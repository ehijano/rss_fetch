      <title>Caught in flagrante delicto: evidence for past mass transfer in massive binaries?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many massive binary systems undergo mass and angular momentum transfer over the course of their evolution. This kind of interaction is expected to deeply affect the properties of the mass donor and mass gainer and to leave various observational signatures. The most common smoking guns of a past mass transfer episode are notably rapid rotation of the mass gainer and altered surface chemical abundances of the stripped mass donor star. Quantitative observational studies of evolved massive binaries are crucial to gain insight into poorly constrained parameters of binary evolution models such as the fraction of mass lost by the mass donor that is actually accreted by the mass gainer. Yet, drawing conclusions about a past mass transfer episode requires a detailed analysis of all aspects of a binary system which sometimes leads to unexpected results. In this contribution, we review the existing observational evidence for past mass exchange events in massive main-sequence and post main-sequence binaries.</description>

      <title>Visual Orbits of Wolf-Rayet Stars II: The Orbit of the Nitrogen-Rich WR Binary WR 138 measured with the CHARA Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical Wolf-Rayet stars are descendants of massive OB-type stars that have lost their hydrogen-rich envelopes, and are in the final stages of stellar evolution, possibly exploding as type Ib/c supernovae. It is understood that the mechanisms driving this mass-loss are either strong stellar winds and or binary interactions, so intense studies of these binaries including their evolution can tell us about the importance of the two pathways in WR formation. WR 138 (HD 193077) has a period of just over 4 years and was previously reported to be resolved through interferometry. We report on new interferometric data combined with spectroscopic radial velocities in order to provide a three-dimensional orbit of the system. The precision on our parameters tend to be about an order of magnitude better than previous spectroscopic techniques. These measurements provide masses of the stars, namely $M_{\rm WR} = 13.93\pm1.49M_{\odot}$ and $M_{\rm O} = 26.28\pm1.71M_{\odot}$. The derived orbital parallax agrees with the parallax from \textit{Gaia}, namely with a distance of 2.13 kpc. We compare the system's orbit to models from BPASS, showing that the system likely may have been formed with little interaction but could have formed through some binary interactions either following or at the start of a red supergiant phase, but with the most likely scenario occurring as the red supergiant phase starts for a $\sim 40M_\odot$ star.</description>

      <title>On The Influence Of The Solar Wind On The Propagation Of Earth-impacting Coronal Mass Ejections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) are subject to changes in their direction of propagation, tilt, and other properties as they interact with the variable solar wind. We investigated the heliospheric propagation of 15 Earth-impacting CMEs observed during April 2010 to August 2018 in the field of view (FOV) of the Heliospheric Imager (HI) onboard the STEREO. About half of the 15 events followed self-similar expansion up to 40 $R_\odot$. The remaining events showed deflection either in latitude, longitude, or a tilt change. Only two events showed significant rotation in the HI1 FOV. We also use toroidal and cylindrical flux rope fitting on the in situ observations of interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) and solar wind parameters to estimate the tilt at L1 for these two events. Although the sample size is small, this study suggests that CME rotation is not very common in the heliosphere. We attributed the observed deflections and rotations of CMEs to a combination of factors, including their interaction with the ambient solar wind and the influence of the ambient magnetic field. These findings contribute to our understanding of the complex dynamics involved in CME propagation and highlight the need for comprehensive modeling and observational studies to improve space weather prediction. In particular, HI observations help us to connect observations near the Sun and near Earth, improving our understanding of how CMEs move through the heliosphere.</description>

      <title>Stellar Pulsation and Evolution: a Combined Theoretical Renewal and Updated Models (SPECTRUM) -- I: Updating radiative opacities for pulsation models of Classical Cepheid and RR-Lyrae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulsating stars are universally recognized as precise distance indicators and tracers of stellar populations. Their variability, combined with well-defined relationships between pulsation properties and intrinsic evolutionary parameters such as luminosity, mass, and age, makes them essential for understanding galactic evolution and retrieving star formation histories. Therefore, accurate modeling of pulsating stars is crucial for using them as standard candles and stellar population tracers. This is the first paper in the "Stellar Pulsation and Evolution: a Combined Theoretical Renewal and Updated Models" (SPECTRUM) project, which aims to present an update of Stellingwerf's hydrodynamical pulsation code, by adopting the latest radiative opacity tables commonly used in stellar evolution community. We assess the impact of this update on pulsation properties, such as periods, instability strip topology, and light curve shapes, as well as on Period Wesenheit and Period-Luminosity relations for Classical Cepheids and RR Lyrae stars, comparing the results with those derived using older opacity data. Our results indicate that the opacity update introduces only minor changes: instability strip boundary locations shift by no more than $100K$ in effective temperature, and pulsation periods vary within $1\sigma$ compared to previous evaluations. Light curves exhibit slight differences in shape and amplitude. Consequently, the theoretical calibration of the Cepheid or RRL-based extragalactic distance scale remains largely unaffected by the opacity changes. However, achieving consistency in opacity tables between stellar evolution and pulsation codes is a significant step toward a homogeneous and self-consistent stellar evolution and pulsation framework.</description>

      <title>Standing torsional Alfv\'en waves as the source of the rotational period variation in magnetic early-type stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. The influence of magnetic fields on stellar evolution remains unresolved. It has been proposed that if there is a large-scale magnetic field in the stellar interior, torsional waves could arise, efficiently transporting angular momentum. In fact, the observed variations in the rotation periods of some magnetic stars may be attributed to these torsional waves' standing waves. Aims. To demonstrate the existence of torsional waves through modeling of the rotational period variations. Method. We conduct an eigenmode analysis of standing waves based on one-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic equations. The internal magnetic field structures are parametrically represented to treat poloidal fields with different degrees of central/surface concentration. The obtained frequencies are compared with the observed frequencies of the rotational period variations, thereby constraining the internal magnetic field structures. Results. The 67.6 years exhibited by CU Vir is reproduced for surface-concentrated magnetic field structures. The rotational period variations of all ten magnetic stars analyzed in this study are inconsistent with a centrally concentrated magnetic field. Conclusions. Torsional waves can reproduce the observations of rotational period variations. The large-scale magnetic fields within magnetic stars would be concentrated on the surface.</description>

      <title>New Cold Subdwarf Discoveries from Backyard Worlds and a Metallicity Classification System for T Subdwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the results of a spectroscopic survey of candidate T subdwarfs identified by the Backyard Worlds: Planet 9 program. Near-infrared spectra of 31 sources with red $J-W2$ colors and large $J$-band reduced proper motions show varying signatures of subsolar metallicity, including strong collision-induced H$_2$ absorption, obscured methane and water features, and weak K I absorption. These metallicity signatures are supported by spectral model fits and 3D velocities, indicating thick disk and halo population membership for several sources. We identify three new metal-poor T subdwarfs ([M/H] $\lesssim$ $-$0.5), CWISE J062316.19+071505.6, WISEA J152443.14$-$262001.8, and CWISE J211250.11-052925.2; and 19 new "mild" subdwarfs with modest metal deficiency ([M/H] $\lesssim$ $-$0.25). We also identify three metal-rich brown dwarfs with thick disk kinematics. We provide kinematic evidence that the extreme L subdwarf 2MASS J053253.46+824646.5 and the mild T subdwarf CWISE J113010.07+313944.7 may be part of the Thamnos population, while the T subdwarf CWISE J155349.96+693355.2 may be part of the Helmi stream. We define a metallicity classification system for T dwarfs that adds mild subdwarfs (d/sdT), subdwarfs (sdT), and extreme subdwarfs (esdT) to the existing dwarf sequence. We also define a metallicity spectral index that correlates with metallicities inferred from spectral model fits and iron abundances from stellar primaries of benchmark T dwarf companions. This expansion of the T dwarf classification system supports investigations of ancient, metal-poor brown dwarfs now being uncovered in deep imaging and spectroscopic surveys.</description>

      <title>Impact of the Brink Axel Hypothesis on Unique First Forbidden \b{eta} transitions for r process nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Key nuclear inputs for the astrophysical r process simulations are the weak interaction rates. Consequently, the accuracy of these inputs directly affects the reliability of nucleosynthesis modeling. Majority of the stellar rates, used in simulation studies, are calculated invoking the Brink Axel (BA) hypothesis. The BA hypothesis assumes that the strength functions of all parent excited states are the same as for the ground state, only shifted in energies. However, BA hypothesis has to be tested against microscopically calculated state by state rates. In this project we study the impact of the BA hypothesis on calculated stellar \b{eta} decay and electron capture rates. Our investigation include both Unique First Forbidden (U1F) and allowed transitions for 106 neutron rich trans iron nuclei ([27, 77] less than equal to [Z, A] less than equal to [82, 208]). The calculations were performed using the deformed proton-neutron quasiparticle randomphase approximation (pn QRPA) model with a simple plus quadrupole separable and schematic interaction. Waiting-point and several key r process nuclei lie within the considered mass region of the nuclear chart.</description>

      <title>Radiative Capture of proton 14N(p,{\gamma}) 15O at Low Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The CNO cycle is the main source of energy in stars more massive than our Sun. It defines the energy production and the duration contributes in determining the lifetime of massive stars. The cycle is an important tool for the determination of the age of globular clusters. Radiative capture p plus 14N 15O plus {\gamma}, at energies of astrophysical interest, is one of the important processes in the CNO cycle. In this project, we apply a potential model to describe both non resonant and resonant reactions in the channels where radiative capture occurs through electric E1 transitions. We employed the R matrix method to describe the reactions going via M1 resonant transitions, when it was not possible to correctly reproduce the experimental data by a potential model. The partial components of the astrophysical S factor are calculated for all possible electric and magnetic dipole transitions in 15O. The linear extrapolated S factor at zero energy (S(0)) is in good agreement with earlier reported values for all types of transitions considered in this work. Based on the value of the total astrophysical S factor, depending on the collision energy, we calculate the nuclear reaction rates for p plus 14N 15O plus {\gamma}. The computed rates are in good agreement with the results of the NACRE II Collaboration and the most recent existing measurements.</description>

      <title>A new sample of super-slowly rotating Ap (ssrAp) stars from the Zwicky Transient Facility survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetic chemically peculiar Ap stars exhibit an extreme spread of rotational velocities, the reason of which is not well understood. Ap stars with rotational periods of 50 days or longer are know as super-slowly rotating Ap (ssrAp) stars. Photometrically variable Ap stars are commonly termed alpha2 Canum Venaticorum (ACV) variables. Our study aims at enlarging the sample of known ssrAp stars using data from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) survey to enable more robust and significant statistical studies of these objects. Using selection criteria based on the known characteristics of ACV variables, candidate stars were gleaned from the ZTF catalogues of periodic and suspected variable stars and from ZTF raw data. ssrAp stars were identified from this list via their characteristic photometric properties, Delta a photometry, and spectral classification. The final sample consists of 70 new ssrAp stars, which mostly exhibit rotational periods between 50 and 200 days. The object with the longest period has a rotational period of 2551.7 days. We present astrophysical parameters and a Hertzsprung-Russell diagram for the complete sample of known ssrAp stars. With very few exceptions, the ssrAp stars are grouped in the middle of the main sequence with ages in excess of 150 Myr. ZTF J021309.72+582827.7 was identified as a possible binary star harbouring an Ap star and a cool component, possibly shrouded in dust. With our study, we enlarge the sample of known ssrAp stars by about 150%, paving the way for more in-depth statistical studies.</description>

      <title>An in-depth analysis of quiet-Sun IRIS Brightenings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Small-scale brightenigs are ubiquitous, dynamic and energetic phenomena found in the chromopshere. An advanced filter-detection algorithm applied to high-resolution observations from the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph enables the detection of these brightenings close to the noise level. This algorithm also tracks the movement of these brightenings and extracts their characteristics. This work outlines the results of an in-depth analysis of a quiet-Sun dataset including a comparison of a brighter domain - associated with a super-granular boundary - to the quiescent inter-network domains. Several characteristics of brightenings from both domains are extracted and analysed, providing a range of sizes, durations, brightness values, travel distances, and speeds. The ``Active" quiet-Sun events tend to travel shorter distances and at slower speeds along the plane-of-sky than their ``True" quiet-Sun counterparts. These results are consistent with the magnetic field model of super-granular photospheric structures and the magnetic canopy model of the chromosphere above. Spectroscopic analyses reveal that BPs demonstrate blue-shift (as well as some bi-directionality) and that they may rise from the chromosphere into the TR. We believe these bright points to be magnetic in nature, are likely the result of magnetic reconnection, and follow current sheets between magnetic field gradients, rather than along magnetic field lines themselves.</description>

      <title>Multiple Components of the Outflow in the Protostellar System HH 212: Outer Outflow Shell, Rotating Wind, Shocked Wind, and Jet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array Band 7 observations of the CO (J=3-2) line emission of the protostellar system HH 212 at $\sim$24 au spatial resolution and compare them to those of the SiO (J=8-7) and SO (J=8-7) line emission reported in the literature. We find that the CO line traces four distinct regions: (1) an outer outflow shell, (2) a rotating wind region between the SiO and CO shells, (3) the shocked and wide-angle inner X-wind inside a SiO shell, and (4) the jet. The origin of the CO outer outflow shell could be associated with the entrained material of the envelope, or an extended disk wind. The rotating wind, which is shocked, is launched from a radius of 9-15 au, slightly exterior to that of the previously detected SO shell, which marks the boundary where the wide-angle X-wind is interacting with and shocking the disk wind. Additionally, the SO is found to be mixed with the CO emission within the thick and extended rotating wind region. The large scale CO shocked wind coexists with the SO emission near the upper portion of the inner shocked region converged on top of the inner SiO knots. The CO jet is traced by a chain of knots with roughly equal interval, exhibiting quasi-periodicity, as reported in other jets in the literature.</description>

      <title>Center-to-limb Variations in Solar Plage using IRIS Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The center-to-limb variations (CLV) of transition region line Gaussian fit parameters in solar plage are reported for the first time. The Si iv 1402.77 A line observed by Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) is used. The spectral intensity increases linearly from the disk center to the solar limb. Similarly, the non-thermal velocity also increases linearly from 23.6 km/s (at the disk center) to 30.9 km/s (at the solar limb). On the other hand, the Doppler velocity decreases from 8.9$\pm$1.0 km/s at the disk center to 0.0 km/s at the limb. This CLV pattern in solar plages is consistent with the CLV pattern reported in the quiet-Sun (QS). However, the average values of the parameters in the solar plage are significantly higher than in the QS. The intensity and non-thermal velocity increase linearly with the magnetic field at the disk center while the Doppler velocity does not depend on the magnetic field.
  Due to the line-of-sight effect, the plasma column depth increases towards the solar limb which leads to a linear increase in the spectral intensity. Further, the increasing plasma column depth towards the solar limb adds more and more unresolved motions, and as a result, the non-thermal velocity increases from the disk center to the solar limb. In the solar plages, the higher plasma density due to the strong magnetic field leads to the higher intensity and non-thermal velocity compared to QS and coronal hole (CH)</description>

      <title>BSN: The First Photometric Analysis of Contact Binary Systems V1961 Cyg and V0890 Lyr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We presented the first photometric analysis of the V1961 Cyg and V0890 Lyr binary systems. We observed and analyzed these systems at an observatory in France as part of the Binary Systems of South and North (BSN) Project. We extracted and collected the times of minima from the observations and literature and presented a new ephemeris for each system. Due to the few observations about these systems over the years, both O-C diagrams were fitted linearly. The PHysics Of Eclipsing BinariEs (PHOEBE) Python code and the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method were used to light curve solutions. The light curve solution required a cold starspot on the hotter component in the V1961 Cyg binary system. We compared and have close agreements between our mass ratios' results from the light curve analysis processes and a new method based on the light curve derivative. We estimated the absolute parameters using an empirical relationship between the semi-major axis and orbital period for contact binary systems. The results show V1961 Cyg and V0890 Lyr are W-type contact binary systems. We displayed stars and systems' positions in the M-L, M-R, and logM_{tot}-logJ_0 diagrams. We also presented a new relationship between mass ratio and luminosity ratio.</description>

      <title>Low Mass Contact Binaries: Orbital Stability at Extreme Low Mass Ratios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the ever-increasing number of light curve solutions of contact binary systems increasing number of potential bright red nova progenitors are being reported. There remains, however, only one confirmed event. In the present study we undertake a comprehensive review of orbital stability of contact binary systems considering the effects of the stellar internal composition (metallicity) and age on the evolution of the gyration radius and its effect on the instability mass ratio of contact binaries. We find that both metallicity and age have an independent effect on orbital stability with metal poor and older systems being more stable. The combined effects of age and metallicity are quite profound such that for most systems with primaries of solar mass or greater which are halfway or more through the main sequence lifespans have instability mass ratio at levels where the secondary component would be below the hydrogen fusion mass limit. We find that from the currently available solutions we cannot confidently assign any system as unstable. Although we identify 8 potential red nova progenitors all have methodological or astrophysical concerns which lower our confidence in designating any of them as potential merger candidates.</description>

      <title>Generation of fast magnetoacoustic waves in the corona by impulsive bursty reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast-mode magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves in the solar corona are often known to be produced by solar flares and eruptive prominences. We here simulate the effect of the interaction of an external perturbation on a magnetic null in the solar corona which results in the formation of a current sheet (CS). Once the CS undergoes a sufficient extension in its length and squeezing of its width, it may go unstable to the formation of multiple impulsive plasmoids. Eventually, the plasmoids merge with one another to form larger plasmoids and/or are expelled from the sheet. The formation, motion and coalescence of plasmoids with each other and with magnetic Y-points at the outer periphery of the extended CS are found to generate wave-like perturbations. An analysis of the resultant quasi-periodic variations of pressure, density, velocity and magnetic field at certain locations in the model corona indicate that these waves are predominantly fast-mode magnetoacoustic waves. For typical coronal parameters, the resultant propagating waves carry an energy flux of $\mathrm{10^{5}~\mathrm{erg~cm^{-2}~s^{-1}}}$ to a large distance of at least 60 Mm away from the current sheet. In general, we suggest that both waves and reconnection play a role in heating the solar atmosphere and driving the solar wind and may interact with one another in a manner that we refer to as a $"$Symbiosis of WAves and Reconnection (SWAR)$"$.</description>

      <title>Using Polar Faculae to Determine the Sun's High-Latitude Rotation Rate. I. Techniques and Initial Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper describes a new way of determining the high-latitude solar rotation rate statistically from simultaneous observations of many polar faculae. In this experiment, I extracted frames from a movie made previously from flat-fielded images obtained in the 6767 A continuum during February 1997-1998 and used those frames to construct space-time maps from high-latitude slices of the favorably oriented south polar cap. These maps show an array of slanted tracks whose average slope indicates the east-west speed of faculae at that latitude, Ls. When the slopes are measured and plotted as a function of latitude, they show relatively little scatter 0.01-02 km/s from a straight line whose zero-speed extension passes through the Sun's south pole. This means that the speed, v(Ls), and the latitudinal radius, R cos(Ls), approach 0 at the same rate, so that their ratio gives a nearly constant synodic rotation rate 8.6 deg/day surrounding the Sun's south pole. A few measurements of the unfavorably oriented north polar cap are consistent with these measurements near the south pole.</description>

      <title>Main sequence dynamo magnetic fields emerging in the white dwarf phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations of volume-limited samples of magnetic white dwarfs (WD) have revealed a higher incidence of magnetism in older WDs. Specifically, these studies indicate that magnetism is more prevalent in WDs with fully or partially crystallized cores compared to those with entirely liquid cores. This has led to the recognition of a crystallization-driven dynamo as an important mechanism for explaining magnetism in isolated WDs. However, recent simulations challenged the capability of this mechanism to match both the incidence of magnetism and the field strengths detected in WDs. In this letter, we explore an alternative hypothesis for the surface emergence of magnetic fields in isolated WDs. WDs with masses $\gtrsim 0.55 M_\odot$ are the descendants of main-sequence stars with convective cores capable of generating strong dynamo magnetic fields. This idea is supported by asteroseismic evidence of strong magnetic fields buried within the interiors of red giant branch stars. Assuming that these fields are disrupted by subsequent convective zones, we have estimated magnetic breakout times for WDs. Due to the significant uncertainties in breakout times stemming from the treatment of convective boundaries and mass loss rates, we cannot provide a precise prediction for the emergence time of the main-sequence dynamo field. However, we can predict that this emergence should occur during the WD phase for WDs with masses $\gtrsim 0.65 M_\odot$. We also find that the magnetic breakout is expected to occur earlier in more massive WDs, consistently with observations from volume-limited samples and the well-established fact that magnetic WDs tend to be more massive than non-magnetic ones. Moreover, within the uncertainties of stellar evolutionary models, we find that the emergence of main-sequence dynamo magnetic fields can account for a significant portion of the magnetic WDs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Newtonian restricted three-body problem involving a positive primary point mass, $m_+$, and a negative secondary point mass, $m_-$, in a circular orbit, and a positive or negative tertiary point mass, $m_3$, with $m_+ &gt; |m_-| \gg |m_3|$, is solved. Five Lagrange points are found for $m_3$, three of which are coplanar with $m_+$ and $m_-$, and two of which are not, a subtle consequence of the gravitational repulsion from $m_-$. All Lagrange points are linearly unstable, except for one point in the regime $m_+ \gtrsim 8.4 |m_-|$, which is linearly stable and collinear with $m_+$ and $m_-$.</description>

      <title>A Wideband Chemical Survey of Massive Star-forming Regions at Subarcsecond Resolution with the Submillimeter Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Massive star-forming regions exhibit a rich chemistry with complex gas distributions, especially on small scales. While surveys have yielded constraints on typical gas conditions, they often have coarse spatial resolution and limited bandwidths. Thus, to establish an interpretative framework for these efforts, detailed observations that simultaneously provide high sensitivity, spatial resolution, and large bandwidths for a subset of diverse sources are needed. Here, we present wideband (32 GHz) Submillimeter Array observations of four high-mass star-forming regions (G28.20-0.05, G20.08-0.14 N, G35.58-0.03, W33 Main) at subarcsecond resolution, where we detect and spatially-resolve 100s of lines from over 60 molecules, including many complex organic molecules (COMs). The chemical richness of our sample is consistent with an evolutionary sequence from the line-rich hot cores and HC HII regions of G28.20-0.05 and G20.08-0.14 N to the more chemically-modest UC HII regions in G35.58-0.03, followed by the molecule-poor HII region W33 Main. We detect lines across a range of excitation conditions (Eu=20 to &gt;800 K) and from numerous isotopologues, which enables robust estimates of gas properties. We derive nearly constant COM column density ratios that agree with literature values in other low- and high-mass protostellar cores, supporting the idea that COM abundances are set during the pre-stellar phase. In all regions, we identify spatial offsets among different molecular families, due to a combination of source physical structure and chemistry. In particular, we find potential evidence of carbon grain sublimation in G28.20-0.05 and identify an elemental oxygen gradient and rich sulfur-chemistry in G35.58-0.03. Overall, these results demonstrate that the SMA's wide bandwidth is a powerful tool to untangle the complex molecular gas structures associated with massive star formation.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion in binary systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) accretion model is widely used to describe how a compact object accretes material from a companion's stellar wind in binary systems. However, this classical model becomes inaccurate when the wind velocity ($v_\mathrm{w}$) is comparable to or less than the orbital velocity ($v_\mathrm{o}$), predicting nonphysical accretion efficiencies above unity. This limits its applicability to systems with low wind-to-orbital velocity ratios ($w= v_\mathrm{w}/v_\mathrm{o} \leq 1$), such as symbiotic systems. We revisit the BHL model and introduce a geometric correction factor that accounts for the varying orientation of the accretion cylinder relative to the wind direction. This correction ensures physically plausible accretion efficiencies ($\eta\leq 1$) for all $w$ in circular orbits. Our modified model naturally predicts the flattening of the accretion efficiency observed in numerical simulations for $w&lt;1$, without the need for ad hoc adjustments. We also peer into the implications of our model for the less-explored case of eccentric orbits, highlighting the key role of the geometric correction factor in shaping the accretion process. We compare our predictions with numerical simulations, finding good agreement for a wide range of parameters. Applications to the symbiotic star R Aqr and the X-ray binary LS 5039 are presented. This improved model offers a more accurate description of wind accretion in binary systems, with implications for stellar evolution, population synthesis, and observational data interpretation.</description>

      <title>Improving the parametrization of transport and mixing processes in planetary atmospheres: the importance of implementing the full Coriolis acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the ongoing characterisation of the atmospheres of exoplanets by the JWST, we are unveiling a large diversity of planetary atmospheres, both in terms of composition and dynamics. As such, it is necessary to build coherent atmospheric models for exoplanetary atmospheres to study their dynamics in any regime of thickness, stratification and rotation. However, many models only partially include the Coriolis acceleration with only taking into account the local projection of the rotation vector along the vertical direction (this is the so-called "Traditional Approximation of Rotation") and do not accurately model the effects of the rotation when it dominates the stratification.
  In this contribution, we report the ongoing efforts to take the full Coriolis acceleration into account for the transport of momentum and the mixing of chemicals. First, we show how the horizontal local component of the rotation vector can deeply modifies the instabilities of horizontal sheared flows and the turbulence they can trigger. Next, we show how the interaction between waves and zonal winds can be drastically modified because of the modification of the wave damping or breaking when taking into account the full Coriolis acceleration. These works are devoted to improve the parameterization of waves and turbulent processes in global atmospheric models.</description>

      <title>Obscured star clusters in the Inner Milky Way. How many massive young clusters are still awaiting detection?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aims. Our goal is twofold. First, to detect new clusters we apply the newest methods for the detection of clustering with the best available wide-field sky surveys in the mid-infrared because they are the least affected by extinction. Second, we address the question of cluster detection's completeness, for now limiting it to the most massive star clusters.
  Methods. This search is based on the mid-infrared Galactic Legacy Infrared Mid Plane Survey Extraordinaire (GLIMPSE), to minimize the effect of dust extinction. The search Ordering Points To Identify the Clustering Structure (OPTICS) clustering algorithm is applied to identify clusters, after excluding the bluest, presumably foreground sources, to improve the cluster-to-field contrast. The success rate for cluster identification is estimated with a semi-empirical simulation that adds clusters, based on the real objects, to the point source catalog, to be recovered later with the same search algorithm that was used in the search for new cluster candidates. As a first step, this is limited to the most massive star clusters with a total mass of 104 $M_\odot$.
  Results. Our automated search, combined with inspection of the color-magnitude diagrams and images yielded 659 cluster candidates; 106 of these appear to have been previously identified, suggesting that a large hidden population of star clusters still exists in the inner Milky Way. However, the search for the simulated supermassive clusters achieves a recovery rate of 70 to 95%, depending on the distance and extinction toward them.
  Conclusions. The new candidates, if confirmed, indicate that the Milky Way still harbors a sizeable population of still unknown clusters. However, they must be objects of modest richness, because our simulation indicates that there is no substantial hidden population of supermassive clusters in the central region of our Galaxy.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the E_p = 416.9 keV resonance strength in the 29Si(p,gamma)30P reaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Silicon isotopic ratios measured in meteoritic presolar grains can provide useful information about the nucleosynthesis origin of these isotopes if the rates of nuclear reactions responsible for their production are known. One of the key reactions determining the Si isotopic abundances is 29Si(p,gamma)30P. Its reaction rate is not known with sufficient precision due in part to some ambiguous resonance strength values. In the present work, the strength of the E_p = 416.9 keV resonance has been measured with high precision using the activation technique. The new strength of omega_gamma = 219 +- 16 meV can be used in updated reaction rate estimations and astrophysical models.</description>

      <title>POSYDON Version 2: Population Synthesis with Detailed Binary-Evolution Simulations across a Cosmological Range of Metallicities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Whether considering rare astrophysical events on cosmological scales or unresolved stellar populations, accurate models must account for the integrated contribution from the entire history of star formation upon which that population is built. Here, we describe the second version of POSYDON, an open-source binary population synthesis code based on extensive grids of detailed binary evolution models computed using the MESA code, which follows both stars' structures as a binary system evolves through its complete evolution from the zero-age main sequence, through multiple phases of mass transfer and supernovae, to their death as compact objects. To generate synthetic binary populations, POSYDON uses advanced methods to interpolate between our large, densely spaced grids of simulated binaries. In our updated version of POSYDON, we account for the evolution of stellar binaries across a cosmological range of metallicities, extending from $10^{-4}\,Z_{\odot}$ to $2\,Z_{\odot}$, including grids specifically focused on the Small and Large Magellanic Clouds ($0.2\,Z_{\odot}$ and $0.45\,Z_{\odot}$). In addition to describing our model grids and detailing our methodology, we outline several improvements to POSYDON. These include the incorporation of single stars in stellar populations, a treatment for stellar mergers, and a careful modeling of "reverse-mass transferring" binaries, in which an once-accreting star later becomes a donor star. Our simulations are focused on binaries with at least one high-mass component, such as those that host neutron stars and black holes, and we provide post-processing methods to account for the cosmological evolution of metallicity and star formation as well as rate calculations for gravitational wave events, gamma-ray bursts, and other transients.</description>

Abstract: We present a study of the detached eclipsing binary TV~Mon using spectra from the LAMOST medium-resolution survey and ASAS-SN, CoRoT photometry. We apply multiple-epochs spectral fitting to derive RV and spectral parameters. The analysis of eclipses in CoRoT data show the relative sizes of the stellar components and almost edge-on circular orbit. Combining the spectral and photometrical solutions we estimate masses and radii of the components: $M_{A,B}=2.063\pm0.033({\rm stat.})\pm0.095({\rm syst.}),~0.218\pm0.004({\rm stat.})\pm0.018({\rm syst.})~M_\odot$, $R_{A,B}=2.394\pm0.014,~2.860\pm0.016~R_\odot$. SED analysis and Gaia parallax allow us to get estimation of temperatures ${T_{ eff}}_{A,B}=7624^{+194}_{-174},~5184^{+130}_{-123}$ K and distance $d=907\pm11$ pc. We identify three $\delta$ Scuti type pulsation frequencies in the primary component, while we also suspect TV~Mon having a spot activity in the secondary component. This system experienced intensive mass transfer and mass ratio reversal in the past, but currently shows no signs of mass transfer in the spectra. The low mass component will lose its outer envelope and shrink to the helium white dwarf, the mass and orbital period of which are in good agreement with evolutionary models predictions.</description>

      <title>Forecasting High-Speed Solar Wind Streams from Solar Images</title>

Abstract: The solar wind, a stream of charged particles originating from the Sun and transcending interplanetary space, poses risks to technology and astronauts.In this work, we develop a prediction model to forecast the solar wind speed at the Earth. We focuse on high-speed streams (HSSs) and their solar source regions, coronal holes. As input, we use the coronal hole area, extracted from solar extreme ultraviolet (EUV) images and mapped on a fixed grid, as well as the solar wind speed 27 days before. We use a polynomial regression model and a distribution transformation to predict the solar wind speed with a lead time of four days. Our forecast achieves a root mean square error (RMSE) of 68.1 km/s for the solar wind speed prediction and an RMSE of 76.8 km/s for the HSS peak velocity prediction for 2010 to 2019. We also demonstrate the applicability of our model to the current solar cycle 25 in an operational setting, resulting in an RMSE of 80.3 km/s and an HSS peak velocity RMSE of 92.2 km/s. The study shows that a small number of physical features explains most of the solar wind variation, and that focusing on these features with simple machine learning algorithms even outperforms current approaches based on deep neural networks and MHD simulations. In addition, we explain why the typically used loss function, the mean squared error, systematically underestimates the HSS peak velocities, aggravates operational space weather forecasts, and how a distribution transformation can resolve this issue.</description>

      <title>History of the Observation of Stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11455v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There are about 6000 stars, that can be seen with the naked eye and have been observed for centuries for various purposes. More modern investigations using advanced telescopes show that our Milky Way, a quite common galaxy, consists of about 100 -- 400 billion stars. And, it is estimated that there are between 200 billion to 2 trillion galaxies in the observable universe -- all of them consist mostly of stars, and sending observable signals which also represents nothing more than a superposition of the light of individual stars. So we can conclude that the most common observable objects in the Universe are $\textit{stars}$.
  In this chapter, we focus on the long history of the observation of stars (compared to studies in other fields of science) to find out more about the nature of these objects.</description>

      <title>KIC 10855535: An elegant Delta Scuti pulsator with Amplitude and Phase Modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20834v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigated the pulsating behavior of KIC 10855535 using Kepler 4-year long cadence data. Two independent frequencies were detected: a pulsation frequency F0 = 17.733260(5)d-1 and a low frequency f8=0.412643(8)d-1 We identify F0 as the fundamental frequency, at which a equidistant quintuplet is centered, suggesting that the star orbits in a binary system. The fitted orbital parameters align well with those reported in previous literature. Long-term phase modulation caused by binarity has been confirmed by considering TESS light curve. Through adjusting light time via removing the light time effect, we measured a linear change in period of order $\dot{P}/P \simeq 1.44\times 10^{-7}yr^{-1}$, a value that could be indicative of stellar evolution. The star also exhibits a gradual and stable amplitude growth, thereby raising the possibility of structural changes during its evolution. We attributed f8 and its two harmonics to rotation and surface spots, with further analysis suggesting evolving characteristics over time. Based on the hypothesis, KIC 10855535 may rotate slowly for its type, with a speed of 37(2)km/s. Overall, KIC 10855535 presents an exceptionally clean spectrum and a relatively slow rotation as a {\delta} Sct pulsator, exhibiting a single pulsation mode that undergoes both amplitude and phase modulation.</description>

      <title>Quantitative spectroscopy of multiple OB stars: I. The quadruple system HD 37061 at the centre of Messier 43</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23229v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The majority of massive stars are located in binary or multiple star systems. Compared to single stars, these objects pose additional challenges to quantitative analyses based on model atmospheres. In particular, little information is currently available on the chemical composition of such systems. The members of the quadruple star system HD 37061, which excites the H II region Messier 43 in Orion, are fully characterised. Accurate and precise abundances for all elements with lines traceable in the optical spectrum are derived for the first time. A hybrid non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) approach, using line-blanketed hydrostatic model atmospheres computed with the ATLAS12 code in combination with non-LTE line-formation calculations with DETAIL and SURFACE, was employed. A high-resolution composite spectrum was analysed for the atmospheric parameters and elemental abundances of the individual stars. Fundamental stellar parameters were derived based on stellar evolution tracks, and the interstellar reddening was characterised. We determined the fundamental parameters and chemical abundances for three stars in the HD 37061 system. The fourth and faintest star in the system shows no distinct spectral features, as a result of its fast rotation. However, this star has noticeable effects on the continuum. The derived element abundances and determined ages of the individual stars are consistent with each other, and the abundances coincide with the cosmic abundance standard. We find an excellent agreement between our spectroscopic distance and the Gaia Data Release 3 parallax distance.</description>

      <title>The physical and chemical processes in protoplanetary disks: constraints on the composition of comets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.14529v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We review the recent observations of protoplanetary disks together with relevant theoretical studies with an emphasis on the evolution of volatiles. In the last several years Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) provided evidence of grain growth, gas-dust decoupling, and sub-structures such as rings and gaps in the dust continuum. Molecular line observations revealed radial and vertical distributions of molecular abundances and also provided significant constraints on the gas dynamics such as turbulence. While sub-millimeter and millimeter observations mainly probe the gas and dust outside the radius of several au, ice and inner warm gas are investigated at shorter wavelengths. Gas and dust dynamics are key to connecting these observational findings. One of the emerging trends is inhomogeneous distributions of elemental abundances, most probably due to dust-gas decoupling.</description>

      <title>Proton Acceleration in Low-beta Magnetic Reconnection with Energetic Particle Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12276v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetic reconnection regions in space and astrophysics are known as active particle acceleration sites. There is ample evidence showing that energetic particles can take a substantial amount of converted energy during magnetic reconnection. However, there has been a lack of studies understanding the backreaction of energetic particles at magnetohydrodynamical scales in magnetic reconnection. To address this, we have developed a new computational method to explore the feedback by non-thermal energetic particles. This approach considers the backreaction from these energetic particles by incorporating their pressure into Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations. The pressure of the energetic particles is evaluated from their distribution evolved through Parker's transport equation, solved using stochastic differential equations (SDE), so we coin the name MHD-SDE. Applying this method to low-beta magnetic reconnection simulations, we find that reconnection is capable of accelerating a large fraction of energetic particles that contain a substantial amount of energy. When the feedback from these particles is included, their pressure suppresses the compression structures generated by magnetic reconnection, thereby mediating particle energization. Consequently, the feedback from energetic particles results in a steeper power-law energy spectrum. These findings suggest that feedback from non-thermal energetic particles plays a crucial role in magnetic reconnection and particle acceleration.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the gas-phase C/O ratio of DR Tau's outer disk from CS, SO, and C$_2$H observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01679v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Millimeter wavelength observations of Class II protoplanetary disks often display strong emission from hydrocarbons and high CS/SO values, providing evidence that the gas-phase C/O ratio commonly exceeds 1 in their outer regions. We present new NOEMA observations of CS $5-4$, SO $7_6-6_5$ and $5_6-4_5$, C$_2$H $N=3-2$, HCN $3-2$, HCO$^+$ $3-2$, and H$^{13}$CO$^+$ $3-2$ in the DR Tau protoplanetary disk at a resolution of $\sim0.4''$ (80 au). Estimates for the disk-averaged CS/SO ratio range from $\sim0.4-0.5$, the lowest value reported thus far for a T Tauri disk. At a projected separation of $\sim180$ au northeast of the star, the SO moment maps exhibit a clump that has no counterpart in the other lines, and the CS/SO value decreases to $&lt;0.2$ at its location. Thermochemical models calculated with DALI indicate that DR Tau's low CS/SO ratio and faint C$_2$H emission can be explained by a gas-phase C/O ratio that is $&lt;1$ at the disk radii traced by NOEMA. Comparisons of DR Tau's SO emission to maps of extended structures traced by $^{13}$CO suggest that late infall may contribute to driving down the gas-phase C/O ratio of its disk.</description>

      <title>Ammonium hydrosulfide (NH4SH) as a potentially significant sulfur sink in interstellar ices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02860v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sulfur is depleted with respect to its cosmic standard abundance in dense star-forming regions. It has been suggested that this depletion is caused by the freeze-out of sulfur on interstellar dust grains, but the observed abundances and upper limits of sulfur-bearing ices remain too low to account for all of the missing sulfur. Toward the same environments, a strong absorption feature at 6.85 $\mu$m is observed, but its long-standing assignment to the NH4+ cation remains tentative. We investigate the plausibility of NH4SH salt serving as a sulfur reservoir and a carrier of the 6.85 $\mu$m band in interstellar ices by characterizing its IR signatures and apparent band strengths in water-rich laboratory ice mixtures and using this laboratory data to constrain NH4SH abundances in observations of 4 protostars and 2 cold dense clouds. The observed 6.85 $\mu$m feature is fit well with the laboratory NH4SH:H2O ice spectra. NH4+ column densities obtained from the 6.85 $\mu$m band range from 8-23% with respect to H2O toward the sample of protostars and dense clouds. The redshift of the 6.85 $\mu$m feature correlates with higher abundances of NH4+ with respect to H2O in both the laboratory data presented here and observational data of dense clouds and protostars. The apparent band strength of the SH- feature is likely too low for the feature to be detectable in the spectrally busy 3.9 $\mu$m region, but the 5.3 $\mu$m NH4+ $\nu_{4}$ + SH- R combination mode may be an alternative means of detection. Its tentative assignment adds to mounting evidence supporting the presence of NH4+ salts in ices and is the first tentative observation of the SH- anion toward interstellar ices. If the majority ($\gtrsim$80-85%) of the NH4+ cations quantified toward the investigated sources in this work are bound to SH- anions, then NH4SH salts could account for up to 17-18% of their sulfur budgets.</description>

      <title>High Resolution ALMA Observations of Richly Structured Protoplanetary Disks in $\sigma$ Orionis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03823v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: ALMA has detected substructures in numerous protoplanetary disks at radii from a few to over a hundred au. These substructures are commonly thought to be associated with planet formation, either by serving as sites fostering planetesimal formation or arising as a consequence of planet-disk interactions. Our current understanding of substructures, though, is primarily based on observations of nearby star-forming regions with mild UV environments, whereas stars are typically born in much harsher UV environments, which may inhibit planet formation in the outer disk through external photoevaporation. We present high resolution ($\sim8$ au) ALMA 1.3 mm continuum images of eight disks in $\sigma$ Orionis, a cluster irradiated by an O9.5 star. Gaps and rings are resolved in the images of five disks. The most striking of these is SO 1274, which features five gaps that appear to be arranged nearly in a resonant chain. In addition, we infer the presence of gap or shoulder-like structures in the other three disks through visibility modeling. These observations indicate that substructures robustly form and survive at semi-major axes of several tens of au or less in disks exposed to intermediate levels of external UV radiation as well as in compact disks. However, our observations also suggest that disks in $\sigma$ Orionis are mostly small and thus millimeter continuum gaps beyond a disk radius of 50 au are rare in this region, possibly due to either external photoevaporation or age effects.</description>

      <title>The Influence of a Shock on the Nucleosynthesis Developing during the Explosion of a Low-Mass Neutron Star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22510v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The pattern of nucleosynthesis during the explosion of a low-mass neutron star formed in a close binary system in the stripping scenario is considered. In the scenario considered the shock arising during the explosion is shown to strongly heat the expanding neutron star matter. The heavy nuclei produced at the preceding stage of nucleosynthesis are partially destroyed as a result of a sharp increase in the role of photonuclear reactions. It is shown that even short-term heating of the matter by the shock can exert a noticeable influence on the results of the synthesis of elements in the r-process in the inner crust matter, while explosive nucleosynthesis gives rise to new elements in the outer crust matter with mass numbers A from 50 to 130.</description>
