      <title>Determinants of twisted Laplacians and the twisted Selberg zeta function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X$ be an orbisurface, meaning a compact hyperbolic Riemann surface possibly with a finite number of elliptic points, and let $X_1$ denote its unit tangent bundle. We consider the twisted Selberg zeta function $Z(s;\rho)$ associated to a representation $\rho: \pi_1(X_1) \to \text{GL}(V_\rho)$. We prove a relation between the twisted Selberg zeta function $Z(s;\rho)$ and the regularized determinant of the twisted Laplacian associated to $\rho$. These results can be viewed as a generalization of a result due to Sarnak who considered the trivial character. Yet our proof is different, as it is based on evaluation of the Laplace-Mellin type integral transformations. Going further, we explicitly compute the multiplicative constant, which we call the torsion factor, and express its dependence on parameters which determine the representation. We study the asymptotic behavior of the constant for a sequence of non-unitary representations introduced by Yamaguchi and prove that the asymptotic behavior of this constant as the dimension of the representation tends to infinity is the same as the behavior of the higher-dimensional Reidemeister torsion on $X_1$ (up to an absolute constant).</description>

      <title>Manifold submetries from compact homogeneous spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that singular Riemannian foliations, or, more generally, manifold submetries, defined on a compact normal homogeneous space, have algebraic nature. Moreover, in this case there exists a one-to-one correspondence between algebras of algebraic functions preserved by the Laplace--Beltrami operator, and manifold submetries.
  A key intermediate result is that, for any manifold submetry on a compact normal homogeneous space, the vector field given by the mean curvature of the fibers is basic, in the sense that it is related to a vector field in the base.</description>

      <title>Eigenvalue regions and realising monotone stochastic matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01314v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Eigenvalues of stochastic matrices have been studied from two complementary perspectives. The individual eigenvalues are characterised through the well-established Karpelevich regions. The spectrum as a whole has also been analysed, yielding powerful results such as the Johnson-Loewy-London (JLL) inequalities. Current research now turns toward particular subsets of stochastic matrices, among others the doubly stochastic matrices.
  This paper studies spectral properties of monotone stochastic matrices which are characterised by the fact that each row stochastically dominates the preceding one, and which arise in contexts such as intergenerational mobility, equal-input models, and credit-rating systems. This paper analyses the dominance matrix associated with a monotone matrix, which is a non-negative matrix that preserves the non-trivial eigenvalues. Properties are established and the conditions are given under which a non-negative matrix can be regarded as a dominance matrix.
  In analogy with the stochastic matrices, this study examines for the monotone stochastic matrices both the individual eigenvalues as the spectrum as a whole. Individually, the eigenvalue region for all monotone matrices up till order 3 is completely determined, and realising matrices are provided. Collectively, the set of possible pairs of non-trivial eigenvalues arising from 3x3 monotone matrices is characterised, accompanied by realising matrices. In both perspectives, the resulting regions are substantially smaller than those for general stochastic matrices. Finally, this paper proves a reduction theorem stating that, for all n from 4 on, the eigenvalue region of n x n monotone matrices is contained within that of (n-1) x (n-1) stochastic matrices.</description>

      <title>Hearing the Sides: Recovering a Planar Rectangle from Eigenvalues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23047v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a direct, index-free method to recover the side lengths of a planar rectangle the spectrum of its Dirichelet Laplacian, assuming only access to a finite subset of eigenvalues. No modal indices $(m,n)$ are available, and the list may begin at an arbitrary unknown offset; in particular, the lowest eigenvalues may be missing, so classical formulas based on $\lambda_{1,0}$ and $\lambda_{0,1}$ cannot be used. Our reconstruction procedure extracts geometric information solely from the asymptotic density and oscillatory structure of the ordered spectrum. The area $ab$ is obtained from the high-frequency Weyl slope, while the fundamental lengths $2a$ and $2b$ appear as dominant periodic--orbit contributions in the Fourier transform of the spectral fluctuations. This separation of smooth and oscillatory components yields a robust, offset-agnostic recovery of both side lengths. The result is a fully index-free algorithm that reconstructs the geometry of a rectangular planar domain even when the spectrum is incomplete and all modal information is lost.</description>
