      <title>A practical approach of measuring $^{238}$U and $^{232}$Th in liquid scintillator to sub-ppq level using ICP-MS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Liquid scintillator (LS) is commonly utilized in experiments seeking rare events due to its high light yield, transparency, and radiopurity. The concentration of $^{238}$U and $^{232}$Th in LS consistently remains below 1 ppq (10$^{-15}$ g/g), and the current screening result is based on a minimum 20-ton detector. Inductively coupled plasma mass (ICP-MS) spectroscopy is well-regarded for its high sensitivity to trace $^{238}$U and $^{232}$Th. This study outlines a method for detecting $^{238}$U and $^{232}$Th in LS at the sub-ppq level using ICP-MS, involving the enrichment of $^{238}$U/$^{232}$Th from the LS through acid extraction. With meticulous cleanliness control, $^{238}$U/$^{232}$Th in approximately 2 kg of LS is concentrated by acid extraction with 0.4 (0.3) pg $^{238}$U ($^{232}$Th) contamination. Three standard adding methods are employed to assess recovery efficiency, including radon daughter, 2,5-diphenyloxazole (PPO), and natural non-existent $^{233}$U/$^{229}$Th. The method detection limit at a 99% confidence level of this approach can reach approximately 0.2-0.3 ppq for $^{238}$U/$^{232}$Th with nearly 100% recovery efficiency.</description>

      <title>Terahertz Antenna Impedance Matched to a Graphene Photodetector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing low-power, high-sensitivity photodetectors for the terahertz (THz) band that operate at room temperature is an important challenge in optoelectronics. In this study, we introduce a photo-thermal-electric (PTE) effect detector based on quasi-free standing bilayer graphene (BLG) on a silicon carbide (SiC) substrate, designed for the THz frequency range. Our detector's performance hinges on a quasi-optical coupling scheme, which integrates an aspherical silicon lens, to optimize impedance matching between the THz antenna and the graphene p-n junction. At room temperature, we achieved a noise equivalent power (NEP) of less than 300 $pW/\sqrt{Hz}$. Through an impedance matching analysis, we coupled a planar antenna with a graphene p-n junction, inserted in parallel to the nano-gap of the antenna, via two coupling capacitors. By adjusting the capacitors and the antenna arm length, we tailored the antenna's maximum infrared power absorption to specific frequencies. The sensitivity, spectral properties, and scalability of our material make it an ideal candidate for future development of far-infrared detectors operating at room temperature.</description>

      <title>Calo-VQ: Vector-Quantized Two-Stage Generative Model in Calorimeter Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel machine learning method developed for the fast simulation of calorimeter detector response, adapting vector-quantized variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE). Our model adopts a two-stage generation strategy: initially compressing geometry-aware calorimeter data into a discrete latent space, followed by the application of a sequence model to learn and generate the latent tokens. Extensive experimentation on the Calo-challenge dataset underscores the efficiency of our approach, showcasing a remarkable improvement in the generation speed compared with conventional method by a factor of 2000. Remarkably, our model achieves the generation of calorimeter showers within milliseconds. Furthermore, comprehensive quantitative evaluations across various metrics are performed to validate physics performance of generation.</description>

      <title>Ultra-high precision comb-locked terahertz frequency-domain spectroscopy of whispering-gallery modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the capabilities of a novel frequency-domain terahertz spectrometer based on a comb-locked frequency synthesizer, which provides absolute frequency calibration. The inherent stability and repeatability of the scans allow for the combination of fast data acquisition with an average time-limited signal-to-noise ratio. We demonstrate kilohertz level frequency resolution in terahertz precision spectroscopy of ultrahigh quality whispering-gallery-mode resonators. Spectra covering multiple free spectral ranges (&gt;36GHz) with sub-20kHz resolution are acquired in 5s. We analyse the coupling behaviour and temperature tuning of single resonances and, for the first time, observe minute red and blue shifts of different mode families. The experimental results are supported with finite element simulations.</description>

      <title>Advances in the Large Area Picosecond Photo-Detector (LAPPD): 8" x 8" MCP-PMT with Capacitively Coupled Readout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.03208v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present advances made in the Large Area Picosecond Photodetector (LAPPD), an 8" $\times$ 8" microchannel plate photomultiplier tube (MCP-PMT), since pilot production was initiated at Incom, Inc. in 2018. The Gen-I LAPPD utilizes a stripline anode for direct charge readout. The novel Gen-II LAPPD employs an internal resistive thin-film which capacitively couples to a customizable external signal readout board, streamlining production. The Gen-II LAPPD, with an active area of 373 cm$^2$, is capable of high single photoelectron (PE) gain of $\sim$10$^7$, low dark rates ($\sim$1 kHz/cm$^2$), single PE timing resolution of $\sim$65 ps, and $\mathcal{O}$(mm) position resolution. Coupled with a UV-grade fused silica window, the LAPPD features a high quantum efficiency (QE) bialkali photocathode of $&gt;$30% with spectral response down to $\sim$165 nm. The LAPPD is an excellent candidate for electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL) timing layers, photon-based neutrino detectors, high energy collider experiments, medical imaging systems, and nuclear non-proliferation applications.</description>

      <title>Muon beamtest results of high-density glass scintillator tiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03681v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To achieve the physics goal of precisely measure the Higgs, Z, W bosons and the top quark, future electron-positron colliders require that their detector system has excellent jet energy resolution. One feasible technical option is the high granular calorimetery based on the particle flow algorithm (PFA). A new high-granularity hadronic calorimeter with glass scintillator tiles (GSHCAL) has been proposed, which focus on the significant improvement of hadronic energy resolution with a notable increase of the energy sampling fraction by using high-density glass scintillator tiles. The minimum ionizing particle (MIP) response of a glass scintillator tile is crucial to the hadronic calorimeter, so a dedicated beamtest setup was developed for testing the first batch of large-size glass scintillators. The maximum MIP response of the first batch of glass scintillator tiles can reach up to 107 p.e./MIP, which essentially meets the design requirements of the CEPC GSHCAL. An optical simulation model of a single glass scintillator tile has been established, and the simulation results are consistent with the beamtest results.</description>

Abstract: T2K is a neutrino oscillation experiment with a 295 km long baseline between the far detector, Super-Kamiokande, and a suite of near detectors to study $\nu_\mu/\bar{\nu}_\mu$ disappearance and $\nu_e/\bar{\nu}_e$ appearance in a $\nu_\mu/\bar{\nu}_\mu$ neutrino beam produced at J-PARC. The experiment has excluded CP conservation in the three-neutrino oscillation model at $&gt;90~\%$ CL and precisely constrained the parameters $\vert \Delta m_{32}^2 \vert$ and $\sin^2 \theta_{23}$. This paper reports on the novelties of the most up-to-date 2022 analysis and the near-future prospects of T2K.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave memory and quantum Michelson interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10454v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examined the output of a quantum Michelson interferometer incorporating the combined effects of nonlinear optomechanical interaction and time-varying gravitational fields. Our findings indicate a deviation from the standard relationship between the phase shift of the interferometer's output and the amplitude of gravitational waves. This deviation, a slight offset in direct proportionality, is associated with the gravitational wave memory effect under the conventional settings of interferometer parameters. Furthermore, the results suggest that consecutive gravitational wave memory, or the stochastic gravitational wave memory background (SGWMB), contributes not only to the classical red noise spectrum but also to a quantum red noise spectrum through this new mechanism. This leads to a novel quantum noise limit for interferometers, which may be crucial for higher precision detection system. Our analysis potentially offers a more accurate description of quantum interferometers responding to gravitational waves and applies to other scenarios involving time-varying gravitational fields. It also provides insights and experimental approaches for exploring how to unify the quantum effects of macroscopic objects and gravitation.</description>

      <title>Nonproportionality of NaI(Tl) Scintillation Detector for Dark Matter Search Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07462v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of the nonproportionality of NaI(Tl) scintillation detectors within the context of dark matter search experiments. Our investigation, which integrates COSINE-100 data with supplementary $\gamma$ spectroscopy, measures light yields across diverse energy levels from full-energy $\gamma$ peaks produced by the decays of various isotopes. These $\gamma$ peaks of interest were produced by decays supported by both long and short-lived isotopes. Analyzing peaks from decays supported only by short-lived isotopes presented a unique challenge due to their limited statistics and overlapping energies, which was overcome by long-term data collection and a time-dependent analysis. A key achievement is the direct measurement of the 0.87 keV light yield, resulting from the cascade following electron capture decay of $^{22}$Na from internal contamination. This measurement, previously accessible only indirectly, deepens our understanding of NaI(Tl) scintillator behavior in the region of interest for dark matter searches. This study holds substantial implications for background modeling and the interpretation of dark matter signals in NaI(Tl) experiments.</description>

      <title>Cluster Counting Algorithm for the CEPC Drift Chamber using LSTM and DGCNN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16493v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Particle identification (PID) of hadrons plays a crucial role in particle physics experiments, especially for flavor physics and jet tagging. The cluster counting method, which measures the number of primary ionizations in gaseous detectors, represents a promising breakthrough in PID. However, developing an effective reconstruction algorithm for cluster counting remains a major challenge. In this study, we address this challenge by proposing a cluster counting algorithm based on long short-term memory and dynamic graph convolutional neural networks for the CEPC drift chamber. Leveraging Monte Carlo simulated samples, our machine learning-based algorithm surpasses traditional methods. Specifically, it achieves a remarkable 10\% improvement in $K/\pi$ separation for PID performance, which meets the necessary PID requirements for CEPC.</description>

      <title>Unifying Simulation and Inference with Normalizing Flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18992v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There have been many applications of deep neural networks to detector calibrations and a growing number of studies that propose deep generative models as automated fast detector simulators. We show that these two tasks can be unified by using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) from conditional generative models for energy regression. Unlike direct regression techniques, the MLE approach is prior-independent and non-Gaussian resolutions can be determined from the shape of the likelihood near the maximum. Using an ATLAS-like calorimeter simulation, we demonstrate this concept in the context of calorimeter energy calibration.</description>
