      <title>Cohomological Equation for Robotic Screw Motion on the Lie Group SE(3)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the cohomological equation associated with screw motions on the Euclidean motion group SE(3). Working on the smooth manifold M = T^3 x SO(3), we combine Fourier analysis in the translational variables with Peter-Weyl theory on SO(3) to reduce the equation to a family of finite-dimensional linear transport systems along frequency orbits induced by the rotational component. In the case of finite-order rotations, solvability is governed by explicit finite-dimensional linear obstructions encoded by monodromy operators. An explicit screw motion along the z-axis illustrates the resulting resonance conditions. Since rigid motions on SE(3) arise naturally as configuration spaces in robotic kinematics, the results provide a precise description of obstruction phenomena relevant to robotic rigid-body motion.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Detection of Tube Rupture via a Cubic Discriminant Criterion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the rupture of invariant tubes in a class of nonautonomous dynamical systems arising from time-dependent Ermakov-type equations. Starting from an exactly tube-integrable reference system, we analyze a time-dependent invariant obtained from a positivity-preserving second-order perturbative construction, which provides a near-integrable geometric description of the dynamics. While this approximation does not preserve exact invariance, its algebraic structure remains sufficiently robust to allow a precise characterization of tube opening and loss of confinement.
  For fixed time, the discriminant of the approximate invariant with respect to the momentum variable defines a cubic polynomial in the configuration variable. We show that the invariant tube admits an unbounded bridge if and only if the associated cubic possesses exactly one real root. This yields a purely algebraic rupture criterion based on the cubic discriminant and reduces the full geometric problem to the evaluation of a single scalar function of time.
  Applying this criterion reveals a sequence of isolated bridge windows whose temporal organization undergoes a transition from one opening per 2*pi cycle to two openings per cycle, corresponding to a period-halving in time. These windows can be represented compactly by a one-dimensional box-plot visualization, which faithfully captures the underlying geometry and highlights the progressive densification and widening of escape-enabling intervals.
  The results demonstrate that algebraic diagnostics derived from time-dependent invariants can retain sharp predictive power for rupture phenomena even when exact tube integrability is weakly perturbed.</description>

      <title>Bifurcation Analysis of a Predator-Prey Model with Allee Effect and Cooperative Hunting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel predator-prey model that integrate two ecologically significant mechanisms: the Allee effect in the prey population and cooperative hunting behavior among predators. Building upon the Rosenzweig-MacArthur framework, our model modifies the prey growth term to incorporate the Allee effect and introduces a nonlinear functional response reflecting predator cooperation.
  We establish the existence and boundedness of global solutions for the system and analyze the local and global stability of its equilibria. In addition, we perform a comprehensive bifurcation analysis, including transcritical, saddle-node, Hopf, and heteroclinic bifurcations, to explore how system dynamics change with key parameters. These results reveal rich and biologically relevant behaviors, such as multiple equilibria, transitions in stability, and the emergence of complex dynamical patterns.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.10751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the complex dynamics of the rational function associated with the Modified Chebyshev's root-finding method. After introducing the basic preliminaries of discrete dynamical systems, we analyze the dynamical behavior of the method, classifying the stability of its fixed points and critical orbits. These theoretical findings are then illustrated through dynamical planes, which map the basins of attraction and reveal the convergence characteristics and potential chaotic regions of the method.</description>

      <title>Existence of Really Perverse Central Configurations in the Spatial $N$-Body Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct explicit examples of really perverse central configurations in the spatial Newtonian $N$-body problem. A central configuration is called really perverse if it satisfies the central configuration equations for two distinct mass distributions having the same total mass. While such configurations were previously known only in the planar case for large $N$, we prove the existence of spatial really perverse central configurations for $N=27,\dots,55$.</description>

Abstract: Moran-type iterated function systems (Moran-type IFS or MIFS) are defined by a sequence of iterated function systems, and their basic theoretical framework is established. We define Moran-type attractors and invariant probability measures associated with a sequence of probability weight vectors. Furthermore, separation conditions for MIFS are introduced, and the dimension theory of Moran-type self-similar sets is investigated.

      <description>arXiv:2601.11274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The space of parametric b-measures endowed with appropriate topologies is introduced to define a new class of generalized ODEs given by parametric b-measures. This framework offers a new approach for dealing with precompact families of Carath\'eodory ODEs using nonautonomous dynamical systems techniques. An application to the study of the dynamics of the fast variables of a slow-fast system of ODEs, where the fast motion is determined by a Carath\'eodory vector field with equicontinuous $m$-bounds and bounded $l$-bounds, is given.</description>

      <title>A Genetic Algorithm for Generating Extreme Examples in Arithmetic Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a genetic algorithm to find extreme examples in the arithmetic of dynamical systems. The algorithm is applied to four problems: small (non-zero) canonical heights, many rational preperiodic points, long rational cycles, and long rational tails. Data is provided for extreme examples generated for polynomials up to degree 13 and rational functions up to degree 5. This work significantly expands the known examples of extreme behavior for several of the conjectured behaviors in arithmetic dynamics and provides a foundation from which to begin a more advanced application of machine learning techniques in the creation of extreme examples for arithmetic dynamics.</description>

      <title>A Stable Measure of Chaos in Dynamical Systems Using Persistent Homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many real-world dynamics exhibit chaos, a phenomenon in which neighboring trajectories in the state space of a dynamical system diverge exponentially over time. A common measure used for measuring the degree of this divergence is the Lyapunov exponent, which relies on pairwise Euclidean distances between the trajectories at each time. The main limitation of the Lyapunov exponent is its sensitivity to small perturbations in input data. Since many real-world dynamics are likely to contain some degree of inherent noise, we are motivated to construct a chaos measure that is robust to small trajectory perturbations. Persistent homology has been used for proving theoretical stability guarantees under such added noise in the data. As such, we introduce a novel, persistent homology based measure of chaos termed the persistence exponent and prove its theoretical stability. We also prove the existence of an upper bound on our measure, and show its greater experimental stability on the Lorenz and Rossler systems describing fluid convection and taffy pulling. We present an algorithm for computing the persistence exponent given a single time series with N points from a dynamical system that runs in O(N^2 log N) time. We finally show the greater experimental stability of the persistence exponent on time series data depicting a Belousov Zhabotinsky chemical reaction, which transitions from periodicity to chaos and back as the system evolves in time.</description>

      <title>Balancing Economic Cost and Disease Impact: Optimization Models for Wolbachia-Based Dengue Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dengue, which affects millions of people each year, is one of the most common diseases transmitted by infected \textit{Aedes aegypti} mosquitoes. In the Philippines, the annual economic cost of dengue infections is estimated at around PHP 17 billion. Previous studies have shown that controlling the population of mosquitoes capable of transmitting the dengue virus can effectively reduce dengue infection rates. This study explores the use of Wolbachia as a strategy for dengue control by targeting mosquitoes. Since the release of Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes involves substantial costs, careful planning is necessary to balance disease control with the associated economic burden. To address this, we propose a mathematical model that captures the dynamics of releasing Wolbachia-carrying mosquitoes and the transmission of dengue in a population. We formulate single- and multi-objective optimization frameworks to minimize the economic costs associated with releasing Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes and the hospitalization costs resulting from dengue infections. This study aims to provide insights into the practical application of Wolbachia-based interventions for controlling dengue transmission. While the analysis is grounded in the Philippine context, the approach is general enough to be applicable to other dengue-endemic countries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.11033v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine multiple ergodic averages of commuting transformations with polynomial iterates in which the polynomials may be pairwise dependent. In particular, we show that such averages are controlled by the Gowers-Host-Kra seminorms whenever the system satisfies some mild ergodicity assumptions. Combining this result with the general criteria for joint ergodicity established in our earlier work, we determine a necessary and sufficient condition under which such averages are jointly ergodic, in the sense that they converge in the mean to the product of integrals, or weakly jointly ergodic, in that they converge to the product of conditional expectations. As a corollary, we deduce a special case of a conjecture by Donoso, Koutsogiannis, and Sun in a stronger form.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01353v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop several combinatorial notions about laminations, some with clear implications for parameter space. We introduce a simplified class of laminations called finite dynamical laminations (FDL). In order to count FDL, we introduce sibling portraits, of which we provide a comprehensive counting theorem. We provide a characterization of which periodic polygons appear in invariant laminations. We introduce the pullback tree. The base of the pullback tree is a set of laminations, and we show that those laminations are proper and invariant, and all laminations in the base of the pullback tree correspond to a polynomial. We define the generational FDL graph, and it provides combinatorial information about polynomial parameter space.</description>

      <title>Neuromodulation and homeostasis: complementary mechanisms for robust neural function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04172v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neurons depend on two interdependent mechanisms-homeostasis and neuromodulation-to maintain robust and adaptable functionality. Homeostasis stabilizes neuronal activity by adjusting ionic conductances, whereas neuromodulation dynamically modifies ionic properties in response to external signals. Combining these mechanisms in conductance-based models often produces unreliable outcomes, particularly when sharp neuromodulation interferes with homeostatic tuning. This study explores how a biologically inspired neuromodulation controller can harmonize with homeostasis to ensure reliable neuronal function. Using computational models of stomatogastric ganglion and dopaminergic neurons, we demonstrate that controlled neuromodulation preserves neuronal firing patterns while maintaining intracellular calcium levels. Unlike sharp neuromodulation, the neuromodulation controller integrates activity-dependent feedback through mechanisms mimicking G-protein-coupled receptor cascades. The interaction between these controllers critically depends on the existence of an intersection in conductance space, representing a balance between target calcium levels and neuromodulated firing patterns. Maximizing neuronal degeneracy enhances the likelihood of such intersections, enabling robust modulation and compensation for channel blockades. We further show that this controller pairing extends to network-level activity, reliably modulating central pattern generators in crustaceans. These findings suggest that targeting neuromodulation pathways-rather than ion channels directly-may offer safer pharmacological strategies to manage neuronal dysfunctions. This study highlights the complementary roles of homeostasis and neuromodulation, proposing a unified control framework for maintaining robust and adaptive neural activity under physiological and pathological conditions.</description>

      <title>Predictability Enables Parallelization of Nonlinear State Space Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16817v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rise of parallel computing hardware has made it increasingly important to understand which nonlinear state space models can be efficiently parallelized. Recent advances like DEER (arXiv:2309.12252) and DeepPCR (arXiv:2309.16318) recast sequential evaluation as a parallelizable optimization problem, sometimes yielding dramatic speedups. However, the factors governing the difficulty of these optimization problems remained unclear, limiting broader adoption. In this work, we establish a precise relationship between a system's dynamics and the conditioning of its corresponding optimization problem, as measured by its Polyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) constant. We show that the predictability of a system, defined as the degree to which small perturbations in state influence future behavior and quantified by the largest Lyapunov exponent (LLE), impacts the number of optimization steps required for evaluation. For predictable systems, the state trajectory can be computed in at worst $O((\log T)^2)$ time, where $T$ is the sequence length: a major improvement over the conventional sequential approach. In contrast, chaotic or unpredictable systems exhibit poor conditioning, with the consequence that parallel evaluation converges too slowly to be useful. Importantly, our theoretical analysis shows that predictable systems always yield well-conditioned optimization problems, whereas unpredictable systems lead to severe conditioning degradation. We validate our claims through extensive experiments, providing practical guidance on when nonlinear dynamical systems can be efficiently parallelized. We highlight predictability as a key design principle for parallelizable models.</description>

Abstract: We consider the orbits of a discrete Painlev\'e equation over finite fields and show that the number of points in such orbits satisfy the Hasse bound. The orbits turn out to lie on algebraic curves, whose defining polynomials are given explicitly. Moreover, these curves are shown to have genus less than or equal to one, which contrasts sharply with the case of discrete Painlev\'e equations over $\mathbb{C}$, whose generic solutions are believed to be more transcendental than elliptic functions.</description>

Abstract: Recent theoretical developments of reservoir computing have clarified a sufficient condition about which reservoir computing can capture the dynamics of a target system, enabling the reconstruction of dynamical invariants. Even when the condition is relaxed, the reservoir computing is found to succeed in reconstructing time series. In this study, we investigate numerically the dynamical structures underlying the embedding structure by comparing the Lyapunov spectrum of a high-dimensional neural network in a reservoir computing model with that of the actual system. We also compute Lyapunov exponents restricted to the tangent space of the inertial manifold in a high-dimensional neural network. Our results provide numerical evidence that reservoir computing can accurately identify the Lyapunov spectrum of the target system, including all negative exponents.</description>

      <title>Identification of a Kalman filter: consistency of local solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04198v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Prediction error and maximum likelihood methods are powerful tools for identifying linear dynamical systems and, in particular, enable the joint estimation of model parameters and the Kalman filter used for state estimation. A key limitation, however, is that these methods require solving a generally non-convex optimization problem to global optimality. This paper analyzes the statistical behavior of local minimizers in the special case where only the Kalman gain is estimated. We prove that these local solutions are statistically consistent estimates of the true Kalman gain. This follows from asymptotic unimodality: as the dataset grows, the objective function converges to a limit with a unique local (and therefore global) minimizer. We further provide guidelines for designing the optimization problem for Kalman filter tuning and discuss extensions to the joint estimation of additional linear parameters and noise covariances. Finally, the theoretical results are illustrated using three examples of increasing complexity. The main practical takeaway of this paper is that difficulties caused by local minimizers in system identification are, at least, not attributable to the tuning of the Kalman gain.</description>

      <title>Non-local planelike minimizers and $\Gamma$-convergence of periodic energies to a local anisotropic perimeter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08677v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a homogenization problem related to a non-local interface energy with a periodic forcing term. We show the existence of planelike minimizers for such energy. Moreover, we prove that, under suitable assumptions on the non-local kernel and the external field, the sequence of rescaled energies $\Gamma$-converges to a suitable local anisotropic perimeter, where the anisotropy is defined as the limit of the normalized energy of a planelike minimizer in larger and larger cubes (i.e., what is called in jargon "stable norm"). To obtain this, we also establish several auxiliary results, including: the minimality of the level sets of the minimizers, explicit bounds on the oscillations of the minimizers, density estimates for almost minimizers, and non-local perimeter estimates in the large.</description>
