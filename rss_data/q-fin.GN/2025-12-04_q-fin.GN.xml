      <title>The First Crypto President: Presidential Power and Cryptocurrency Markets During Trump's Second Term (2025-2029)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper analyzes the intersection of presidential authority and cryptocurrency markets during Donald J. Trump's second term (2025-2029). We examine developments from 2024 through October 2025, focusing on how executive influence, family business ventures, and digital assets became intertwined in ways that blurred boundaries between public office and private profit. Using a mixed-methods approach that combines quantitative market data with qualitative institutional assessment, we identify politically linked digital assets as a distinct class characterized by reflexive valuations, asymmetric risk distribution, and systemic vulnerabilities. The Trump family's integrated cryptocurrency ecosystem reached peak valuations exceeding eleven billion dollars before collapsing by more than one trillion in market capitalization following a tariff announcement in October 2025. Results highlight conflicts of interest, failures in market microstructure, and the emergence of political finance as a monetizable phenomenon in the digital age. The study contributes to understanding how presidential signaling reshapes capital flows, how politically branded tokens function as quasi-currencies, and how sudden policy actions can trigger cascading liquidations across global digital asset systems.</description>

      <title>The Effect of High-Speed Rail Connectivity on Capital Market Earnings Forecast Error: Evidence from the Chinese Stock Market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines how China's high-speed rail (HSR) expansion affects analyst earnings forecast errors from an economic information friction perspective. Using firm-year panel data from 2008-2019, a period that covers HSR's early introduction and rapid nationwide rollout, the findings show that analysts' relative earnings forecast errors (RFE) decline significantly only after firms' cities become connected by high-speed rail. The placebo test, which artificially shifts HSR connectivity 3 years earlier than the actual opening year, yields an insignificant DID coefficient, rejecting the possibility that forecast errors were improving before the infrastructure shock. This supports the conclusion that forecast error reduction is linked to real geographic accessibility improvements rather than coincidence, pre-existing trends, or analyst anticipation. Economically, the study highlights that HSR reduces analysts' costs of gathering private, incremental information, particularly soft information obtained via plant or management visits. The rail network does not directly alter firms' internal capital allocation or earnings generation paths, but it lowers spatial barriers to information collection, enabling analysts to update EPS expectations under reduced travel friction. This work provides intuitive evidence that geography and mobility improvements contribute to forecasting accuracy in China's emerging, decentralized capital market corridors, and it encourages future research to consider transport accessibility as an exogenous information cost shock rather than an internal firm-capital shock.</description>
