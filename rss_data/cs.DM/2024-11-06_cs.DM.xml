      <title>Generalized Word-Representable Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The literature on word-representable graphs is quite rich, and a number of variations of the original definition have been proposed over the years. We are initiating a systematic study of such variations based on formal languages. In our framework, we can associate a graph class to each language over the binary alphabet \{0,1\}. All graph classes that are language-representable in this sense are hereditary and enjoy further common properties. Besides word-representable graphs and, more generally, 1^k- or k-11-representable graphs, we can identify many more graph classes in our framework, like (co)bipartite graphs, (co)comparability graphs, to name a few. It was already known that any graph is 111- or 2-11-representable. When such representations are considered for storing graphs, 111- or 2-11-representability bears the disadvantage of being significantly inferior to standard adjacency matrices or lists. We prove that quite famous languages like the palindromes, the copy language or the Lyndon words can match the efficiency of standard graph representations. The perspective of language theory allows us to prove general results that hold for all graph classes that can be defined in this way. This includes certain closure properties (e.g., all language-definable graph classes are hereditary) as well as certain limitations (e.g., all language-representable graph classes contain graphs of arbitrarily large treewidth and of arbitrarily large degeneracy, except a trivial case). As each language describes a graph class, we can also ask decidability questions concerning graph classes, given a concrete presentation of a formal language. We also present a systematic study of graph classes that can be represented by languages in which each letter occurs at most twice. Here, we find graph classes like interval, permutation, circle, bipartite chain, convex, and threshold graphs.</description>

      <title>On the $d$-independence number in 1-planar graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $d$-independence number of a graph $G$ is the largest possible size of an independent set $I$ in $G$ where each vertex of $I$ has degree at least $d$ in $G$. Upper bounds for the $d$-independence number in planar graphs are well-known for $d=3,4,5$, and can in fact be matched with constructions that actually have minimum degree $d$. In this paper, we explore the same questions for 1-planar graphs, i.e., graphs that can be drawn in the plane with at most one crossing per edge. We give upper bounds for the $d$-independence number for all $d$. Then we give constructions that match the upper bound, and (for small $d$) also have minimum degree $d$.</description>

      <title>Counting random $k$-SAT near the satisfiability threshold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present efficient counting and sampling algorithms for random $k$-SAT when the clause density satisfies $\alpha \le \frac{2^k}{\mathrm{poly}(k)}.$ In particular, the exponential term $2^k$ matches the satisfiability threshold $\Theta(2^k)$ for the existence of a solution and the (conjectured) algorithmic threshold $2^k (\ln k) / k$ for efficiently finding a solution. Previously, the best-known counting and sampling algorithms required far more restricted densities $\alpha\lesssim 2^{k/3}$ [He, Wu, Yang, SODA '23]. Notably, our result goes beyond the lower bound $d\gtrsim 2^{k/2}$ for worst-case $k$-SAT with bounded-degree $d$ [Bez\'akov\'a et al, SICOMP '19], showing that for counting and sampling, the average-case random $k$-SAT model is computationally much easier than the worst-case model.
  At the heart of our approach is a new refined analysis of the recent novel coupling procedure by [Wang, Yin, FOCS '24], utilizing the structural properties of random constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs). Crucially, our analysis avoids reliance on the $2$-tree structure used in prior works, which cannot extend beyond the worst-case threshold $2^{k/2}$. Instead, we employ a witness tree similar to that used in the analysis of the Moser-Tardos algorithm [Moser, Tardos, JACM '10] for the Lov\'{a}sz Local lemma, which may be of independent interest. Our new analysis provides a universal framework for efficient counting and sampling for random atomic CSPs, including, for example, random hypergraph colorings. At the same time, it immediately implies as corollaries several structural and probabilistic properties of random CSPs that have been widely studied but rarely justified, including replica symmetry and non-reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Fractional Chromatic Numbers from Exact Decision Diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, Van Hoeve proposed an algorithm for graph coloring based on an integer flow formulation on decision diagrams for stable sets. We prove that the solution to the linear flow relaxation on exact decision diagrams determines the fractional chromatic number of a graph. This settles the question whether the decision diagram formulation or the fractional chromatic number establishes a stronger lower bound. It also establishes that the integrality gap of the linear programming relaxation is O(log n), where n represents the number of vertices in the graph. We also conduct experiments using exact decision diagrams and could determine the chromatic number of r1000.1c from the DIMACS benchmark set. It was previously unknown and is one of the few newly solved DIMACS instances in the last 10 years.</description>

      <title>Neural Networks and (Virtual) Extended Formulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural networks with piecewise linear activation functions, such as rectified linear units (ReLU) or maxout, are among the most fundamental models in modern machine learning. We make a step towards proving lower bounds on the size of such neural networks by linking their representative capabilities to the notion of the extension complexity $\mathrm{xc}(P)$ of a polytope $P$, a well-studied quantity in combinatorial optimization and polyhedral geometry. To this end, we propose the notion of virtual extension complexity $\mathrm{vxc}(P)=\min\{\mathrm{xc}(Q)+\mathrm{xc}(R)\mid P+Q=R\}$. This generalizes $\mathrm{xc}(P)$ and describes the number of inequalities needed to represent the linear optimization problem over $P$ as a difference of two linear programs. We prove that $\mathrm{vxc}(P)$ is a lower bound on the size of a neural network that optimizes over $P$. While it remains open to derive strong lower bounds on virtual extension complexity, we show that powerful results on the ordinary extension complexity can be converted into lower bounds for monotone neural networks, that is, neural networks with only nonnegative weights. Furthermore, we show that one can efficiently optimize over a polytope $P$ using a small virtual extended formulation. We therefore believe that virtual extension complexity deserves to be studied independently from neural networks, just like the ordinary extension complexity. As a first step in this direction, we derive an example showing that extension complexity can go down under Minkowski sum.</description>

      <title>Graph-Based Semi-Supervised Segregated Lipschitz Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an approach to semi-supervised learning for the classification of data using the Lipschitz Learning on graphs. We develop a graph-based semi-supervised learning framework that leverages the properties of the infinity Laplacian to propagate labels in a dataset where only a few samples are labeled. By extending the theory of spatial segregation from the Laplace operator to the infinity Laplace operator, both in continuum and discrete settings, our approach provides a robust method for dealing with class imbalance, a common challenge in machine learning. Experimental validation on several benchmark datasets demonstrates that our method not only improves classification accuracy compared to existing methods but also ensures efficient label propagation in scenarios with limited labeled data.</description>

      <title>Symmetric Splendor: Unraveling Universally Closest Refinements and Fisher Market Equilibrium through Density-Friendly Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17964v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive framework that unifies several research areas within the context of vertex-weighted bipartite graphs, providing deeper insights and improved solutions. The fundamental solution concept for each problem involves refinement, where vertex weights on one side are distributed among incident edges. The primary objective is to identify a refinement pair with specific optimality conditions that can be verified locally. This framework connects existing and new problems that are traditionally studied in different contexts.
  We explore three main problems: (1) density-friendly hypergraph decomposition, (2) universally closest distribution refinements problem, and (3) symmetric Fisher Market equilibrium.
  Our framework presents a symmetric view of density-friendly hypergraph decomposition, wherein hyperedges and nodes play symmetric roles. This symmetric decomposition serves as a tool for deriving precise characterizations of optimal solutions for other problems and enables the application of algorithms from one problem to another.</description>

      <title>Restivo Salemi property for $\alpha$-power free languages with $\alpha\geq 5$ and $k\geq 3$ letters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10061v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 2009, Shur published the following conjecture: Let $L$ be a power-free language and let $e(L)\subseteq L$ be the set of words of $L$ that can be extended to a bi-infinite word respecting the given power-freeness. If $u, v \in e(L)$ then $uwv \in e(L)$ for some word $w$. Let $L_{k,\alpha}$ denote an $\alpha$-power free language over an alphabet with $k$ letters, where $\alpha$ is a positive rational number and $k$ is positive integer. We prove the conjecture for the languages $L_{k,\alpha}$, where $\alpha\geq 5$ and $k\geq 3$.</description>

      <title>Iterated Radical Expansions and Convergence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02114v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We treat three recurrences involving square roots, the first of which arises from an infinite simple radical expansion for the Golden mean, whose precise convergence rate was made famous by Richard Bruce Paris in 1987. A never-before-seen proof of an important formula is given. The other recurrences are non-exponential yet equally interesting. Asymptotic series developed for each of these two examples feature a constant, dependent on the initial condition but otherwise intrinsic to the function at hand.</description>
