      <title>Is it possible to describe an electron by the evolution of a single point?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The answer to the title-question is positive. The analysis of the geometry of continuous and differentiable curves in three-dimensional Euclidean space suggests that the point represents the location of the center of charge of the electron, satisfies a system of ordinary differential equations of fourth order, and moves at the speed of light. The center of mass of the electron is a different point and will be determined by the evolution of the center of charge. It is the relative motion of the center of charge around the center of mass that gives rise to the spin and magnetic properties.</description>

      <title>General Relativistic Quantum Mechanics deriving Electroweak and Gravitational Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A gauge theory with an indefinite metric without negative probabilities is given by extending quantum mechanics, where a general metric is introduced, and the invariance under the general linear transformation is imposed on the space of quantum states. On this basis, we construct and investigate a chiral sextet model, which has one more Lorentz symmetry in the gauge space, to derive much properties of the standard electroweak theory, and also Einstein gravity, when the double Lorentz symmetry spontaneously fuses into one.</description>

      <title>From Poincare Invariance to Gauge Theories: Yang-Mills and General Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02052v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article is founded on two fundamental principles: the principle field equations introduced in Refs. \cite{S, S1, S2} and the Fock-Ivanenko covariant derivatives \cite{FI, F}. The former yields the equations of motion for free fields of arbitrary spin and helicity. In the massless case, it also dictates that Lorentz transformations for tensor fields acquire an additional term, which takes the form of a gauge transformation \cite{W, S1}.
  The latter principle, the Fock-Ivanenko derivative, introduces interactions based on the intrinsic and Poincare groups. This framework allows us to recover a complete Yang-Mills theory, as well as general relativity in the connection-based formulations of Palatini and Ashtekar, both of which are theories with local gauge symmetries.
  While the standard approach begins with the symmetries of a matter action, we will instead derive dynamics directly from Poincare invariance. This perspective reveals that for free fields, Lorentz invariance induces the gauge symmetry of massless tensors. A proper definition of these gauge transformations, in turn, requires the covariant derivatives provided by the Fock-Ivanenko approach.
  Considering matter fields, we derive the interacting Dirac equation in the presence of Yang-Mills and gravitational fields from its free counterpart.</description>

      <title>Disentangling Brillouin's negentropy law of information and Landauer's law on data erasure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02086v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The link between information and energy introduces the observer and their knowledge into the understanding of a fundamental quantity of physics. Two approaches compete to account for this link, Brillouin's negentropy law of information and Landauer's law on data erasure, which are often confused. The first, based on the Clausius' inequality and Shannon's mathematical results is very robust, while the second, based on the simple idea that information needs a material embodiment (data-bits) is today perceived as more physical and prevails. In this paper, we show that Landauer's idea results from a confusion between information (a global emergent concept) and data (a local material object). This confusion leads to many inconsistencies and is incompatible with thermodynamics and information theory. The reason it prevails is interpreted to be due to a frequent tendency of materialism towards reductionism, neglecting emergence and seeking to eliminate the role of the observer. A paradoxical trend given that it is often accompanied by the materialist idea that all scientific knowledge nevertheless originates from observation. Information and entropy are actually emergent quantities introduced in the theory by convention.</description>

      <title>Possible Vulnerability of Bell-Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt Tests used for Quantum Certification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07867v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A hidden variables (HVs) model is reported, which reproduces quantum predictions for Bell-Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (Bell-CHSH) tests. The existence of such a model poses some limitations to quantum certifications that rely on Bell-CHSH inequality violations. The reported model does not prove wrong Bell's theorem. The latter assumes the factorability of the probability density $p_{AB}$, which rules the stochastic behavior of the HVs. The reported HVs model is based on an extended form of $p_{AB}$, which is suggested by Lebesgue's decomposition theorem for bounded functions. The considered $p_{AB}$ complies with locality and realism, and also with measurement independence, parameter independence and outcome independence.</description>
