      <description>arXiv:2509.20629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we analyze the properties of tame nodal stacky curves, in particular twisted curves and \textit{doubly-twisted} curves. Our main results are a complete classification of the possible structures of a tame stacky node, along with computations of the Picard and Brauer groups of nodal stacky curves.</description>

      <title>Moduli spaces of parabolic representation pairs of the fundamental group of a punctured surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the notions of parabolic representation pair variety and relative representation variety of a given parabolic type. We investigate the local behavior of these varieties. The Zariski tangent space and the tangent quadratic cones are described. By the Riemann--Hilbert--Deligne correspondence, we pro-represent the analytic germs of these varieties by functors related to certain groupoids of parabolic logarithmic flat bundles. Under suitable assumptions, we prove that the differential graded Lie algebra (DGLA) controlling the deformation of parabolic logarithmic flat bundle is mixedly formal. Finally, we construct the moduli space of weighted parabolic representation pairs, and, by means of quiver representation theory, we establish the Kobayashi--Hitchin-type theorem for polystable parabolic representation pairs.</description>

      <title>Purity of generalized affine Springer fibers from generic planar curve singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the cohomological purity of punctual Hilbert schemes of points on generic irreducible planar curve singularities, by constructing an explicit affine paving. Via their identification with generalized $GL_N$-affine Springer fibers attached to the direct sum of the adjoint and standard representations, this establishes a new case of the purity conjecture for generalized affine Springer fibers. The combinatorics of the paving - cell indices and dimensions - are controlled by $(dn,dm)$-Dyck paths extending results of Gorsky-Mazin-Oblomkov on compactified Jacobians. As a byproduct, we also give a simpler proof of their bijection between admissible $(dn,dm)$-invariant subsets and $(dn,dm)$-Dyck paths.</description>

      <title>Birationally integrable vector fields on complex projective surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A rational vector field on a complex projective smooth surface $S$ is said to be birationally integrable if it generates, by integration, a one-parameter subgroup of the group $\operatorname{Bir}(S)$ of birational transformations of $S$. We prove that every birationally integrable vector field is regularizable, i.e. birationally conjugated to a holomorphic vector field. Next, we extend this result to any finite-dimensional Lie algebra $\mathfrak g$ of birationally integrable vector fields. This implies that $\mathfrak g$ is naturally included into the Lie algebra of an algebraic subgroup of $\operatorname{Bir}(S)$. Moreover, we obtain a complete birational classification of birationally integrable Lie algebras that are of dimension two or semisimple, exhibiting holomorphic normal forms of them. We also characterize those birationally integrable algebras of rational vector fields that are maximal.</description>

      <title>Subgroups of the Projective Linear Group Realized by wild Galois Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We work over an algebraically closed field of positive characteristic. This paper investigates linear representations of Galois groups arising from wild Galois points on projective hypersurfaces. We prove that these Galois groups lift to the general linear group and act naturally on vector spaces. Furthermore, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for subgroups of the projective linear group to be realized as Galois groups of wild Galois points. In addition, we show that projections from wild Galois points on normal hypersurfaces are necessarily wildly ramified. We provide a geometric criterion for detecting wild ramification via the fixed loci of birational automorphisms, linking group-theoretic properties to the geometry of the hypersurface.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a conjecture proposed by the first author on boundedness of Stein degree of divisors on log Calabi-Yau fibrations. More precisely, for $d\in \mathbb{N}$ and $t\in (0,1]$, let $(X, B)\to Z$ be a log Calabi-Yau fibration of relative dimension $d$, and let $S$ be a horizontal$/Z$ irreducible component of $B$ whose coefficient in $B$ is $\ge t$. We show that the number of irreducible components of a general fibre of $S\to Z$ is bounded from above depending only on $d,t$.</description>

      <title>Toric surface codes and the periodicity of polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Toric codes are error-correcting codes that are derived from toric varieties, which hold a unique correspondence to integral convex polytopes. In this paper, we focus on integral convex polytopes $P \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2$ and the toric codes they define. We begin by studying period-1 polytopes -- polytopes satisfying the property $L(tP)$ = $tL(P)$ for all $t \in \mathbb{Z}^+$, where $tP$ is the $t$-dilate of $P$, and we prove an explicit formula for the minimum distance of toric codes associated to a particular class of period-1 polytopes. We also apply the methods of Little and Schwarz, using Vandermonde matrices, to compute the minimum distance of another class of period-1 polytopes.</description>

      <title>On the geometry of integral models of Shimura varieties with $\Gamma_1(p)$-level structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study integral models of some Shimura varieties with bad reduction at a prime p, namely the Siegel modular variety and Shimura varieties associated with some unitary groups. We focus on the case where the level structure at p is given by the pro-unipotent radical of an Iwahori subgroup, and we analyze the geometry of the integral models that have been proposed until now: we show that they are almost never normal and in some cases not flat over $\mathbb{Z}_p$. We do so by showing the failure of these geometric properties on the corresponding local models, and we explain how the local model diagrams can be interpreted using the root stack construction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.21204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the trace of Frobenius on the sheaf of nearby cycles for the integral model of the Siegel modular variety with pro-p Iwahori level structure, constructed by Haines and Stroh, in the case of $\text{GSp}_4$. To this end, we make use of a semistable resolution of this model due to Shadrach. Finally, we compare our results with calculations made by Horn, confirming a conjecture of Haines and Kottwitz in this case.</description>

      <title>Strong cohomological integrality for symmetric stacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a strong form of the cohomological integrality theorem, decomposing the cohomology of smooth symmetric stacks as the cohomological Hall induction of the intersection cohomology of the good moduli spaces of stacks of graded points. This generalizes the previous result by the second author together with Bu--Davison--Ib\'a\~nez Nu\~nez--P\u{a}durariu to non-orthogonal stacks, and confirms a conjecture of the first author that the algebraic BPS cohomology of the quotient stack of a symmetric representation matches the intersection cohomology group whenever it is nonzero. As a consequence, we obtain a version of the cohomological integrality theorem for general 0-shifted symplectic stacks with good moduli spaces, as well as for the character stacks of general compact oriented $3$-manifolds with reductive gauge groups. As an application, we prove Halpern-Leistner's conjecture on the purity of the Borel--Moore homology of $0$-shifted symplectic stacks admitting proper good moduli spaces.
  Our proof combines a cohomological bound for the algebraic BPS cohomology, due to the first author and based on Efimov's lemma, with a vanishing-cycle argument due to the second author in collaboration with Bu--Davison--Ib\'a\~nez Nu\~nez--P\u{a}durariu.</description>

      <title>The arithmetic rank of determinantal nullcones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the arithmetic rank of nullcone ideals arising from the classical actions of the symplectic group, the general linear group, and the orthogonal group. We use these arithmetic rank calculations to establish striking vanishing results on the local cohomology modules supported at these nullcone ideals. This is done by analyzing the integer torsion in the critical local cohomology modules. The vanishing theorems that we obtain are sharp in multiple ways.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we showed that the adjoint polynomial of a polyhedral cone equals the multidegree polynomial of the toric ideal with multigrading, both given by the vertex rays. This fact implies a conjecture of Aluffi, to the effect that the adjoint polynomial of a polyhedral cone in the positive orthant is a covolume polynomial.</description>

      <title>A Morse complex for the homology of vanishing cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct Morse homology groups associated with any regular function on a smooth complex algebraic variety, allowing singular and non-compact critical loci. These groups are generated by critical points of a certain large pertubation of the function, built from a normal crossing compactification of the variety. They are canonically isomorphic to the homology of vanishing cycles and -- in the absence of bifurcations at infinity -- recover the hypercohomology of the perverse sheaf of vanishing cycles, studied extensively in singularity theory and enumerative geometry. Our construction arises as a special case of a more general construction of Morse homology of non-compact manifolds that admit a compactification by a manifold with corners.</description>

      <title>Bigraded Polynomials for the Cohomology of Wild Hitchin Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a bi-graded polynomial that encodes the cohomology groups of the wild Hitchin system of type~$A_{n-1}$, constructed using an irregular singularity (determined by an integer~$m$) and an arbitrary regular singularity~$f$. When the regular singularity is of the form~$f = [1, \ldots, 1]$, the bi-graded polynomial~$C_{m,n}(q,t)$ coincides with the bigraded rational parking function defined combinatorially, admitting a Schur expansion~$C_{m,n}(q,t) = \sum_\lambda f_\lambda(q,t) s_\lambda(x)$. For general~$f$, the polynomial takes the form~$C^f_{m,n}(q,t) = \sum_\lambda f_\lambda(q,t) K_{\lambda f}$, where~$K_{\lambda f}$ denotes the Kostka number. We conjecture that this bi-graded polynomial agrees with the one arising from the perverse filtration of the Hitchin fibration, or equivalently, from the weight filtration of the mixed Hodge structure from the character variety. We also give a description by using the geometry of affine Springer fiber.}</description>

      <title>Graphical configuration spaces, Contractads and Formality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a finite simple connected graph $\Gamma$, the graphical configuration space $\mathrm{Conf}_{\Gamma}(X)$ is the space of collections of points in $X$ indexed by the vertices of $\Gamma$, where points corresponding to adjacent vertices must be distinct. When $X=\mathbb{R}^d$ and the points are replaced by small disks, the resulting spaces for all possible graphs fit together into an algebraic structure that extends the little disks operad, called the little disks contractad $\mathcal{D}_d$. In this paper, we investigate the homotopical and algebraic properties of the little disks contractad $\mathcal{D}_d$. We construct and study Fulton-MacPherson compactifications of graphical configuration spaces, which provide a convenient model for $\mathcal{D}_d$ within the class of compact manifolds with boundary. Using these and wonderful compactifications, we prove that $\mathcal{D}_d$ is formal in the category of (Hopf) contractads for $d=1$, $d=2$, and for chordal graphs for any $d$. We also identify the first obstructions to coformality in the case of cyclic graphs. In addition, we give a combinatorial description of the cell structure of $\mathcal{D}_2$ and present applications to the study of graphical configuration spaces $\mathrm{Conf}_{\Gamma}(X)$ using the language of twisted algebras.</description>

      <title>Cylinder maps of algebraic cycles on cubic hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.12394</link>
      <description>arXiv:1810.12394v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let \(X\subset \mathbb{P}^{n+1}\) be a smooth cubic hypersurface, and let \(F(X)\) be the variety of lines on \(X\). We prove the surjectivity of the cylinder maps on the Chow groups of \(F(X)\) and \(X\) if \(X\) contains a one-cycle of degree \(1\). Mongardi and Ottem previously proved the integral Hodge conjecture for curve classes on hyperk\"ahler manifolds. Using the cylinder maps, we provide an alternative proof for the \(F(X)\) of a smooth complex cubic fourfold \(X\), which is a special hyperk\"ahler fourfold. In addition, we confirm the integral Tate conjecture for \(F(X)\) of a smooth cubic fourfold \(X\) over a finitely generated field.</description>

Abstract: Donaldson-Thomas (DT) invariants of a quiver with potential can be expressed in terms of simpler attractor DT invariants by a universal formula. The coefficients in this formula are calculated combinatorially using attractor flow trees. In this paper, we prove that these coefficients are genus 0 log Gromov--Witten invariants of $d$-dimensional toric varieties, where $d$ is the number of vertices of the quiver. This result follows from a log-tropical correspondence theorem which relates $(d-2)$-dimensional families of tropical curves obtained as universal deformations of attractor flow trees, and rational log curves in toric varieties.</description>

Abstract: We prove a correspondence between Donaldson-Thomas invariants of quivers with potential having trivial attractor invariants and genus zero punctured Gromov-Witten invariants of holomorphic symplectic cluster varieties. The proof relies on the comparison of the stability scattering diagram, describing the wall-crossing behavior of Donaldson-Thomas invariants, with a scattering diagram capturing punctured Gromov-Witten invariants via tropical geometry.</description>

      <title>Computing the $F$-pure Threshold of Flag Varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06908v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the $F$-pure threshold of the natural cone over flag varieties in characteristic $p&gt;0$. Our calculations are mainly focused on flag varieties that are arithmetically Gorenstein, but we offer some results in the non-Gorenstein case. Our goal is to determine the $a$-invariant of the cone. As a result, the $F$-pure thresholds we find are independent of the characteristic $p$, hence one immediately gets the value of the log canonical threshold of flags in characteristic 0 as well.</description>

      <title>Mukai bundles on Fano threefolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07154v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a proof of Mukai's Theorem on the existence of certain exceptional vector bundles on prime Fano threefolds. To our knowledge this is the first complete proof in the literature. The result is essential for Mukai's biregular classification of prime Fano threefolds, and for the existence of semiorthogonal decompositions in their derived categories.
  Our approach is based on Lazarsfeld's construction that produces vector bundles on a variety from globally generated line bundles on a divisor, on Mukai's theory of stable vector bundles on K3 surfaces, and on Brill--Noether properties of curves and (in the sense of Mukai) of K3 surfaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23533v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a pair consisting of a smooth variety of arbitrary dimension over a field of positive characteristic and a multi-ideal with a real exponent. We prove that the set of log discrepancies for a fixed exponent is discrete. Additionally, we show that the set of log canonical thresholds (lcts) of multi-ideals on a smooth variety in positive characteristic is contained within the set of lcts of multi-ideals on a smooth variety over the complex number field. As a result, we find that the accumulation points of log canonical thresholds are rational if all the exponents are rational. We also obtain ACC for the set of lcts of multi-ideals on a smooth varieties in positive characteristic.</description>

Abstract: In this short paper, we prove that the moduli of automorphisms of Frobenius twisted de Rham cohomology functor is given by $\mathbb{G}_m$. Our method is to use the notion of $\mathbb{G}_a^{\mathrm{perf}}$-modules and its connection to the de Rham cohomology functor introduced in \cite{M22}. As an application of the induced $\mathbb{G}_m$-action, we reprove a result of Bhatt, Petrov, and Vologodsky on the decomposition of the Frobenius twisted de Rham complex.</description>

      <title>Functorial constructions related to double Poisson vertex algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06071v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For any double Poisson algebra, we produce a double Poisson vertex algebra using the jet algebra construction. We show that this construction is compatible with the representation functor which associates to any double Poisson (vertex) algebra and any positive integer a Poisson (vertex) algebra. We also consider related constructions, such as Poisson reductions and Hamiltonian reductions, with the aim of comparing the different corresponding categories. This allows us to provide various interesting examples of double Poisson vertex algebras, in particular from double quivers.</description>

      <title>A minimal model for prestacks and morphisms of operadic algebras via Koszul duality for box operads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04185v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Prestacks are algebro-geometric objects whose defining relations are far from quadratic. Indeed, they are cubic and quartic, and moreover inhomogeneous. Similarly, a morphism of $P$-algebras for a (nonsymmetric) Koszul operad $P$ has inhomogeneous relations possibly of any arity. We show that box operads, a rectangular type of operads introduced in arXiv:2305.20036, constitute the correct framework to encode them and resolve their relations up to homotopy. Our first main result is a Koszul duality theory for box operads, extending the duality for (nonsymmetric) operads. In this new theory, the classical restriction of being quadratic is replaced by the notion of being \emph{thin-quadratic}, a condition referring to a particular class of ``thin'' operations. Our main cases of interest are the box operad $Morph(P)$ encoding morphisms of $P$-algebras and the box operad $Lax$ encoding lax prestacks. We show that both $Morph(P)$ and $Lax$ are not Koszul. We then go on to remedy the situation by suitably restricting the respective Koszul dual box cooperads $Morph(P)^{\antishriek}$ and $Lax^{\antishriek}$ to obtain our two main applications. As our second main result we establish a minimal model $Morph(P)_\infty$ for the box operad $Morph(P)$ as the cobar construction on a box subcooperad $Morph(P)^{\antishriek}_{p\leq 1}$ of $Morph(P)^{\antishriek}$, hereby answering an open question by Markl in arXiv:math/0103052 (Problem 9). As expected, it encodes $\infty$-morphisms of $P_\infty$-algebras. As our third main result we establish a minimal model $Lax_{\infty}$ for the box operad $Lax$ encoding lax prestacks. This sheds new light on Markl's question on the existence of an explicit cofibrant model for the operad encoding presheaves of algebras from arXiv:math/0103052 (Conjecture 31). Indeed, we answer the parallel question with presheaves viewed as prestacks in the positive.</description>

      <title>Symbols for toric Eisenstein cocycles and arithmetic applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00294v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using a complex parameterizing rational spherical chains, we construct explicit cocycles for $\mathrm{GL}_n(\Q)$ valued in the motivic cohomology of (open subsets of) the algebraic $n$-torus $\mathbb{G}_m^n$. The resulting cocycles directly generalize the work of Sharifi and Venkatesh from the case $n=2$ \cite{SV}. Even in this special case, our systematic use of pushforwards allows us to avoid the use of their ``connecting sequences,'' and allows us to refine the construction and Hecke properties of the Sharifi map $\varpi$ to the maximal expected statements, while inverting only the prime $2$. For general $n$, the $d\log$ regulator of our cocycle is related by convex conical duality to cocycles constructed from Shintani cones. This affords a systematic approach to $p$-adic $L$-functions for totally real fields without need for auxiliary data or logarithm sheaf coefficients, including a distribution-valued $\GL_n(\Z)$-cocycle specializing in a simple way to all such $p$-adic $L$-functions. It moreover provides a direct conceptual link between polylogarithmic constructions of Eisenstein classes (e.g., in \cite{BKL}), and those constructed using Shintani cones (e.g., in \cite{CDG}). We also show how our formalism gives an alternate proof of the exceptional divisibilities of the Deligne-Ribet $2$-adic $L$-function in almost all cases.</description>

      <title>Isolated and parameterized points on curves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14353v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a self-contained introduction to isolated points on curves and their counterpoint, parameterized points, that situates these concepts within the study of the arithmetic of curves. In particular, we show how natural geometric constructions of infinitely many degree d points on curves motivate the definitions of $\mathbb{P}^1$- and AV-parameterized points and explain how a result of Faltings implies that there are only finitely many isolated points on any curve. We use parameterized points to deduce properties of the density degree set and show that parameterized points of very low degree arise for a unique geometric reason. The paper includes several examples that illustrate the possible behaviors of degree d points.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16140v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Borel plane of the topological string free energy on all hypergeometric one-parameter Calabi-Yau models close to singular points in moduli space, focusing on the location of Borel singularities and the value of the associated Stokes constants. We find in particular that in models which exhibit massless D-branes at a singular point, the central charge of the D-brane close to the singular point coincides with the location of the leading Borel singularity, and the generalized Donaldson-Thomas invariant associated to the charge of the D-brane, in as far as its value is known, coincides with the Stokes constant associated to the Borel singularity.</description>
