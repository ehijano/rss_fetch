      <title>Maple: A Multi-agent System for Portable Deep Learning across Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training deep learning (DL) models across Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) clusters is technically challenging. One aspect is that users have to compose command lines to adapt to the heterogeneous launchers, schedulers, affinity options, DL framework arguments, and environment variables. Composing correct command lines is error-prone and can easily frustrate users, impeding research or wasting resources. In this work, we present Maple, a multi-agent system that generates correct DL command lines with users' natural language input. Maple consists of four agents with the functionalities of information extraction, template retrieval, command line verification, and error correction. We evaluate Maple on nine GPU clusters across national computing centers in the U.S., five representative deep learning model families, and four commonly used parallel DL training paradigms. Our experiments also cover schedulers of SLURM and PBS and heterogeneous architectures, such as NVIDIA A100/H200 GPUs and Intel Max series GPUs. Maple achieves 92.0% accuracy in generating command lines across the 567 test cases. Leverage multiple language models with an aggregated size of 10B parameters, Maple delivers comparable performance to the state-of-the-art models of GPT-5, Claude, and Gemini. Together, these results highlight Maple's practical value in enabling portable and scalable distributed DL across heterogeneous HPC environments.</description>

      <title>Slicing Is All You Need: Towards A Universal One-Sided Algorithm for Distributed Matrix Multiplication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many important applications across science, data analytics, and AI workloads depend on distributed matrix multiplication. Prior work has developed a large array of algorithms suitable for different problem sizes and partitionings including 1D, 2D, 1.5D, and 2.5D algorithms. A limitation of current work is that existing algorithms are limited to a subset of partitionings. Multiple algorithm implementations are required to support the full space of possible partitionings. If no algorithm implementation is available for a particular set of partitionings, one or more operands must be redistributed, increasing communication costs. This paper presents a universal one-sided algorithm for distributed matrix multiplication that supports all combinations of partitionings and replication factors. Our algorithm uses slicing (index arithmetic) to compute the sets of overlapping tiles that must be multiplied together. This list of local matrix multiplies can then either be executed directly, or reordered and lowered to an optimized IR to maximize overlap. We implement our algorithm using a high-level C++-based PGAS programming framework that performs direct GPU-to-GPU communication using intra-node interconnects. We evaluate performance for a wide variety of partitionings and replication factors, finding that our work is competitive with PyTorch DTensor, a highly optimized distributed tensor library targeting AI models.</description>

      <title>Co-designing a Programmable RISC-V Accelerator for MPC-based Energy and Thermal Management of Many-Core HPC Processors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Managing energy and thermal profiles is critical for many-core HPC processors with hundreds of application-class processing elements (PEs). Advanced model predictive control (MPC) delivers state-of-the-art performance but requires solving an online optimization problem over a thousand times per second (1 kHz control bandwidth), with computational and memory demands scaling with PE count. Traditional MPC approaches execute the controller on the PEs, but operating system overheads create jitter and limit control bandwidth. Running MPC on dedicated on-chip controllers enables fast, deterministic control but raises concerns about area and power overhead. In this work, we tackle these challenges by proposing a hardware-software codesign of a lightweight MPC controller, based on an operator-splitting quadratic programming solver and an embedded multi-core RISC-V controller. Key innovations include pruning weak thermal couplings to reduce model memory and ahead-of-time scheduling for efficient parallel execution of sparse triangular systems arising from the optimization problem. The proposed controller achieves sub-millisecond latency when controlling 144 PEs at 500 MHz, delivering 33x lower latency and 7.9x higher energy efficiency than a single-core baseline. Operating within a compact less than 1 MiB memory footprint, it consumes as little as 325 mW while occupying less than 1.5% of a typical HPC processor's die area.</description>

      <title>Are Voters Willing to Collectively Secure Elections? Unraveling a Practical Blockchain Voting System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensuring ballot secrecy is critical for fair and trustworthy electronic voting systems, yet achieving strong secrecy guarantees in decentralized, large-scale elections remains challenging. This paper proposes the concept of collectively secure voting, in which voters themselves can opt in as secret holders to protect ballot secrecy. A practical blockchain-based collectively secure voting system is designed and implemented. Our design strikes a balance between strong confidentiality guarantees and real-world applicability. The proposed system combines threshold cryptography and smart contracts to ensure ballots remain confidential during voting, while all protocol steps remain transparent and verifiable. Voters can use the system without prior blockchain knowledge through an intuitive user interface that hides underlying complexity. To evaluate this approach, a user testing is conducted. Results show a high willingness to act as secret holders, reliable participation in share release, and high security confidence in the proposed system. The findings demonstrate that voters can collectively maintain secrecy and that such a practical deployment is feasible.</description>

      <title>Man-Made Heuristics Are Dead. Long Live Code Generators!</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Policy design for various systems controllers has conventionally been a manual process, with domain experts carefully tailoring heuristics for the specific instance in which the policy will be deployed. In this paper, we re-imagine policy design via a novel automated search technique fueled by recent advances in generative models, specifically Large Language Model (LLM)-driven code generation. We outline the design and implementation of PolicySmith, a framework that applies LLMs to synthesize instance-optimal heuristics. We apply PolicySmith to two long-standing systems policies - web caching and congestion control, highlighting the opportunities unraveled by this LLM-driven heuristic search. For caching, PolicySmith discovers heuristics that outperform established baselines on standard open-source traces. For congestion control, we show that PolicySmith can generate safe policies that integrate directly into the Linux kernel.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning-Driven Edge Management for Reliable Multi-view 3D Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-time multi-view 3D reconstruction is a mission-critical application for key edge-native use cases, such as fire rescue, where timely and accurate 3D scene modeling enables situational awareness and informed decision-making. However, the dynamic and unpredictable nature of edge resource availability introduces disruptions, such as degraded image quality, unstable network links, and fluctuating server loads, which challenge the reliability of the reconstruction pipeline. In this work, we present a reinforcement learning (RL)-based edge resource management framework for reliable 3D reconstruction to ensure high quality reconstruction within a reasonable amount of time, despite the system operating under a resource-constrained and disruption-prone environment. In particular, the framework adopts two cooperative Q-learning agents, one for camera selection and one for server selection, both of which operate entirely online, learning policies through interactions with the edge environment. To support learning under realistic constraints and evaluate system performance, we implement a distributed testbed comprising lab-hosted end devices and FABRIC infrastructure-hosted edge servers to emulate smart city edge infrastructure under realistic disruption scenarios. Results show that the proposed framework improves application reliability by effectively balancing end-to-end latency and reconstruction quality in dynamic environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rise of distributed applications and cloud computing has created a demand for scalable, high-performance key-value storage systems. This paper presents a performance evaluation of three prominent NoSQL key-value stores: Redis, Aerospike, and Dragonfly, using the Yahoo! Cloud Serving Benchmark (YCSB) framework. We conducted extensive experiments across three distinct workload patterns (read-heavy, write-heavy), and balanced while systematically varying client concurrency from 1 to 32 clients. Our evaluation methodology captures both latency, throughput, and memory characteristics under realistic operational conditions, providing insights into the performance trade-offs and scalability behaviour of each system</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Scheduling for Multi-Vector Image Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To effectively leverage user-specific data, retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is employed in multimodal large language model (MLLM) applications. However, conventional retrieval approaches often suffer from limited retrieval accuracy. Recent advances in multi-vector retrieval (MVR) improve accuracy by decomposing queries and matching against segmented images. They still suffer from sub-optimal accuracy and efficiency, overlooking alignment between the query and varying image objects and redundant fine-grained image segments. In this work, we present an efficient scheduling framework for image retrieval - HiMIR. First, we introduce a novel hierarchical paradigm, employing multiple intermediate granularities for varying image objects to enhance alignment. Second, we minimize redundancy in retrieval by leveraging cross-hierarchy similarity consistency and hierarchy sparsity to minimize unnecessary matching computation. Furthermore, we configure parameters for each dataset automatically for practicality across diverse scenarios. Our empirical study shows that, HiMIR not only achieves substantial accuracy improvements but also reduces computation by up to 3.5 times over the existing MVR system.</description>

      <title>Multiparty equality in the local broadcast model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the multiparty equality problem in graphs, where every vertex of a graph $G$ is given an input, and the goal of the vertices is to decide whether all inputs are equal. We study this problem in the local broadcast model, where a message sent by a vertex is received by all its neighbors and the total cost of a protocol is the sum of the lengths of the messages sent by the vertices. This setting was studied by Khan and Vaidya, who gave in 2021 a protocol achieving a 4-approximation in the general case.
  We study this multiparty communication problem through the lens of network topology. We design a new protocol for 2-connected graphs, whose efficiency relies on the notion of total vertex cover in graph theory. This protocol outperforms the aforementioned 4-approximation in a number of cases. To demonstrate its applicability, we apply it to obtain optimal or asymptotically optimal protocols for several natural network topologies such as cycles, hypercubes, and grids. On the way we also provide new bounds of independent interest on the size of total vertex covers in regular graphs.</description>

      <title>FAST: An Efficient Scheduler for All-to-All GPU Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09764v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: All-to-All(v) communication is a critical primitive in modern machine learning workloads, particularly mixture-of-experts (MoE) models. Unfortunately, efficient scheduling is challenging due to workload skew, heterogeneous two-tier fabrics, and incast congestion, compounded by the dynamic nature of MoE workloads, where traffic shifts every few hundred milliseconds. Existing schedulers are hardly scalable, incurring seconds to hours of synthesis time, making them impractical. We present FAST, an efficient All-to-All(v) scheduler. FAST addresses skew through intra-server rebalancing and enforces balanced, one-to-one scale-out transfers that avoid incast. Evaluated extensively on both NVIDIA H200 and AMD MI300X clusters, FAST consistently outperforms state-of-the-art solutions on skewed workloads while reducing synthesis time by orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Lower Bounds for $k$-Set Agreement in Fault-Prone Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15562v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a new lower bound for k-set agreement in synchronous message-passing systems connected by an arbitrary directed communication network, where up to t processes may crash. Our result thus generalizes the t/k+1 lower bound for complete networks in the t-resilient model by Chaudhuri, Herlihy, Lynch, and Tuttle [JACM'00]. Moreover, it generalizes two lower bounds for oblivious algorithms in synchronous systems connected by an arbitrary undirected communication network known to the processes, namely, the domination number-based lower bound by Castaneda, Fraigniaud, Paz, Rajsbaum, Roy, and Travers [TCS'21] for failure-free processes, and the radius-based lower bound in the t-resilient model by Fraigniaud, Nguyen, and Paz [STACS'24].
  Our topological proof non-trivially generalizes and extends the connectivity-based approach for the complete network, as presented in the book by Herlihy, Kozlov, and Rajsbaum (2013). It is based on a sequence of shellable carrier maps that, starting from a shellable input complex, determine the evolution of the protocol complex: During the first t/k rounds, carrier maps that crash exactly k processes per round are used, ensuring high connectivity of their images. A Sperner's lemma style argument is used to prove that k-set agreement is still impossible by that round. From round t/k+1 up to our lower bound, we employ a novel carrier map that maintains high connectivity. Our proof also provides a strikingly simple lower bound for k-set agreement in synchronous systems with an arbitrary communication network with initial crashes. We express the resulting additional agreement overhead via an appropriately defined radius of the communication graphs. Finally, we prove that the usual input pseudosphere complex for k-set agreement can be replaced by an exponentially smaller input complex based on Kuhn triangulations, which we prove to be also shellable.</description>

      <title>Federated Fine-Tuning of Sparsely-Activated Large Language Models on Resource-Constrained Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19078v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Federated fine-tuning of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based large language models (LLMs) is challenging due to their massive computational requirements and the resource constraints of participants. Existing working attempts to fill this gap through model quantization, computation offloading, or expert pruning. However, they cannot achieve desired performance due to impractical system assumptions and a lack of consideration for MoE-specific characteristics. In this paper, we propose FLUX, a system designed to enable federated fine-tuning of MoE-based LLMs across participants with constrained computing resources (e.g., consumer-grade GPUs), aiming to minimize time-to-accuracy. FLUX introduces three key innovations: (1) quantization-based local profiling to estimate expert activation with minimal overhead, (2) adaptive layer-aware expert merging to reduce resource consumption while preserving accuracy, and (3) dynamic expert role assignment using an exploration-exploitation strategy to balance tuning and non-tuning experts. Extensive experiments on LLaMA-MoE and DeepSeek-MoE with multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that FLUX significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving up to 4.75X speedup in time-to-accuracy.</description>

      <title>Communication-Efficient Distributed Training for Collaborative Flat Optima Recovery in Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20424v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study centralized distributed data parallel training of deep neural networks (DNNs), aiming to improve the trade-off between communication efficiency and model performance of the local gradient methods. To this end, we revisit the flat-minima hypothesis, which suggests that models with better generalization tend to lie in flatter regions of the loss landscape. We introduce a simple, yet effective, sharpness measure, Inverse Mean Valley, and demonstrate its strong correlation with the generalization gap of DNNs. We incorporate an efficient relaxation of this measure into the distributed training objective as a lightweight regularizer that encourages workers to collaboratively seek wide minima. The regularizer exerts a pushing force that counteracts the consensus step pulling the workers together, giving rise to the Distributed Pull-Push Force (DPPF) algorithm. Empirically, we show that DPPF outperforms other communication-efficient approaches and achieves better generalization performance than local gradient methods and synchronous gradient averaging, while maintaining communication efficiency. In addition, our loss landscape visualizations confirm the ability of DPPF to locate flatter minima. On the theoretical side, we show that DPPF guides workers to span flat valleys, with the final valley width governed by the interplay between push and pull strengths, and that its pull-push dynamics is self-stabilizing. We further provide generalization guarantees linked to the valley width and prove convergence in the non-convex setting.</description>

      <title>Robust LLM Training Infrastructure at ByteDance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16293v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The training scale of large language models (LLMs) has reached tens of thousands of GPUs and is still continuously expanding, enabling faster learning of larger models. Accompanying the expansion of the resource scale is the prevalence of failures (CUDA error, NaN values, job hang, etc.), which poses significant challenges to training stability. Any large-scale LLM training infrastructure should strive for minimal training interruption, efficient fault diagnosis, and effective failure tolerance to enable highly efficient continuous training. This paper presents ByteRobust, a large-scale GPU infrastructure management system tailored for robust and stable training of LLMs. It exploits the uniqueness of LLM training process and gives top priorities to detecting and recovering failures in a routine manner. Leveraging parallelisms and characteristics of LLM training, ByteRobust enables high-capacity fault tolerance, prompt fault demarcation, and localization with an effective data-driven approach, comprehensively ensuring continuous and efficient training of LLM tasks.

      <title>Prompt-Aware Scheduling for Low-Latency LLM Serving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03243v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficient scheduling of LLM inference tasks is essential for achieving low latency and high throughput, particularly with the growing use of reasoning-capable LLMs. Traditional strategies like First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS) often suffer from Head-of-Line (HOL) blocking, where long-running tasks delay shorter ones queued behind them. In this paper, we introduce PARS, a prompt-aware LLM task scheduler that improves serving efficiency by approximating shortest-job-first (SJF) scheduling through pairwise ranking with margin ranking loss. PARS focuses on impactful scheduling decisions and is seamlessly integrated into the state-of-the-art LLM serving system vLLM. It effectively predicts response-length-based task ordering, reducing latency with minimal overhead. Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs and real-world inference datasets show that PARS significantly improves performance, including for reasoning workloads. Furthermore, our cross-model evaluations demonstrate that the design generalizes well, enabling effective scheduling even when predictors are trained on different LLMs.</description>

      <title>CAFL-L: Constraint-Aware Federated Learning with Lagrangian Dual Optimization for On-Device Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03298v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Constraint-Aware Federated Learning with Lagrangian Dual Optimization (CAFL-L), a principled extension of FedAvg that explicitly incorporates device-level resource constraints including energy, communication, memory, and thermal budgets. CAFL-L employs Lagrangian dual optimization to dynamically adapt training hyperparameters -- freezing depth, local steps, batch size, and communication compression -- while preserving training stability through token-budget preservation via gradient accumulation. Experiments on a character-level language model demonstrate that CAFL-L achieves superior constraint satisfaction compared to standard FedAvg (reducing memory usage by 20% and communication by 95%) while maintaining competitive validation performance, making it practical for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices.</description>

      <title>SketchGuard: Scaling Byzantine-Robust Decentralized Federated Learning via Sketch-Based Screening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07922v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) enables privacy-preserving collaborative training without centralized servers, but remains vulnerable to Byzantine attacks where malicious clients submit corrupted model updates. Existing Byzantine-robust DFL defenses rely on similarity-based neighbor screening that requires every client to exchange and compare complete high-dimensional model vectors with all neighbors in each training round, creating prohibitive communication and computational costs that prevent deployment at web scale. We propose SketchGuard, a general framework that decouples Byzantine filtering from model aggregation through sketch-based neighbor screening. SketchGuard compresses $d$-dimensional models to $k$-dimensional sketches ($k \ll d$) using Count Sketch for similarity comparisons, then selectively fetches full models only from accepted neighbors, reducing per-round communication complexity from $O(d|N_i|)$ to $O(k|N_i| + d|S_i|)$, where $|N_i|$ is the neighbor count and $|S_i| \le |N_i|$ is the accepted neighbor count. We establish rigorous convergence guarantees in both strongly convex and non-convex settings, proving that Count Sketch compression preserves Byzantine resilience with controlled degradation bounds where approximation errors introduce only a $(1+O(\epsilon))$ factor in the effective threshold parameter. Comprehensive experiments across multiple datasets, network topologies, and attack scenarios demonstrate that SketchGuard maintains identical robustness to state-of-the-art methods while reducing computation time by up to 82% and communication overhead by 50-70% depending on filtering effectiveness, with benefits scaling multiplicatively with model dimensionality and network connectivity. These results establish the viability of sketch-based compression as a fundamental enabler of robust DFL at web scale.</description>
