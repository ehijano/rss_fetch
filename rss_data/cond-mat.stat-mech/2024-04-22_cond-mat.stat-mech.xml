      <title>Stochastic fluctuations and stability in birth-death population dynamics: two-component Langevin equation in path-integral formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the stochastic process of creation and annihilation of particles, i.e., the $A^{n} \rightleftarrows B$ process in which $n$ particles $A$s and one particle $B$ are transformed to each other. Considering the case that the stochastic fluctuations are dependent on the numbers of $A$ and $B$, we apply the Langevin equation for the stochastic time-evolution of the numbers of $A$ and $B$. We analyze the Langevin equation in the path-integral formalism, and show that the new driving force is generated dynamically by the stochastic fluctuations. We present that the generated driving force leads to the nontrivial stable equilibrium state. This equilibrium state is regarded as the new state of order which is induced effectively by stochastic fluctuations. We also discuss that the formation of such equilibrium state requires at least two stochastic variables in the stochastic processes.</description>

      <title>Persistent and anti-Persistent Motion in Bounded and Unbounded Space: Resolution of the First-Passage Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presence of temporal correlations in random movement trajectories is a widespread phenomenon across biological, chemical and physical systems. The ubiquity of persistent and anti-persistent motion in many natural and synthetic systems has led to a large literature on the modelling of temporally correlated movement paths. Despite the substantial body of work, little progress has been made to determine the dynamical properties of various transport related quantities, including the first-passage or first-hitting probability to one or multiple absorbing targets when space is bounded. To bridge this knowledge gap we generalise the renewal theory of first-passage and splitting probabilities to correlated discrete variables. We do so in arbitrary dimensions on a lattice for the so-called correlated or persistent random walk, the one step non-Markovian extension of the simple lattice random walk in bounded and unbounded space. We focus on bounded domains and consider both persistent and anti-persistent motion in hypercubic lattices as well as the hexagonal lattice. The discrete formalism allows us to extend the notion of the first-passage to that of the directional first-passage, whereby the walker must reach the target from a prescribed direction for a hitting event to occur. As an application to spatio-temporal observations of correlated moving cells that may be either repelled or attracted to hard surfaces, we compare the first-passage statistics to a target within a reflecting domain depending on whether an interaction with the reflective interface invokes a reversal of the movement direction or not. With strong persistence we observe multi-modality in the first-passage distribution in the former case, which instead is greatly suppressed in the latter.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Thermodynamics of Micromagnetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the stochastic thermodynamics of micro-magnetic systems. We first formulate the stochastic dynamics of micro-magnetic systems by incorporating noises into Landau-Lifshitz (LL) equation, which describes the irreversible and deterministic dynamics of magnetic moments. The resulting stochastic Landau-Lifshitz (sLL) equation obeys detailed balance, which guarantees that, with the external field fixed, the system converges to thermodynamic equilibrium with vanishing entropy production and with non-vanishing probability current. We then discuss various thermodynamic variables both at the trajectory level and at the ensemble level, and further establish both the first and the second laws of thermodynamics. Finally, we establish fluctuation theorems, and verify them using numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Stochastic thermodynamics of Brownian motion in a flowing fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study stochastic thermodynamics of over-damped Brownian motion in a flowing fluid. Unlike some previous works, we treat the effects of the flow field as a non-conservational driving force acting on the Brownian particle. This allows us to apply the theoretical formalism developed in a recent work for general non-conservative Langevin dynamics. We define heat and work both at the trajectory level and at the ensemble level, and prove the second law of thermodynamics explicitly. The entropy production (EP) is decomposed into a housekeeping part and an excess part, both of which are non-negative at the ensemble level. Fluctuation theorems are derived for the housekeeping work, the excess work, and the total work, which are further verified using numerical simulations. A comparison between our theory and an earlier theory by Speck et. al. is also carried out.</description>

      <title>Residual Entropy of Hexagonal Ice and Cubic Ice: A Transfer Matrix Description</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Residual entropy of ice systems has long been a significant and intriguing issue in condensed matter physics and statistical mechanics. The exact solutions for the residual entropy of realistic three-dimensional ice systems remain unknown. In this study, we focus on two typical realistic ice systems, namely the hexagonal ice (ice Ih) and cubic ice (ice Ic). We present a transfer matrix description of the number of ice-ruled configurations for these two systems. First, a transfer matrix M is constructed for ice Ic, where each element is the number of ice-ruled configurations of a hexagonal monolayer under certain condition. The product of M and its transpose corresponds to a bilayer unit in ice Ih lattice, therefore is exactly a transfer matrix for ice Ih. Making use of this, we simply show that the residual entropy of ice Ih is not less than that of ice Ic in the thermodynamic limit, which was first proved by Onsager in 1960s. Furthermore, we find an alternative transfer matrix M' for ice Ih, which is based on a monolayer periodic unit. Some interesting properties of M, MMT and M' are illustrated, specifically the summation of all elements, the element in the first row and first column, and the trace. Each property is equivalent with the residual entropy of a two-dimensional ice model. Our work rediscovers the relationship between the residual entropies of ice Ih and ice Ic, and provides an effective description for various two-dimensional ice models.</description>

      <title>Current fluctuations in finite-sized one-dimensional non-interacting passive and active systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the problem of effusion of particles initially confined in a finite one-dimensional box of size $L$. We study both passive as well active scenarios, involving non-interacting diffusive particles and run-and-tumble particles, respectively. We derive analytic results for the fluctuations in the number of particles exiting the boundaries of the finite confining box. The statistical properties of this quantity crucially depend on how the system is prepared initially. Two common types of averages employed to understand the impact of initial conditions in stochastic systems are annealed and quenched averages. It is well known that for an infinitely extended system, these different initial conditions produce quantitatively different fluctuations, even in the infinite time limit. We demonstrate explicitly that in finite systems, annealed and quenched fluctuations become equal beyond a system-size dependent timescale, $t \sim L^2$. For diffusing particles, the fluctuations exhibit a $\sqrt{t}$ growth at short times and decay as $1/\sqrt{t}$ for time scales, $t \gg L^2/D$, where $D$ is the diffusion constant. Meanwhile, for run-and-tumble particles, the fluctuations grow linearly at short times and then decay as $1/\sqrt{t}$ for time scales, $t \gg L^2/D_{\text{eff}}$, where $D_{\text{eff}}$ represents the effective diffusive constant for run-and-tumble particles. To study the effect of confinement in detail, we also analyze two different setups (i) with one reflecting boundary and (ii) with both boundaries open.</description>

      <title>Navier-Stokes equations for nearly integrable quantum gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Navier-Stokes equations are paradigmatic equations describing hydrodynamics of an interacting system with microscopic interactions encoded in transport coefficients. In this work we show how the Navier-Stokes equations arise from the microscopic dynamics of nearly integrable $1d$ quantum many-body systems. We build upon the recently developed hydrodynamics of integrable models to study the effective Boltzmann equation with collision integral taking into account the non-integrable interactions. We compute the transport coefficients and find that the resulting Navier-Stokes equations have two regimes, which differ in the viscous properties of the resulting fluid. We illustrate the method by computing the transport coefficients for an experimentally relevant case of coupled 1d cold-atomic gases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Information is everywhere in nature which is very uncertain and unpredictable. But information, in itself, is a very ambiguous term. In this cursory write-up, we attempt to understand the formal meaning of information by quantifying uncertainty and discuss how it naturally appears in two core topics of classical physics -- classical mechanics and statistical mechanics. In the process, we witness how the concepts of the information theory render a unique viewpoint in physics. Except for the presentation of the material, the author claims no originality; however, the responsibility of every inadvertent error lies entirely with the author.</description>

      <title>A Variational Approach to Trap Macromolecules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trapping macromolecules is impoartant for the study of their conformations, interactions, dynamics and kinetic processes. Here, we develop a variational approach which self-consistently introduces a mean force that controls the center-of-mass position and a self-adjustable harmonic potential that counters the center-of-mass fluctuation. The effectiveness and versatility of our approach is verified in three classical yet not fully understood problems in polymer physics: (1) single-chain conformation in the entire solvent regimes, (2) globule-pearl necklace-coil transition of a polyelectrolyte and (3) inter-chain interaction by simultaneously trapping two polymers. The scaling relationships and $\theta$ behaviors are well captured. Conformations with large shape anisotropy appearing in charged polymers are clearly depicted. Our theoretical predictions are in quantitative agreement with experimental results reported in the literature.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Assessment of Probabilistic Cellular Automata Simulations in Microstructure Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The probabilistic cellular automaton (PCA) method is highlighted for its relatively simple numerical algorithm and low computational cost in the simulation of microstructural evolution. In this method, probabilistic state change rules are implemented to compute the evolution of cell states at each time step. The stochastic nature of this simulation method leads to non-repeatable simulation results, introducing inherent uncertainty. In this study, the uncertainty and dispersion in PCA simulations of microstructural evolution were investigated. Hence, the probabilistic transformations of cell states were meticulously considered at each time step, and discrete probability distribution functions (dPDF) were introduced to analyze the frequency distribution of simulation outcomes. To evaluate the performance of the proposed dPDFs, cellular automaton models were developed with various numbers of cells and distribution of transformation probabilities. Multiple iterations of these simulations were conducted, and the validity of the presented distribution functions was assessed through statistical analysis of the simulations outcomes. Comparisons between PCA simulation results and distribution functions demonstrate consistency, emphasizing the predictive capability of the proposed models. Also, the effects of modeling parameters on the uncertainty of simulation results in two and three-dimensional PCA modeling were studied, introducing the coefficient of variation as a measure of dispersion. Results indicate that increasing the number of boundary cells, cellular resolution, and model size reduces uncertainty, enhancing the repeatability of PCA simulation outcomes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distinct from human cognitive processing, deep neural networks trained by backpropagation can be easily fooled by adversarial examples. To design a semantically meaningful representation learning, we discard backpropagation, and instead, propose a local contrastive learning, where the representation for the inputs bearing the same label shrink (akin to boson) in hidden layers, while those of different labels repel (akin to fermion). This layer-wise learning is local in nature, being biological plausible. A statistical mechanics analysis shows that the target fermion-pair-distance is a key parameter. Moreover, the application of this local contrastive learning to MNIST benchmark dataset demonstrates that the adversarial vulnerability of standard perceptron can be greatly mitigated by tuning the target distance, i.e., controlling the geometric separation of prototype manifolds.</description>

      <title>Ergodic and chaotic properties in Tavis-Cummings dimer: quantum and classical limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate two key aspects of quantum systems by using the Tavis-Cummings dimer system as a platform. The first aspect involves unraveling the relationship between the phenomenon of self-trapping (or lack thereof) and integrability (or quantum chaos). Secondly, we uncover {the possibility of} mixed behavior in this quantum system using diagnostics based on random matrix theory and make an in-depth study of classical-quantum correspondence. The setup chosen for the study is precisely suited as it (i) enables a transition from delocalized to self-trapped states and (ii) has a well-defined classical limit, thereby amenable to studies involving classical-quantum conjectures. The obtained classical model in itself has rich chaotic and ergodic properties which were probed via maximal Lyapunov exponents. Furthermore, we present aspects of chaos in the corresponding open quantum system and make connections with non-Hermitian random matrix theory.</description>

      <title>Waiting time statistics for a double quantum dot coupled with an optical cavity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A double quantum dot coupled to an optical cavity is a prototypical example of a non-trivial open quantum system. Recent experimental and theoretical studies show that this system is a candidate for single-photon detection in the microwave domain. This motivates studies that go beyond just the average current, and also take into account the full counting statistics of photon and electron detections. With this in mind, here we provide a detailed analysis of the waiting time statistics of this system within the quantum jump unravelling, which allows us to extract analytical expressions for the success and failure probabilities, as well as for the inter detection times. Furthermore, by comparing single and multi-photon scenarios, we infer a hierarchy of occurrence probabilities for the different events, highlighting the role of photon interference events in the detection probabilities. Our results therefore provide a direct illustration of how waiting time statistics can be used to optimize a timely and relevant metrological task.</description>

      <title>Extract Universal Corner Entanglement Entropy in a Single Quantum Monte Carlo Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The subleading corner logarithmic corrections in entanglement entropy (EE) are crucial for revealing universal characteristics of the quantum critical points (QCPs), but they are challenging to detect. Motivated by recent developments of stable computation of EE in (2+1)D quantum many body systems, we develop a new method for directly measuring the corner contribution in EE with less computational cost. The cornerstone of our approach is to measure the subtracted corner entanglement entropy (SCEE) defined as the difference between the EEs of subregions with the same boundary length for smooth and corner entanglement boundaries in \textit{a single} quantum Monte Carlo simulation. Our improved method inherently eliminates not only the area law term of EE but also the subleading log-corrections arising from Goldstone modes, leaving the universal corner contribution as the leading term of SCEE. Utilizing this advanced approach, we calculate the SCEE of the bilayer Heisenberg model on both square and honeycomb lattices across their (2+1)D O(3) QCPs with different corner opening angles and obtain the accurate values of the corresponding universal corner log-coefficients. These findings will encourage further theoretical investigations in this field.</description>

      <title>Decoherence of a charged Brownian particle in a magnetic field : an analysis of the roles of coupling via position and momentum variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of decoherence plays a key role in our understanding of the transition from the quantum to the classical world. Typically, one considers a system coupled to an external bath which forms a model for an open quantum system. While most of the studies pertain to a position coupling between the system and the environment, some involve a momentum coupling, giving rise to an anomalous diffusive model. Here we have gone beyond existing studies and analysed the quantum Langevin dynamics of a harmonically oscillating charged Brownian particle in the presence of a magnetic field and coupled to an Ohmic heat bath via both position and momentum couplings. The presence of both position and momentum couplings leads to a stronger interaction with the environment, resulting in a faster loss of coherence compared to a situation where only position coupling is present. The rate of decoherence can be tuned by controlling the relative strengths of the position and momentum coupling parameters. In addition, the magnetic field results in the slowing down of the loss of information from the system, irrespective of the nature of coupling between the system and the bath. Our results can be experimentally verified by designing a suitable ion trap setup.</description>

Abstract: Quantum long-range models at zero temperature can be described by fractional Lifshitz field theories, that is, anisotropic models whose actions are short-range in time and long-range in space. In this paper we study the renormalization of fractional Lifshitz field theories with weakly relevant cubic or quartic self-interactions. Their nontrivial infrared fixed points exhibit Lifshitz scale invariance, and we compute the lowest-order corrections to the dynamic critical exponent.</description>

      <title>Cooperativity, information gain, and energy cost during early LTP in dendritic spines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a mutual relationship between information and energy during early phase of LTP induction and maintenance in a large-scale system of mutually coupled dendritic spines, with discrete internal states and probabilistic dynamics, within the framework of nonequilibrium stochastic thermodynamics. In order to analyze this computationally intractable stochastic multidimensional system, we introduce a pair approximation, which allows us to reduce the spine dynamics into a lower dimensional manageable system of closed equations. It is found that the rates of information gain and energy attain their maximal values during an initial period of LTP (i.e. during stimulation), and after that they recover to their baseline low values, as opposed to a memory trace that lasts much longer. This suggests that learning phase is much more energy demanding than the memory phase. We show that positive correlations between neighboring spines increase both a duration of memory trace and energy cost during LTP, but the memory time per invested energy increases dramatically for very strong positive synaptic cooperativity, suggesting a beneficial role of synaptic clustering on memory duration. In contrast, information gain after LTP is the largest for negative correlations, and energy efficiency of that information generally declines with increasing synaptic cooperativity. We also find that dendritic spines can use sparse representations for encoding of long-term information, as both energetic and structural efficiencies of retained information and its lifetime exhibit maxima for low fractions of stimulated synapses during LTP. In general, our stochastic thermodynamics approach provides a unifying framework for studying, from first principles, information encoding and its energy cost during learning and memory in stochastic systems of interacting synapses.</description>

      <title>Optimal frequency for undulatory motion in granular media</title>

Abstract: Sand is a highly dissipative system, where the local spatial arrangements and densities depend strongly on the applied forces, resulting in fluid-like or solid-like behaviour. This makes sand swimming challenging and intriguing, raising questions about the nature of the motion and how to optimize the design of artificial swimmers able to swim in sand. Recent experiments suggest that lateral undulatory motion enables efficient locomotion, with a non-monotonic dependence of the swimming speed on the undulatory frequency and the height of the sediment bed. Here, we propose a quasi-2D granular model, where the effect of the bed height is modeled by a coarse-grained frictional force with the substrate. We show that the optimal frequency coincides with the second vibrational mode of the swimmer and explain the underlying mechanism through a characterization of the rheology of the medium. Potential implications in the design of artificial swimmers are discussed.</description>

Abstract: Microphase separation is common in active biological systems as exemplified by the separation of RNA and DNA-rich phases in the cell nucleus driven by the transcriptional activity of polymerase enzymes acting similarly to amphiphiles in a microemulsion. Here we propose an analytically tractable model of an active microemulsion to investigate how the activity affects its structure and relaxation dynamics. Continuum theory derived from a lattice model exhibits two distinct regimes of the relaxation dynamics and is linked to the broken detailed balance due to intermittent activity of the amphiphiles.</description>

      <title>Colored Stochastic Multiplicative Processes with Additive Noise Unveil a Third-Order PDE, Defying Conventional FPE and Fick-Law Paradigms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Research on stochastic differential equations (SDE) involving both additive and multiplicative noise has been extensive. In situations where the primary process is driven by a multiplicative stochastic process, additive white noise typically represents an intrinsic and unavoidable fast factor, including phenomena like thermal fluctuations, inherent uncertainties in measurement processes, or rapid wind forcing in ocean dynamics. This work focuses on a significant class of such systems, particularly those characterized by linear drift and multiplicative noise, extensively explored in the literature. Conventionally, multiplicative stochastic processes are also treated as white noise in existing studies. However, when considering colored multiplicative noise, the emphasis has been on characterizing the far tails of the probability density function (PDF), regardless of the spectral properties of the noise. In the absence of additive noise and with a general colored multiplicative SDE, standard perturbation approaches lead to a second-order PDE known as the Fokker-Planck Equation (FPE), consistent with Fick's law. This investigation unveils a notable departure from this standard behavior when introducing additive white noise. At the leading order of the stochastic process strength, perturbation approaches yield a \textit{third-order PDE}, irrespective of the white noise intensity. The breakdown of the FPE further signifies the breakdown of Fick's law. Additionally, we derive the explicit solution for the equilibrium PDF corresponding to this third-order PDE Master Equation. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate significant deviations from outcomes derived using the FPE obtained through the application of Fick's law.</description>

      <title>Temporal Entanglement Profiles in Dual-Unitary Clifford Circuits with Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study temporal entanglement in dual-unitary Clifford circuits with probabilistic measurements preserving spatial unitarity. We exactly characterize the temporal entanglement barrier in the measurement-free regime, exhibiting ballistic growth and decay and a volume-law peak. In the presence of measurements, we show that the initial ballistic growth of temporal entanglement with bath size is modified to diffusive, which can be understood through a mapping to a persistent random walk model. The peak value of the temporal entanglement barrier exhibits volume-law scaling for all measurement rates. Additionally, measurements modify the ballistic decay to the ``perfect dephaser limit" with vanishing temporal entanglement to an exponential decay, which we describe through a spatial transfer matrix method. The spatial dynamics is shown to be described by a non-Hermitian hopping model, exhibiting a PT-breaking transition at a critical measurement rate $p=1/2$.</description>

Abstract: Cellular Potts models are broadly applied across developmental biology and cancer research. We overcome limitations of the traditional approach, which reinterprets a modified Metropolis sampling as ad hoc dynamics, by introducing a physical timescale through Poissonian kinetics and by applying principles of stochastic thermodynamics to separate thermal and relaxation effects from athermal noise and nonconservative forces. Our method accurately describes cell-sorting dynamics in mouse-embryo development and identifies the distinct contributions of nonequilibrium processes, e.g. cell growth and active fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Circuit complexity and functionality: a thermodynamic perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05731v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Circuit complexity, defined as the minimum circuit size required for implementing a particular Boolean computation, is a foundational concept in computer science. Determining circuit complexity is believed to be a hard computational problem [1]. Recently, in the context of black holes, circuit complexity has been promoted to a physical property, wherein the growth of complexity is reflected in the time evolution of the Einstein-Rosen bridge (``wormhole'') connecting the two sides of an AdS ``eternal'' black hole [2]. Here we explore another link between complexity and thermodynamics for circuits of given functionality, making the physics-inspired approach relevant to real computational problems, for which functionality is the key element of interest. In particular, our thermodynamic framework provides a new perspective on the obfuscation of programs of arbitrary length -- an important problem in cryptography -- as thermalization through recursive mixing of neighboring sections of a circuit, which can be viewed as the mixing of two containers with ``gases of gates''. This recursive process equilibrates the average complexity and leads to the saturation of the circuit entropy, while preserving functionality of the overall circuit. The thermodynamic arguments hinge on ergodicity in the space of circuits which we conjecture is limited to disconnected ergodic sectors due to fragmentation. The notion of fragmentation has important implications for the problem of circuit obfuscation as it implies that there are circuits with same size and functionality that cannot be connected via local moves. Furthermore, we argue that fragmentation is unavoidable unless the complexity classes NP and coNP coincide, a statement that implies the collapse of the polynomial hierarchy of computational complexity theory to its first level.</description>

Abstract: Optimization of a random processes by restart is a subject of active theoretical research in statistical physics and has long found practical application in computer science. Meanwhile, one of the key issues remains largely unsolved: when should we restart a process whose detailed statistics are unknown to ensure that our intervention will improve performance? Addressing this query here we propose several constructive criteria for the effectiveness of various protocols of non-instantaneous restart in the mean completion time problem and in the success probability problem. Being expressed in terms of a small number of easily estimated statistical characteristics of the original process, these criteria allow informed restart decision based on partial information.</description>

Abstract: Using mode coupling theory the conditions for all allowed dynamical universality classes for the conserved modes in one-dimensional driven systems are presented in closed form as a function of the stationary currents and their derivatives. With a view on the search for the golden ratio universality class the existence of some families of microscopic models is ruled out a priori by using an Onsager-type macroscopic current symmetry. At equal mean densities of the conserved quantities the golden modes can only appear if the currents are antisymmetric under interchange of the conserved densities and if these densities are correlated, but not in the symmetric case where at equal densities one mode is always diffusive and the second may be either Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ), modified KPZ, 3/2-L\'evy, or also diffusive. We also show that the predictions of mode coupling theory for a noisy chain of harmonic oscillators are exact.</description>

      <title>Phase space maximal entropy random walk: Langevin-like ensembles of physical trajectories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01239v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As written by statistician George Box "All models are wrong, but some are useful", standard diffusion derivation or Feynman path ensembles use nonphysical infinite velocity/kinetic energy nowhere differentiable trajectories - what seems wrong, might be only our approximation to simplify mathematics. This article introduces some basic tools to investigate this issue. To consider ensembles of more physical finite velocity trajectories, we can work in $(x,v)$ phase space like in Langevin equation with velocity controlling spatial steps, here also controlled with spatial potential $V(x)$. There are derived and compared 4 approaches to predict stationary probability distributions: using Boltzmann ensemble of steps/points in space (GRW - generic random walk) or in phase space (psGRW), and analogously Boltzmann ensemble of paths in space (MERW - maximal entropy random walk) and in phase space (psMERW), also generalized to L{\'e}vy flights. Path ensembles generally have much stronger Anderson-like localization, MERW has stationary distribution exactly as quantum ground state. Proposed novel MERW in phase space has some slight differences, which might be distinguished experimentally. For example for 1D infinite potential well: $\rho=1$ stationary distribution for step ensemble, $\rho\sim \sin^2$ for path ensemble (as in QM), and $\rho\sim \sin$ for proposed smooth path ensembles - more frequently approaching the barriers due to randomly gained velocity.</description>

Abstract: Totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP) sets the paradigm for one-dimensional driven single file motion. We study a periodic TASEP with two ``road blocks'' or defects of different kinds, one point and another extended, across which particle flows are inhibited. We show how the interplay between particle number conservation and competition between the defects lead to inhomogeneous steady states with localised domain walls (LDW) or static density shocks, whose locations jump discontinuously, indicating a first order transition between these LDW states, as the system passes from being controlled by one defect to the other. When the defects are ``competing'', instead of an LDW a pair of delocalised domain walls are found, none of which can penetrate the extended defect. A minimum current principle can be used to identify the dominant defect that controls the domain wall formations.</description>

Abstract: Universal scaling laws only apply asymptotically near critical phase transitions. We propose a general scheme, based on normal form theory of renormalization group flows, for incorporating corrections to scaling that quantitatively describe the entire neighboring phases. Expanding Onsager's exact solution of the 2D Ising model about the critical point, we identify a special coordinate with radius of convergence covering the entire physical temperature range, $0&lt;T&lt;\infty$. Without an exact solution, we demonstrate that using solely the critical singularity with low- and high-temperature expansions leads to exponentially converging approximations across all temperatures for both the 2D and 3D Ising free energies and the 3D magnetization. We discuss challenges and opportunities for future work.</description>

      <title>Discrete Boltzmann model with split collision for nonequilibrium reactive flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05953v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A multi-relaxation-time discrete Boltzmann model (DBM) with split collision is proposed for both subsonic and supersonic compressible reacting flows, where chemical reactions take place among various components. The physical model is based on a unified set of discrete Boltzmann equations that describes the evolution of each chemical species with adjustable acceleration, specific heat ratio, and Prandtl number. On the righ-hand side of discrete Boltzmann equations, the collision, force, and reaction terms denote the change rates of distribution functions due to self- and cross-collisions, external forces, and chemical reactions, respectively. The source terms can be calculated in three ways, among which the matrix inversion method possesses the highest physical accuracy and computational efficiency. Through Chapman-Enskog analysis, it is proved that the DBM is consistent with the reactive Navier-Stokes equations, Fick's law and Stefan-Maxwell diffusion equation in the hydrodynamic limit. Compared with the one-step-relaxation model, the split collision model offers a detailed and precise measurement of hydrodynamic, thermodynamic, and chemical nonequilibrium effects. Finally, the model is validated by six benchmarks, including multicomponent diffusion, mixture in the force field, Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, flame at constant pressure, opposing chemical reaction, and steady detonation.</description>

Abstract: We study the non-equilibrium dynamics of the dissipative quantum East model via numerical tensor networks. We use matrix product states to represent evolution under quantum-jump unravellings for sizes beyond those accessible to exact diagonalisation. This allows us to demonstrate that dynamical heterogeneity accompanies slow relaxation, in analogy with what is seen in classical glassy systems. Furthermore, using variational matrix product operators we: (i) compute the spectral gap of the Lindbladian, and show that glassiness is enhanced in the presence of weak quantum fluctuations compared to the pure classical case, and (ii) obtain the dynamical large deviations by calculating the leading eigenvector of the tilted Lindbladian, and find clear evidence for a first-order active-inactive dynamical phase transition. We also show how to directly sample the rare quantum trajectories associated to the large deviations.</description>

Abstract: To describe the behavior of Markov models as parameters are varied, I show how to embed the space of Markov models within a Minkowski space. This embedding maintains the inherent distance between different instances of the model. The coordinates of this embedding emerge from the symmetrized Kullback-Leibler divergence and are expressed in terms of thermodynamic quantities, organizing the Minkowski space into equilibrium and nonequilibrium components. With this approach, we can visualize models' behaviors and gain a thermodynamic interpretation of information geometric concepts, even in far-from-equilibrium scenarios. I illustrate this approach using an analytically solvable molecular motor model.</description>

Abstract: Several systems may display an equilibrium condensation transition, where a finite fraction of a conserved quantity is spatially localized. The presence of two conservation laws may induce the emergence of such transition in an out-of-equilibrium setup, where boundaries are attached to two different and subcritical heat baths. We study this phenomenon in a class of stochastic lattice models, where the local energy is a general convex function of the local mass, mass and energy being both globally conserved in the isolated system. We obtain exact results for the nonequilibrium steady state (spatial profiles, mass and energy currents, Onsager coefficients) and we highlight important differences between equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium condensation.</description>

Abstract: We propose a mechanism for reaching pseudorandom quantum states, computationally indistinguishable from Haar random, with shallow log-n depth quantum circuits, where n is the number of qudits. We argue that $\log n$ depth 2-qubit-gate-based generic random quantum circuits that are claimed to provide a lower bound on the speed of information scrambling, cannot produce computationally pseudorandom quantum states. This conclusion is connected with the presence of polynomial (in $n$) tails in the stay probability of short Pauli strings that survive evolution through such shallow circuits. We show, however, that stay-probability-tails can be eliminated and pseudorandom quantum states can be accomplished with shallow $\log n$ depth circuits built from a special universal family of `inflationary' quantum (IQ) gates. We prove that IQ-gates cannot be implemented with 2-qubit gates, but can be realized either as a subset of 2-qudit-gates in $U(d^2)$ with $d\ge 3$ and $d$ prime, or as special 3-qubit gates.</description>

      <title>Bounds on the rates of statistical divergences and mutual information via stochastic thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05597v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Statistical divergences are important tools in data analysis, information theory, and statistical physics, and there exist well known inequalities on their bounds. However, in many circumstances involving temporal evolution, one needs limitations on the rates of such quantities, instead. Here, several general upper bounds on the rates of some f-divergences are derived, valid for any type of stochastic dynamics (both Markovian and non-Markovian), in terms of information-like and/or thermodynamic observables. As special cases, the analytical bounds on the rate of mutual information are obtained. The major role in all those limitations is played by temporal Fisher information, characterizing the speed of global system dynamics, and some of them contain entropy production, suggesting a link with stochastic thermodynamics. Indeed, the derived inequalities can be used for estimation of minimal dissipation and global speed in thermodynamic stochastic systems. Specific applications of these inequalities in physics and neuroscience are given, which include the bounds on the rates of free energy and work in nonequilibrium systems, limits on the speed of information gain in learning synapses, as well as the bounds on the speed of predictive inference and learning rate. Overall, the derived bounds can be applied to any complex network of interacting elements, where predictability and thermodynamics of network dynamics are of prime concern.</description>

      <title>Surface Phase Diagrams from Nested Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.08509v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Studies in atomic-scale modeling of surface phase equilibria often focus on temperatures near zero Kelvin due to the challenges in calculating the free energy of surfaces at finite temperatures. The Bayesian-inference-based nested sampling (NS) algorithm allows for modeling phase equilibria at arbitrary temperatures by directly and efficiently calculating the partition function, whose relationship with free energy is well known. This work extends NS to calculate adsorbate phase diagrams, incorporating all relevant configurational contributions to the free energy. We apply NS to the adsorption of Lennard-Jones (LJ) gas particles on low-index and vicinal LJ solid surfaces and construct the canonical partition function from these recorded energies to calculate ensemble averages of thermodynamic properties, such as the constant-volume heat capacity and order parameters that characterize the structure of adsorbate phases. Key results include determining the nature of phase transitions of adsorbed LJ particles on flat and stepped LJ surfaces, which typically feature an enthalpy-driven condensation at higher temperatures and an entropy-driven reordering process at lower temperatures, and the effect of surface geometry on the presence of triple points in the phase diagrams. Overall, we demonstrate the ability and potential of NS for surface modeling.</description>

      <title>The two upper critical dimensions of the Ising and Potts models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01529v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive the exact actions of the $Q$-state Potts model valid on any graph, first for the spin degrees of freedom, and second for the Fortuin-Kasteleyn clusters. In both cases the field is a traceless $Q$-component scalar field $\Phi^\alpha$. For the Ising model ($Q=2$), the field theory for the spins has upper critical dimension $d_{\rm c}^{\rm spin}=4$, whereas for the clusters it has $d_{\rm c}^{\rm cluster}=6$. As a consequence, the probability for three points to be in the same cluster is not given by mean-field theory for $d$ within $4&lt;d&lt;6$. We estimate the associated universal structure constant as $C=\sqrt{6-d}+ {\cal O}(6-d)^{3/2}$. This shows that some observables in the Ising model have an upper critical dimension of 4, while others have an upper critical dimension of $6$. Combining perturbative results from the $\epsilon=6-d$ expansion with a non-perturbative treatment close to dimension $d=4$ allows us to locate the shape of the critical domain of the Potts model in the whole $(Q,d)$ plane.</description>

      <title>Unveiling chiral states of the XXZ chain: Finite-size scaling as a probe of quantum phase transition in symmetry-enriched $c=1$ conformal field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16660v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the low-energy properties of the one-dimensional spin-1/2 XXZ chain with time-reversal symmetry-breaking pseudo-scalar chiral interaction and propose a phase diagram for the model. In the integrable case of the isotropic Heisenberg model with the chiral interaction, we employ the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz to find ``chiralization", the response of the ground state versus the strength of the pseudo-scalar chiral interaction of a chiral Heisenberg chain. Unlike the magnetization case, the chirality of the ground state remains zero until the transition point corresponding to critical coupling $\alpha_c=2J/\pi$ with $J$ being the antiferromagnetic spin-exchange interaction. The central-charge $c=1$ conformal field theories (CFTs) describe the two phases with zero and finite chirality. We show for this particular case and conjecture more generally for similar phase transitions that the difference between two emergent CFTs with identical central charges lies in the symmetry of their ground state (lightest weight) primary fields, i.e., the two phases are symmetry-enriched CFTs. At finite but small temperatures, the non-chiral Heisenberg phase acquires a finite chirality that scales with the temperature quadratically. We show that the finite-size effect around the transition point probes the transition.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the hidden reaction kinetic network of carbon dioxide in supercritical aqueous solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07019v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dissolution of CO$_2$ in water followed by the subsequent hydrolysis reactions is of great importance to the global carbon cycle, and carbon capture and storage. Despite enormous previous studies, the reactions are still not fully understood at the atomistic scale. Here, we combined ab initio molecular dynamics simulations with Markov state models to elucidate the reaction mechanisms and kinetics of CO$_2$ in supercritical water both in the bulk and nanoconfined states. The integration of unsupervised learning with first-principles data allows us to identify complex reaction coordinates and pathways automatically instead of a priori human speculation. Interestingly, our unbiased modelling found a novel pathway of dissolving CO$_2$(aq) under graphene nanoconfinement, involving the pyrocarbonate anion (C$_2$O$_5^{2-}$(aq)) as an intermediate state. The pyrocarbonate anion was previously hypothesized to have a fleeting existence in water; however our study reveals that it is a crucial reaction intermediate and stable carbon species in the nanoconfined solutions. We even observed the formation of pyrocarbonic acid (H$_2$C$_2$O$_5$(aq)), which was unknown in water. The unexpected appearance of pyrocarbonates is related to the superionic behavior of the confined solutions. We also found that carbonation reactions involve collective proton transfer along transient water wires, which exhibits concerted behavior in the bulk solution but proceeds stepwise under nanoconfinement. Our study highlights the importance of large oxocarbons in aqueous carbon reactions, with great implications for the deep carbon cycle and the sequestration of CO$_2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09551v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider Fokker-Planck equations that interpolate a pair of supersymmetrically related Fokker-Planck equations with constant coefficients. Based on the interesting property of shape-invariance, various one-parameter interpolations of the solutions of the supersymmetric pair of Fokker-Planck systems can be directly constructed.</description>
