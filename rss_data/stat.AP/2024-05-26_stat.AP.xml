      <title>Auditing the Fairness of COVID-19 Forecast Hub Case Prediction Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The COVID-19 Forecast Hub, a repository of COVID-19 forecasts from over 50 independent research groups, is used by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for their official COVID-19 communications. As such, the Forecast Hub is a critical centralized resource to promote transparent decision making. Nevertheless, by focusing exclusively on prediction accuracy, the Forecast Hub fails to evaluate whether the proposed models have similar performance across social determinants that have been known to play a role in the COVID-19 pandemic including race, ethnicity and urbanization level. In this paper, we carry out a comprehensive fairness analysis of the Forecast Hub model predictions and we show statistically significant diverse predictive performance across social determinants, with minority racial and ethnic groups as well as less urbanized areas often associated with higher prediction errors. We hope this work will encourage COVID-19 modelers and the CDC to report fairness metrics together with accuracy, and to reflect on the potential harms of the models on specific social groups and contexts.</description>

      <title>Study on spike-and-wave detection in epileptic signals using t-location-scale distribution and the K-nearest neighbors classifier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pattern classification in electroencephalography (EEG) signals is an important problem in biomedical engineering since it enables the detection of brain activity, particularly the early detection of epileptic seizures. In this paper, we propose a k-nearest neighbors classification for epileptic EEG signals based on a t-location-scale statistical representation to detect spike-and-waves. The proposed approach is demonstrated on a real dataset containing both spike-and-wave events and normal brain function signals, where our performance is evaluated in terms of classification accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian Approach to GRAPPA Parallel FMRI Image Reconstruction Increases SNR and Power of Task Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In fMRI, capturing brain activation during a task is dependent on how quickly k-space arrays are obtained. Acquiring full k-space arrays, which are reconstructed into images using the inverse Fourier transform (IFT), that make up volume images can take a considerable amount of scan time. Under-sampling k-space reduces the acquisition time, but results in aliased, or "folded," images. GeneRalized Autocalibrating Partial Parallel Acquisition (GRAPPA) is a parallel imaging technique that yields full images from subsampled arrays of k-space. GRAPPA uses localized interpolation weights, which are estimated per-scan and fixed over time, to fill in the missing spatial frequencies of the subsampled k-space. Hence, we propose a Bayesian approach to GRAPPA (BGRAPPA) where space measurement uncertainty are assessed from the a priori calibration k-space arrays. The prior information is utilized to estimate the missing spatial frequency values from the posterior distribution and reconstruct into full field-of-view images. Our BGRAPPA technique successfully reconstructed both a simulated and experimental single slice image with less artifacts, reduced noise leading to an increased signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and stronger power of task detection.</description>

      <title>Adaptive probabilistic forecasting of French electricity spot prices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electricity price forecasting (EPF) plays a major role for electricity companies as a fundamental entry for trading decisions or energy management operations. As electricity can not be stored, electricity prices are highly volatile which make EPF a particularly difficult task. This is all the more true when dramatic fortuitous events disrupt the markets. Trading and more generally energy management decisions require risk management tools which are based on probabilistic EPF (PEPF). In this challenging context, we argue in favor of the deployment of highly adaptive black-boxes strategies allowing to turn any forecasts into a robust adaptive predictive interval, such as conformal prediction and online aggregation, as a fundamental last layer of any operational pipeline.
  We propose to investigate a novel data set containing the French electricity spot prices during the turbulent 2020-2021 years, and build a new explanatory feature revealing high predictive power, namely the nuclear availability. Benchmarking state-of-the-art PEPF on this data set highlights the difficulty of choosing a given model, as they all behave very differently in practice, and none of them is reliable. However, we propose an adequate conformalisation, OSSCP-horizon, that improves the performances of PEPF methods, even in the most hazardous period of late 2021. Finally, we emphasize that combining it with online aggregation significantly outperforms any other approaches, and should be the preferred pipeline, as it provides trustworthy probabilistic forecasts.</description>

      <title>Seismic fragility curves fitting revisited: ordinal regression models and their generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research conducts a thorough reevaluation of seismic fragility curves by utilizing ordinal regression models, moving away from the commonly used log-normal distribution function known for its simplicity. It explores the nuanced differences and interrelations among various ordinal regression approaches, including Cumulative, Sequential, and Adjacent Category models, alongside their enhanced versions that incorporate category-specific effects and variance heterogeneity. The study applies these methodologies to empirical bridge damage data from the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake, using both frequentist and Bayesian inference methods, and conducts model diagnostics using surrogate residuals. The analysis covers eleven models, from basic to those with heteroscedastic extensions and category-specific effects. Through rigorous leave-one-out cross-validation, the Sequential model with category-specific effects emerges as the most effective. The findings underscore a notable divergence in damage probability predictions between this model and conventional Cumulative probit models, advocating for a substantial transition towards more adaptable fragility curve modeling techniques that enhance the precision of seismic risk assessments. In conclusion, this research not only readdresses the challenge of fitting seismic fragility curves but also advances methodological standards and expands the scope of seismic fragility analysis. It advocates for ongoing innovation and critical reevaluation of conventional methods to advance the predictive accuracy and applicability of seismic fragility models within the performance-based earthquake engineering domain.</description>

      <title>Improving and Evaluating Machine Learning Methods for Forensic Shoeprint Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a machine learning pipeline for forensic shoeprint pattern matching that improves on the accuracy and generalisability of existing methods. We extract 2D coordinates from shoeprint scans using edge detection and align the two shoeprints with iterative closest point (ICP). We then extract similarity metrics to quantify how well the two prints match and use these metrics to train a random forest that generates a probabilistic measurement of how likely two prints are to have originated from the same outsole. We assess the generalisability of machine learning methods trained on lab shoeprint scans to more realistic crime scene shoeprint data by evaluating the accuracy of our methods on several shoeprint scenarios: partial prints, prints with varying levels of blurriness, prints with different amounts of wear, and prints from different shoe models. We find that models trained on one type of shoeprint yield extremely high levels of accuracy when tested on shoeprint pairs of the same scenario but fail to generalise to other scenarios. We also discover that models trained on a variety of scenarios predict almost as accurately as models trained on specific scenarios.</description>

      <title>A graph-space optimal transport FWI approach based on \kappa-generalized Gaussian distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The statistical basis for conventional full-waveform inversion (FWI) approaches is commonly associated with Gaussian statistics. However, errors are rarely Gaussian in non-linear problems like FWI. In this work, we investigate the portability of a new objective function for FWI applications based on the graph-space optimal transport and $\kappa$-generalized Gaussian probability distribution. In particular, we demonstrate that the proposed objective function is robust in mitigating two critical problems in FWI, which are associated with cycle skipping issues and non-Gaussian errors. The results reveal that our proposal can mitigate the negative influence of cycle-skipping ambiguity and non-Gaussian noises and reduce the computational runtime for computing the transport plan associated with the optimal transport theory.</description>

      <title>On Flexible Inverse Probability of Treatment and Intensity Weighting: Informative Censoring, Variable Inclusion, and Weight Trimming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many observational studies feature irregular longitudinal data, where the observation times are not common across individuals in the study. Further, the observation times may be related to the longitudinal outcome. In this setting, failing to account for the informative observation process may result in biased causal estimates. This can be coupled with other sources of bias, including non-randomized treatment assignments and informative censoring. This paper provides an overview of a flexible weighting method used to adjust for informative observation processes and non-randomized treatment assignments. We investigate the sensitivity of the flexible weighting method to violations of the noninformative censoring assumption, examine variable selection for the observation process weighting model, known as inverse intensity weighting, and look at the impacts of weight trimming for the flexible weighting model. We show that the flexible weighting method is sensitive to violations of the noninformative censoring assumption and show that a previously proposed extension fails under such violations. We also show that variables confounding the observation and outcome processes should always be included in the observation intensity model. Finally, we show that weight trimming should be applied in the flexible weighting model when the treatment assignment process is highly informative and driving the extreme weights. We conclude with an application of the methodology to a real data set to examine the impacts of household water sources on malaria diagnoses.</description>

      <title>Efficient stochastic generators with spherical harmonic transformation for high-resolution global climate simulations from CESM2-LENS2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02216v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Earth system models (ESMs) are fundamental for understanding Earth's complex climate system. However, the computational demands and storage requirements of ESM simulations limit their utility. For the newly published CESM2-LENS2 data, which suffer from this issue, we propose a novel stochastic generator (SG) as a practical complement to the CESM2, capable of rapidly producing emulations closely mirroring training simulations. Our SG leverages the spherical harmonic transformation (SHT) to shift from spatial to spectral domains, enabling efficient low-rank approximations that significantly reduce computational and storage costs. By accounting for axial symmetry and retaining distinct ranks for land and ocean regions, our SG captures intricate non-stationary spatial dependencies. Additionally, a modified Tukey g-and-h (TGH) transformation accommodates non-Gaussianity in high-temporal-resolution data. We apply the proposed SG to generate emulations for surface temperature simulations from the CESM2-LENS2 data across various scales, marking the first attempt of reproducing daily data. These emulations are then meticulously validated against training simulations. This work offers a promising complementary pathway for efficient climate modeling and analysis while overcoming computational and storage limitations.</description>

      <title>The Chained Difference-in-Differences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.01085v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the identification, estimation, and inference of long-term (binary) treatment effect parameters when balanced panel data is not available, or consists of only a subset of the available data. We develop a new estimator: the chained difference-in-differences, which leverages the overlapping structure of many unbalanced panel data sets. This approach consists in aggregating a collection of short-term treatment effects estimated on multiple incomplete panels. Our estimator accommodates (1) multiple time periods, (2) variation in treatment timing, (3) treatment effect heterogeneity, (4) general missing data patterns, and (5) sample selection on observables. We establish the asymptotic properties of the proposed estimator and discuss identification and efficiency gains in comparison to existing methods. Finally, we illustrate its relevance through (i) numerical simulations, and (ii) an application about the effects of an innovation policy in France.</description>

      <title>Non-parametric inference on calibration of predicted risks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.09713v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Moderate calibration, the expected event probability among observations with predicted probability z being equal to z, is a desired property of risk prediction models. Current graphical and numerical techniques for evaluating moderate calibration of risk prediction models are mostly based on smoothing or grouping the data. As well, there is no widely accepted inferential method for the null hypothesis that a model is moderately calibrated. In this work, we discuss recently-developed, and propose novel, methods for the assessment of moderate calibration for binary responses. The methods are based on the limiting distributions of functions of standardized partial sums of prediction errors converging to the corresponding laws of Brownian motion. The novel method relies on well-known properties of the Brownian bridge which enables joint inference on mean and moderate calibration, leading to a unified "bridge" test for detecting miscalibration. Simulation studies indicate that the bridge test is more powerful, often substantially, than the alternative test. As a case study we consider a prediction model for short-term mortality after a heart attack, where we provide suggestions on graphical presentation and the interpretation of results. Moderate calibration can be assessed without requiring arbitrary grouping of data or using methods that require tuning of parameters. An accompanying R package implements this method (see https://github.com/resplab/cumulcalib/).</description>

      <title>Propagating moments in probabilistic graphical models with polynomial regression forms for decision support systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03643v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Probabilistic graphical models are widely used to model complex systems under uncertainty. Traditionally, Gaussian directed graphical models are applied for analysis of large networks with continuous variables as they can provide conditional and marginal distributions in closed form simplifying the inferential task. The Gaussianity and linearity assumptions are often adequate, yet can lead to poor performance when dealing with some practical applications. In this paper, we model each variable in graph G as a polynomial regression of its parents to capture complex relationships between individual variables and with a utility function of polynomial form. We develop a message-passing algorithm to propagate information throughout the network solely using moments which enables the expected utility scores to be calculated exactly. Our propagation method scales up well and enables to perform inference in terms of a finite number of expectations. We illustrate how the proposed methodology works with examples and in an application to decision problems in energy planning and for real-time clinical decision support.</description>

      <title>Social and Economic Impact Analysis of Solar Mini-Grids in Rural Africa: A Cohort Study from Kenya and Nigeria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.02445v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study presents the first comprehensive analysis of the social and economic effects of solar mini-grids in rural African settings, specifically in Kenya and Nigeria. A group of 2,658 household heads and business owners connected to mini-grids over the last five years were interviewed both before and one year after their connection. These interviews focused on changes in gender equality, productivity, health, safety, and economic activity. The results show notable improvements in all areas. Economic activities and productivity increased significantly among the connected households and businesses. The median income of rural Kenyan community members quadrupled. Gender equality also improved, with women gaining more opportunities in decision making and business. Health and safety enhancements were linked to reduced use of hazardous energy sources like kerosene lamps. The introduction of solar mini-grids not only transformed the energy landscape but also led to broad socioeconomic benefits in these rural areas. The research highlights the substantial impact of decentralized renewable energy on the social and economic development of rural African communities. Its findings are crucial for policymakers, development agencies, and stakeholders focused on promoting sustainable energy and development in Africa.</description>
