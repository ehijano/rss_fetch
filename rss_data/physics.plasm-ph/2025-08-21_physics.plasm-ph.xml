      <title>Suppression of two stream instability in relativistic electron-ion plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the suppression of two stream instabilities in electron ion plasmas when the individual species attain relativistic velocities. This suppression of the growth rate of two stream instability is consistent even when the ions form a neutralizing background. It is found that the parameter space of the growth rate reasonably squeezes for relativistic electrons at higher plasma frequencies. We further report the suppression of the growth rate of the said instability as the ion electron mass ratio reaches the realistic limit. Our results have implications for high-energy plasmas, laser-plasma interactions, and relativistic particle beam physics, providing insights into the complex interplay of linear and nonlinear processes governing the two-stream instability. Our unified four-regime analysis extends previous understanding of how realistic mass ratios fundamentally modify relativistic suppression effects, providing essential scaling laws for high-energy plasma applications.</description>

      <title>Excitation of toroidal Alfv\'en eigenmode by energetic particles in DTT and effect of negative triangularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A linear gyrokinetic eigenvalue code is developed to study the stability of toroidal Alfv\'en eigenmode (TAE) in general axisymmetric toroidal geometry, with the self-consistent treatment of energetic particle drive and core plasma Landau damping in a non-perturbative way. The general particle responses of both circulating and trapped particles are incorporated in the calculation by means of the action-angle approach, and, particularly, the finite Larmor radius and orbit width effects of energetic particles are fully taken into account. The ballooning-mode representation is adopted to solve the eigenmode equations in order to reduce the computational resource while obtaining a high resolution of the fine radial structure. Furthermore, the code is able to study the physics of wave-particle interaction in great detail, thanks to the development of systematic theory-based numerical diagnostics, including effective mode structure and phase space resonance structure. As an application of the code, we perform an in-depth study of the triangularity effect on TAE stability based on the reference equilibrium of the Divertor Tokamak Test facility. It is demonstrated that TAE growth rate can be affected by the triangularity through the modifications of geometric couplings, resonance condition, as well as mode frequency and mode structure. As a result, negative triangularity can either stabilize or destabilize the energetic particle driven TAE depending on the dominant mechanism. The relative importance of these mechanisms under different circumstances is systematically analyzed, providing clear physical insights. The overall effect of negative triangularity for a specific tokamak scenario can be assessed based on these studies.</description>

      <title>Phase space transport, quasilinear diffusion and locality in phase velocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14657v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the motion of charged particles subjected to a discrete spectrum of electrostatic waves. We focus on situations when transport dominates, leading to significant variations in particle velocity. Nonetheless, these velocity changes remain finite due to the presence of KAM tori bounding phase space. We analyze the conditions under which transport can be modeled as a diffusion process and evaluate the relevance of the so-called quasilinear value of the diffusion coefficient. We distinguish between traditional quasilinear diffusion, when wave-particle interaction is perturbative, and the so-called chaotic regime of diffusion, when the particle motion looks erratic. In the perturbative regime, we demonstrate both numerically and theoretically that diffusion occurs only when wave-particle interaction is local in phase velocity; that is, when wave contributions from phase velocities far from the particles instantaneous velocities are negligible. Conversely, numerical results indicate that chaotic diffusion can occur even when wave-particle interaction is not local. Furthermore, in regimes when quasilinear diffusion is applicable, we introduce a simple analytical expression for the time evolution of the velocity distribution function, that accounts for phase space boundaries.</description>

      <title>Diagnosing electric and magnetic fields in laser-driven coil targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02326v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Laser-driven capacitor coils are widely used to generate intense magnetic fields for various applications in high-energy-density physics research. Accurate measurement of the magnetic fields is essential but challenging, due to the overlapping contributions from magnetic and electric fields in proton radiography, which is the primary tool diagnosing the field generation around the coils. In this study, we systematically analyze proton radiographs obtained from laser-driven capacitor-coil targets along two orthogonal axes under various electromagnetic field conditions, including magnetic field only, electric field only, and combined electromagnetic fields. By analyzing key features in the radiographs, we distinguish and characterize the respective contributions from magnetic and electric fields. Using detailed simulations validated by experimental benchmarks, methods to isolate and quantify the magnetic field and electric field are given. The methods are successfully applied to determine the electric current and charge distribution in a double coil configuration. Our findings provide insights into improving the diagnostic capability of proton radiography, potentially leading to more accurate measurements of electromagnetic fields and enhancing the utility of laser-driven capacitor coils in high-energy-density experiments.</description>

      <title>Record Magnetic Field Generation by Short-Pulse Laser-Driven Capacitor-Coil Targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02332v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic fields generated by capacitor-coil targets driven by intense short-pulse lasers have been characterized using ultrafast proton radiography. A 1-kJ, 15-ps laser at a center wavelength of 1053 nm irradiated the back plate of the capacitor with an intensity of $\sim$8.3 $\times$ 10$^{18}$ W$/$cm$^{2}$, creating ultra large currents in the connecting coils. High-quality proton data obtained in the axial probing geometry show definitive signatures of magnetic field generation allowing precision measurement of the field distribution and strength. The data show a coil current of 120 $\pm$ 10 kA producing 200 $\pm$ 20 Tesla magnetic fields at the coil center at 1.127 ns afer the laser drive. This sets a record for magnetic field generation by the short-pulse-powered capacitor-coil targets.</description>
