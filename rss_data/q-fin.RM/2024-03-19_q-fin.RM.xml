      <title>Default Resilience and Worst-Case Effects in Financial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we analyze the resilience of a network of banks to joint price fluctuations of the external assets in which they have shared exposures, and evaluate the worst-case effects of the possible default contagion. Indeed, when the prices of certain external assets either decrease or increase, all banks exposed to them experience varying degrees of simultaneous shocks to their balance sheets. These coordinated and structured shocks have the potential to exacerbate the likelihood of defaults. In this context, we introduce first a concept of {default resilience margin}, $\epsilon^*$, i.e., the maximum amplitude of asset prices fluctuations that the network can tolerate without generating defaults. Such threshold value is computed by considering two different measures of price fluctuations, one based on the maximum individual variation of each asset, and the other based on the sum of all the asset's absolute variations. For any price perturbation having amplitude no larger than $\epsilon^*$, the network absorbs the shocks remaining default free. When the perturbation amplitude goes beyond $\epsilon^*$, however, defaults may occur. In this case we find the worst-case systemic loss, that is, the total unpaid debt under the most severe price variation of given magnitude. Computation of both the threshold level $\epsilon^*$ and of the worst-case loss and of a corresponding worst-case asset price scenario, amounts to solving suitable linear programming problems.}</description>

      <title>Improving Fairness in Credit Lending Models using Subgroup Threshold Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In an effort to improve the accuracy of credit lending decisions, many financial intuitions are now using predictions from machine learning models. While such predictions enjoy many advantages, recent research has shown that the predictions have the potential to be biased and unfair towards certain subgroups of the population. To combat this, several techniques have been introduced to help remove the bias and improve the overall fairness of the predictions. We introduce a new fairness technique, called \textit{Subgroup Threshold Optimizer} (\textit{STO}), that does not require any alternations to the input training data nor does it require any changes to the underlying machine learning algorithm, and thus can be used with any existing machine learning pipeline. STO works by optimizing the classification thresholds for individual subgroups in order to minimize the overall discrimination score between them. Our experiments on a real-world credit lending dataset show that STO can reduce gender discrimination by over 90\%.</description>

      <title>On the Relevance and Appropriateness of Name Concentration Risk Adjustments for Portfolios of Multilateral Development Banks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13802v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sovereign loan portfolios of Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs) typically consist of only a small number of borrowers and hence are heavily exposed to single name concentration risk. Based on realistic MDB portfolios constructed from publicly available data, this paper quantifies the magnitude of the exposure to name concentration risk using exact Monte Carlo simulations. In comparing the exact adjustment for name concentration risk to its analytic approximation as currently applied by the major rating agency Standard &amp; Poor's, we further investigate whether current capital adequacy frameworks for MDBs are overly conservative. Finally, we discuss the choice of appropriate model parameters and their impact on measures of name concentration risk.</description>
