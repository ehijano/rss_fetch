      <title>Price-Based Attention and Welfare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To choose between two discrete goods, a consumer pays attention to only those with prices below a threshold. From these, she chooses her most preferred good. We assume consumers in a population have the same preference but may have different thresholds. Similar models of bounded rationality have been studied in the empirical marketing literature. We fully characterize the model, and using observational choice data alone, we identify the welfare implications of a price change. The behavioral content of our model overlaps with an important class of random utility models, but the welfare implications are meaningfully different. The distribution of equivalent variation under our model first-order stochastically dominates that under the random utility model.</description>

      <title>Cross-pollination dynamics of web-based social media: An application of insect-mediated pollen transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a model of cross-pollination among online social media (OSM) websites, where the dynamics of user interactions mimic insect-mediated pollen transfer by pollinators. A pollinator acts as a vehicle enabling users to visit multiple social media sites- akin to visiting different plants in the same field- within a single browsing session. This approach frames geitonogamy in self-incompatible plant species as analogous to the distribution of web traffic across the social media landscape. A theoretical pollinator, allowing users to choose among social media sites multiple times per trip, drives uneven increases in web traffic across platforms, disproportionately benefiting the largest social networks while providing tangible competitive advantages to smaller OSMs. This heterogeneous landscape fosters monopolistic competition among niche platforms, incentivizing smaller sites to promote cross-pollination despite the larger relative gains to their bigger competitors. Our findings underscore the broader value of cross-platform user engagement, highlighting how cross-pollination dynamics can intensify network effects and bolster interconnectivity. Cross pollination via new pass-through apps facilitates the movement of attention, deepening and distributing engagement across multiple destinations. As pass-through apps gain traction, their disproportionate impact on traffic to social media platforms will incentivize social media platforms, large and small, to embrace cross-pollination dynamics.</description>

      <title>A characterization of strategy-proof probabilistic assignment rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the classical probabilistic assignment problem, where finitely many indivisible objects are to be probabilistically or proportionally assigned among an equal number of agents. Each agent has an initial deterministic endowment and a strict preference over the objects. While the deterministic version of this problem is well understood, most notably through the characterization of the Top Trading Cycles (TTC) rule by Ma (1994), much less is known in the probabilistic setting. Motivated by practical considerations, we introduce a weakened incentive requirement, namely SD-top-strategy-proofness, which precludes only those manipulations that increase the probability of an agent's top-ranked object.
  Our first main result shows that, on any free pair at the top (FPT) domain (Sen, 2011), the TTC rule is the unique probabilistic assignment rule satisfying SD-Pareto efficiency, SD-individual rationality, and SD-top-strategy-proofness. We further show that this characterization remains valid when Pareto efficiency is replaced by the weaker notion of SD-pair efficiency, provided the domain satisfies the slightly stronger free triple at the top (FTT) condition (Sen, 2011). Finally, we extend these results to the ex post notions of efficiency and individual rationality.
  Together, our findings generalize the classical deterministic results of Ma (1994) and Ekici (2024) along three dimensions: extending them from deterministic to probabilistic settings, from full strategy-proofness to top-strategy-proofness, and from the unrestricted domain to the more general FPT and FTT domains.</description>

      <title>Comparison of Oracles: Part II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies incomplete-information games in which an information provider, an oracle, publicly discloses information to the players. One oracle is said to dominate another if, in every game, it can replicate the equilibrium outcomes induced by the latter. The companion Part I characterizes dominance under deterministic signaling and under stochastic signaling with a unique common knowledge component. The present paper extends the analysis to general environments and provides a characterization of equivalence (mutual dominance) among oracles. To this end, we develop a theory of information loops, thereby extending the seminal work of Blackwell (1951) to strategic environments and Aumann (1976)'s theory of common knowledge.</description>

      <title>Fraud-Proof Revenue Division on Subscription Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a model of subscription-based platforms where users pay a fixed fee for unlimited access to content, and creators receive a share of the revenue. Existing approaches to detecting fraud predominantly rely on machine learning methods, engaging in an ongoing arms race with bad actors. We explore revenue division mechanisms that inherently disincentivize manipulation. We formalize three types of manipulation-resistance axioms and examine which existing rules satisfy these. We show that a mechanism widely used by streaming platforms, not only fails to prevent fraud, but also makes detecting manipulation computationally intractable. We also introduce a novel rule, ScaledUserProp, that satisfies all three manipulation-resistance axioms. Finally, experiments with both real-world and synthetic streaming data support ScaledUserProp as a fairer alternative compared to existing rules.</description>

      <title>Fisher Meets Lindahl: A Unified Duality Framework for Market Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Fisher market equilibrium for private goods and the Lindahl equilibrium for public goods are classic and fundamental solution concepts for market equilibria. While Fisher market equilibria have been well-studied, the theoretical foundations for Lindahl equilibria remain substantially underdeveloped.
  In this work, we propose a unified duality framework for market equilibria. We show that Lindahl equilibria of a public goods market correspond to Fisher market equilibria in a dual Fisher market with dual utilities, and vice versa. The dual utility is based on the indirect utility, and the correspondence between the two equilibria works by exchanging the roles of allocations and prices.
  Using the duality framework, we address the gaps concerning the computation and dynamics for Lindahl equilibria and obtain new insights and developments for Fisher market equilibria. First, we leverage this duality to analyze welfare properties of Lindahl equilibria. For concave homogeneous utilities, we prove that a Lindahl equilibrium maximizes Nash Social Welfare (NSW). For concave non-homogeneous utilities, we show that a Lindahl equilibrium achieves $(1/e)^{1/e}$ approximation to the optimal NSW, and the approximation ratio is tight. Second, we apply the duality framework to market dynamics, including proportional response dynamics (PRD) and t\^atonnement. We obtain new market dynamics for the Lindahl equilibria from market dynamics in the dual Fisher market. We also use duality to extend PRD to markets with total complements utilities, the dual class of gross substitutes utilities. Finally, we apply the duality framework to markets with chores. We propose a program for private chores for general convex homogeneous disutilities that avoids the "poles" issue, whose KKT points correspond to Fisher market equilibria. We also initiate the study of the Lindahl equilibrium for public chores.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15955v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze incomplete-information games where an oracle publicly shares information with players. One oracle dominates another if, in every game, it can match the set of equilibrium outcomes induced by the latter. Distinct characterizations are provided for deterministic and stochastic signaling functions, based on simultaneous posterior matching, partition refinements, and common knowledge components. This study extends the work of Blackwell (1951) to games, and expands the study of Aumann (1976) on common knowledge, along with the companion Part II, which develops a theory of information loops.</description>
