      <title>Pathways from a chiral superconductor to a composite Fermi liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experiments have reported chiral time-reversal broken superconductivity in $n$-layer rhombohedral graphene for $n = 4,5, 6$. Introducing a moir\'e potential by alignement with a hexagonal boron nitride substrate suppresses the superconductivity but leads instead to various fractional quantum anomalous Hall phenomena. Motivated by these observations, we consider the fate of the phase transition between (a chiral) Landau Fermi liquid (LFL) metal and a Composite Fermi Liquid (CFL) metal in the presence of attractive interactions. These are parent states, respectively, for the superconductor and the fractional quantum Hall states. For weak attractive interactions, the LFL is usually unstable to superconductivity while the CFL is stable. This raises the possibility of a direct continuous phase transition between the chiral superconductor and the CFL. However, we show that generically the LFL close to the transition to the CFL is stable against superconductivity. Thus the evolution between the CFL and chiral superconductor goes through an intermediate stable LFL phase for weak attractive interactions. With stronger interactions, the evolution can instead go through a non-Abelian paired quantum Hall state.</description>

      <title>Spin-basis wavefunctions for the one-dimensional Kitaev model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic phases with quantum entanglement are often expressed in terms of parton wavefunctions. Relatively few examples are known where wavefunctions can be directly written down in the spin basis. In this article, we consider the spin-$S$ Kitaev model in one dimension. For $S=1/2$, its eigenstates can be written using a Jordan-Wigner fermionic representation. Here, we present ground state wavefunctions for any $S$ directly in the spin basis. The states we propose are valence bond arrangements, with bonds having singlet or triplet character for $S=1/2$. For $S&gt;1/2$, we use bond-states that serve as analogues of singlets and triplets. We establish the validity of our wavefunctions using a perturbative approach starting from an anisotropic limit, with key features surviving to all orders in perturbation theory. For half-integer $S$ and periodic boundaries, we have exponential ground state degeneracy. The ground states have topological character, with an even number of `triplets' superposed on a background of `singlets'. For integer $S$, a unique ground state emerges, composed purely of `triplets'. Our spin-basis wavefunctions, while not exact, capture the dominant weight of the ground state(s). We obtain good agreement against exact diagonalization wavefunctions and Jordan-Wigner spectra.</description>

      <title>Low-energy photoexcitation inside the Mott gap in doped Hubbard and t-J ladders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate changes in the optical conductivity of doped Mott insulators by tuning ultrashort pump pulses to target either the Drude or low-energy absorption regions. Using a hole-doped two-leg Hubbard ladder and a four-leg t-J ladders, we calculate the optical conductivity after pump by employing the time-dependent density matrix renormalization group. We find that a monocycle electric field pulse tuned to the Drude absorption reduces the Drude weight, accompanied by a slight enhancement in the mid-infrared (mid-IR) spectral weight. However, this enhancement diminishes as the pulse intensity increases. In contrast, a pump pulse tuned to the mid-IR absorption only affects the Drude weight. This behavior arises because the mid-IR absorption originates from magnetic excitations that do not couple directly to photons. These predictions can be tested experimentally by applying ultrashort low-energy pump pulses to cuprate materials.</description>

      <title>Gapless and ordered phases in spin-1/2 Kitaev-XX-Gamma chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the spin-1/2 Kitaev chain with additional XX and symmetric off-diagonal Gamma interactions. By a combination of Jordan-Wigner transformation and density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) numerical simulations, we obtain the exact solution of the model and map out the phase diagram containing six distinct phases. The four gapped phases display ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic magnetic orders along the (1, 1, 0)- and (1, -1, 0)-spin directions, whereas in the gapless phases, the low energy spectrum consists of two branches of helical Majorana fermions with unequal velocities. Transition lines separating different phases include deconfined quantum critical lines with dynamical critical exponent z = 1 and quadratic critical lines with z = 2. Our work reveals the rich interplay among symmetry, magnetic order, and quantum criticality in the Kitaev-XX-Gamma chain</description>

      <title>From gauging to duality in one-dimensional quantum lattice models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gauging and duality transformations, two of the most useful tools in many-body physics, are shown to be equivalent up to constant depth quantum circuits in the case of one-dimensional quantum lattice models. This is demonstrated by making use of matrix product operators, which provide the lattice representation theory for global (categorical) symmetries as well as a classification of duality transformations. Our construction makes the symmetries of the gauged theory manifest and clarifies how to deal with static background fields when gauging generalised symmetries.</description>

      <title>Predictor-corrector method based on dynamic mode decomposition for tensor-train nonequilibrium Green's function calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nonequilibrium Green's function (NEGF) formalism is a powerful tool to study the nonequilibrium dynamics of correlated lattice systems, but its applicability to realistic system sizes and long timescales is limited by unfavorable memory scaling. While compressed representations, such as the recently introduced quantics tensor train (QTT) format, alleviate the memory bottleneck, the efficiency of QTT-NEGF calculations is hindered by poor initializations and slow or unstable convergence of globally updated self-consistent iterations. Here, we introduce a predictor-corrector solver for QTT-NEGF simulations that combines dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) extrapolation with the recently proposed causality-preserving block-time-stepping updates. The DMD predictor supplies accurate initial guesses that reduce the iteration count of the calculation, while the block-time-stepping correction ensures stable convergence even for long propagation intervals. Applying this method to the Hubbard model on a $32\times 32$ lattice within the nonequilibrium $GW$ approximation, we demonstrate stable propagation up to times of $t_\mathrm{max}=512$ inverse hoppings, surpassing the capabilities of both matrix-based implementations and previous QTT solvers. Our contribution is twofold. (i) We integrate tensor dynamic mode decomposition with the QTT representation, which establishes a general framework that is not limited to NEGFs. (ii) We demonstrate its practical benefits in NEGF simulations, where it enables stable and efficient access to unprecedented timescales at high momentum resolution, thereby advancing controlled studies of long-time dynamics and nonequilibrium steady states in correlated lattice systems.</description>

      <title>Features of the Electronic and Charge States of Monovalent-Doped Manganite Films Probed by Magnetic Circular Dichroism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) spectroscopy in the range of 1.2 - 3.7 eV was studied for La1-xKxMnO3 (x = 0.05 - 0.18) epitaxial films over a wide temperature range. The thin films were grown using a two-step procedure: deposition of LaxMnO3-{\delta} and potassium K+ incorporation into the films via isopiestic annealing. The temperature behavior of the MCD effect in different spectral regions was analyzed alongside the temperature dependences of magnetization, resistivity, and magnetoresistance of the films. It was found that the MCD signal is sensitive not only to the magnetic but also to the charge sublattice of the material. Accordingly, a correlation between the magneto-optical and magnetoresistive responses of the system was identified. These findings underscore the high information content of MCD spectroscopy for investigating the magnetic and magnetotransport properties of strongly correlated magnetic oxides. The ground and excited electronic states in the La1-xKxMnO3 films were identified, and the obtained data were compared with magneto-optical data for divalent - doped and lanthanum-deficient manganite films. Good agreement was observed, indicating the universality of the electronic structure and the shared mechanisms underlying the observed effects in such materials. These results broaden the understanding of the band structure in manganites and provide a solid foundation for its theoretical description.</description>

      <title>Continuum theory for topological phase transitions in exciton systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An effective continuum theory is constructed for the topological phase transition of excitons in quasi-two-dimensional systems. These topological excitons crucially determine the optoelectronic properties, because of their larger binding energies in 2D as well as their topologically enhanced exciton transport. The core idea of this letter is, that the essential physics determining the topological invariants across the phase transition is localized near $N$-fold band-crossing points (BCPs) in the interaction-induced exciton band structure. The construction of the continuum theory around these BCPs needs only the information of exciton states that build up these BCPs at both $\mathbf{Q}=0$ and finite $\mathbf{Q}$ points, and not the numerically challenging solution of the Bethe-Salpeter equation over the full exciton Brillouin zone. This theory applies to systems with and without spin conservation. Our theory is illustrated in two specific examples: the transition metal dichalcogenide twisted bilayer systems and the Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang (BHZ) model. These results offer a promising route toward studying complex systems, such as the room-temperature quantum spin Hall system Bismuthene (Bi/SiC) and other twisted bilayer systems.</description>

      <title>Competing $s$-wave pairing in overdoped $t$-$J$ model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $d$-wave pairing symmetry has long been considered a defining feature of high-temperature superconductivity in cuprates. In this work, we reveal that $s$-wave pairing states exhibit variational energies comparable to the $d$-wave state in a square $t$-$J$ model, particularly at high doping levels ($\delta\gtrsim 15\%$) by using the state-of-the-art tensor network simulation. This surprising result suggests that $s$-wave pairing may play an important role in the cuprate phase diagram, especially for the overdoped region. Our findings provide a potential resolution to discrepancies in recent Josephson tunneling experiments on twisted bilayer cuprates and offer new insights into the evolution of pairing symmetry with doping.</description>

      <title>Quantum Simulation of Fermions in $AdS_2$ Black Hole: Chirality, Entanglement, and Spectral Crossovers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider free Dirac fermions on a discretized $AdS_2$ black hole background, and analyze how curved space redshift, horizons, and the spin connection induced chiral gravitational effect shape spectral, transport, and scrambling phenomena. The system is discretized via staggered fermions followed by the Jordan-Wigner transform to encode the model in qubit degrees of freedom, whose Hamiltonian carries site dependent warp factors and bond chirality terms encoding the redshift and spin connection effects. We calculate the ground state and first excited states energies, their local charge profiles, and their half-chain entanglement entropies, showing how redshift and chirality affect the transition from criticality to a gapped regime. Probing operator growth via out-of-time-order correlators, we find that horizons and the chiral coupling accelerate scrambling, yet remain within a non-chaotic regime. Finally, we map out an integrable to ergodic crossover via level-spacing statistics and Brody fits, and introduce on-site disorder to drive a many body localization transition.</description>

      <title>Thermal reconstruction of chaotic quantum many-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermal states are thermal with respect to a fixed Hamiltonian. How much information about this Hamiltonian can we ``bootstrap'' from the subsystems of a thermal state? We attack the problem by positioning it as a subspecies of the quantum marginal problem. In states that obey the quantum Markov property, the Petz recovery map captures the knowledge of the larger system inherent in a subsystem. We use the conditional mutual information to check the goodness of Petz recovery, analytically in a random-matrix-theory-inspired hopping model and numerically in an Ising-like spin chain model. We observe different behavior in chaotic versus integrable phases of the model: in the chaotic phase, the reconstruction works well at both very low and very high temperatures, with some intermediate critical temperature at which reconstruction works worst, whereas in the integrable phase reconstruction breaks down at low temperatures.</description>

      <title>Critical dynamics and superconducting state preparation in the quenched Kitaev chain with pairing imbalance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamical balance of the pairing term plays a crucial role in the emergence of topological superconductivity in the p-wave spinless Kitaev chain, particularly in the non-Hermitian regime. In this work, we systematically investigate the effects of non-Hermitian pairing terms on both equilibrium and nonequilibrium phenomena in the Kitaev chain. Our analysis focuses on two representative forms of pairing imbalance: uniform and staggered. We demonstrate that a uniform imbalance induces only minor perturbations to the spectrum and dynamical properties, without significantly affecting its equilibrium phase or nonequilibrium steady behavior. In contrast, even a slight staggered imbalance leads to drastic changes. At the symmetry point, it enables the resonant generation of two distinct superconducting states through critical dynamics, with the realized state determined by the direction of the bias. Both states exhibit exact off-diagonal long-range order (ODLRO) in the thermodynamic limit. Our results emphasize the fragility of coherent dynamics in non-Hermitian topological systems and elucidate the interplay among non-Hermiticity, topology, and dynamical criticality in quench processes.</description>

      <title>Smearing of dynamical quantum phase transitions in dissipative free-fermion systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the Lindblad dynamics of the reduced Loschmidt echo (RLE) in dissipative quadratic fermion systems. Focusing on the case of gain and loss dissipation, we derive general conditions for the persistence of nonanalyticities (so-called dynamical quantum phase transitions) in the time evolution of the RLE. We show that nonanalyticities that are present in the corresponding unitary dynamics can survive under purely gain or purely loss processes, but are completely smeared out as soon as both channels are active, even if one is infinitesimally small. These results hold for generic dissipative Gaussian evolutions, and are illustrated explicitly for the quench from the N\'eel state in the tight-binding chain, as well as for the quantum Ising chain. We also show that the subtle interplay between dissipative and unitary dynamics gives rise to a nested lightcone structure in the dynamics of the RLE, even in cases where this structure is not present in the corresponding unitary evolution, due to coherent cancellations in the phase structure of the wavefunction.</description>

      <title>Quantum simulation approach to ultra-weak magnetic anisotropy in a frustrated spin-1/2 antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The intrinsic equivalence between electron spin and qubit offers a natural foundation for quantum simulations of magnetic materials. However, incorporating magnetocrystalline anisotropy (MCA), a key feature of real magnets, remains a major challenge. Here, we develop a quantum simulation framework for MCA in CuSb2O6, a spin-1/2 antiferromagnet with alternating ferromagnetic chains arising from frustrated, anisotropic exchange interactions in a nearly square lattice. The $\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}$ spin network is modeled as a four-qubit square lattice, with four paired ancilla qubits introduced to encode angle-dependent MCA. This two-qubit representation per spin site resolves the limitation that squared Pauli operators yield only the identity, enabling MCA terms to be faithfully embedded into quantum circuits. Using the variational quantum eigensolver, we determine an exceptionally small easy-axis MCA constant, just 0.00022% of the nearest-neighbor exchange interaction, yet sufficient to drive a spin-flop transition with $90^{\circ}$ spin reorientation and strong angular variation in magnetic torque. Beyond this regime, the simulations uncover a half-saturated magnetic phase at ultra-high fields, stabilized by anisotropic next-nearest-neighbor interactions. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of resource-efficient quantum simulations of complex magnetic phenomena in real materials.</description>

Abstract: Magnetic molecules are a class of compounds that is also investigated in view of their magnetocaloric properties. The isothermal entropy change and the adiabatic temperature change are key figures of merit for magnetocaloric performance. Here, we investigate spin systems of realistic molecular structures comprising four spins. In view of possible large spin quantum numbers as for gadolinium we model these spin systems by a combination of Heisenberg and dipolar spin-spin interactions. It turns out that a tetrahedral structure with ferromagnetic exchange interactions yields the best figures of merit.</description>

      <title>Holographic defect CFTs with Dirichlet end-of-the-world branes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a holographic model of defect conformal field theories (DCFTs) with defects of codimension greater than one. Our construction generalizes the AdS/BCFT model by anchoring the end-of-the-world brane on defects at the asymptotic AdS boundary and imposing Dirichlet boundary conditions for the metric on the brane. We compute the defect entropy and defect free energy and show that the defect $\mathcal{C}$-function is always non-negative. We further study holographic defect-localized RG flows triggered by a localized scalar field on the brane and show that the defect $\mathcal{C}$-theorem holds. We also verify that our model reproduces the expected forms of correlation functions in DCFTs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the observation of superconductivity in cubic La3Al single crystal. It shows a metallic behavior at a normal state without observable structural transition and enters the superconducting state below Tc ~ 6.32 K. Detailed characterizations and analysis indicate that cubic La3Al is a bulk type-II BCS superconductor. Moreover, theoretical calculations show that it can host interstitial anionic electrons, which are located at the body center of cubic unit cell, and confirm the electron-phonon coupling as the superconducting mechamism. Thus, cubic La3Al can be regarded as an novel electride superconductor.</description>

      <title>Limitations of detecting structural changes and time-reversal symmetry breaking in scanning tunneling microscopy experiments</title>

Abstract: The family of kagome superconductors $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ ($A$=K, Cs, Rb) is an exciting playground for investigating various density waves, unusual superconductivity and a surprising time-reversal symmetry breaking despite the absence of spin magnetism. The origin of time-reversal symmetry breaking has been of particular interest, and conflicting results have been intensely debated. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) provided crucial evidence by the observation that apparent chirality associated with the 2 $\times$ 2 charge density wave (CDW) may be modified by the direction of magnetic field, a phenomenon observed in select sample areas in some experiments, but not others. Related to this, Xing et al. investigated the effects of magnetic and electric fields on the 2 $\times$ 2 CDW state and the lattice structure of kagome superconductor RbV$_3$Sb$_5$. They report a $\sim$ 1% change in the in-plane lattice constants, concomitant with the CDW intensities modification, controlled by the field direction. This was interpreted as a rare case of piezomagnetism. Here we show how the apparent magnetic field induced lattice and CDW intensity change is a consequence of two independent experimental artifacts: reconfiguration of atoms at the STM tip apex that alter the amplitudes of CDW modulations, and piezo creep, hysteresis, and thermal drift that artificially distort STM topographs. We find no evidence supporting that magnetic field leads to intrinsic changes in the sample, which challenges reported piezomagnetism.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic, magnetic and transport properties of the repulsive Hubbard model on the kagome lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.01048v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over the past decades, magnetic frustration has been under intense debate due to its unusual properties. For instance, frustration in the kagome lattice suppresses long range spin correlations and it is expected to be a candidate for a spin liquid system. Therefore, with the advent of experiments with ultra-cold atoms, the interest for frustrated geometries has increased. Given this, in the present work we investigate the repulsive Hubbard model on the kagome lattice by unbiased quantum Monte Carlo simulations. We examine its thermodynamic properties, as well as the magnetic and transport response of the system at finite temperatures and different values of the repulsive interaction. From these results, we discuss the possible occurrence of adiabatic cooling, a quite important feature in ultra-cold systems, and the presence of a metal-to-insulator transition at a finite interaction strength. Our findings may guide future experiments in ultra-cold fermionic atoms on the kagome lattice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11046v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose two distinct crosscap states for the two-dimensional (2D) Ising field theory. These two crosscap states, identifying Ising spins or dual spins (domain walls) at antipodal points, are shown to be related via the Kramers-Wannier duality transformation. We derive their Majorana free field representations and extend bosonization techniques to calculate correlation functions of the 2D Ising conformal field theory (CFT) with different crosscap boundaries. Away from criticality, we develop a conformal perturbation theory to calculate the Klein bottle entropy (norm-square of the crosscap overlap) as a universal scaling function [Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 151602 (2023)]. For the Ising field theory, our analytical results support the conjectured monotonicity of the Klein bottle entropy under relevant perturbations. The formalism provides a general framework for studying perturbed 2D CFTs on non-orientable manifolds.</description>

      <title>Two-dopant origin of competing stripe and pair formation in Hubbard and $t$-$J$ models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18131v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the physics of the two-dimensional Hubbard model is widely believed to be a key step in achieving a full understanding of high-$T_\mathrm{c}$ cuprate superconductors. In recent years, progress has been made by large-scale numerical simulations at finite doping and, on the other hand, by microscopic theories able to capture the physics of individual charge carriers. In this work, we study single pairs of dopants in a cylindrical system using the density-matrix renormalization group algorithm. We identify two coexisting charge configurations that couple to the spin environment in different ways: A tightly bound configuration featuring (next-)nearest-neighbor pairs and a stripe-like configuration of dopants on opposite sides of the cylinder, accompanied by a spin domain wall. Thus, we establish that the interplay between stripe order and uniform pairing, central to the models' phases at finite doping, has its origin at the single-pair level. By interpolating between the Hubbard and the related $t$-$J$ model, we are able to quantitatively understand discrepancies in the pairing properties of the two models through the three-site hopping term usually omitted from the $t$-$J$ Hamiltonian. This term is closely related to a next-nearest-neighbor tunneling $t'$, which we observe to upset the balance between the competing stripe and pair states on the two-dopant level.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09709v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the interplay between quantum geometry, interactions, and external fields in complex band systems. When Wannier obstructions preclude a description based solely on atomic-like orbitals, this complicates the prediction of electromagnetic responses particularly in the presence of disorder and interactions. In this work, we introduce a generalized Peierls substitution framework based on Lagrange multipliers to enforce the constraints of the Wannier obstruction in the band of interest. Thus we obtain effective descriptions of interactions and disorder in the presence of non-trivial quantum geometry of that band. We apply our approach to examples including the diamagnetic response in flat-band superconductors and delocalization effects in flat-band metals caused by interactions and disorder.</description>

      <title>Laughlin-like states of few atomic excitations in small subwavelength atom arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17014v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Atom arrays with sub-wavelength lattice constant can exhibit fascinating optical properties. For example, the combination of $V$-type level structure and magnetic fields can yield topological band structures, making the neutral atomic excitations behave like charged particles in a magnetic field. Up to now, much of our understanding of these systems (and arrays in general) focuses on the single-excitation regime. Here, we go beyond the single-excitation level to show that such systems can give rise to few-particle Laughlin-like states. In particular, we consider small honeycomb ``flakes,'' where the harmful divergences near the light cone can be smeared out by finite-size effects. By choosing an appropriate value of magnetic field we thereby obtain an energy spectrum and eigenstates resembling those of Landau levels. The native hard-core nature of atomic excitations then gives rise to multi-excitation Laughlin-like states. This phenomenon occurs not only in samples of tens of sites, but also in a minimal nanoring system of only six sites. Next, considering two-particle Laughlin-like states, we show that they can be driven by uniform light, and that correlations of the output light contain identifying fingerprints of these states. We believe that these results are a step towards new paradigms of engineering and understanding strongly-correlated many-body states in atom-light interfaces.</description>

      <title>Missing link between the 2D Quantum Hall problem and 1D quasicrystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01122v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper discusses a connection between two important classes of materials, namely quasicrystals and topological insulators as exemplified by the Quantum Hall problem. It has been remarked that the quasicrystal ``inherits" topological properties from the 2D Quantum Hall model. We show this explicitly by introducing the Fibonacci-Hall model as a link between a 1D quasicrystal and the magnetic problems. We show here how Chern numbers for bands in periodic approximants of quasicrystals can be computed, along with gap labels. The Chern numbers are thus seen as a consequence of a flux parameter $\phi^S$ induced by the geometry of winding in 2D space of the quasicrystal. We show the existence of lines of Lifshitz transitions in the phase space of the model. These are marked by change of Chern number and disappearance of edge states. The proposed extrapolation method can be generalized to higher dimensional 2D and 3D quasicrystals, where higher order Chern numbers could be computed, and related to experimentally measurable transport quantities.</description>

      <title>Emergent Inductance from Chiral Orbital Currents in a Bulk Ferrimagnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05492v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the discovery of a new form of inductance in the bulk ferrimagnet Mn3Si2Te6, which features strong spin-orbit coupling, large magnetic anisotropy, and pronounced magnetoelastic interactions. Below its Curie temperature, Mn3Si2Te6 hosts chiral orbital currents (COC) that circulate within the crystal lattice and give rise to collective electronic behavior [1]. By applying a magnetic field along the hard c axis and driving the system with low-frequency currents, we uncover a giant inductive response up to millihenry scale, originating from first-order reconfigurations of COC domains. These domains act as coherent mesoscopic inductive elements that resist reversal upon current reduction, producing a large electromotive force and sharply increasing voltage. This emergent inductance defies classical models, occurs without superconductivity or engineered nanostructures, and opens a new frontier in orbital-based quantum functionality and device concepts.</description>

      <title>Symmetry- and energy-resolved entanglement dynamics in a disordered Bose-Hubbard model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.14825v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using numerical quantum quenches with the integration of both symmetry and energy resolutions, we comprehensively study the dynamics of symmetry-resolved entanglement in a disordered Bose-Hubbard (dBH) model, concentrating on the two types of inhomogeneous initial states to target the lower- and higher-energy sections of its dynamical phase diagram. (i) Motivated by the recent experiment [A. Lukin et al., Science 364, 256 (2019)] which focused on the lower-energy dynamic behaviors of the dBH chain, we first show that, at low energies, for a thermalizing state, although the second law of thermodynamics prohibits the decrease of the total entropy over time, for part of the channel-resolved entropies, a long-term entropic reduction may arise at weak disorder. (ii) A companion channel-resolved analysis at strong disorder further hints that the priorly observed double-log growth of the number entropy might not directly indicate the breakdown of MBL in spin or fermion chains, providing a refreshing perspective on this major controversy in the community. (iii) From time-evolving the line-shape low-energy product state, we subsequently reveal an abrupt formation of a novel "entropy imbalance pattern" across the different symmetry channels. Intriguingly, this imbalance melts in the strong-disorder limit. We conjecture that the melting of the entropic pattern, together with the freezing of a concurrent particle-density wave, embodies a dual trait inherent to MBL. (iv) Specifically, we find a cluster MBL regime, unique to the Bose statistics, emerging from the higher-energy section. This cluster MBL regime realizable even at weak disorder appears not suffer from the finite-size drift and is distinguished by its absence of the hallmark of MBL - the unbounded growth of the entanglement entropy. Our theoretical predictions are by and large testable via the present experimental facilities.</description>

      <title>Nanoscale defects as probes of time reversal symmetry breaking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14648v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nanoscale defects such as Nitrogen Vacancy (NV) centers can serve as sensitive and non-invasive probes of electromagnetic fields and fluctuations from materials, which in turn can be used to characterize these systems. Here we specifically discuss how NV centers can probe time-reversal symmetry breaking (TRSB) phenomena in low-dimensional conductors. We argue that the difference in relaxation rates $\Gamma_{\pm \hat{z}}$ of NV centers starting from $m = \pm 1$ spin states to the ground state with $m = 0$ directly probes TRSB. The effect arises from the difference in the fluctuation spectrum of left and right-polarized electromagnetic fields emanating from such materials. In the quantum Hall setting, the NV center experiences (nearly zero) large additional contribution to its relaxation due to the presence of the material when its magnetic dipole (anti-) aligns with the external field. More generally, the difference in the relaxation rates is sensitive to the imaginary part of the wave-vector dependent Hall conductivity. We argue that this can be used to determine the Hall viscosity, which can potentially distinguish candidate fractional quantum Hall states and be used to infer the pairing angular momentum in TRSB superconductors. For the latter, we consider specifically the case of TRSB in stacked twisted Bismuth strontium calcium copper oxide (BSCCO) flakes, which have recently been investigated experimentally and are suggested to exhibit TRSB. We show that the average relaxation rate $\left[\Gamma_{+\hat{z}} + \Gamma_{-\hat{z}}\right]$ near such a system exhibits a Hebel-Slichter like enhancement below $T_c$. The difference $\Gamma_{+\hat{z}} - \Gamma_{-\hat{z}}$ also inherits this peak but is only non-zero for $T &lt; T_c$ and only in a chiral d-wave superconductor. We provide concrete estimates for observing this effect.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07837v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new computational framework combining coarse-graining techniques with bootstrap methods to study quantum many-body systems. The method efficiently computes rigorous upper and lower bounds on both zero- and finite-temperature expectation values of any local observables of infinite quantum spin chains. This is achieved by using tensor networks to coarse-grain bootstrap constraints, including positivity, translation invariance, equations of motion, and energy-entropy balance inequalities. Coarse-graining allows access to constraints from significantly larger subsystems than previously possible, yielding substantially tighter bounds compared to earlier methods.</description>

      <title>Optical control of the crystal structure in the bilayer nickelate superconductor La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ via nonlinear phononics</title>

Abstract: Superconductivity in the bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ occurs when the interlayer Ni-O-Ni bond angle becomes straight under pressure, suggesting a strong relationship between the crystal structure and the emergence of superconductivity. In this study, we theoretically propose a way to control the crystal structure of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ toward the tetragonal symmetry via light irradiation instead of pressure using the idea of nonlinear phononics. Here, resonant optical excitation of an infrared-active (IR) lattice vibration induces a nonlinear Raman-mode displacement through the anharmonic phonon-phonon coupling. We calculate the light-induced phonon dynamics on the anharmonic lattice potential determined by first-principles calculation. We find that the interlayer Ni-O-Ni bond angle gets slightly closer to straight when an appropriate IR mode is selectively excited. Our study suggests that light irradiation can be a promising way for structural control of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.</description>

      <title>Generating Generalised Ground-State Ansatzes from Few-Body Examples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00497v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a method that generates ground-state ansatzes for quantum many-body systems which are both analytically tractable and accurate over wide parameter regimes. Our approach leverages a custom symbolic language to construct tensor network states (TNS) via an evolutionary algorithm. This language provides operations that allow the generated TNS to automatically scale with system size. Consequently, we can evaluate ansatz fitness for small systems, which is computationally efficient, while favouring structures that continue to perform well with increasing system size. This ensures that the ansatz captures robust features of the ground state structure. Remarkably, we find analytically tractable ansatzes with a degree of universality, which encode correlations, capture finite-size effects, accurately predict ground-state energies, and offer a good description of critical phenomena. We demonstrate this method on the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model (LMG) and the quantum transverse-field Ising model (TFIM), where the same ansatz was independently generated for both. The simple structure of the ansatz allows us to obtain exact expressions for the expectation values of local observables as well as for correlation functions. In addition, it permits symmetries that are broken in the ansatz to be restored, which provides a systematic means of improving the accuracy of the ansatz.</description>

      <title>Probing metric fluctuations with the spin decoherence of a particle in a quantum simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18351v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exploring potential empirical manifestations of quantum gravity is a challenging pursuit. In this study, we utilise a lattice representation of a (2+1)D massive gravity toy model interacting with Dirac fermions that can support specific spacetime fluctuations. We focus on the evolution of the fermion's spin due to its coupling to spacetime fluctuations. To monitor their dynamics a minimal model is required that comprises two bosonic modes describing spacetime geometry fluctuations coupled with the spin of the fermion. A possible emulation of this system involves encoding spin degrees of freedom in the electronic states of an atom coupled with a bimodal optical cavity that provides the two bosonic modes. The spin exhibits a variety of dynamical behaviours due to its coupling with the fluctuating geometry, with decoherence emerging as a key signature of this interaction. Our proposal introduces a novel approach for modelling the effect of interactions between quantum gravity and matter that can be probed with current technology.</description>
