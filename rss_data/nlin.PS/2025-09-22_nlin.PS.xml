      <title>Fractional Dynamics with Non-Local Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear fractional dynamics with scale invariance in continuous and discrete time approaches are described. We use non-integer-order integro-differential operators that can be interpreted as generalizations of scaling (dilation) differential operator for the case of non-locality. Nonlinear integro-differential equations with Hadamard type operators of non-integer orders with respect to time and periodic sequence of kicks are considered. Exact solutions of these equations are derived without using approximations. Using these solutions for discrete time points, we derive mappings with non-local scaling in time from proposed equations without approximation. Non-local mappings are obtained in general for arbitrary orders of the Hadamard type fractional operators. An example of these mappings with non-local scaling in time is given for arbitrary positive orders of integro-differential equations with kicks. The proposed mappings are independent of the period of kicks at zero initial conditions. The proposed approach can be used to describe the nonlinear fractional dynamics that is characterized by scale invariance.</description>

      <title>Turing Patterns in a Morphogenetic Model with Single Regulatory Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Confirming Turing's theory of morphogens in developmental processes is challenging, and synthetic biology has opened new avenues for testing Turing's predictions. Synthetic mammalian pattern formation has been recently achieved through a reaction-diffusion system based on the short-range activator (Nodal) and the long-range inhibitor (Lefty) topology, where a single function regulates both morphogens. In this paper, we investigate the emergence of Turing patterns in the synthetic Nodal-Lefty system. First, we prove the existence of a global solution and derive conditions for Turing instability through linear stability analysis. Subsequently, we examine the behavior of the system near the bifurcation threshold, employing weakly nonlinear analysis, and using multiple time scales, we derive the amplitude equations for supercritical and subcritical cases. The results demonstrate the ability of the system to support various patterns, with the subcritical Turing instability playing a crucial role in the formation of dissipative structures observed experimentally.</description>

      <title>Defects, parcellation, and renormalized negative diffusivities in non-homogeneous oscillatory media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09264v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spatial non-homogeneities can synchronize clusters of spatially-extended oscillators in different frequency plateaus. Motivated by physiological rhythms, we fully characterize the phase diagram of a Ginzburg-Landau (GL) model with a gradient of frequencies. For large gradients and diffusion, the rest state is stable, and the linear spectrum around it maps onto the non-Hermitian Bloch-Torrey equation. When complex pairs of eigenvalues turn unstable, precursors of plateaus grow, separated by defects where the GL amplitude vanishes. Nonlinear effects either saturate the amplitude of plateaus or lead to a phase-locked state, with saddle-node bifurcations separating the two regimes. In the region of plateaus, we trace the formation of defects to a non-linear renormalization of the diffusivity, and determine the scaling of their number and length vs dynamical parameters.</description>

      <title>Manipulating topological charges via engineering zeros of wave functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07101v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological charges are typically manipulated by managing their energy bands in quantum systems. In this work, we propose a new approach to manipulate the topological charges of systems by engineering density zeros of localized wave excitations in them. We demonstrate via numerical simulation and analytical analysis that the winding number of a toroidal Bose condensate can be well manipulated by engineering the relative velocities between the dark solitons and their backgrounds. The crossing of relative velocities through zero makes a change in winding number by inducing density zeros during acceleration, with the direction of crossing determining whether charge increases or decreases. Possibilities of observing such winding number manipulation are discussed for current experimental settings. This idea may also be to higher dimensions. These results will inspire new pathways in designing topological materials using quantum simulation platforms.</description>

      <title>Oscillating ring ferrodark solitons with breathing nematic core in a homogeneous spinor superfluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13874v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of ring ferrodark solitons (FDSs) in a homogeneous quasi-two-dimensional (2D) ferromagnetic spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). In contrast to the usual expanding dynamics of ring dark solitons in a homogeneous system, the ring FDS radius exhibits self-sustained oscillations accompanied by the nematic tensor breathing at the magnetization-vanishing ring FDS core. When the ring radius greatly exceeds the FDS width, motion is nearly elastic, and we derive the ring-radius equation of motion (EOM) which admits exact solutions. This equation can be recast into a form analogous to the inviscid Rayleigh-Plesset equation governing spherical bubble dynamics in classical fluids, but with anomalous terms. At the ring FDS core, the nematic tensor motion is parameterized by a single parameter that connects the two types of FDSs monotonically. Beyond the hydrodynamics regime, density and spin wave emissions become significant and cause energy loss, shrinking the ring FDS radius oscillation; below a threshold, collapses occur followed by the ring FDS annihilation. In the zero quadratic Zeeman energy limit, the ring radius and eigenvalues of the nematic tensor become stationary, while oscillations of the nematic tensor components, driven by the ring curvature, persist at the core. Excellent agreements are found between analytical predictions and numerical simulations.</description>
