      <title>Diffeomorphism invariance and general covariance: a pedagogical introduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffeomorphism invariance is a feature that gets sometimes highlighted as something with profound implications in the physics of spacetime. Moreover, it is often wrongly associated exclusively with General Relativity. The fact that diffeomorphism invariance and general covariance are used interchangeably does not help. Here, we attempt at clarifying these concepts.</description>

      <title>An indeterminacy-based ontology for quantum theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07197v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I present and defend a new ontology for quantum theories (or "interpretations" of quantum theory) called Generative Quantum Theory (GQT). GQT postulates different sets of features, and the combination of these different features can help generate different quantum theories. Furthermore, this ontology makes quantum indeterminacy and determinacy play an important explanatory role in accounting for when quantum systems whose values of their properties are indeterminate become determinate. The process via which determinate values arise varies between the different quantum theories. Moreover, quantum states represent quantum properties and structures that give rise to determinacy, and each quantum theory specifies a structure with certain features. I will focus on the following quantum theories: GRW, the Many-Worlds Interpretation, single-world relationalist theories such as Relational Quantum Mechanics, Bohmian Mechanics, hybrid classical-quantum theories, and Environmental Determinacy-based (EnD) Quantum Theory. I will argue that GQT should be taken seriously because it provides a series of important benefits that current widely discussed ontologies lack, namely, wavefunction realism and primitive ontology, without some of their costs. For instance, it helps generate quantum theories that are clearly compatible with relativistic causality, such as EnD Quantum Theory. Also, GQT has the benefit of providing new ways to compare and evaluate quantum theories, which may lead to philosophical and scientific progress on these issues.</description>
