      <title>Broadband traveling wave generation using acoustic black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work studies the effectiveness of acoustic black holes to generate broadband non-reflective traveling waves using a single excitation source. This is inspired by similar observations in the basilar membrane of the mammalian inner ear. An aluminum beam is machined to introduce a gradual, asymmetric power-law taper at one of its ends. This tapered termination was then partially covered by viscoelastic tape to enhance the acoustic black hole effect in the system. This setup is then used to validate a model developed based on the Euler-Bernoulli beam theory. Following good agreement between the model and the experimental setup over a broad excitation frequency range (1 kHz to 10 kHz), the model is used to conduct a parametric study investigating the effects of different variables on the system's response. This study revealed the effectiveness of acoustic black holes in sustaining traveling waves over a broad frequency range. By optimizing parameters, such as the power-law order, one can significantly enhance this effect. This is especially noticeable towards the lower-frequency end.</description>

      <title>Long-term behavior of nonlocal reaction-diffusion equation under small random perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the nonlocal reaction-diffusion equation driven by stationary noise, which is a regular approximation to white noise and satisfies certain properties. We show the existence of random attractor for the equation. When stochastic nonlocal reaction-diffusion equation is driven by additive and multiplicative noise, we prove that the solution converges to the corresponding deterministic equation and establish the upper semicontinuity of the attractors as the perturbation parameter \delta and \epsilon both approaches zero.</description>

      <title>Smooth Models of Fibered Partially Hyperbolic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study fibered partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms. We show that as long as certain topological obstructions vanish and as long as homological minimum expansion dominates the distortion on the fibers that a fibered partially hyperbolic system can be homotoped to a fibered partially hyperbolic system with a $C^{\infty}$-center fibering. In addition, we study obstructions to the existence of smooth lifts of Anosov diffeomorphisms to bundles. In particular, we give an example of smooth topologically trivial bundle over a torus, where an Anosov diffeomorphism can lift continuously but not smoothly to the bundle.</description>

      <title>Dimension of Furstenberg measures on $\mathbb{CP}^{1}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\theta$ be a finitely supported probability measure on $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})$, and suppose that the semigroup generated by $\mathcal{G}:=\mathrm{supp}(\theta)$ is strongly irreducible and proximal. Let $\mu$ denote the Furstenberg measure on $\mathbb{CP}^{1}$ associated to $\theta$. Assume further that no generalized circle is fixed by all M\"obius transformations corresponding to elements of $\mathcal{G}$, and that $\mathcal{G}$ satisfies a mild Diophantine condition. Under these assumptions, we prove that $\dim\mu=\min\left\{ 2,h_{\mathrm{RW}}/\left(2\chi\right)\right\} $, where $h_{\mathrm{RW}}$ and $\chi$ denote the random walk entropy and Lyapunov exponent associated to $\theta$, respectively.
  Since our result expresses $\dim\mu$ in terms of the random walk entropy rather than the Furstenberg entropy, and relies only on a mild Diophantine condition as a separation assumption, we are forced to directly confront difficulties arising from the ambient space $\mathbb{CP}^{1}$ having real dimension $2$ rather than $1$. Moreover, our analysis takes place in a projective, contracting-on-average setting. This combination of features introduces significant challenges and requires genuinely new ideas.</description>

      <title>Accessibility and central integrability in the absence of periodic points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a partially hyperbolic diffeomorphism $f: M \to M$ without periodic points on a closed manifold $M$. We prove that $f$ is accessible when $M$ is a 3-manifold with non-virtually-solvable fundamental group $\pi_1(M)$. In the case where $\dim E^c = 1$, we demonstrate that the center bundle $E^c$ is uniquely integrable if $f$ lacks accessibility. Furthermore, we provide a complete characterization of accessibility classes for such systems with one-dimensional center bundles.</description>

      <title>Transitivity in CR-Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A CR-dynamical system is a pair $(X, G)$, where $X$ is a compact metric space and $G$ is a closed relation (CR) on $X$. In this paper, we introduce a new type of transitive point and transitivity in CR-dynamical systems. We develop a new tool called transitivity trees, which we use to determine the relationship between the different types of transitive points.</description>

      <title>Index theory for singular Lagrangian systems and Bessel-type differential operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of the present manuscript is to develop an index theory for singular Lagrangian systems, with a particular focus on the important class of singular operators given by Bessel type differential operators. The main motivation is to address several challenges posed by singular operators, which appear in a wide range of applications: celestial mechanics (for instance, perturbations in planetary motion), oscillatory systems with time dependent forcing, electromagnetism (such as wave equations in nonuniform media), and quantum mechanics (notably certain Schroedinger equations with periodic potentials).
  We pursue two principal objectives. First, we establish a spectral flow formula and a Morse Index Theorem for gap-continuous paths of singular Sturm Liouville operators. By means of these index formulas, we construct a Morse index theory for a broad class of Bessel type differential operators and apply it to a family of asymptotic solutions of the gravitational n body problem.
  Finally, our new index theory provides new insight into a phenomenon first observed by Rellich concerning the spectrum of one-parameter families of Sturm Liouville operators with varying domains.</description>

      <title>Freezing phase transition for the Thue-Morse subshift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On the full shift on two symbols, we consider the potential defined by $V(x) = \frac{1}{n}$ where $n$ denotes the longest common prefix between the infinite word $x$ and an element of the subshift associated to the Thue-Morse substitution. Given a non negative real number $\beta$, the pressure function is $P(\beta):=\sup\left\{h_{\mu}+\beta\int V\,d\mu\right\},$ where the supremum is taken over all shift invariant probabilities $\mu$ on the full shift and $h_{\mu}$ is the Kolmogorov entropy. We prove that there is a freezing phase transition for the potential $V$: For $\beta$ large enough, the pressure $P(\be)$ is equal to zero. Similar results were previously published by Bruin and Leplaideur in \cite{BL2}, \cite{Bruin-Leplaid-13} but their proofs contained significant gaps and required substantial clarification.</description>

      <title>Existence of Exotic rotation domains and Herman rings for quadratic H\'enon maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quadratic H\'enon map is an automorphism of $\C^2$ of the form $h:(x,y)\mapsto (\l^{1/2} (x^2+c)-\l y,x)$. It has a constant Jacobian equal to $\l$ and has two fixed points. If $\lambda$ is on the unit circle (one says $h$ is conservative) these fixed points can be both elliptic or both hyperbolic. In the elliptic case, under an additional Diophantine condition, a simple application of Siegel Theorem shows that $h$ admits quasi-periodic orbits with two frequencies in the neighborhood of its fixed points. Surprisingly, in some hyperbolic cases, Shigehiro Ushiki observed numerically what seems to be quasi-periodic orbits belonging to some ``Exotic rotation domains'' though no Siegel disk is associated to the fixed points. The aim of this paper is to explain and prove the existence of these ``Exotic rotation domains''. Our method also applies to the dissipative case ($|\l|&lt;1$) and allows to prove the existence of attracting Herman rings. The theoretical framework we develop permits to produce numerically these Herman rings that were never observed before.</description>

      <title>Distribution of values at tuples of integer vectors under symplectic forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate lattice-counting problems associated with symplectic forms from the perspective of homogeneous dynamics. In the qualitative direction, we establish an analog of Margulis theorem for symplectic forms, proving density results for tuples of vectors. Quantitatively, we derive a volume formula having a certain growth rate, and use this and Rogers' formulas for a higher rank Siegel transform to obtain the asymptotic formulas of the counting function associated with a generic symplectic form. We further establish primitive and congruent analogs of the generic quantitative result. For the primitive case, we show that the lack of completely explicit higher moment formulas for a primitive higher rank Siegel transform does not obstruct obtaining quantitative statements.</description>

      <title>The pointwise ergodic theorem on finitely additive spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The almost sure convergence of ergodic averages in Birkhoff's pointwise ergodic theorem is known to fail in the finitely additive setting. We introduce a natural reformulation of almost sure convergence suitable for finitely additive measures, which we call finite almost sure convergence. Unlike the classical formulation, finite almost sure convergence only involves measures of finite unions and intersections, making it well adapted to finitely additive spaces. Using this notion, we extend the pointwise ergodic theorem to finitely additive probability spaces. Our proof relies on demonstrating that several quantitative generalizations of the pointwise ergodic theorem remain valid in the finitely additive setting via an extension of the Calder\'on transference principle. The result then follows by exploiting the relationships between quantitative notions of almost sure convergence developed by the author and Powell (c.f. Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. Series B 12 (2025), 974-1019).</description>

Abstract: We investigate a family of $4$-regular graphs constructed to test for the presence of combinatorial structure in a sequence of distinct real numbers. We show that the graphs constructed from the Kronecker sequence can be embedded into the torus, while the graphs constructed from the binary van der Corput sequence can be embedded into the Chamanara surface, in both cases with the possible removal of one edge. These results allude to a general theory of sequence graphs which can be embedded into particular translation surfaces coming from interval exchange transformations.</description>

      <title>Counting the number of $2$-periodic $\mathbb{Z}_{p}$-and $\mathbb{F}_{p}[t]$-points of a discrete dynamical system with applications from arithmetic statistics, VI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this follow-up paper, we again inspect a surprising relationship between the set of $2$-periodic points of a polynomial map $\varphi_{d, c}$ defined by $\varphi_{d, c}(z) = z^d + c$ for all $c, z \in \mathbb{Z}_{p}$ or $c, z \in \mathbb{F}_{p}[t]$ and the coefficient $c$, where $d&gt;2$ is an integer. As before, we again wish to study counting problems that are inspired by advances on $2$-torsion point-counting in arithmetic statistics and $2$-periodic point-counting in arithmetic dynamics. In doing so, we then first prove that for any prime $p\geq 3$ and for any $\ell \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 1}$, the average number of distinct $2$-periodic $p$-adic integral points of any $\varphi_{p^{\ell}, c}$ modulo $p\mathbb{Z}_{p}$ is bounded or zero or unbounded as $c\to \infty$; and then prove that for any prime $p\geq 5$ and for any $\ell\in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 1}$, the average number of distinct $2$-periodic $p$-adic integral points of any $\varphi_{(p-1)^{\ell}, c}$ modulo $p\mathbb{Z}_{p}$ is $1$ or $2$ or $0$ as $c\to \infty$. Motivated by periodic $\mathbb{F}_{p}(t)$-point-counting in arithmetic dynamics, we then also prove that for any prime $p\geq 3$ and for any $\ell \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 1}$, the average number of distinct $2$-periodic points of any $\varphi_{p^{\ell}, c}$ modulo prime $\pi$ is bounded or zero or unbounded as $c$ varies; and then prove that for any prime $p\geq 5$ and for any $\ell \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 1}$, the average number of distinct $2$-periodic points of any $\varphi_{(p-1)^{\ell}, c}$ modulo prime $\pi$ is $1$ or $2$ or $0$ as $c$ varies. Finally, we apply density, field-counting, and Sato-Tate equidistribution results from arithmetic statistics, and then obtain counting and statistical results on irreducible polynomials, number (function) fields, and Artin $L$-functions that arise naturally in our polynomial discrete dynamical settings.</description>

      <title>Regularization Implies balancedness in the deep linear network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use geometric invariant theory (GIT) to study the deep linear network (DLN). The Kempf-Ness theorem is used to establish that the $L^2$ regularizer is minimized on the balanced manifold. This allows us to decompose the training dynamics into two distinct gradient flows: a regularizing flow on fibers and a learning flow on the balanced manifold. We show that the regularizing flow is exactly solvable using the moment map.
  This approach provides a common mathematical framework for balancedness in deep learning and linear systems theory. We use this framework to interpret balancedness in terms of model reduction and Bayesian principles.</description>

Abstract: Let $f$ be a piecewise continuous and monotonic map on the interval with at most finitely many discontinuities and turning points. In this paper we study properties about this class of maps and show its main difference from the continuous case. We define and study the notion of closed structure, which can be seen as an generalization of periodic orbit. We also study the periodic orbits that are away from the discontinuities of $f$, extending the notion of trapped and free orbits.</description>

      <title>Learning Nonholonomic Dynamics with Constraint Discovery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15201v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider learning nonholonomic dynamical systems while discovering the constraints, and describe in detail the case of the rolling disk. A nonholonomic system is a system subject to nonholonomic constraints. Unlike holonomic constraints, nonholonomic constraints do not define a sub-manifold on the configuration space. Therefore, the inverse problem of finding the constraints has to involve the tangent bundle. This paper discusses a general procedure to learn the dynamics of a nonholonomic system through Hamel's formalism, while discovering the system constraint by parameterizing it, given the data set of discrete trajectories on the tangent bundle $TQ$. We prove that there is a local minimum for convergence of the network. We also preserve symmetry of the system by reducing the Lagrangian to the Lie algebra of the selected group.</description>

      <title>Resolvent-Type Data-Driven Learning of Generators for Unknown Continuous-Time Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00923v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A semigroup characterization, or equivalently, a characterization by the generator, is a classical technique used to describe continuous-time nonlinear dynamical systems. In the realm of data-driven learning for an unknown nonlinear system, one must estimate the generator of the semigroup of the system's transfer operators (also known as the semigroup of Koopman operators) based on discrete-time observations and verify convergence to the true generator in an appropriate sense. As the generator encodes essential instantaneous transitional information of the system, challenges arise for some existing methods that rely on accurately estimating the time derivatives of the state with constraints on the observation rate. Recent literature develops a technique that avoids the use of time derivatives by employing the logarithm of a Koopman operator. However, the validity of this method has been demonstrated only within a restrictive function space and requires knowledge of the operator's spectral properties. In this paper, we propose a resolvent-type method for learning the system generator to relax the requirements on the observation frequency and overcome the constraints of taking operator logarithms. We also provide numerical examples to demonstrate its effectiveness in applications of system identification and constructing Lyapunov functions.</description>

      <title>The distribution of the largest digit for parabolic Iterated Function Systems of the interval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18297v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the distribution of the largest digit for a wide class of infinite parabolic Iterated Function Systems (IFSs) of the unit interval. Due to the recurrence to parabolic (neutral) fixed points, the dimension analysis of these systems become more delicate than that of uniformly contracting IFSs. We show that the Hausdorff dimensions of level sets associated with the largest digits are constantly equal to the Hausdorff dimension of the limit set of the IFS. This result is an analogue of Wu and Xu's theorem [Math. Proc. Camb. Phil. Soc. {\bf 146} (2009), 207--212] on the regular continued fraction. Examples of application of our result include the backward (aka minus, or negative) continued fractions, even integer continued fractions, and go beyond. Our main technical tool is a dimension theory for non-uniformly expanding Markov interval maps with infinitely many branches.</description>

      <title>Dynamical spectrum of power-free integers in quadratic number fields and beyond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17736v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Power-free integers and related lattice subsets give rise to interesting dynamical systems. They are revisited from a spectral perspective, in the setting of the Halmos--von Neumann theorem. With respect to the natural patch frequency measure, also known as the Mirsky measure, many of these systems have pure-point dynamical spectrum, but trivial topological point spectrum. We calculate the spectra explicitly, in additive notation, and derive their group structure, both for a large class of $\cB$-free lattice systems in $\RR^d$ and for power-free integers in quadratic number fields. Further, in all cases, the eigenfunctions can be given in closed form, via the Fourier--Bohr coefficients of generic elements and their translates, which form a subset of full Mirsky measure. Based on a simple argument via Kolmogorov's strong law of large numbers, we show how the Fourier--Bohr coefficients also provide the eigenfunctions for the unique measure of maximal entropy, and that we get phase consistency for both measures.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Robustness in Biochemical Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21900v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Living systems maintain stable internal states despite environmental fluctuations. Absolute concentration robustness (ACR) is a striking homeostatic phenomenon in which the steady-state concentration of a species remains invariant despite changes in total supply. Although experimental studies have reported approximate-but not exact-robustness in steady-state concentrations, such behavior has often been attributed to exact ACR motifs perturbed by measurement noise or minor reactions, rather than recognized as a structural property of a network itself. Here, we introduce a previously underappreciated phenomenon, namely asymptotic ACR (aACR): approximate robustness can emerge solely from the network structure, without requiring exact ACR motifs or negligible parameters. We find that aACR is more pervasive than classical ACR, as demonstrated in systems such as the Escherichia coli EnvZ-OmpR osmoregulation system and a futile cycle. Furthermore, we prove that such ubiquity stems solely from network structure without fine-tuning of kinetic parameters. The notion of aACR provides a rigorous and practical tool to analyze robust responses in broad biochemical systems.</description>

      <title>Unique Reconstruction From Mean-Field Measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.00301v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the inverse problem of reconstructing both the structure and dynamics of a network from mean-field measurements, which are linear combinations of node states. This setting arises in applications where only a few aggregated observations are available, making network inference challenging. We focus on the case when the number of mean-field measurements is smaller than the number of nodes. To tackle this ill-posed recovery problem, we propose a framework that combines localized initial perturbations with sparse optimization techniques. We derive sufficient conditions that guarantee the unique reconstruction of the network's adjacency matrix from mean-field data and enable recovery of node states and local governing dynamics. Numerical experiments demonstrate the robustness of our approach across a range of sparsity and connectivity regimes. These results provide theoretical and computational foundations for inferring high-dimensional networked systems from low-dimensional observations.</description>

Abstract: Let $\Gamma &lt; G$ be an arithmetic lattice in a noncompact connected semisimple real algebraic group. For many such $G$ of rank at most $2$, in particular $G = \operatorname{SL}_3(\mathbb R)$, we prove effective equidistribution of large translates of tori in $G/\Gamma$. As an application, we obtain an asymptotic counting formula with a power saving error term for integral $3 \times 3$ matrices with a specified characteristic polynomial. These effectivize celebrated theorems of Eskin-Mozes-Shah.</description>

      <title>Polynomial endomorphisms of $\A^2$ with many periodic curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13873v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove that for a regular polynomial endomorphism of positive degree on $\mathbb{P}^2$, a family of curves containing a Zariski dense set of periodic curves is invariant under some iterate of the endomorphism. The setting is closely related to the Relative Dynamical Manin-Mumford Conjecture, recently proposed by DeMarco and Mavraki, which concerns a parametrized family of endomorphisms and varieties. Our result proves a weaker version of the conjecture where the endomorphism is a regular polynomial endomorphism on $\mathbb{P}^2$ that remains fixed in the family, and the family of curves contains a dense set of periodic curves. This result can also be viewed as a Dynamical Manin-Mumford type statement on the moduli space of divisors, and it proves a special case of the Dynamical Manin-Mumford Conjecture with a stronger assumption.
  Moreover, our result specifically implies a uniform degree stabilization statement for a generic set of curves in a family under the transformation of a regular polynomial endomorphism. We demonstrate that a more general degree stabilization statement for a family of positive dimension subvarieties in $\mathbb{P}^K$ under the transformation of a family of endomorphisms is predicted by the Relative Dynamical Manin-Mumford Conjecture. We then prove that it is true when $K=2$ for families of regular polynomial endomorphisms under certain restrictions on the ramifications at the line at infinity.
  Finally, we demonstrate an application of our result to classify all regular polynomial endomorphisms that admit infinitely many periodic curves of bounded degree.</description>

      <title>Generalized Stochastic Resilience for Early Warning Signals Based on Koopman Operator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19655v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Developing methods for detecting tipping phenomena at an early stage is an important problem in various fields such as ecology, medicine, and economics. A tipping phenomenon is characterized by a rapid transition resulting from the accumulation of small parameter changes and is known to be related to bifurcations of dynamical systems. However, few studies have examined how nonlinear properties near bifurcation points affect early warning signal (EWS) performance. In this study, we apply the Koopman operator, which describes the time evolution of dynamical systems in an infinite-dimensional function space, to generalize stochastic resilience the theoretical basis of EWSs such as variance-based ones. As a result, we develop a novel signal capable of more accurately predicting tipping events by separately isolating stochastic fluctuations induced by noise and contributions from a continuous spectrum emerging immediately above tipping points. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach detects early signs of tipping phenomena more robustly than conventional methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03572v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel framework to analyze symmetry breaking in dynamical systems through the lens of entropy and information transfer. Information transfer quantifies the directional exchange of entropy between observables, allowing us to anticipate the onset of symmetry breaking. For local symmetry breakings, namely, local Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking (SSB) and Dynamical Symmetry Breaking (DSB), we show that as a system loses symmetry, its trajectories exhibit a pronounced slowdown accompanied by an increase in Shannon entropy. This establishes a direct link between symmetry loss, dynamical slowing down, and entropy growth. We also extend the analysis to global symmetry breaking and characterize its associated entropy change. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework using representative examples, showing that information theoretic quantities can serve as reliable precursors and diagnostics of symmetry breaking transitions.</description>

Abstract: The wave equation with energy critical sources and nonlinear damping defined on a 3D bounded domain is considered. It is shown that the resulting dynamical system admits a global attractor. Under the additional assumption of strong monotonicity of the damping at the origin, it is shown that the originally unstable quintic wave is uniformly stabilised to a finite dimensional and smooth set. Moreover, the existence of exponential attractor is established. In order to handle \enquote{energy criticality} of both sources and damping, the methods used depend on enhanced dissipation \cite{Bociu-lasiecka-jde}, energy {\it identity} for weak solutions \cite{Koch-lasiecka}, an adaptation of Ball's method \cite{ball}, and the theory of quasi-stable systems \cite{chueshov-white}.</description>

      <title>A natural decomposition of the Jacobi equation for some classes of $N$-body problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24501v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider several $N$-body problems. The main result is a very simple and natural criterion for decoupling the Jacobi equation for some classes of them. If $E$ is a Euclidean space, and the potential function $U(x)$ for the $N$-body problem is a $C^2$ function defined in an open subset of $E^N$, then the Jacobi equation along a given motion $x(t)$ writes $\ddot J=HU_x(J)$, where the endomorphism $HU_x$ of $E^N$ represents the second derivative of the potential with respect to the mass inner product.
  Our splitting in particular applies to the case of homographic motions by central configurations. It allows then to deduce the well known Meyer-Schmidt decomposition for the linearization of the Euler-Lagrange flow in the phase space, formulated twenty years ago to study the relative equilibria of the planar $N$-body problem. However, our decomposition principle applies in many other classes of $N$-body problems, for instance to the case of isosceles three body problem, in which Sitnikov proved the existence of oscillatory motions.
  As a first concrete application, for the classical three-body problem we give a simple and short proof of a theorem of Y. Ou, ensuring that if the masses verify $\mu=(m_1+m_2+m_3)^2/(m_1m_2+m_2m_3+m_1m_3)&lt;27/8$ then the elliptic Lagrange solutions are linearly unstable for any value of the excentricity.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we study the connectedness of the fibers of integrable systems that have only non-degenerate singular points and extend complexity one $T$-spaces with proper moment maps. Our main result states that if there are no tall singular points with a hyperbolic block and connected $T$-stabilizer, then each fiber is connected. Moreover, we prove that the above condition is necessary if either some reduced space is simply connected or the moment map for the integrable system is generic in a natural sense.</description>

      <title>Convergence of Random Batch Method with replacement for interacting particle systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19315v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Random Batch Method (RBM) proposed in [Jin et al. J Comput Phys, 2020] is an efficient algorithm for simulating interacting particle systems (IPS). In this paper, we investigate the Random Batch Method with replacement (RBM-r), which is the same as the kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) method for the pairwise interacting particle system of size $N$. In the RBM-r algorithm, one randomly picks a small batch of size $p \ll N$, and only the particles in the picked batch interact among each other within the batch for a short time, where the weak interaction (of strength $\frac{1}{N-1}$) in the original system is replaced by a strong interaction (of strength $\frac{1}{p-1}$). Then one repeats this pick-interact process. This KMC algorithm dramatically reduces the computational cost from $O(N^2)$ to $O(pN)$ per time step, and provides an unbiased approximation of the original force/velocity field of the interacting particle system. We give a rigorous proof of this approximation with an explicit convergence rate. In detail, we show that the Wasserstein-2 distance between first marginal distributions of IPS and RBM-r has an $O(\kappa^{1/4})$ upper bound, where $\kappa$ is the time step for choosing the random batch and the bound is independent of $N$. An improved $O(\kappa^{1/2})$ rate is also obtained when there is no diffusion in the system. Notably, the techniques in our analysis can potentially be applied to study KMC for other systems, including the stochastic Ising spin system.</description>

Abstract: We determine the minimum dilatation $\delta_n$ among pseudo-Anosov braids with $n$ strands, for large enough values of $n$. These are the dilatations attained by the examples of Hironaka-Kin and Venzke, and they satisfy $\lim_{n \to \infty} \delta_n^n = (2+\sqrt{3})^2 \approx 13.928$. Together with previous work, this result confirms conjectures by Kin-Takasawa and Venzke, and solves the minimum dilatation problem on the $n$-punctured sphere, for all but $6$ values of $n$.</description>
