      <title>Development and validation of a high-fidelity full-spectrum Monte Carlo model for the Swiss airborne gamma-ray spectrometry system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Airborne Gamma-Ray Spectrometry (AGRS) is a critical tool for radiological emergency response, enabling the rapid identification and quantification of hazardous terrestrial radionuclides over large areas. However, existing calibration methods are inherently limited to only a few gamma-ray sources, excluding most gamma-ray emitting radionuclides released in severe nuclear accidents and nuclear weapon detonations, which in turn compromise effective response and accurate risk assessments in such incidents. Here, we present a high-fidelity Monte Carlo model that overcomes these limitations, offering full-spectrum calibration of any gamma-ray source. Unlike previous approaches, our model integrates a detailed mass model of the entire aircraft and a calibrated non-proportional scintillation model, enabling accurate event-by-event prediction of the spectrometer's scintillation response to arbitrarily complex gamma-ray fields. Through a series of validation measurements in near-, mid-, and far-field scenarios, we show that the developed model not only effectively addresses the large deficiencies of previous approaches, but also achieves the accuracy and precision required to supersede traditional empirical calibration methods. These results mark a major advancement in AGRS. The developed methodology not only allows for the quantification of any gamma-ray source, but also reduces calibration time and costs, minimizes reliance on high-intensity calibration sources, and eliminates the generation of related radioactive waste. In addition, these advancements offer promising new capabilities for AGRS applications beyond emergency response, including the quantification of the cosmic-ray induced gamma-ray flux in the atmosphere and probing trace-level airborne radionuclides.</description>

      <title>End-to-End Detector Optimization with Diffusion models: A Case Study in Sampling Calorimeters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning have opened new avenues for optimizing detector designs in high-energy physics, where the complex interplay of geometry, materials, and physics processes has traditionally posed a significant challenge. In this work, we introduce the $\textit{end-to-end}$ optimization framework AIDO that leverages a diffusion model as a surrogate for the full simulation and reconstruction chain, enabling gradient-based design exploration in both continuous and discrete parameter spaces. Although this framework is applicable to a broad range of detectors, we illustrate its power using the specific example of a sampling calorimeter, focusing on charged pions and photons as representative incident particles. Our results demonstrate that the diffusion model effectively captures critical performance metrics for calorimeter design, guiding the automatic search for layer arrangement and material composition that aligns with known calorimeter principles. The success of this proof-of-concept study provides a foundation for future applications of end-to-end optimization to more complex detector systems, offering a promising path toward systematically exploring the vast design space in next-generation experiments.</description>

      <title>Measured gain suppression in FBK LGADs with different active thicknesses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the gain suppression mechanism has been studied for large localized charge deposits in Low-Gain Avalanche Detectors (LGADs). LGADs are a thin silicon detector with a highly doped gain layer that provides moderate internal signal amplification. Using the CENPA Tandem accelerator at the University of Washington, the response of LGADs with different thicknesses to MeV-range energy deposits from a proton beam were studied. Three LGAD prototypes of 50~$\mu$m, 100~$\mu$m, 150~$\mu$m were characterized. The devices' gain was determined as a function of bias voltage, incidence beam angle, and proton energy. This study was conducted in the scope of the PIONEER experiment, an experiment proposed at the Paul Scherrer Institute to perform high-precision measurements of rare pion decays. LGADs are considered for the active target (ATAR) and energy linearity is an important property for particle ID capabilities.</description>

      <title>Signal shape studies and rate dependence of HFO-based gas mixtures in RPC detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The RPCs employed at the LHC experiments are currently operated in avalanche mode, with a mixture containing a large fraction of C$_{2}$H$_{2}$F$_{4}$ ($\approx$90\% or more) with the addition of i-C$_{4}$H$_{10}$ and SF$_{6}$ in different concentrations. However, C$_{2}$H$_{2}$F$_{4}$ and SF$_{6}$ are fluorinated greenhouse gases (F-gases) with Global Warming Potential (GWP) of $\approx$1400 and $\approx$22800, respectively. EU regulations imposed a progressive phase-down of C$_{2}$H$_{2}$F$_{4}$ production and consumption, aiming at strongly reducing its emission. This is already resulting in an increase of its price and reduction in availability.
  The most desirable long-term solution to this problem is to find an alternative, F-gases-free gas mixture, able to maintain similar detector performance. To address this challenge, the RPC ECOGasas@GIF++ collaboration (including RPC experts of ALICE, ATLAS, CMS, SHiP/LHCb, and the CERN EP-DT group) was created in 2019. The collaboration is currently studying a gas from the olefine family, the C$_{3}$H$_{2}$F$_{4}$ (or simply HFO, with GWP $\approx$6), to be used, in combination with CO$_{2}$, as a substitute for C$_{2}$H$_{2}$F$_{4}$.
  This contribution will focus on the signal shape studies that have been carried out by the collaboration during dedicated beam test periods. The methodology used in the data analysis will be presented, together with the results obtained with several HFO-based gas mixtures, and with the currently employed one. Furthermore, results on the counting-rate dependence of the RPC performance, obtained by combining the muon beam with the GIF++ $^{137}$Cs source with different attenuation factors, will also be presented.</description>

      <title>Characterization of CMOS sensor using X-ray irradiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in particle physics demand pixel detectors that can withstand increased luminosity in the future collider experiments. In response, MALTA, a novel monolithic active pixel detector, has been developed with a cutting-edge readout architecture. This new class of monolithic pixel detectors is found to have exceptional radiation tolerance, superior hit rates, higher resolution and precise timing resolution, making them ideally suited for experiments at the LHC. To optimize the performance of these sensors before their deployment in actual detectors, comprehensive electrical characterization has been conducted. This study also includes comparative DAC analyses among sensors of varying thicknesses, providing crucial insights for performance enhancement. For the further understanding of the effect of radiation, the sensors are being exposed to different fluence using high intensity X-ray source.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a novel shot-to-shot acquisition method for optical pump - keV electron energy probe in ultrafast scattering experiments. We integrate a phase-locked acquisition scheme at a repetition rate of 20kHz in a conventional ultrafast electron diffraction (UED) setup. We proceed to a full characterization of the noise level in different configurations and of the temporal resolution as a function of electron flux. The shot-to-shot acquisition improves the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by one order of magnitude in a low perturbation regime.</description>

      <title>Cryogenic Thermal Modeling of Microwave High Density Signaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconducting quantum computers require microwave control lines running from room temperature to the mixing chamber of a dilution refrigerator. Adding more lines without preliminary thermal modeling to make predictions risks overwhelming the cooling power at each thermal stage. In this paper, we investigate the thermal load of SC-086/50-SCN-CN semi-rigid coaxial cable, which is commonly used for the control and readout lines of a superconducting quantum computer, as we increase the number of lines to a quantum processor. We investigate the makeup of the coaxial cables, verify the materials and dimensions, and experimentally measure the total thermal conductivity of a single cable as a function of the temperature from cryogenic to room temperature values. We also measure the cryogenic DC electrical resistance of the inner conductor as a function of temperature, allowing for the calculation of active thermal loads due to Ohmic heating. Fitting this data produces a numerical thermal conductivity function used to calculate the static heat loads due to thermal transfer within the wires resulting from a temperature gradient. The resistivity data is used to calculate active heat loads, and we use these fits in a cryogenic model of a superconducting quantum processor in a typical Bluefors XLD1000-SL dilution refrigerator, investigating how the thermal load increases with processor sizes ranging from 100 to 225 qubits. We conclude that the theoretical upper limit of the described architecture is approximately 200 qubits. However, including an engineering margin in the cooling power and the available space for microwave readout circuitry at the mixing chamber, the practical limit will be approximately 140 qubits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The camera of the Large-Sized Telescopes (LSTs) of the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) consists of 1855 pixels that are grouped into 265 high-performance photomultiplier tube (PMT) modules. Each module comprises a seven-light-guide plate, seven PMT units, a slow control board, and a readout board with a trigger board. %In this paper we describe The requirements for the PMT modules include various aspects, such as photon detection efficiency, dynamic range, buffer depth, and test pulse functionality. We have developed a high-performance PMT module that fulfills all these requirements. Mass-production and quality control (QC) of modules for all four LSTs of the northern CTAO have been completed. Here we report on the technical details of each element of the module and its performance, together with the methods and results of QC measurements.</description>

      <title>A plug-and-play solution for characterizing two-way optical frequency transfer over free-space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical clock networks connected by phase-coherent links offer significant potential for advancing fundamental research and diverse scientific applications. Free-space optical frequency transfer extends fiber-based connectivity to remote areas and holds the potential for global coverage via satellite links. Here we present a compact and robust portable, rack-integrated two-way free-space link characterization system. Equipped with plug-and-play capabilities, the system enables straightforward interfacing with various optical systems and facilitates quick deployment for field experiments. In this work, we achieve a fractional frequency instability of $2.0 \times 10^{-19}$ for an averaging time of 10 s over a 3.4 km horizontal fully folded intra-city free-space link. Moreover, the system maintains an uptime of $94\%$ over 15 hours, illustrating its reliability and effectiveness for high-precision optical frequency comparisons over free-space.</description>

      <title>Cryogenic operation of silicon photomultiplier arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The LHCb experiment at CERN has been upgraded for the Run 3 operation of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). A new concept of tracking detector based on Scintillating Fibres (SciFi) read out with multichannel silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) was installed during its upgrade. One of the main challenges the SciFi tracker will face during the Run 4 operation of the LHC is the higher radiation environment due to fast neutrons, where the SiPMs are located. To cope with the increase in radiation, cryogenic cooling with liquid nitrogen is being investigated as a possible solution to mitigate the performance degradation of the SiPMs induced by radiation damage. Thus, a detailed performance study of different layouts of SiPM arrays produced by Fondazione Bruno Kessler (FBK) and Hamamatsu Photonics K.K. is being carried out. These SiPMs have been designed to operate at cryogenic temperatures. Several SiPMs have been tested in a dedicated cryogenic setup down to 100 K. Key performance parameters such as breakdown voltage, dark count rate, photon detection efficiency, gain and direct cross-talk are characterized as a function of the temperature. The main results of this study are going to be presented here.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of FPGA and GPU Performance for Machine Learning-Based Track Reconstruction at LHCb</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In high-energy physics, the increasing luminosity and detector granularity at the Large Hadron Collider are driving the need for more efficient data processing solutions. Machine Learning has emerged as a promising tool for reconstructing charged particle tracks, due to its potentially linear computational scaling with detector hits. The recent implementation of a graph neural network-based track reconstruction pipeline in the first level trigger of the LHCb experiment on GPUs serves as a platform for comparative studies between computational architectures in the context of high-energy physics. This paper presents a novel comparison of the throughput of ML model inference between FPGAs and GPUs, focusing on the first step of the track reconstruction pipeline$\unicode{x2013}$an implementation of a multilayer perceptron. Using HLS4ML for FPGA deployment, we benchmark its performance against the GPU implementation and demonstrate the potential of FPGAs for high-throughput, low-latency inference without the need for an expertise in FPGA development and while consuming significantly less power.</description>

      <title>Gamma Ray Detection Efficiency of GAGG Crystal Scintillator Using Three Tagged Gamma Ray Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04659v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A CubeSat with a prototype scintillating detector with a sensitive volume of GAGG crystal is being developed with a possible launch date of 2025. Its purpose is to characterize the background signals that mimic the neutrino interaction that the nuSOL (Neutrino Solar Orbiting Laboratory) team is looking for. An important part of the characterization of the backgrounds and the expected real signal is understanding the gamma ray detection efficiency of the prototype detector when compared to simulations performed in Geant4. To this end we have used three techniques to do a measurement of the gamma ray efficiency compared to simulation. The first is using electron capture sources that emit an X-ray before prompt emission of a de-excitation gamma ray, specifically Zn-65 and Mn-54. The second is using a beta + decay source wherein a positron annihilates on an atomic shell electron producing two back-to-back 511 keV gammas followed promptly by a de-excitation gamma, specifically Na-22. The third is using a gamma cascade of two near-simultaneous de-excitation gammas from the same nucleus, specifically from Co-60 decay.</description>

Abstract: Plastic scintillators are widely used for the detection of elementary particles, and 3D reconstruction of particle tracks is achieved by segmenting the detector into 3D granular structures. In this study, we present a novel prototype fabricated by additive manufacturing, consisting of a 5 x 5 x 5 array of 1 cm3 plastic scintillator cubes, each optically isolated. This innovative approach eliminates the need to construct complex monolithic geometries in a single operation and gets rid of the traditional time-consuming manufacturing and assembling processes. The prototype underwent performance characterization during a beam test at CERN's Proton-Synchrotron facility. Light yield, optical crosstalk, and light response uniformity, were evaluated. The prototype demonstrated a consistent light yield of approximately 27 photoelectrons (p.e.) per channel, similar to traditional cast scintillator detectors. Crosstalk between adjacent cubes averaged 4-5%, and light yield uniformity within individual cubes exhibited about 7% variation, indicating stability and reproducibility. These results underscore the potential of the novel additive manufacturing technique, for efficient and reliable production of high-granularity scintillator detectors.</description>

Abstract: Superparamagnetic iron-oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) are promising probes for biomedical imaging, but the heterogeneity of their magnetic properties is difficult to characterize with existing methods. Here, we perform widefield imaging of the stray magnetic fields produced by hundreds of isolated ~30-nm SPIONs using a magnetic microscope based on nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond. By analyzing the SPION magnetic field patterns as a function of applied magnetic field, we observe substantial field-dependent transverse magnetization components that are typically obscured with ensemble characterization methods. We find negligible hysteresis in each of the three magnetization components for nearly all SPIONs in our sample. Most SPIONs exhibit a sharp Langevin saturation curve, enumerated by a characteristic polarizing applied field, B_c. The B_c distribution is highly asymmetric, with a standard deviation (1.4 mT) that is larger than the median (0.6 mT). Using time-resolved magnetic microscopy, we directly record SPION N\'eel relaxation, after switching off a 31 mT applied field, with a temporal resolution of ~60 ms that is limited by the ring-down time of the electromagnet coils. For small bias fields B_{hold}=1.5-3.5 mT, we observe a broad range of SPION N\'eel relaxation times--from milliseconds to seconds--that are consistent with an exponential dependence on B_{hold}. Our time-resolved diamond magnetic microscopy study reveals rich SPION sample heterogeneity and may be extended to other fundamental studies of nanomagnetism.</description>
