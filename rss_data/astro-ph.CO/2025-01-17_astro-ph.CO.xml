      <title>PSZ2 G181.06+48.47 III: weak-lensing analysis and merging scenario reconstruction of a low-mass cluster with exceptionally-distant radio relics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The galaxy cluster PSZ2 G181.06+48.47 ($z=0.234$) is a post-merging system that exhibits symmetric double radio relics separated by ~2.7 Mpc. We present the first weak-lensing analysis of PSZ2 G181.06+48.47 and propose possible merging scenarios using numerical simulations. Our analysis with Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam imaging identifies a binary dark matter structure consisting of northern and southern components, separated by ~500 kpc. Assuming Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) halos, the masses for the northern and southern subclusters are $M_{200c}^{N} = 0.88_{-0.30}^{+0.35} \times 10^{14} M_{\odot}$ and $M_{200c}^{S} = 2.71_{-0.48}^{+0.51} \times 10^{14} M_{\odot}$, respectively. By superposing the two NFW halos, we determine the total mass of the cluster to be $M_{200c} = 4.22_{-1.00}^{+1.10} \times 10^{14} M_{\odot}$ ($M_{500c} = 2.90_{-0.69}^{+0.75} \times 10^{14} M_{\odot}$). Our mass estimate suggests that the two relics are located around the cluster $R_{200c}$, where the density of the intracluster medium is very low. Our idealized simulations find that an off-axis collision of a 3:1 major merger can simultaneously reproduce the observed relic and dark matter halo separations. From these findings, we suggest that the system is observed ~0.9 Gyr after the first pericenter passage and is returning from the first apocenter.</description>

      <title>Boosting Supermassive Black Hole Growth in the Early Universe by Fuzzy Dark Matter Solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations of massive supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in the early universe challenge existing black hole formation models. We propose that soliton cores in fuzzy dark matter (FDM) offer a potential solution to this timing problem. Our FDM cosmological zoom-in simulations confirm that for a particle mass $m_{\rm FDM}\sim 10^{-22}~{\rm eV}$, solitons are well developed at redshift $z \sim 7$ with masses of $\sim10^9~M_\odot$, comparable to the observed SMBHs. We then demonstrate using hydrodynamic simulations that, compared to cold dark matter, these high-$z$ massive FDM solitons with mass $M_s$ can provide additional gravitational potential to accrete gas and boost the Bondi accretion rate of a growing black hole seed with mass $M_{\rm BH}$ by up to two to four orders of magnitude, in the regime of efficient cooling and negligible radiation pressure. This accretion boosting mechanism is effective for $10^{-22}~{\rm eV} \lesssim m_{\rm FDM} \lesssim 10^{-20}~{\rm eV}$ and potentially beyond as long as $M_s &gt; M_{\rm BH}$. The simulation code GAMER is accessible at https://github.com/gamer-project/gamer.</description>

      <title>Cosmology from UNIONS weak lensing profiles of galaxy clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmological information is encoded in the structure of galaxy clusters. In Universes with less matter and larger initial density perturbations, clusters form earlier and have more time to accrete material, leading to a more extended infall region. Thus, measuring the mean mass distribution in the infall region provides a novel cosmological test. The infall region is largely insensitive to baryonic physics, and provides a cleaner structural test than other measures of cluster assembly time such as concentration. We consider cluster samples from three publicly available galaxy cluster catalogues: the Spectrsopic Identification of eROSITA Sources (SPIDERS) catalogue, the X-ray and Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect selected clusters in the meta-catalogue M2C, and clusters identified in the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Legacy Imaging Survey. Using a preliminary shape catalogue from the Ultraviolet Near Infrared Optical Northern Survey (UNIONS), we derive excess surface mass density profiles for each sample. We then compare the mean profile for the DESI Legacy sample, which is the most complete, to predictions from a suite of simulations covering a range of $\Omega_{\rm m}$ and $\sigma_8$, obtaining constraints of $\Omega_{\rm m}=0.29\pm 0.05$ and $\sigma_8=0.80 \pm 0.04$. We also measure mean (comoving) splashback radii for SPIDERS, M2C and DESI Legacy Imaging Survey clusters of $1.59^{+0.16}_{-0.13} {\rm cMpc}/h$, $1.30^{+0.25}_{-0.13} {\rm cMpc}/h$ and $1.45\pm0.11 {\rm cMpc}/h$ respectively. Performing this analysis with the final UNIONS shape catalogue and the full sample of spectroscopically observed clusters in DESI, we can expect to improve on the best current constraints from cluster abundance studies by a factor of 2 or more.</description>

      <title>JERALD: high-fidelity dark matter, stellar mass and neutral hydrogen maps from fast N-body simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new code and approach, JERALD -- JAX Enhanced Resolution Approximate Lagrangian Dynamics -- , that improves on and extends the Lagrangian Deep Learning method of Dai &amp; Seljak (2021), producing high-resolution dark matter, stellar mass and neutral hydrogen maps from lower-resolution approximate $N$-body simulations. The model is trained using the Sherwood-Relics simulation suite (for a fixed cosmology), specifically designed for the intergalactic medium and the neutral hydrogen distribution in the cosmic web. The output is tested in the redshift range from $z=5$ to $z=0$ and the generalization properties of the learned mapping is demonstrated. JERALD produces maps with dark matter, stellar and neutral hydrogen power spectra in excellent agreement with full-hydrodynamic simulations with $8\times$ higher resolution, at large and intermediate scales; in particular, JERALD's neutral hydrogen power spectra agree with their higher-resolution full-hydrodynamic counterparts within 90% up to $k\simeq1\,h$Mpc$^{-1}$ and within 70% up to $k\simeq10\,h$Mpc$^{-1}$. JERALD provides a fast, accurate and physically motivated approach that we plan to embed in a statistical inference pipeline, such as Simulation-Based Inference, to constrain dark matter properties from large- to intermediate-scale structure observables.</description>

      <title>Probing Cosmology with 92 Localized Fast Radio Bursts and DESI BAO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) collaboration, combined with the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) observations, suggest a preference for dynamical dark energy (DDE) with $w_0&gt;-1$ and $w_a&lt;0$. Given the cosmological origin of fast radio bursts (FRBs), the combination of their dispersion measures and host galaxy redshifts makes localized FRBs a valuable tool for probing cosmology. Using an updated sample of 92 localized FRBs, along with DESI BAO, PlantheonPlus and CMB data, we constrain the dark energy (DE) equation of state (EoS) under the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parameterization. We find that even without incorporating CMB data, DDE remains preferred with $w_0 = -0.855 ^{+0.084}_{-0.084}$ and $w_a = -1.174^{+0.462}_{-0.491}$ at a confidence level of $\sim2.5 \sigma$. A joint analysis constrains these to be $w_0 = -0.784^{+0.064}_{-0.064}$ and $w_a = -0.872^{+0.269}_{-0.278}$, showing a discrepancy with $\Lambda$CDM at a $\sim3.1\sigma$ level. Furthermore, using localized FRBs alone, we estimate the Hubble constant $H_0$ to be $69.04^{+2.30}_{-2.07}$ and $75.61^{+2.23}_{-2.07} \, \rm km \, s^{-1} \, Mpc^{-1}$, assuming the Galactic electron density models to be NE2001 (Cordes \&amp; Lazio) and YMW16 (Yao et al.), respectively. Thus, accurate accounting of the Galactic dispersion measure is crucial for resolving the Hubble tension with FRBs. Future BAO measurements, next-generation CMB experiments, and more localized FRBs will further constrain the DE EoS and the cosmological parameters.</description>

      <title>Void spin distribution as a powerful probe of $\sigma_{8}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a numerical proof of the concept that the void spin distributions can in principle provide a tight constraint on the amplitude of matter density fluctuation on the scale of $8\,h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$ ($\sigma_{8}$) without being severely deteriorated by the degeneracies of $\sigma_{8}$ with cold dark matter density parameter multiplied by the dimensionless Hubble parameter square ($\Omega_{\rm cdm}h^{2}$), total neutrino mass ($M_{\nu}$) and dark energy equation of state ($w$). Applying the Void-Finder algorithm to a total of $15$ AbacusSummit $N$-body simulations of $15$ different cosmological models, we identify the giant voids to measure their spins, defined as the magnitudes of rescaled specific angular momenta of void halos. The $15$ cosmologies include the Planck $\Lambda$CDM and $14$ non-Planck models, each of which differs among one another only in one of $\{\sigma_{8},\ \Omega_{\rm cdm}h^{2},\ M_{\nu},\ w\}$. The probability density distribution of void spins is determined for each model and found to be well approximated by the generalized Gamma distribution with two characteristic parameters, $k$ and $\theta$. It turns out that the best-fit values of $k$ and $\theta$ exhibit very sensitive dependences only on $\sigma_{8}$, being almost insensitive to $\Omega_{\rm cdm}h^{2}$, $M_{\nu}$, $w$. This exclusive $\sigma_{8}$-dependence of the void spin distributions is confirmed to be robust against the variation of the mass and number cuts of void halos. We also test an observational feasibility of estimating the void spins from real data on the galaxy redshifts.</description>

      <title>Velocity fields and turbulence from cosmic filaments to galaxy clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy clusters are currently the endpoint of the hierarchical structure formation; they form via the accretion of dark matter and cosmic gas from their local environment. In particular, filaments contribute grandly by accreting gas from cosmic matter sheets and underdense regions and feeding it to the galaxy clusters. Along the way, the gas in filaments is shocked and heated, which, together with the velocity structure within the filament, induces swirling and, thus, turbulence. In this work, we study a constrained hydrodynamical simulation replica of the Virgo cluster to characterise the velocity field in the two cosmic filaments connected to the cluster with unprecedented high resolution. First, we conduct a qualitative examination of slices extracted from the simulation. We study the temperature, the velocity field, and derived quantities in longitudinal cuts to study the general structure of the filaments and in transverse cuts to study their inner organisation and connection to cosmic matter sheets and underdense regions. Then, we conduct a quantitative study of velocities in Virgo's filaments by computing the 2D energy spectrum from 1 and 5~Mpc square maps extracted from the slices and centred on the core of the filaments. We show that the velocity field goes from mostly compressive far in the filaments to mostly solenoidal in Virgo's core. Moreover, we observe that the total energy spectrum in the filaments gains in amplitude and steepens towards Virgo.</description>

      <title>Chern-Simons gravitational term coupled to an isocurvature field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Chern-Simons gravitational term during inflation is usually coupled to the inflaton field. The resulting theory suffers from ghost-field formation in the tensor sector, which limits the observational effects of P-violation on cosmological correlators. In this work, we consider the Chern-Simons term coupled to an isocurvature component in a multi-field model of inflation. Since the resulting theory does not affect the quadratic action of tensor perturbations, ghost fields do not appear. This operator provides (P-violating) interactions between the isocurvature perturbation and the curvature and tensor perturbations. We show that combining these couplings with interactions between the curvature and isocurvature components coming from a turning trajectory, the resulting $\langle sst \rangle_{PV}$ non-Gaussianities can reach $f^{sst, PV}_{\rm NL}=B_{PV}^{\zeta\zeta h}(k,k,k)/P^2_{\zeta}(k)\sim \mathcal O(1)$ within the parameter space of the theory. Our result motivates the systematic study of the Chern-Simons gravitational term coupled to isocurvature fields in multi-field models of inflation with couplings between the curvature and isocurvature fields or other mechanisms that transfer effects on the isocurvature field into the curvature field.</description>

      <title>Impact of correlated noise on the reconstruction of the stochastic gravitational wave background with Einstein Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Einstein Telescope (ET) is a proposed next-generation Gravitational Wave (GW) interferometer designed to detect a large number of astrophysical and cosmological sources with unprecedented sensitivity. A key target for ET is the detection of a stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB), a faint signal from unresolved GW sources. In its proposed triangular configuration, correlated Newtonian noise of seismic origin poses some challenges for the SGWB detection. We study the impact of correlated noise on the SGWB detection and relative parameter estimation for ET in the triangular configuration, comparing it to a 2L configuration with two separated L-shaped detectors. We perform a Bayesian analysis on simulated data, which shows that accurate reconstruction of the SGWB parameters and instrumental noise is achievable if the noise is properly modeled. We illustrate that neglecting correlated noise leads to significant biases in the parameter reconstruction. Our results show that while the 2L configuration provides slightly better parameter estimation precision, mainly due to its longer arm length, the triangular configuration remains competitive when accurate noise modeling is provided.</description>

      <title>The COSMOS-Web deep galaxy group catalog up to $z=3.7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Galaxy groups with $M_{tot} \lesssim 10^{14}$ $M_\odot$ and up to a few tens of members are the most common galaxy environment, marking the transition between field and massive clusters. Identifying groups plays a crucial role in understanding structure formation and galaxy evolution. Modern deep surveys allow us to build well-characterized samples of groups up to the regime where structures were taking shape. We aimed to build the largest deep catalog of galaxy groups to date over the COSMOS-Web field effective area of 0.45 deg$^2$, leveraging the deep high quality data of the new COSMOS-Web photometric catalog resulted from the James Webb Space Telescope observations of the COSMOS-Web field. We performed the group search with the AMICO algorithm, a linear matched filter based on an analytical model for the group signal. AMICO has already been tested in wide and deep field surveys, including COSMOS data up to $z=2$. In this work, we tested the algorithm performances at even higher redshift and searched for protocluster cores at $z&gt;2$. We compiled a list of known protoclusters in COSMOS at $2 \leq z \leq 3.7$, matched them with our detections and studied the clustering of the detected cores. We estimated purity and completeness of our sample by creating data-driven mocks with the SinFoniA code and linked signal-to-noise to purity. We detected 1678 groups in the COSMOS-Web field up to $z=3.7$, including lists of members extending nearly two magnitudes deeper than the previous AMICO-COSMOS catalog. 756 groups were detected with purity of 80\%. More than 500 groups have their redshift confirmed by assigning spectroscopic counterparts. This group catalog offers a unique opportunity to explore galaxy evolution in different environments spanning $\sim$12 Gyr and to study groups, from the least rich population to the formation of the most massive clusters.</description>

      <title>Zapped then Napped? A rapidly quenched, remnant leaker candidate with a steep spectroscopic $\beta_{UV}$ slope at z=8.5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use NIRSpec MSA spectroscopy and NIRCam Photometry to explore the properties of JADES-GS8-RL-1, a rapidly quenched, $z=8.5$ galaxy with a stellar mass of $10^{8.9}M_\odot$, a steep blue UV slope, a Balmer break, and no sign of strong emission lines. With a $\beta_{UV}$=-2.8$\pm 0.2$, as measured from the NIRSpec spectrum, JADES-GS8-RL-1 is consistent with negligible dust attenuation and little to no contribution from the nebular continuum alongside a probable high escape fraction. The $\beta_{UV}$ slope measured from photometry varies from -3.0 in the central regions to -2.2 at the outskirts suggesting possible regional differences in the escape fraction. There are no high-ionisation emission lines, only a tentative 2.9\sig detection of [OII]. Using photometry, this emission appears to be extended, possibly corresponding to weakly ionised gas expelled during or after the quenching process. JADES-GS8-RL-1 is spatially resolved with a half-light radius of 240 pc and has an exponential, disc-like morphology. It appears to have formed all its stars in a short burst within the past 100 Myr with a formation time of $\approx$70 Myr and a quenching time of $\approx$30 Myr. This quenching would have occurred rapidly, making it a more distant example of the kind of low-mass "mini-quenched" galaxies previously observed at high-z. Due to the extremely blue $\beta_{UV}$ slope, our best-fit model predicts a high value for \fesc of &gt;10\%, consistent with the value derived from the $\beta_{UV}$ slope, which when combined with our extraordinarily low O32 upper limit suggests JADES-GS8-RL-1 is a fascinating example of a high-z "remnant leaker" in one of its earliest phases, deep in the epoch of reionisation.</description>

      <title>Scalar Rayleigh Dark Matter: current bounds and future prospects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark Matter can interact with electroweak gauge bosons via higher-dimensional operators, in spite of being neutral under gauge interactions, much like neutral atoms interact with photons through Rayleigh scattering. This study explores effective interactions between a real scalar Dark Matter particle, singlet under the SM gauge group, and electroweak gauge bosons. We present a comprehensive analysis of current constraints and projected sensitivities from both lepton and hadron colliders as well as direct and indirect detection experiments in testing Rayleigh Dark Matter interactions. We find that, thanks to the complementarity between collider experiments and cosmological probes, thermally produced Rayleigh Dark Matter at the hundreds of GeV scale can be thoroughly tested with the next generation of experiments. For lighter candidates, upcoming forecasts will explore uncharted parameter space, significantly surpassing the thermal Dark Matter benchmark.</description>

      <title>Remarks on brane-antibrane inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide an accessible review to the eta problem in brane-antibrane inflation and a recently proposed solution. The description of the antibrane by means of nonlinearly realized supersymmetry suggests a simple stabilization mechanism for the volume mode, based on the most general Kahler and superpotentials compatible with the symmetries of the problem. This work is a contribution to the proceedings of the second general meeting of the COST Action CA21106 (Cosmic WISPers) and is based on arXiv:2410.00097 .</description>

      <title>Updated BBN Bounds on Hadronic Injection in the Early Universe: The Gravitino Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Late-decaying particles naturally arise in many extensions of the Standard Model, directly impacting key cosmological processes in the early universe, such as Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). BBN studies often consider electromagnetic energy injection episodes only, but in practice long-lived particles are also amenable to hadronic decays. The latter can greatly alter the predicted abundances of light elements such as $\mathrm{D}/\mathrm{H}$, $Y_p$, ${}^3\mathrm{He}/\mathrm{D}$, and ${}^7\mathrm{Li}/\mathrm{H}$. Incorporating up-to-date measurements, we place constraints on the primordial abundance of long-lived particles as a function of their lifetime. Lastly, we apply our results to the gravitino problem and set bounds on the reheating temperature, which controls the gravitino primordial abundance.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Interactions with Phantom Scalar Field: Revisiting Background Phase-Space Analysis with Compactified Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Energy transfer in the dark sector of the universe gives rise to new phenomena of special interest in modern cosmology. When dark energy is modeled as a phantom scalar field, interactions become crucial to avoid Big Rip singularities. In this work, we revisit the phase-space analysis of the field equations by introducing a new set of dimensionless variables distinct from the traditional Hubble normalization approach. These new variables define a compactified phase space for the evolution of physical parameters. We demonstrate that these compactified variables offer fresh insights into the phase-space analysis in gravitational theories, particularly when the dark energy fluid is allowed to possess a negative kinetic energy density.</description>

      <title>Observable Signatures of RN Black Holes with Dark Matter Halos via Strong Gravitational Lensing and Constraints from EHT Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of dark matter halos on the gravitational lensing produced by electrically charged, spherically symmetric black holes in the strong-field regime. The study focuses on two dark matter models: the Universal Rotation Curve Model and the cold dark matter model. We derive the coefficients for the strong deflection limit and numerically analyze the deflection angle variations. Graphical representations of the results show that the strong deflection angle, $\alpha_D$ , increases with the charge parameter $Q$ in the presence of a dark matter halo. We explore the astrophysical consequences for the supermassive black holes $M87^*$ and $SgrA^*$ , comparing the results with standard Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m and Schwarzschild black holes via strong gravitational lensing observations. Our findings suggest that charged black holes with dark matter halos can be differentiated from standard black holes. We constrain the charge parameter $Q$ using observational data from the Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration. For $M87^*$ , we find $0 \leq |Q| \leq 0.366M$ with the Universal Rotation Curve model and $0 \leq |Q| \leq 0.364M$ with the cold dark matter model. For $SgrA^*$ , the constraints are $0 \leq |Q| \leq 0.586M$ and $0 \leq |Q| \leq 0.584M$, respectively. These results suggest that charged black holes with dark matter halos satisfy the Event Horizon Telescope constraints, offering potential for future identification in observational campaigns.</description>

      <title>WALLABY Pilot Survey &amp; ASymba: Comparing HI Detection Asymmetries to the SIMBA Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An avenue for understanding cosmological galaxy formation is to compare morphometric parameters in observations and simulations of galaxy assembly. In this second paper of the ASymba: Asymmetries of HI in SIMBA Galaxies series, we measure atomic gas HI asymmetries in spatially-resolved detections from the untargetted WALLABY survey, and compare them to realizations of WALLABY-like mock samples from the SIMBA cosmological simulations. We develop a Scanline Tracing method to create mock galaxy HI datacubes which minimizes shot noise along the spectral dimension compared to particle-based methods, and therefore spurious asymmetry contributions. We compute 1D and 3D asymmetries for spatially-resolved WALLABY Pilot Survey detections, and find that the highest 3D asymmetries A3D&gt;0.5 stem from interacting systems or detections with strong bridges or tails. We then construct a series of WALLABY-like mock realizations drawn from the SIMBA 50 Mpc simulation volume, and compare their asymmetry distributions. We find that the incidence of high A3D detections is higher in WALLABY than in the SIMBA mocks, but that difference is not statistically significant (p-value = 0.05). The statistical power of quantitative comparisons of asymmetries such as the one presented here will improve as the WALLABY survey progresses, and as simulation volumes and resolutions increase.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the breaking of dark $SU(2)_d$ symmetry at different temperature scales, occurring after Peccei-Quinn symmetry breaking or following QCD symmetry breaking. We focus on assessing the potential of the hidden monopoles generated during this process to serve as dark matter candidate. Additionally, we examine the impact of axion-monopole interactions on the axion mass. When the phase transition occurs at extremely high temperature ($\sim 10^8 \mathrm{GeV}$), the contribution of monopoles to the axion mass through witten effect becomes non-negligible, playing a crucial role in accurately determining the axion relic density. Moreover, the stochastic gravitational wave background generated by dark phase transition and axionic domain wall collapse may offer a potential explanation for the low-frequency gravitational wave signals observed in PTA experiments.</description>

      <title>Cosmic voids and the kinetic analysis. IV. Hubble tension and the cosmological constant</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The formation of the cosmic structures in the late Universe is considered using Vlasov kinetic approach. The crucial point is the use of the gravitational potential with repulsive term of the cosmological constant which provides a solution to the Hubble tension, that is the Hubble parameter for the late Universe has to differ from its global cosmological value. This also provides a mechanism of formation of stationary semi-periodic gravitating structures of voids and walls, so that the cosmological constant has a role of the scaling and hence can be compared with the observational data for given regions. The considered mechanism of the structure formation in late cosmological epoch then is succeeding the epoch described by the evolution of primordial density fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Scattering meets absorption in dark matter detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Direct detection experiments have started to explore dark matter scattering off electrons and nucleons through light mediators. Mediators with sub-keV masses are efficiently produced in the Sun and can be absorbed in the same detectors that probe dark matter scattering. We investigate the interplay of dark matter scattering and mediator absorption for two models with a dark photon as mediator. For Dirac dark matter, we find that scattering and absorption can be simultaneously observed at direct detection experiments in the near future. For atomic dark matter, we predict additional signals due to scattering of both dark atoms and constituents from ionized dark atoms. In both models, we determine the parameter space that respects bounds from cosmology and astrophysics, where the strongest constraints come from dark matter self-interactions. In this way, we identify viable targets for dark matter with light mediators at upcoming direct detection experiments. Distinguishing between the various signals, for instance by measuring energy distributions, will be crucial to reveal the underlying model in case of a discovery.</description>

      <title>Constraining the Secluded and Catalyzed Annihilation Dark Matter with Fermi-LAT and Planck Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a dark matter (DM) model with a complex scalar charged under a hidden gauge symmetry, denoted as $U(1)_D$. The scalar field is the DM candidate while the $U(1)_D$ gauge field $A'$ plays the role of a mediator, which connects the dark sector to the standard model (SM) sector via a tiny kinetic mixing. We find that both the secluded and catalyzed annihilation scenarios can be realized in this model. The phenomenology of DM, including relic density, indirect detection (Fermi-LAT), and CMB (Planck) constraints, is discussed. We also extend our discussion to DM with other spins, including Dirac fermion and vector boson. Our analysis is carried out in two models, denoted as $U(1)_D \times U(1)_Y$ and $U(1)_D \times U(1)_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$, with the former corresponding to $A'$ kinetically mixing with the $U(1)_Y$ gauge field $B$ and the latter corresponding to $A'$ mixing with the $U(1)_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ gauge field $Z'$. We find that, in previous studies, the indirect detection limits were overly restrictive because they only considered the simplified $2\mathrm{DM} \to 2\mathrm{SM}$ annihilation channel. In contrast, by performing a complete calculation of the gamma-ray and CMB constraints from the process $2\mathrm{DM} \to 2A' \to 4\mathrm{SM}$ in the models we consider, we observe weaker constraints in both the $U(1)_D \times U(1)_Y$ and $U(1)_D \times U(1)_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ models, with the $U(1)_D \times U(1)_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ model being subject to the weakest constraints overall since it involves less hadronic decay processes.</description>

      <title>SHORES: Serendipitous H-ATLAS-fields Observations of Radio Extragalactic Sources with the ATCA. I: catalog generation and analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Serendipitous H-ATLAS-fields Observations of Radio Extragalactic Sources (SHORES) multiple pencil beam survey that observed at 2.1 GHz with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) 29 fields in total intensity and polarization within the Herschel-ATLAS Southern Galactic Field. This paper presents the observations, calibration and analysis of the 27 shallow fields that cover an overall area of $\sim 26$ square degree with increasing sensitivity towards the phase centers of each pointing according to the ATCA 22 m dish response function, down to $\sigma\lesssim 33\, \mu$Jy. Two additional (deep) fields have been observed to even higher sensitivity. All the SHORES observations have been calibrated to account also for linear polarization. Polarization and deeper field analysis will be presented in future papers. The SHORES shallow-field sample considered in the present paper counts $2294$ sources detected with BLOBCAT to signal-to-noise ratio $SNR\gtrsim 4.5$. Simulations determined that our procedure and final catalog is 95% reliable above $497.5\, \mu$Jy and $95\%$ complete to the $SNR\gtrsim 4.5$ significance level. By exploiting ATCA E-W 6 km configuration we reached resolutions of $3.2\times 7.2$ arcsec, to which level $81\%$ of our sources are unresolved. We determined source counts down to the $150\, \mu$Jy level. For the sources with a counterpart in H-ATLAS, the FIR-radio correlation is calculated and discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.12643v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic fields can be generated in cosmic string wakes due to the Biermann mechanism in the presence of neutrino inhomogeneities. As the cosmic string moves through the plasma the small magnetic field is amplified by the turbulence in the plasma. Relativistic charged particles which cross the magnetized wake of a cosmic string will therefore emit synchrotron radiation. The opening angle of the cosmic string is very small and so the wake appears like a relativistic jet. Assuming a homogeneous magnetic field in the wake of the string, we obtain the synchrotron emission from non thermal relativistic electrons in the wake of the string. The emitted radiation has a broad peak and is over a wide range of frequency. We show that the spectrum can be mapped to some of the unknown sources in different ranges of the current available catalogues.</description>

Abstract: Modern machine learning will allow for simulation-based inference from reionization-era 21cm observations at the Square Kilometre Array. Our framework combines a convolutional summary network and a conditional invertible network through a physics-inspired latent representation. It allows for an optimal and extremely fast determination of the posteriors of astrophysical and cosmological parameters. The sensitivity to non-Gaussian information makes our method a promising alternative to the established power spectra.</description>

      <title>Constraining $f(Q, L_m)$ gravity with bulk viscosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08837v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of bulk viscosity on late-time cosmic acceleration within an extended $f(Q, L_m)$ gravity framework, where the non-metricity $Q$ is non-minimally coupled with the matter Lagrangian $L_m$. Analyzing the function $f(Q, L_m) = \alpha Q + \beta L_m$, we derive exact solutions under non-relativistic matter domination. Using observational datasets ($H(z)$, Pantheon supernovae, and their combination), we constrain the model parameters $H_0$, $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\zeta$. The deceleration parameter transitions from positive to negative values around redshifts $z_t \approx 0.80$ to $0.99 $, indicating current accelerated expansion. Moreover, the effective equation of state parameter, $\omega_{eff}$, resembles quintessence dark energy ($-1 &lt; \omega_{eff} &lt; -\frac{1}{3}$), with corresponding values from respective datasets. Finally, we use the $Om(z)$ diagnostic, which confirms that our model demonstrates quintessence-like behavior. Our findings underscore the significant role of bulk viscosity in understanding accelerated expansion in the universe within alternative gravity theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07980v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of third-order statistics in large-scale structure analyses has been hampered by the increased complexity of bispectrum estimators (compared to power spectra), the large dimensionality of the data vector, and the difficulty in estimating its covariance matrix. In this paper we present the filtered-squared bispectrum (FSB), an estimator of the projected bispectrum effectively consisting of the cross-correlation between the square of a field filtered on a range of scales and the original field. Within this formalism, we are able to recycle much of the infrastructure built around power spectrum measurement to construct an estimator that is both fast and robust against mode-coupling effects caused by incomplete sky observations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the existing techniques for the estimation of analytical power spectrum covariances can be used within this formalism to calculate the bispectrum covariance at very high accuracy, naturally accounting for the most relevant Gaussian and non-Gaussian contributions in a model-independent manner.</description>

      <title>Testing the robustness of the BAO determination in the presence of massive neutrinos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01897v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the robustness of the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) feature in galaxy clustering in the presence of massive neutrinos. In the standard BAO analysis pipeline a reference cosmological model is assumed to boost the BAO peak through the so-called reconstruction technique and in the modelling of the BAO feature to extract the cosmological information. State-of-the art spectroscopic BAO measurements, such as the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument claim an aggregate precision of 0.52$\%$ on the BAO scale, with a systematic error of 0.1$\%$ associated to the assumption of a reference cosmology when measuring and analyzing the BAO feature. While the systematic effect induced by this arbitrary choice of fiducial cosmology has been studied for a wide range of $\Lambda$CDM-like models, it has not yet been tested for reference cosmologies with massive neutrinos with the precision afforded by next generation surveys. In this context, we employ the Quijote high-resolution dark-matter simulations with haloes above a mass of $M\sim 2\times10^{13} h^{-1}M_{\odot}$, with different values for the total sum of neutrinos masses, $\sum m_\nu[{\rm eV}] = 0,\, 0.1,\, 0,2,\, 0.4$ to study and quantify the impact of the pipeline's built-in assumption of massless neutrinos on the measurement of the BAO signal, with a special focus on the BAO reconstruction technique. We determine that any additional systematic bias introduced by the assumption of massless neutrinos is no greater than $0.1\%$ ($0.2\%$) for the isotropic (anisotropic) measurement. We expect these conclusions also hold for galaxies provided that neutrino properties do not alter the galaxy-halo connection.</description>

      <title>KiDS-Legacy: Covariance validation and the unified OneCovariance framework for projected large-scale structure observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06962v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce OneCovariance, an open-source software designed to accurately compute covariance matrices for an arbitrary set of two-point summary statistics across a variety of large-scale structure tracers. Utilising the halo model, we estimate the statistical properties of matter and biased tracer fields, incorporating all Gaussian, non-Gaussian, and super-sample covariance terms. The flexible configuration permits user-specific parameters, such as the complexity of survey geometry, the halo occupation distribution employed to define each galaxy sample, or the form of the real-space and/or Fourier space statistics to be analysed.
  We illustrate the capabilities of OneCovariance within the context of a cosmic shear analysis of the final data release of the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS-Legacy). Upon comparing our estimated covariance with measurements from mock data and calculations from independent software, we ascertain that OneCovariance achieves accuracy at the per cent level. When assessing the impact of ignoring complex survey geometry in the cosmic shear covariance computation, we discover misestimations at approximately the $10\%$ level for cosmic variance terms. Nonetheless, these discrepancies do not significantly affect the KiDS-Legacy recovery of cosmological parameters. We derive the cross-covariance between real-space correlation functions, bandpowers, and COSEBIs, facilitating future consistency tests among these three cosmic shear statistics. Additionally, we calculate the covariance matrix of photometric-spectroscopic galaxy clustering measurements, validating Jackknife covariance estimates for calibrating KiDS-Legacy redshift distributions. The OneCovariance can be found on github Hub together with a comprehensive documentation and examples.</description>

      <title>Galactic and extragalactic probe of dark matter with LISA's binary black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15562v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The upcoming LISA mission will be able to detect gravitational waves from galactic and extragalactic compact binaries. Here, we report on LISA's capability to probe dark matter around these binaries if the latter constitute black holes. By analyzing the variation in the chirp mass of the binary, we show that depending on the black hole masses, LISA should be able to probe their surrounding dark matter to a luminosity distance of $\approx 1$ Gpc if such binaries are observed within the inner $\approx 10$ pc of their galactic center for particle-like dark matter or near the galactic solitonic core for wave-like dark matter. In the case a null result is recorded during the course of observation of \emph{well-localized} binaries, one can still rule out certain parameter spaces of dark matter as being the dominant contributor to the matter budget of the Universe.</description>

      <title>Strong constraints on a sharp change in $G$ as a solution to the Hubble tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15301v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been proposed that the gravitational constant $G$ abruptly decreased around 130 Myr ago, making Type Ia supernovae (SNe) in the Hubble flow intrinsically brighter than those in host galaxies with Cepheid distances. This would make Hubble flow SNe more distant, causing redshifts to rise slower with distance, potentially solving the Hubble tension. We explore a wide range of unattractive consequences of this ''$G$ step model'' (GSM). We find that since the luminosities of Sun-like stars scale as approximately $G^{5.6}$, the Solar luminosity would have dropped substantially 130 Myr ago in this scenario, likely pushing Earth into a planetary glaciation. However, there was no Snowball Earth episode in the last 500 Myr. The GSM also implies that the length of a year would have abruptly increased by about 10%, but the number of days per year has evolved broadly continuously according to geochronometry and cyclostratigraphy. The GSM would drastically alter stellar evolution, causing the Sun to have exhausted about 2/3 of its fuel supply rather than 1/2. This would lead make the Sun's helioseismic age exceed that of the oldest meteorite samples, but these agree excellently in practice. The expected age of the Universe also agrees well with that of the oldest Galactic stars assuming constant $G$. The GSM however implies these stars are younger, creating a lack of stars from the first 3 Gyr of cosmic history. These arguments cast severe doubt on the viability of the GSM: the solution to the Hubble tension should be sought elsewhere.</description>

      <title>Approximating non-Gaussian Bayesian partitions with normalising flows: statistics, inference and application to cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04791v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Subject of this paper is the simplification of Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling as used in Bayesian statistical inference by means of normalising flows, a machine learning method which is able to construct an invertible and differentiable transformation between Gaussian and non-Gaussian random distributions. We use normalising flows to compute Bayesian partition functions for non-Gaussian distributions and show how normalising flows can be employed in finding analytical expressions for posterior distributions beyond the Gaussian limit. Flows offer advantages for the numerical evaluation of the partition function itself, as well as for cumulants and for the information entropy. We demonstrate how normalising flows in conjunction with Bayes partitions can be used in inference problems in cosmology and apply them to the posterior distribution for the matter density $\Omega_m$ and a dark energy equation of state parameter $w_0$ on the basis of supernova data.</description>

      <title>Exploring the AGN Fraction of a Sample of JWST's Little Red Dots at $5 &lt; z &lt; 8$: Overmassive Black Holes Are Strongly Favored</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10329v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: JWST is revolutionizing our view of the early Universe by pushing the boundaries of detectable galaxies and black holes in redshift (upward) and mass (downward). The Little Red Dots (LRDs), detected by several surveys at $z &gt; 4$, present a significant interpretational challenge, as their Spectral Energy Distributions (SED) can mimic both AGN and stellar population templates. This study analyzes 19 LRDs from the JADES survey, utilizing NIRCam and MIRI photometry. By performing SED fitting across a vast parameter space, we explore a broad range of AGN fractions, defined as the ratio of the monochromatic luminosities (AGN, galaxy, and dust) over a specified wavelength range, 0.4 - 0.7 $\mu m$ rest-frame. We find that 17 of the 19 LRDs investigated are consistent with having significant AGN contributions, with best-fitting AGN fractions ranging between 20% and 70%, while one galaxy shows a low AGN contribution (2%) and another appears to be purely star-forming. Moreover, assuming these LRDs do indeed host AGN, we can place limits on their black hole masses using the inferred AGN bolometric luminosities and adopting the Eddington limit. We find that, independent of the specific AGN fraction adopted, the LRDs' black holes are significantly overmassive relative to their host galaxies -- by $\sim 1$ dex, and up to $\sim 4$ dex in the most extreme cases -- compared to the local $M_{\bullet} - M_{\star}$ relation. The presence of overmassive black holes in the high-$z$ Universe may provide the strongest evidence yet of heavy black hole seeding occurring during the cosmic dark ages.</description>

      <title>Bayesian technique to combine independently-trained Machine-Learning models applied to direct dark matter detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21008v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We carry out a Bayesian analysis of dark matter (DM) direct detection data to determine particle model parameters using the Truncated Marginal Neural Ratio Estimation (TMNRE) machine learning technique. TMNRE avoids an explicit calculation of the likelihood, which instead is estimated from simulated data, unlike in traditional Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms. This considerably speeds up, by several orders of magnitude, the computation of the posterior distributions, which allows to perform the Bayesian analysis of an otherwise computationally prohibitive number of benchmark points. In this article we demonstrate that, in the TMNRE framework, it is possible to include, combine, and remove different datasets in a modular fashion, which is fast and simple as there is no need to re-train the machine learning algorithm or to define a combined likelihood. In order to assess the performance of this method, we consider the case of WIMP DM with spin-dependent and independent interactions with protons and neutrons in a xenon experiment. After validating our results with MCMC, we employ the TMNRE procedure to determine the regions where the DM parameters can be reconstructed. Finally, we present CADDENA, a Python package that implements the modular Bayesian analysis of direct detection experiments described in this work.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Bursty Star Formation in Dwarf Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06807v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dwarf galaxy star formation histories are theoretically expected to be bursty, potentially leaving distinct imprints on their chemical evolution. We propose that episodic starbursts with quiescent periods longer than $\sim$100 Myr should lead to discontinuous tracks in a dwarf galaxy's [$\alpha$/Fe]-[Fe/H] chemical abundance plane, with metallicity gaps as large as 0.3-0.5 dex at [Fe/H] = -2. This occurs due to continued Fe production by Type Ia supernovae during quiescent periods. We demonstrate that Gaussian mixture models can statistically distinguish discontinuous and continuous tracks based on the Akaike Information Criterion. Applying this method to APOGEE observations of the Sculptor dSph galaxy suggests an episodic star formation history with $\sim$300 Myr quiescent periods. While current dwarf galaxy datasets are limited by small spectroscopic sample sizes, future surveys and extremely large telescopes will enable determining large numbers of precise chemical abundances, opening up the investigation of very short timescales in early dwarf galaxy formation. This unprecedentedly high time resolution of dwarf galaxy formation in the early Universe has important implications for understanding both reionization in the early Universe and the episodic star formation cycle of dwarf galaxies.</description>

      <title>From Halos to Galaxies. VI. Improved halo mass estimation for SDSS groups and measurement of the halo mass function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12442v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, galaxies form and evolve in their host dark matter (DM) halos. Halo mass is crucial for understanding the halo-galaxy connection. The abundance matching (AM) technique has been widely used to derive the halo masses of galaxy groups. However, quenching of the central galaxy can decouple the coevolution of its stellar mass and DM halo mass. Different halo assembly histories can also result in significantly different final stellar mass of the central galaxies. These processes can introduce substantial uncertainties in the halo masses derived from the AM method, particularly leading to a systematic bias between groups with star-forming centrals (blue groups) and passive centrals (red groups). To improve, we developed a new machine learning (ML) algorithm that accounts for these effects and is trained on simulations. Our results show that the ML method eliminates the systematic bias in the derived halo masses for blue and red groups and is, on average, $\sim1/3$ more accurate than the AM method. With careful calibration of observable quantities from simulations and observations from SDSS, we apply our ML model to the SDSS Yang et al. groups to derive their halo masses down to $10^{11.5}\mathrm{M_\odot}$ or even lower. The derived SDSS group halo mass function agrees well with the theoretical predictions, and the derived stellar-to-halo mass relations for both red and blue groups matches well with those obtained from direct weak lensing measurements. These new halo mass estimates enable more accurate investigation of the galaxy-halo connection and the role of the halos in galaxy evolution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11991v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider theories which break the invariance under diffeomorphisms (Diff) down to transverse diffeomorphisms (TDiff) in the matter sector, consisting of multiple scalar fields. In particular, we regard shift-symmetric models with two free TDiff scalar fields in a flat Robertson-Walker spacetime (FLRW) and use the perfect fluid approach to study their dynamics. As a consequence of the symmetry breaking, an effective interaction between the fields is induced from the conservation of the total energy-momentum tensor, without the necessity to introduce any explicit interacting term in the Lagrangian. We study the different single-field domination regimes and analyze the energy exchange between the fields. Thereupon, we introduce an application of these models for the description of interactions in the dark sector, and compare the theoretical predictions of our model to observational data from Type Ia supernovae.</description>

      <title>Eccentric Binary Black Hole Simulations with Numerical Relativity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18728v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform a systematic study of eccentric orbiting nonspinning black hole binaries. We first make a technical study of the optimal full numerical techniques to apply to these studies. We choose different gauge parameters and Courant factors, $c=dx/dt$, and find an optimal value for it of 0.45. We also find the grid structure and global resolution that optimize accuracy and speed of current computational resources. With these choices we perform a study of the merger times $t_m$ as a function of eccentricity for configurations with comparable orbital energy content and find that they are well represented by the post-Newtonian factor $F(e)=(1+73e^2/24+37e^4/96)/(1-e^2)^{7/2}$ when merger times are normalized to their quasicircular values, i.e. $t_m(e)/t_m\approx F(e)$. We then perform a systematic coverage of five small-medium eccentricities up to $e\sim0.45$ and six mass ratios up to 8.5:1 producing a total of 30 simulations covering up to 25 orbits to merger to further model merger times and as a seed to a forthcoming new systematic catalog of gravitational waveforms from eccentric binary black holes to directly perform parameter estimations of gravitational waves events.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from supercooled phase transitions in conformal Majoron models of neutrino mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02645v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study supercooled first-order phase transitions above the QCD scale in a wide class of conformal Majoron-like U(1)' models that explain the totality of active neutrino oscillation data and produce a detectable stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) at LIGO, LISA and ET. We place constraints on the U(1)' breaking scale and gauge coupling using current LIGO-Virgo-Kagra data. We find that strong supercooling can be ruled out in large regions of parameter space if a SGWB is not detected by these experiments. A null signal at LIGO and ET will disfavor a type-I seesaw scale above $10^{14}$ GeV, while a positive signal is a signature of heavy right-handed neutrinos. On the other hand, LISA will be sensitive to seesaw scales as low as a TeV, and could detect a SGWB even if the right-handed neutrinos are decoupled.</description>
