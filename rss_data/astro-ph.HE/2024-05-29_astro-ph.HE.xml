      <title>Past activity of Sgr A* is unlikely to affect the local cosmic-ray spectrum up to the TeV regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presence of kiloparsec-sized bubble structures in both sides of the Galactic plan suggests active phases of Sgr A$^\star$, the central supermassive black hole of the Milky-Way in the last 1-6 Myr. The contribution of such event on the cosmic-ray flux measured in the solar neighborhood is investigated with numerical simulations. We evaluate whether the population of high-energy charged particles emitted by the Galactic Center could be sufficient to significantly impact the CR flux measured in the solar neighborhood. We present a set of 3D magnetohydrodynamical simulations, following the anisotropic propagation of CR in a Milky - Way like Galaxy. Independent populations of cosmic-ray are followed through time, originating from two different sources types, namely Supernovae and the Galactic Center. To assess the evolution of the CR flux spectrum properties, we split these populations into two independent energy groups of 100 GeV and 10 TeV. We find that the anisotropic nature of cosmic-ray diffusion dramatically affects the amount of cosmic-ray energy received in the solar neighborhood. Typical timescale to observe measurable changes in the CR spectrum slope is of the order 10 Myr, largely surpassing estimated ages of the Fermi bubbles in the AGN jet-driven scenario. We conclude that a cosmic-ray outburst from the Galactic center in the last few Myr is unlikely to produce any observable feature in the local CR spectrum in the TeV regime within times consistent with current estimates of the Fermi bubbles ages.</description>

      <title>Probing Intracluster Dynamics and Evolution of Globular Clusters through Cataclysmic Variable Populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamical interactions in globular clusters (GCs) significantly impact the formation and evolution of binary sources, including cataclysmic variables (CVs). This study investigates the connection between dynamical states of GCs and X-ray luminosity ($L_{x}$) distributions of CV populations through both simulations and actual observations. Utilizing a Monte Carlo simulation tool, MOCCA, we categorize the simulated GCs into three different evolutionary stages which are referred to as Classes I/II/III. Significant differences are found in the $L_{x}$ distributions of the CVs among these three Classes. In observational aspects, we have analyzed 179 CV candidates in 18 GCs observed by the {\it Chandra} X-ray Observatory. By dividing these GCs into three Families of different dynamical ages, namely Families I/II/III, the $L_{x}$ distributions of the CV candidates also show significant differences among these three Families. Both simulations and observational results suggest that CVs in more dynamically evolved clusters (Class/Family III) exhibit brighter X-ray emission. This highlights the influence of the dynamical status of a GC on the properties of its hosted compact binaries. Similar to blue stragglers, CV populations can serve as tracers of a GC's dynamical history. Our findings provide insights for understanding the interplay between intracluster dynamics and the evolution of compact binaries in GCs.</description>

      <title>Extended Shock Breakout and Early Circumstellar Interaction in SN 2024ggi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present high-cadence photometric and spectroscopic observations of supernova (SN) 2024ggi, a Type II SN with flash spectroscopy features which exploded in the nearby galaxy NGC 3621 at $\sim$7 Mpc. The light-curve evolution over the first 30 hours can be fit by two power law indices with a break after 22 hours, rising from $M_V \approx -12.95$ mag at +0.66 days to $M_V \approx -17.91$ mag after 7 days. In addition, the densely sampled color curve shows a strong blueward evolution over the first few days and then behaves as a normal SN II with a redward evolution as the ejecta cool. Such deviations could be due to interaction with circumstellar material (CSM). Early high- and low-resolution spectra clearly show high-ionization flash features from the first spectrum to +3.42 days after the explosion. From the high-resolution spectra, we calculate the CSM velocity to be 37 $\pm~4~\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}} $. We also see the line strength evolve rapidly from 1.22 to 1.49 days in the earliest high-resolution spectra. Comparison of the low-resolution spectra with CMFGEN models suggests that the pre-explosion mass-loss rate of SN 2024ggi falls in a range of $10^{-3}$ to $10^{-2}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, which is similar to that derived for SN 2023ixf. However, the rapid temporal evolution of the narrow lines in the spectra of SN 2024ggi ($R_\mathrm{CSM} \sim 2.7 \times 10^{14} \mathrm{cm}$) could indicate a smaller spatial extent of the CSM than in SN 2023ixf ($R_\mathrm{CSM} \sim 5.4 \times 10^{14} \mathrm{cm}$) which in turn implies lower total CSM mass for SN 2024ggi.</description>

      <title>Elevated Rates of Tidal Disruption Events in Active Galactic Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advances in time domain astronomy have produced a growing population of flares from galactic nuclei, including both tidal disruption events (TDEs) and flares in active galactic nuclei (AGN). Because TDEs are uncommon and AGN variability is abundant, large-amplitude AGN flares are usually not categorized as TDEs. While TDEs are normally channelled by the collisional process of two-body scatterings over relaxation timescale, the quadrupole moment of a gas disk alters the stellar orbits, allowing them to collisionlessly approach the central massive black hole (MBH). This leads to an effectively enlarged loss cone, the \emph{loss wedge}. Earlier studies found a moderate enhancement, up to a factor $\sim 2-3$, of TDE rates $\dot{N}_{\rm 2b} $ for a static axisymmetric perturbation. Here we study the loss wedge problem for an evolving AGN disk, which can capture large number of stars into the growing loss wedge over much shorter times. The rates $\dot{N}_{\rm cl}$ of collisionless TDEs produced by these time-evolving disks are much higher than the collisional rates $\dot{N}_{\rm 2b}$ in a static loss wedge. We calculate the response of a stellar population to the axisymmetric potential of an adiabatically growing AGN disk and find that the highest rates of collisionless TDEs are achieved for the largest (i) MBH masses $M_{\bullet}$ and (ii) disk masses $M_{\rm d}$. For $M_{\bullet}\sim 10^7 M_\odot$ and $M_{\rm d} \sim 0.1 M_{\bullet}$, the rate enhancement can be up to a factor $\dot{N}_{\rm cl}/\dot{N}_{\rm 2b} \sim 10$. The orbits of collisionless TDEs sometimes have a preferred orientation in apses, carrying implications for observational signatures of resulting flares.</description>

      <title>Candidate strongly-lensed Type Ia supernovae in the Zwicky Transient Facility archive</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitationally lensed Type Ia supernovae (glSNe Ia) are unique astronomical tools for studying cosmological parameters, distributions of dark matter, the astrophysics of the supernovae and the intervening lensing galaxies themselves. Only a few highly magnified glSNe Ia have been discovered by ground-based telescopes, such as the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), but simulations predict the existence of a fainter, undetected population. We present a systematic search in the ZTF archive of alerts from 1 June 2019 to 1 September 2022. Using the AMPEL platform, we developed a pipeline that distinguishes candidate glSNe Ia from other variable sources. Initial cuts were applied to the ZTF alert photometry before forced photometry was obtained for the remaining candidates. Additional cuts were applied to refine the candidates based on their light curve colours, lens galaxy colours, and the resulting parameters from fits to the SALT2 SN Ia template. Candidates were also cross-matched with the DESI spectroscopic catalogue. Seven transients passed all the cuts and had an associated galaxy DESI redshift, which we present as glSN Ia candidates. While superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) cannot be fully rejected, two events, ZTF19abpjicm and ZTF22aahmovu, are significantly different from typical SLSNe and their light curves can be modelled as two-image glSN Ia systems. From this two-image modelling, we estimate time delays of 22 $\pm$ 3 and 34 $\pm$ 1 days for the two events, respectively, which suggests that we have uncovered a population with longer time delays. The pipeline is efficient and sensitive enough to parse full alert streams. It is currently being applied to the live ZTF alert stream to identify and follow-up future candidates while active. This pipeline could be the foundation for glSNe Ia searches in future surveys, like the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time.</description>

      <title>The discovery and significance of fast radio bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2007 we were part of a team that discovered the so-called ``Lorimer Burst'', the first example of a new class of objects now known as fast radio bursts (FRBs). These enigmatic events are only a few ms in duration and occur at random locations on the sky at a rate of a few thousand per day. Several thousand FRBs are currently known. While it is now well established that they have a cosmological origin, and about 10\% of all currently known sources have been seen to exhibit multiple bursts, the origins of these enigmatic sources are currently poorly understood. In this article, we review the discovery of FRBs and present some of the highlights from the vast body of work by an international community. Following a brief overview of the scale of the visible Universe in \S 1, we describe the key moments in radio astronomy (\S 2) that led up to the discovery of the Lorimer burst (\S 3). Early efforts to find more FRBs are described in \S 4 which led to the discovery of the first repeating source (\S 5). In \S 6, as we close out on the second decade of FRBs, we outline some of the many open questions in the field and look ahead to the coming years where many surprises are surely in store.</description>

      <title>Intermediate-mass-ratio inspirals with general dynamical friction in dark matter minispikes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intermediate-mass-ratio inspirals (IMRIs) may be surrounded by dark matter (DM) minispikes. The dynamical friction from these DM minispike structures can affect the dynamics and the gravitational wave (GW) emission of the IMRIs. We analyze the effects of general dynamical friction, with a particular contribution from DM particles moving faster than the stellar-mass black hole in an eccentric IMRI. The results show that the dynamical friction caused by these DM particles tends to eccentricify the orbit, and the general dynamical friction is able to increase the eccentricity. We also analyze the effects of general dynamical friction on the GW characteristic strain. The results indicate that the peak value of the characteristic strain occurs at higher frequencies as the power law index of DM minispike $\gamma_\mathrm{sp}$ increases. For the first time, a general analytical relation between the frequency peak value of characteristic strain of GWs and $\gamma_\mathrm{sp}$ is established. Using the analytical relation, the presence of DM and its halo density may be determined potentially from future GW data.</description>

      <title>Dark matter admixed neutron stars with a realistic nuclear equation of state from chiral nuclear interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effects of dark matter on the structural properties of neutron stars. In particular we investigate how the presence of a dark matter component influences the mass-radius relation, the value of the maximum mass of a neutron star and others stellar properties. To model ordinary matter we use a state-of-the-art equation of state of $\beta$-stable nuclear matter obtained using the Brueckner-Hartree-Fock quantum many-body approach starting from two-body and three-body nuclear interactions derived from chiral effective field theory. The dark matter component of the star is modeled as a non-self-annihilating system of spin $1/2$ fermions and its equation of state as an ideal relativistic Fermi gas. The equilibrium configurations of these dark matter admixed neutron stars (DANS) are calculated by solving a generalization of the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations to the case where the system consists of two perfect fluids interacting solely through gravity. We find that, depending on the dark matter particle mass $m_\chi$, one can have somehow opposite effects on the stellar properties. In the case $m_\chi = 1\, \mathrm{GeV}$, the stellar gravitational maximum mass $M_{max}$ decreases, whereas in the case $m_\chi = 0.1\, \mathrm{GeV}$, $M_{max}$ increases with respect to the maximum mass of ordinary neutron stars. We also show that the presence of dark matter has indirect sizeable effect on the proton fraction in the ordinary matter fluid and, in the case $m_\chi = 1\, \mathrm{GeV}$, results in a decrease of the threshold gravitational mass $M_{tot}^{durca}$ for having direct URCA processes and fast stellar cooling. Finally we study the stability of dark matter admixed neutron stars with respect to radial perturbations.</description>

      <title>The Effect of Tornadic Supercell Thunderstorms on the Atmospheric Muon Flux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tornadoes are severe weather phenomena characterized by a violently rotating column of air connecting the ground to a parent storm. Within the United States, hundreds of tornadoes occur every year. Despite this, the dynamics of tornado formation and propagation are not particularly well understood, in part due to the challenge of instrumentation: many existing instruments for measuring atmospheric properties are in-situ detectors, making deployment in or near an active or developing tornado difficult. Here, we combine local atmospheric and cosmic ray air shower simulation to explore the potential for remote measurement of the pressure field within tornado-producing supercell thunderstorms by examining directional variations of the atmospheric muon flux.</description>

      <title>X-ray and Radio campaign of the Z-source GX 340+0: discovery of X-ray polarization and its implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the discovery of X-ray polarization from the neutron star low-mass X-ray binary and Z-source, GX~340$+$0, using an Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) observation in March 2024. Along with the IXPE observation, we conducted an extensive X-ray and radio monitoring campaign to ascertain the source properties during and around the IXPE observation. The source was within the horizontal branch throughout the multiwavelength campaign. We measured a significant X-ray polarization in 2--8 keV with polarization degree (PD) = $4.02 \pm 0.35$% and polarization angle (PA) = $37.6 \pm 2.5^\circ$. The energy-dependent polarization indicates that in the 2-2.5 keV energy range, the PA is much lower, $\sim9\pm8^\circ$, while other energy bands are consistent with the PA found over 2.5--8 keV. The simultaneous AstroSat-IXPE spectro-polarimetric observations provide some evidence for independent polarization from various spectral components, hinting at a disparity in the PA from the accretion disk and the Comptonized emission, while suggesting an unpolarized emission from the blackbody component. Radio observations in the 0.7--9 GHz frequency range reveal a non-detection of radio emission in 0.7-1.5 GHz and a significant detection in 5.5--9 GHz, suggesting the presence of a spectral break in 1.5-5.5 GHz. Using ATCA observation we place upper limits on the radio polarization at $&lt;$6% on the linear polarization and $&lt;$4% on the circular polarization at 3$\sigma$ level. We discuss the origin of the X-ray polarization and its implications on the geometry of the spectral components.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: WIMP-type dark matter may have additional interactions that break baryon number, leading to induced nucleon decays which are subject to direct experimental constraints from proton decay experiments. In this work, we analyze a possibility of continuous baryon destruction, deriving strong limits from the dark matter accumulating inside old neutron stars, as such a process leads to excess heat generation. We construct the simplest particle dark matter model that breaks baryon and lepton numbers separately but conserves $B-L$. Virtual exchange by DM particles in this model results in di-nucleon decay via $nn\to n\bar\nu$ and $np\to ne^+$ processes.</description>

      <title>Black hole-neutron star mergers in Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational wave observations of black hole-neutron star binaries, particularly those where the black hole has a lower mass compared to other observed systems, have the potential to place strong constraints on modifications to general relativity that arise at small curvature length scales. Here we study the dynamics of black hole-neutron star mergers in shift-symmetric Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity, a representative example of such a theory, by numerically evolving the full equations of motion. We consider quasi-circular binaries with different mass-ratios that are consistent with recent gravitational wave observations, including cases with and without tidal disruption of the star, and quantify the impact of varying the coupling controlling deviations from general relativity on the gravitational wave signal and scalar radiation. We find that the main effect on the late inspiral is the accelerated frequency evolution compared to general relativity, and that--even considering Gauss-Bonnet coupling values approaching those where the theory breaks down--the impact on the merger gravitational wave signal is mild, predominately manifesting as a small change in the amplitude of the ringdown. We compare our results to current post-Newtonian calculations and find consistency throughout the inspiral.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fundamental process of detecting and examining the polarization modes of gravitational waves plays a pivotal role in enhancing our grasp on the precise mechanisms behind their generation. A thorough investigation is essential for delving deeper into the essence of gravitational waves and rigorously evaluating and validating the range of modified gravity theories. In this line of interest, a general description of black holes in theories beyond general relativity can serve a meaningful purpose where distinct deviation parameters can be mapped to solutions representing distinct theories. Employing a refined version of the deformed Kerr geometry, which is free from pathological behaviours such as unphysical divergences in the metric, we explore an extreme mass-ratio inspiral system, wherein a stellar-mass object perturbs a supermassive black hole. We compute the effects of deformation parameters on gravitational wave fluxes, orbital evolution and phase dynamics with leading order post-Newtonian corrections. With the waveform analysis, we assess the plausibility of detecting deviations from general relativity through observations facilitated by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), simultaneously constraining the extent of these deviations. Therefore, this analysis provides an understanding while highlighting the essential role of observations in advancing gravitational phenomena beyond general relativity.</description>

      <title>Genuine Retrieval of the AGN Host Stellar Population (GRAHSP)</title>

Abstract: The assembly and co-evolution of supermassive black holes (SMBH) and their host galaxy stellar population is a key open questions in galaxy evolution. Stellar mass ($M_\star$) and star formation rate (SFR), are inferred by modeling the spectral energy distribution (SED). For galaxies triggering SMBH activity, the active galactic nucleus (AGN) contaminates the light at all wavelengths, hampering the inference of galaxy parameters. Incomplete AGN templates can lead to systematic overestimates of the stellar mass, biasing our understanding of AGN-galaxy co-evolution. This challenge has gained further impetus with the advent of sensitive wide-area surveys with millions of luminous AGN, including by eROSITA, Euclid and LSST. We aim to estimate the accuracy and bias of AGN host galaxy parameters and improve upon existing techniques. This work makes two contributions: 1) a new SED fitting code, GRAHSP, with a flexible, empirically motivated AGN model including a power law continuum emission lines, a FeII forest and a flexible infrared torus. We verify that our model reproduces published X-ray to infrared SEDs of AGN to better than 20\% accuracy. A fully Bayesian fit with nested sampling includes uncertainties in the model and the data, making the inference highly robust. 2) we created a benchmark photometric dataset where pure quasars are merged with non-AGN pure galaxies into a hybrid (Chimera) object but with known galaxy and AGN properties. Comparing the true and retrieved $M_\star$, SFR and AGN luminosities shows that previous codes systematically over-estimate $M_\star$ and SFR by 0.5 dex with a wide scatter of 0.7 dex, at AGN luminosities above 10^44 erg/s. In contrast, GRAHSP shows no bias on $M_\star$ and SFR. GRAHSP also estimates more realistic uncertainties. GRAHSP enables characterization of the environmental conditions conducive to black hole growth. (abridged)</description>

      <title>Discovery and follow-up of a quasiperiodically nulling and sub-pulse drifting pulsar with the Murchison Widefield Array</title>

Abstract: The phenomenon of pulsar nulling, where pulsars temporarily and stochastically cease their radio emission, is thought to be indicative of a `dying' pulsar, where radio emission ceases entirely. Here we report the discovery of a long-period pulsar, PSR J0452-3418, from the ongoing Southern-sky MWA Rapid Two-meter (SMART) pulsar survey. The pulsar has a rotation period of ${\sim}$1.67\,s and a dispersion measure of 19.8\,\dmu, and it exhibits both quasi-periodic nulling and sub-pulse drifting. Periodic nulling is uncommon, only reported in $&lt;1$\% of the pulsar population, with even a smaller fraction showing periodic nulling and sub-pulse drifting. We describe the discovery and follow-up of the pulsar, including a positional determination using high-resolution imaging with the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT), initial timing analysis using the combination of MWA and uGMRT data, and detailed characterisation of the nulling and drifting properties in the MWA's frequency band (140-170\,MHz). Our analysis suggests a nulling fraction of 34$\pm6$\% and a nulling periodicity of 42$^{+1.5}_{-1.3}$ pulses. We measure the phase ($P_2$) and time modulation ($P_3$) caused by the sub-pulse drifting, with an average $P_2$ of 7.1$^{+26.3}_{-3.1}$ degrees and a $P_3$ of 4.8$^{+1.5}_{-0.9}$ pulses. We compare and contrast the observed properties with those of other pulsars that exhibit sub-pulse drifting and quasi-periodic nulling phenomena, and find that the majority of these objects tend to be in the `death valley' in the period-period derivative ($P$-$\dot{P}$) diagram. We also discuss some broader implications for pulsar emission physics and the detectability of similar objects using next-generation pulsar surveys.</description>

      <title>Negative Lags on the Viscous Timescale in Quasar Photometry and Prospects for Detecting More with LSST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05455</link>

Abstract: The variability of quasar light curves can be used to study the structure of quasar accretion disks. For example, continuum reverberation mapping uses delays between variability in short and long wavelength bands ("short" lags) to measure the radial extent and temperature profile of the disk. Recently, a potential reverse lag, where variations in shorter wavelength bands lag the longer wavelength bands at the much longer viscous timescale, was detected for Fairall 9. Inspired by this detection, we derive a timescale for these "long" negative lags from fluctuation propagation models and recent simulations. We use this timescale to forecast our ability to detect long lags using the Vera Rubin Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). After exploring several methods, including the interpolated cross-correlation function, a Von-Neumann estimator, javelin, and a maximum-likelihood Fourier method, we find that our two main methods, javelin and the maximum-likelihood method, can together detect long lags of up to several hundred days in mock LSST light curves. Our methods work best on proposed LSST cadences with long season lengths, but can also work for the current baseline LSST cadence, especially if we add observations from other optical telescopes during seasonal gaps. We find that LSST has the potential to detect dozens to hundreds of additional long lags. Detecting these long lags can teach us about the vertical structure of quasar disks and how it scales with different quasar properties.</description>

      <title>Once-in-a-lifetime encounter models for neutrino media: From coherent oscillations to flavor equilibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05022</link>

Abstract: Collective neutrino oscillations are typically studied using the lowest-order quantum kinetic equation, also known as the mean-field approximation. However, some recent quantum many-body simulations suggest that quantum entanglement among neutrinos may be important and may result in flavor equilibration of the neutrino gas. In this work, we develop new quantum models for neutrino gases in which any pair of neutrinos can interact at most once in their lifetimes. A key parameter of our models is $\gamma=\mu \Delta z$, where $\mu$ is the neutrino coupling strength, which is proportional to the neutrino density, and $\Delta z$ is the duration over which a pair of neutrinos can interact each time. Our models reduce to the mean-field approach in the limit $\gamma\to0$ and achieve flavor equilibration in time $t \gg (\gamma\mu)^{-1}$. These models demonstrate the emergence of coherent flavor oscillations from the particle perspective and may help elucidate the role of quantum entanglement in collective neutrino oscillations.</description>

      <title>General properties of the electric Penrose process</title>

Abstract: We consider the Penrose process with the charged particles in the Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m (RN) background. Let parent particle 0 decay to particles 1 and 2. With the assumption that all three particles move in the equatorial plane, the exact formulas for characteristics of particles 1 and 2 in terms of those of particle 0 are derived. We concentrate on scenarios in which particle 1 and 2 are ejected along the trajectory of particle 0. It is shown that such scenarios correspond to the extrema of energies $E_{1}$ or $E_{2}$ of daughter particles with respect to the angular momentum $L_{1}$ or $L_{2}$. We derive bounds on the values of angular momenta $L_{1}$ and $% L_{2}$. We give classification of these scenarios and discuss their properties including decay in the near-horizon region. We find that the maximum of efficiency is achieved on the horizon for some of these scenarios but not for all of them and with additional constraints on particle parameters. The results are reformulated in terms of velocities of daughter particles in the center of mass frame. The approach is applicable also to collisional Penrose process, in which a combination of particles 1 and 2 is considered as one effective particle. If the mass of particle 0 $% m_{0}\rightarrow \infty $, the situation corresponds to the Ba\~{n}% ados-Silk-West effect, the results agree with the ones known in literature before. In addition, we consider special cases when decay occurs in the turning point for one or all three particles. The formalism developed in this work has a model-independent character and applies not only to the RN metric.</description>
