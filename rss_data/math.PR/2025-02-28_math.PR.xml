      <title>Permuton limits for some permutations avoiding a single pattern</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Permutons are probability measures on the unit square with uniform marginals that provide a natural way to describe limits of permutations. We are interested in the permuton limits for permutations sampled uniformly from certain pattern-avoiding classes that are in bijection with the class of permutations avoiding the increasing pattern of length $d+1$. In particular, we will look at a family of permutations whose permuton limit collapses to the unique permuton supported on the line $x + y = 1$ in the unit square, informally known as the anti-diagonal. We prove some general properties about permutons to aid our efforts, which may be useful for proving permuton limits that converge to the anti-diagonal for a broader range of permutation classes.</description>

      <title>Weak uniqueness for stochastic partial differential equations in Hilbert spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $U,H$ be two separable Hilbert spaces. The main goal of this paper is to study the weak uniqueness of the Stochastic Differential Equation evolving in $H$ \begin{align*} dX(t)=AX(t)dt+\mathcal{V}B(X(t))dt+GdW(t), \quad t&gt;0, \quad X(0)=x \in H, \end{align*} where $\{W(t)\}_{t\geq 0}$ is a $U$-cylindrical Wiener process, $A:D(A)\subseteq H\to H$ is the infinitesimal generator of a strongly continuous semigroup, $\mathcal{V},G:U\rightarrow H$ are linear bounded operators and $B:H\rightarrow U$ is a uniformly continuous function. The abstract result in this paper gives the weak uniqueness for large classes of heat and damped equations in any dimension without any H\"older continuity assumption on $B$.</description>

      <title>Study of direct and inverse first-exit problems for drifted Brownian motion with Poissonian resetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: \noindent We address some direct and inverse problems, for the first-exit time (FET) $\tau $ of a drifted Brownian motion with Poissonian resetting ${\cal X}(t)$ from an interval $(0,b)$ and the first-exit area (FEA) $A,$ namely the area swept out by ${\cal X}(t)$ till the time $\tau $; this type of diffusion process ${\cal X}(t)$ is characterized by the fact that a reset to the position $x_R $ can occur according to a homogeneous Poisson process with rate $r&gt;0.$ When the initial position ${\cal X}(0)= \eta \in (0,b)$ is deterministic and fixed, the direct FET problem consists in investigating the statistical properties of the FET $\tau ,$ whilst the direct FEA problem studies the probability distribution of the FEA $A$. The inverse FET problem regards the case when $\eta $ is randomly distributed in $(0,b)$ (while $r$ and $x_R $ are fixed); if
  $F(t)$ is a given distribution function on the time $t$ axis, the inverse FET problem consists in finding the density $g$ of $\eta,$ if it exists, such that $P[\tau \le t ] = F(t), \ t &gt;0.$ %In addition to the case of random initial position $\eta,$ we also study the case when the initial position $\eta$ and the resetting rate $r$ are fixed, whereas the reset position $x_R$ is random. Several explicit examples of solutions to the inverse FET problem are provided.</description>

      <title>A current expansion for Ising lattice gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we discuss a random current expansion and a switching lemma for Ising lattice gauge theory at all choices of inverse temperature $\beta$. We deduce some simple consequences, including several expressions for the Wilson loop expectation (at any $\beta$) and a new proof of the area law estimate for sufficiently small \( \beta\). We also derive a few results analogous to corresponding results for the Ising model. In particular, we show that the Wilson loop expectation is non-negative at any $\beta$ and give an alternative short proof of Griffith's second inequality and, as a consequence, show that the Wilson loop expectations are increasing in \( \beta\) for all $\beta$.</description>

      <title>On Malliavin differentiability and absolute continuity of one-dimensional doubly perturbed diffusion processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish Malliavin differentiability and absolute continuity for $\alpha, \beta$-doubly perturbed diffusion process with parameters $\alpha &lt;1$ and $\beta &lt;1$ such that $|\rho| &lt; 1$, where $ \rho : = \frac{\alpha\beta}{(1-\alpha)(1-\beta)}$. Furthermore, under some regularity conditions on the coefficients, we prove that the solution $X_t$ has a smooth density for all $t\in(0, t_0)$ for some finite number $t_0&gt;0$. Our results recover earlier works by Yue and Zhang (2015) and Xue, Yue and Zhang (2016), and the proofs are based on the techniques of the Malliavin calculus.</description>

      <title>Strategic timing of arrivals to a queueing system with scheduled customers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines a single-server queueing system that serves both scheduled and strategic walk-in customers. The service discipline follows a first-come, first-served policy, with scheduled customers granted non-preemptive priority. Each walk-in customer strategically chooses their arrival time to minimize their expected waiting time, taking into account the reservation schedule and the decisions of other walk-in customers. We derive the Nash equilibrium arrival distribution for walk-in customers and investigate the implications of allowing early arrivals. By analysing various appointment schedules, we assess their effects on equilibrium arrival patterns, waiting times, and server idle time. Additionally, we develop an optimisation approach using the Differential Evolution algorithm, which demonstrates measurable improvements in system performance compared to traditional equally-spaced scheduling.</description>

      <title>Uniform-in-Time Convergence Rates to a Nonlinear Markov Chain for Mean-Field Interacting Jump Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a system of $N$ particles interacting through their empirical distribution on a finite state space in continuous time. In the formal limit as $N\to\infty$, the system takes the form of a nonlinear (McKean--Vlasov) Markov chain. This paper rigorously establishes this limit. Specifically, under the assumption that the mean field system has a unique, exponentially stable stationary distribution, we show that the weak error between the empirical measures of the $N$-particle system and the law of the mean field system is of order $1/N$ uniformly in time. Our analysis makes use of a master equation for test functions evaluated along the measure flow of the mean field system, and we demonstrate that the solutions of this master equation are sufficiently regular. We then show that exponential stability of the mean field system is implied by exponential stability for solutions of the linearized Kolmogorov equation with a source term. Finally, we show that our results can be applied to the study of mean field games and give a new condition for the existence of a unique stationary distribution for a nonlinear Markov chain.</description>

      <title>A diagrammatic formulation of local realism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given two parties performing experiments in separate laboratories, we provide a diagrammatic formulation of what it means for the joint statistics of their experiments to satisfy local realism. In particular, we show that the principles of locality and realism are both captured by a single commutative diagram in the category of probability-preserving maps between finite probability spaces, and we also show that an assumption of such a diagrammatic formulation of local realism implies the standard CHSH inequality associated with dichotomic random variables. As quantum theory is known not to satisfy local realism, our formulation of local realism in terms of commutative diagrams provides yet another way in which the notion of non-commutativity plays a fundamental role in quantum theory. We note that we do not assume any prior knowledge of category theory or quantum theory, as this work is intended for philosophers, mathematicians and physicists alike.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of Quantum Likelihood Operators (LO) and their connection with quantum Fisher information (QFI). It is observed that the present approaches to this problem tacitly assume commutativity of parametrised density matrix $\rho_\theta$ and its derivative, which, in general, need not be true, and this has nontrivial consequences in QFI. As examples, we discuss the parametrised two-level system exhaustively, and, as a further example, the one-mode coherent states of an infinite-dimensional system.</description>

      <title>Scalability of the second-order reliability method for stochastic differential equations with multiplicative noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show how to efficiently compute asymptotically sharp estimates of extreme event probabilities in stochastic differential equations (SDEs) with small multiplicative Brownian noise. The underlying approximation is known as sharp large deviation theory or precise Laplace asymptotics in mathematics, the second-order reliability method (SORM) in reliability engineering, and the instanton or optimal fluctuation method with 1-loop corrections in physics. It is based on approximating the tail probability in question with the most probable realization of the stochastic process, and local perturbations around this realization. We first recall and contextualize the relevant classical theoretical result on precise Laplace asymptotics of diffusion processes [Ben Arous (1988), Stochastics, 25(3), 125-153], and then show how to compute the involved infinite-dimensional quantities - operator traces and Carleman-Fredholm determinants - numerically in a way that is scalable with respect to the time discretization and remains feasible in high spatial dimensions. Using tools from automatic differentiation, we achieve a straightforward black-box numerical computation of the SORM estimates in JAX. The method is illustrated in examples of SDEs and stochastic partial differential equations, including a two-dimensional random advection-diffusion model of a passive scalar. We thereby demonstrate that it is possible to obtain efficient and accurate SORM estimates for very high-dimensional problems, as long as the infinite-dimensional structure of the problem is correctly taken into account. Our JAX implementation of the method is made publicly available.</description>

      <title>Decay of resolvent kernels and Schr\"odinger eigenstates for L\'evy operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the spatial decay behaviour of resolvent kernels for a large class of non-local L\'evy operators and bound states of the corresponding Schr\"odinger operators. Our findings naturally lead us to proving results for L\'evy measures, which have subexponential or exponential decay, respectively. This leads to sharp transitions in the the decay rates of the resolvent kernels. We obtain estimates that allow us to describe and understand the intricate decay behaviour of the resolvent kernels and the bound states in either regime, extending findings by Carmona, Masters and Simon for fractional Laplacians (the subexponential regime) and classical relativistic operators (the exponential regime). Our proofs are mainly based on methods from the theory of operator semigroups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Results regarding off-diagonal Gaussian upper heat kernel bounds on discrete weighted graphs with possibly unbounded geometry are summarized and related.
  After reviewing uniform upper heat kernel bounds obtained by Carlen, Kusuoka, and Stroock, the universal Gaussian term on graphs found by Davies is addressed and related to corresponding results in terms of intrinsic metrics. Then we present a version of Grigor'yan's two-point method with Gaussian term involving an intrinsic metric. A discussion of upper heat kernel bounds for graph Laplacians with possibly unbounded but integrable weights on bounded combinatorial graphs preceeds the presentation of compatible bounds for anti-trees, an example of combinatorial graph with unbounded Laplacian. Characterizations of localized heat kernel bounds in terms of intrinsic metrics and universal Gaussian are reconsidered. Finally, the problem of optimality of the Gaussian term is discussed by relating Davies' optimal metric with the supremum over all intrinsic metrics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the success of Sinkhorn's algorithm for entropic optimal transport, we study convergence properties of iterative proportional fitting procedures (IPFP) used to solve more general information projection problems. We establish exponential convergence guarantees for the IPFP whenever the set of probability measures which is projected onto is defined through constraints arising from linear function spaces. This unifies and extends recent results from multi-marginal, adapted and martingale optimal transport. The proofs are based on strong convexity arguments for the dual problem, and the key contribution is to illuminate the role of the geometric interplay between the subspaces defining the constraints. In this regard, we show that the larger the angle (in the sense of Friedrichs) between the linear function spaces, the better the rate of contraction of the IPFP.</description>

      <title>Minimax rate for learning kernels in operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning kernels in operators from data lies at the intersection of inverse problems and statistical learning, offering a powerful framework for capturing nonlocal dependency in function spaces and high-dimensional settings. In contrast to classical nonparametric regression, where the inverse problem is well-posed, kernel estimation involves a compact normal operator and an ill-posed deconvolution. To address these challenges, we introduce adaptive spectral Sobolev spaces, unifying Sobolev spaces and reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, that automatically discard non-identifiable components and control terms with small eigenvalues. Within this framework, we establish the minimax convergence rates for the mean squared error under both polynomial and exponential spectral decay regimes. Methodologically, we develop a tamed least squares estimator achieving the minimax upper rates via controlling the left-tail probability for eigenvalues of the random normal matrix; and for the minimax lower rates, we resolve challenges from infinite-dimensional measures through their projections.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we prove large deviation principles for the empirical measures associated with the Independent Metropolis Hastings (IMH) sampler and the Metropolis-adjusted Langevin Algorithm (MALA). These are the first large deviation results for empirical measures of Markov chains arising from specific Metropolis-Hastings methods on a continuous state space. Moreover, we show that the existing large deviation framework, that we developed in a previous work (Milinanni and Nyquist, 2024), does not cover the Random Walk Metropolis sampler, even in cases when the underlying Markov chain is geometrically ergodic.</description>

      <title>Gelation in Vector Multiplicative Coalescence and Extinction in Multi-Type Poisson Branching Processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06910v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Random coalescent processes and branching processes are two fundamental constructs in the field of stochastic processes, each with a rich history and a wide range of applications. Though developed within distinct contexts, in this note we present a novel connection between a multi-type (vector) multiplicative coalescent process and a multi-type branching process with Poisson offspring distributions. More specifically, we show that the equations that govern the phenomenon of gelation in the vector multiplicative coalescent process are equivalent to the set of equations that yield the extinction probabilities of the corresponding multi-type Poisson branching process. We then leverage this connection with two applications, one in each direction. The first is a new quick proof of gelation in the vector multiplicative coalescent process using a well known result of branching processes, and the second is a new series expression for the extinction probabilities of the multi-type Poisson branching process using results derived from the theory of vector multiplicative coalescence. While the correspondence is fairly straightforward, it illuminates a deep connection between these two paradigms which we hope will continue to reveal new insights and potential for cross-disciplinary research.</description>

      <title>On a class of exponential changes of measure for stochastic PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08057v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a mild solution $X$ to a semilinear stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE), we consider an exponential change of measure based on its infinitesimal generator $L$, defined in the topology of bounded pointwise convergence. The changed measure $\mathbb{P}^h$ depends on the choice of a function $h$ in the domain of $L$. In our main result, we derive conditions on $h$ for which the change of measure is of Girsanov-type. The process $X$ under $\mathbb{P}^h$ is then shown to be a mild solution to another SPDE with an extra additive drift-term. We illustrate how different choices of $h$ impact the law of $X$ under $\mathbb{P}^h$ in selected applications. These include the derivation of an infinite-dimensional diffusion bridge as well as the introduction of guided processes for SPDEs, generalizing results known for finite-dimensional diffusion processes to the infinite-dimensional case.</description>

      <title>Rigidity of random stationary measures and applications to point processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18519v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The {\it number rigidity} of a stationary point process $\mathsf{P}$ entails that for a bounded set $A$ the knowledge of $\mathsf{P}$ on $A^{c}$ a.s. determines $\mathsf{P}(A)$; the $k$-order rigidity means the moments of $\mathsf{P}1_{A}$ up to order $k$ can be recovered. We show that $k$-rigidity occurs if the continuous component $\mathscr{s}$ of $\mathsf{P}$'s {\it structure factor} has a zero of order $k$ in $0$, by exploiting a connection with Schwartz's Paley-Wiener theorem for analytic functions of exponential type; these results apply to any random $L^{2}$ wide sense stationary measure on $\mathbb{R}^{d}$ or $\mathbb{Z}^{d}$. In the continuous setting, these local conditions are also necessary if $\mathscr{s}$ has finitely many zeros, or is isotropic, or at the opposite separable. This explains why no model seems to exhibit rigidity in dimension $d\geqslant 3$, and allows to efficiently recover many recent rigidity results about point processes. For a field on $\mathbb{Z} ^{d}$, these results hold provided $\# A &gt;2k$. For a continuous Determinantal point process with reduced kernel $\kappa$, $k$-rigidity is equivalent to $(1- \widehat {\kappa ^{2}})^{-1}$ having a zero of order $k$ in $0$, which answers questions on completeness and number rigidity. We also deduce some non-integrability results in the less tractable realm of Riesz gases. Finally, we are able to prove that random stationary quasicrystals are maximally rigid on any compact.</description>

      <title>Construction of distorted Brownian motion with permeable sticky behaviour on sets with Lebesgue measure zero</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13814v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The starting point is a gradient Dirichlet form with respect to $\varrho\lambda^d$ on the space $L^2({\mathbb{R}}^d, \varrho\mu)$. Here $\lambda^d$ is the Lebesgue measure on ${\mathbb R}^d$, $\varrho$ a strictly positive density and $\mu$ puts weight on a set $A\subset {\mathbb R}^d$ with Lebesgue measure zero. We show that the Dirichlet form admits an associated stochastic process $X$.
  We derive an explicit representation of the corresponding generator if $A$ is a Lipschitz boundary. This representation together with the Fukushima decomposition identifies $X$ as a distorted Brownian motion with drift given by the logarithmic derivative of $\varrho$ in ${\mathbb R}^d \setminus A$. Furthermore, we prove $X$ to be irreducible and recurrent. Finally, via ergodicity we prove positive s\'ejour time of $X$ on $A$. Hence we obtain a stochastic process $X$ with permeable sticky behaviour on $A$.</description>

      <title>Poisson statistics, vanishing correlations, and extremal particle limits for symmetric exclusion in d &gt; 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10522v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the symmetric simple exclusion system on $\mathbb{Z}^d$, $d \ge 2$, starting from a class of ``step'' initial conditions in which particles are constrained within a half-space. One may count the number $N_t$ of particles that have moved beyond a distance $z = z(t)$ into the initially-empty half of $\mathbb{Z}^d$ at time $t$. We show in large generality that when $\lim_{t\to\infty} E[N_t]$ exists, correlations between particles beyond $z$ vanish as $t \to \infty$ so as to allow convergence of $N_t$ to the same Poisson distribution one would get were the particles allowed to move independently. When the initial condition constrains a region of polynomial growth, we identify $z(t)$ and the limit of $E[N_t]$ explicitly. As a consequence of the limit, we obtain a Gumbel limit distribution for the extremal particle position, as well as the limiting distributions of all order statistics.</description>

      <title>Mean-Field Analysis of Latent Variable Process Models on Dynamically Evolving Graphs with Feedback Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04280v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the asymptotic behavior of a class of dynamic co-evolving latent space networks. The model we study is subject to bi-directional feedback effects, meaning that at any given time, the latent process depends on its own value and the graph structure at the previous time step, and the graph structure at the current time depends on the value of the latent processes at the current time but also on the graph structure at the previous time instance (sometimes called a persistence effect). We construct the mean-field limit of this model, which we use to characterize the limiting behavior of a random sample taken from the latent space network in the limit as the number of nodes in the network diverges. From this limiting model, we can derive the limiting behavior of the empirical measure of the latent process and establish the related graphon limit of the latent particle network process. We also provide a description of the rich conditional probabilistic structure of the limiting model. The inherent dependence structure complicates the mathematical analysis significantly. In the process of proving our main results, we derive a general conditional propagation of chaos result, which is of independent interest. In addition, our novel approach of studying the limiting behavior of random samples proves to be a very useful methodology for fully grasping the asymptotic behavior of co-evolving particle systems. Numerical results are included to illustrate the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Instability of backoff protocols with arbitrary arrival rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.17144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.17144v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In contention resolution, multiple processors are trying to coordinate to send discrete messages through a shared channel with limited communication. If two processors send at the same time, the messages collide and are not transmitted successfully. Queue-free backoff protocols are an important special case - for example, Google Drive and AWS instruct their users to implement binary exponential backoff to handle busy periods. It is a long-standing conjecture of Aldous (IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 1987) that no stable backoff protocols exist for any positive arrival rate of processors. This foundational question remains open; instability is only known in general when the arrival rate of processors is at least 0.42 (Goldberg et al. SICOMP 2004). We prove Aldous' conjecture for all backoff protocols outside of a tightly-constrained special case using a new domination technique to get around the main difficulty, which is the strong dependencies between messages.</description>

      <title>Gaussian upper heat kernel bounds and Faber-Krahn inequalities on graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11715v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the equivalence of relative Faber-Krahn inequalities and the conjunction of Gaussian upper heat kernel bounds and volume doubling on large scales on graphs. For the normalizing measure, we obtain their equivalence up to constants by imposing comparability of small balls and the vertex degree at their centers. Removing this comparability assumption on the cost of a local regularity condition entering the equivalence and allowing for a variable dimension lead to a further generalization. The variable dimension converges to the doubling dimension for increasing ball radius. If the counting measure or arbitrary measures are considered, the local regularity condition contains the vertex degree. Furthermore, correction functions for the Gaussian, doubling, and Faber-Krahn dimension depending on the vertex degree are introduced. For the Gaussian and doubling, the variable correction functions always tend to one at infinity. Moreover, the variable Faber-Krahn dimension can be related to the doubling dimension and the vertex degree growth.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric estimation of the multivariate Spearman's footrule: a further discussion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07665v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose two new estimators of the multivariate rank correlation coefficient Spearman's footrule which are based on two general estimators for Average Orthant Dependence measures. We compare the new proposals with a previous estimator existing in the literature and show that the three estimators are asymptotically equivalent, but, in small samples, one of the proposed estimators outperforms the others. We also analyse Pitman efficiency of these indices to test for multivariate independence as compared to multivariate versions of Kendall's tau and Spearman's rho.</description>

      <title>Finite-time blowup of a Brownian particle in a repulsive potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11796v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a Brownian particle performing an overdamped motion in a power-law repulsive potential. If the potential grows with the distance faster than quadratically, the particle escapes to infinity in a finite time. We determine the average blowup time and study the probability distribution of the blowup time. In particular, we show that the long-time tail of this probability distribution decays purely exponentially, while the short-time tail exhibits an essential singularity. These qualitative features turn out to be quite universal, as they occur for all rapidly growing power-law potentials in arbitrary spatial dimensions. The quartic potential is especially tractable, and we analyze it in more detail.</description>
