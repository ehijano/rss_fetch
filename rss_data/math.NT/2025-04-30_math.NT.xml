      <title>Finitude du groupe de Tate-Shafarevich pour les groupes de type multiplicatif constants sur des corps des fonctions</title>

Abstract: Let $k_0$ be a number field, $K$ be a finite extension of $k_0(\!(x_1,...,x_n)\!)$ and let $R$ be the integral closure of $k_0[[x_1,...,x_n]]$ in $K$. Consider a group of multiplicative type $G$ defined over $K$. We study the Tate-Shafarevich group given by elements of $H^1(K,G)$ locally trivial at completions of $K$ with respect to the points of codimension $1$ of $Spec(R)$. We show the finiteness of the Tate-Shafarevich group when $G$ comes from a group of multiplicative type $G_{k_0}$ defined over $k_0$ provided that two technical conditions are satisfied. We then prove that the Tate-Shafarevich group is trivial when the ring of integers $R$ is regular.

      <title>Integers Having $F_{2k}$ in Both Zeckendorf and Chung-Graham Decompositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zeckendorf's theorem states that every positive integer can be uniquely decomposed into nonadjacent Fibonacci numbers. On the other hand, Chung and Graham proved that every positive integer can be uniquely written as a sum of even-indexed Fibonacci numbers with coefficients $0,1$, or $2$ such that between two coefficients $2$, there is a coefficient $0$. For each $k\ge 1$, we find the set of all positive integers having $F_{2k}$ in both of their Zeckendorf and Chung-Graham decompositions.</description>

      <title>Primes represented by shifted quadratic forms: on primitivity and congruence classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove lower bounds of the form $\gg N/(\log N)^{3/2}$ for the number of primes up to $N$ primitively represented by a shifted positive definite integral binary quadratic form, and under the additional condition that primes are from an arithmetic progression. This extends the sieve methods of Iwaniec, who showed such lower bounds without the primitivity and congruence conditions. Imposing primitivity adds some subtleties to the local criteria for representation of a shifted prime: for example, some shifted quadratic forms of discriminant $5 \pmod{8}$ do not primitively represent infinitely many primes. We also provide a careful list of the local conditions under which a genus of an integral binary quadratic form represents an integer, verified by computer, and correcting some minor errors in previous statements. The motivation for this work is as a tool for the study of prime components in Apollonian circle packings [FFH+24]</description>

      <title>The number of cuspidal representations over a function field and its behavior under base changes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a smooth projective curve over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$, $k$ be its function field, and $G$ be a simply connected almost simple split group over $\mathbb{F}_q$. We also write $G$ for its structure over $k$. We calculate the sum of multiplicities of all cuspidal representations of $G$ satisfying a given condition assuming the conjectural trace formula. We also observe how the sum changes if we replace $X$ by its base change $X\otimes_{\mathbb{F}_q}\mathbb{F}_{q^m}$.</description>

      <title>Mordell--Lang and disparate Selmer ranks of odd twists of some superelliptic curves over global function fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fix a prime number $\ell \geq 5$. Let $K = \mathbb{F}_q(t)$ be a global function field of characteristic $p$ coprime to $2,3$, and $q \equiv 1 \text{ mod } \ell$. Let $C:y^\ell = F(x)$ be a non-isotrivial superelliptic curve over $K$ such that $F$ is a degree $3$ polynomial over $\mathbb{F}_q(t)$. Denote by $C_f: fy^\ell = F(x)$ the twist of $C$ by a polynomial $f$ over $\mathbb{F}_q$. Assuming some conditions on $C$, we show that the expected number of $K$-rational points of $C_f$ is bounded, and at least $99\%$ of such curves $C_f$ have at most $(3p)^{5\ell} \cdot \ell!$ many $K$-rational points, as $f$ ranges over the set of polynomials of sufficiently large degree over $\mathbb{F}_q$. To achieve this, we compute the distribution of dimensions of $1-\zeta_\ell$ Selmer groups of Jacobians of such superelliptic curves. This is done by generalizing the technique of constructing a governing Markov operator, as developed from previous studies by Klagsbrun--Mazur--Rubin, Yu, and the author. As a byproduct, we prove that the density of odd twist families of such superelliptic curves with even Selmer ranks cannot be equal to $50\%$, a disparity phenomena observed in previous works by Klagsbrun--Mazur--Rubin, Yu, and Morgan for quadratic twist families of principally polarized abelian varieties.</description>

      <title>The relative entropy of primes in arithmetic progressions is really small</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fix a modulus $q$. One would expect the number of primes in each invertible residue class mod $q$ to be multinomially distributed, i.e. for each $p \,\mathrm{mod}\, q$ to behave like an independent random variable uniform on $(\mathbb{Z}/q\mathbb{Z})^\times$. Using techniques from data science, we discover overwhelming evidence to the contrary: primes are much more uniformly distributed than iid uniform random variables. This phenomenon was previously unknown, and there is no clear theoretical explanation for it.
  To demonstrate that our test statistic of choice, the KL divergence, is indeed extreme, we prove new bounds for the left tail of the relative entropy of the uniform multinomial using the method of types.</description>

      <title>L\'{e}vy-Khintchine Theorems: effective results and central limit theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20718v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The L\'evy-Khintchine theorem is a classical result in Diophantine approximation that describes the asymptotic growth of the denominators of convergents in the continued fraction expansion of a typical real number. An effective version of this theorem was proved by Phillip and Stackelberg (\textit{Math. Annalen}, 1969). In this work, we develop a new approach towards effectivising the L\'evy-Khintchine theorem. Our methods extend to the setting of higher-dimensional simultaneous Diophantine approximation, thereby providing an effective version of a theorem of Cheung and Chevallier (\textit{Annales scientifiques de l'ENS}, 2024). In addition, we prove a central limit theorem for best approximations in all dimensions. Our approach relies on techniques from homogeneous dynamics.</description>

      <title>Kolyvagin systems of rank 0 and the structure of the Selmer group of elliptic curves over abelian extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the motivation to study the Selmer group af an elliptic curve, we improve the theory of Kolyvagin systems to describe the Fitting ideals of a Selmer group in the core rank zero situation. By relaxing a Selmer structure of rank zero at certain prime, we can construct an auxiliary Kolyvagin system whose localisation determines most of the Fitting ideals of the Selmer group, and all of them when the Galois representation is not self-dual. With this new theory, one can describe, in terms of the modular symbols, the Galois structure of the Selmer group of an elliptic curve $E/\mathbb{Q}$ over a finite abelian extension whose degree is coprime to $p$.</description>

      <title>On the structure of the dimension spectrum for continued fraction expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse the dimension spectrum of continued fractions expansions with coefficients restricted to infinite subsets of $ \mathbb{N}$. We prove that the set of powers $P_q=\{q^n\colon n\in \mathbb{N}\}$ has full dimension spectrum for each integer $q\geq 2$, answering a question by Chousionis, Leykekhman and Urba\'nski. On the other hand, we show that the dimension spectrum for $P^*_q=\{q^n\colon n\in \mathbb{N}\}\cup\{1\}$ has many gaps and regions where it is nowhere dense. We also investigate the case where $A$ is generated by a monomial, $M_q=\{n^q\colon n\in\mathbb{N}\}$. For $M_q$ we prove that the dimension spectrum is full for $q\in\{1,2,3,4,5\}$, and it has a gap for each $q\geq 6$. Furthermore we show for $q\in\{6,7,8\}$ that the dimension spectrum of $M_q$ is the disjoint union of two nontrivial closed intervals, and it is the disjoint union of three nontrivial closed intervals for $q \in\{9,10\}$. For $q\geq 11$ we show that the dimension spectrum of $M_q$ consists of finitely many disjoint nontrivial closed intervals. The results concerning $M_q$ extend existing results for $q=1$ and $q=2$. In our analysis we employ Perron-Frobenius (transfer) operators, and numerical tools developed by Falk and Nussbaum that give rigorous estimates for the Hausdorff dimension for continued fractions expansions.</description>

      <title>A generalization of Ramanujan's sum over finite groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite group, and let $x \in G$. Denote by $\langle x^G \rangle$ the normal subgroup of $G$ generated by the conjugacy class of $x$, and define $[x^G] := \{ y \in G : \langle x^G \rangle = \langle y^G \rangle \}$. For any irreducible character $\chi$ of $G$, we define the character sum \begin{align} C_{\chi}(x):= \frac{1}{\chi(\textbf{1})} \sum_{s \in [x^G]} \chi(s),\nonumber \end{align} where $\textbf{1}$ is the identity of $G$. In 1979, Babai proved that $C_{\chi}(x)$ is an eigenvalue of the Cayley graph $\text{Cay}(G, [x^G])$. When $G$ is a finite cyclic group and $x$ is a generator, this sum coincides with the classical Ramanujan sum. Thus, $C_{\chi}(x)$ can be viewed as a generalization of the Ramanujan sum to arbitrary finite groups. A well-known formula for the classical Ramanujan sum involves the M$\ddot{\text{o}}$bius function and Euler's phi function. In this work, we derive an explicit formula for the character sum $C_{\chi}(x)$, which extends the formula of classical Ramanujan sum to the context of finite groups. This generalization not only enrich the theory of Ramanujan's sum but also provide new tools in spectral graph theory, representation theory, and algebraic number theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide some novel binomial convolution related to symmetric functions, as well as convolution sums without the binomial symbol. Moreover we give some new convolution sums of Bernoulli, Euler, and Genocchi numbers and polynomials with symmetric functions , by making use of the elementary methods including exponential generating functions. From these convolutions we deduce several new combinatorial identities for bivariate polynomials, and we establish several new identities related Bernoulli, Euler and Genocchi numbers and polynomials with certain bivariate polynomials such as bivariate Fibonacci, bivariate Lucas, bivariate balancing and bivariate balancing-Lucas polynomials.</description>

      <title>Sharpening Vahlen's result in Diophantine approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: n this paper we refine Vahlen's 1895 result in Diophantine approximation by providing sharper bounds for the approximation coefficients, especially when at least one of the partial quotients $a_n$ or $a_{n+1}$ of the regular continued fraction expansion $[a_0;a_1,a_2,\dots]$ of $x$ is 1. An improvement of Vahlen's result was already given in papers by Jaroslav Han\u{c}l ([9]), Han\u{c}l and Silvie Bahnerova ([10]), and by Dinesh Sharma Bhattarai ([5]), but the approach of the present paper is very different from Han\u{c}l c.s. We believe that the geometrical methods used in this paper not only offer a significant improvement over Vahlen's result, but also yield new insights that can contribute to improving Borel's classical constant.</description>

      <title>An Explicit Uniform Mordell Conjecture over Function Fields of Characteristic Zero</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.02101v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give an explicit uniform result on the Mordell conjecture for non-isotrivial curves over function field of characteristic 0. The proof is based on Vojta's method, and make use of Zhang's admissible adelic line bundles and a quantitative proof of the Bogomolov conjecture by Looper-Silverman-Wilms.</description>

      <title>Bilateral Bailey Lattices and Andrews-Gordon Type Identities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.02346v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the Bailey lattice can be extended to a bilateral version in just a few lines from the bilateral Bailey lemma, using a very simple lemma transforming bilateral Bailey pairs relative to $a$ into bilateral Bailey pairs relative to $a/q$. Using this and similar lemmas, we give bilateral versions and simple proofs of other (new and known) Bailey lattices, including a Bailey lattice of Warnaar and the inverses of Bailey lattices of Lovejoy. As consequences of our bilateral point of view, we derive new $m$-versions of the Andrews-Gordon identities, Bressoud's identities, a new companion to Bressoud's identities, and the Bressoud-G\"ollnitz-Gordon identities. Finally, we give a new elementary proof of another very general identity of Bressoud using one of our Bailey lattices.</description>

      <title>The Hasse norm principle for some non-Galois extensions of square-free degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.12550v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the Hasse norm principle for some non-Galois extensions of number fields. Our main theorem is that for any square-free composite number $d$ which is divisible by at least one of $3$, $55$, $91$ or $95$, there exists a finite extension of degree $d$ for which the Hasse norm principle fails. To accomplish it, we determine the structure of the Tate--Shafarevich groups of norm one tori for finite extensions of degree $d$ under the normality of $p$-Sylow subgroups of the Galois groups of their Galois closures for a square-free prime factor $p$ of $d$. Moreover, we reduce the assertion to an investigation of $2$-dimensional $\mathbb{F}_p$-representations of some groups of order coprime to $p$.</description>

      <title>Eratosthenes sieve supports the $k$-tuple conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20470v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Viewing Eratosthenes sieve as a discrete dynamic system, we show that every admissible instance of every admissible constellation of gaps arises and persists in Eratosthenes sieve. For an admissible constellation of length J, we show that its population across stages of the sieve is consistent with the Hardy and Littlewood estimates from 1923. This work strongly connects Eratosthenes sieve to the k-tuple conjecture, and it provides a compact notation, primorial coordinates, for tracking the locations of admissible instances for a constellation.</description>

      <title>A positive Siegel theorem: Dynkin friezes and positive Mordell-Schinzel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08800v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We determine the number of positive integral points on $n$-dimensional affine varieties associated to arbitrary $n \times n$ generalized Cartan matrices. An application to the theory of cluster algebras and combinatorics is the resolution of the Fontaine-Plamondon conjecture, which says that there are exactly $4400$ and $26952$ positive integral friezes of type $E_7$ and $E_8$ respectively. An application to number theory refines and generalizes theorems of Mohanty, Mordell, and Schinzel to the positive integers and higher dimensions by exhibiting examples of Diophantine equations $xyz = G(x, y)$ and $xyzw = G(x, y, z)$ of every degree greater than $3$ with infinitely many positive integral solutions.</description>

      <title>Greedy Regular Convolutions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02795v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a class of convolutions on arithmetical functions that are regular in the sense of of Narkiewicz, homogeneous in the sense of Burnett et al, and bounded, in the sense that there exists a common finite bound for the rank of primitive numbers. Among these "greedy convolutions" the unitary convolution and the "ternary convolution" are particularly interesting: they are the only regular, homogeneous convolutions where each primitive number have the same finite rank. While the greedy convolution of length 3, also described in detail, has primitive numbers of rank 3 and rank 1, it is still special in that the set of primitives can be generated by a simple recursive procedure that we name selective sifting.</description>

      <title>Diophantine approximation with integers represented by binary quadratic forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09650v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For any given positive definite binary quadratic form $Q$ with integer coefficients, we establish two results on Diophantine approximation with integers represented by $Q$. Firstly, we show that for every irrational number $\alpha$, there exist infinitely many positive integers $n$ represented by $Q$ and satisfying $||\alpha n||&lt;n^{-(1/2-\varepsilon)}$ for any fixed but arbitrarily small $\varepsilon&gt;0$. This is an easy consequence of a result by Cook on small fractional parts of diagonal quadratic forms. Secondly, we give a quantitative version with a lower bound of this result when the exponent $1/2-\varepsilon$ is replaced by any fixed $\gamma&lt;3/7$. To this end, we use the Voronoi summation formula and a bound for bilinear forms with Kloosterman sums to fixed moduli by Kerr, Shparlinski, Wu and Xi.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we define the multiple Eisenstein series in positive characteristic, with Thakur's multiple zeta values appearing as the "constant terms" of their expansions in terms of "multiple Goss sums". We show that the multiple Eisenstein series satisfy the same $q$-shuffle relations as the multiple zeta values do, thereby lifting the relations from "values" to "functions".</description>

      <title>Maximal curves over finite fields and a modular isogeny</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18894v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the existence of curves of genus $7$ and $12$ over the field with $11^5$ elements, reaching the Hasse-Weil-Serre upper bound. These curves are quotients of modular curves and we give explicit equations. We compute the number of points of many quotient modular curves in the same family without providing equations. For various pairs (genus, finite field) we find new records for the largest known number of points. In other instances we find quotient modular curves that are maximal, matching already known results. To perform these computations, we provide a generalization of Chen's isogeny result.</description>

      <title>On the Grothendieck ring of varieties in positive characteristic</title>

      <description>arXiv:1811.02614v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proves two theorems (1) Let $k$ be an algebraically closed field of characteristic $p&gt;0$. I prove (Theorem 2.1.1) that if, $p &gt; 13$ or $p = 11$, then the isomorphism class of any supersingular elliptic curve is a zero divisor in the ring of smooth, complete $k$-varieties and Bittner relations. In particular, this ring contains zero divisors. The proof proceeds via establishing (in Theorem 2.2.1) that the Albanese variety functor is a motivic measure. (2) I prove (Theorem 3.1) that the etale fundamental group of a smooth, proper variety over any alg. clsoed field k (in any characteristic) also provides a motivic measure on this ring. In particular, the etale fundamental group is a motivic measure on the Grothendieck ring of varieties over complex numbers.</description>

      <title>An average case efficient algorithm for solving two variable linear diophantine equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14052v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solving two variable linear Diophantine equations has application in many cryptographic protocols such as RSA and Elliptic curve cryptography. The Extended Euclid's algorithm is the most widely used algorithm to solve these equations. We revisit two algorithms to solve two variable linear Diophantine equations. For one of those, we do a fine-grained analysis of the number of recursive calls and arrive at a periodic function that represents the number of recursive calls. We find the period and use it to derive an accurate closed-form expression for the average number of recursive calls incurred by that algorithm. We find multiple loose upper bounds on the average number of recursive calls in different cases based on whether a solution exists or not. If we know that for a fixed value of $a,b$ and a varying $c$, an equation $ax+by=c$ (where $a&gt;b$) is solvable, then we can find the solution in $O\left(\frac{\log b}{gcd(a,b)}\right)$ average number of recursion or steps. We computationally evaluate this bound as well as one more upper bound and compare them with the average number of recursive calls in Extended Euclid's algorithm on a number of random $ n$-bit inputs. We observe that the average number of iterations in the analyzed algorithm decreases with an increase in $gcd(a,b)$. We propose an iterative version of the algorithm. We implement this algorithm and find that the average number of iterations by our algorithm is less than that of two existing algorithms.</description>

      <title>Ellipsoidal designs and the Prouhet--Tarry--Escott problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17106v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The notion of ellipsoidal design was first introduced by Pandey (2022) as a full generalization of spherical designs on the unit circle $S^1$. In this paper, we elucidate the advantages of examining the connections between ellipsoidal design and the two-dimensional Prouhet--Tarry--Escott problem, say ${\mathrm PTE}_2$, originally introduced by Alpers and Tijdeman (2007) as a natural generalization of the classical one-dimensional PTE problem (${\mathrm PTE}_1$). We first provide a combinatorial criterion for the construction of solutions of ${\mathrm PTE}_2$ from a pair of ellipsoidal designs. We also give an arithmetic proof of the Stroud-type bound for ellipsoidal designs, and then establish a classification theorem for designs with equality. Such a classification result is closely related to an open question on the existence of rational spherical $4$-designs on $S^1$, discussed in Cui, Xia and Xiang (2019). As far as the authors know, a solution found by Alpers and Tijdeman is the first and the only known parametric ideal solution of degree $5$ for ${\mathrm PTE}_2$. Moreover, as one of our main theorems, we prove that the Alpers--Tijdeman solution is equivalent to a certain two-dimensional extension of the famous Borwein solution for ${\mathrm PTE}_1$. As a by-product of this theorem, we discover a family of ellipsoidal $5$-designs among the Alpers--Tijdeman solution.</description>
