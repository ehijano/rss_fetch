      <title>Comparisons of Infinite Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper describes new comparisons of arbitrary infinite sets, both in terms of cardinality and in terms of other constructions, which result in set comparisons characterized by what it calls ``totality.'' It then explores the use of outer measure to get one such comparison: for subsets of a metric space X vis-a-vis subsets of its power set P(X).</description>

      <title>Numerical Behavior of the Riemann Zeta Function Using Real-to-Complex Conversion Without Gram Points or Bracketing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Riemann zeta function and the distribution of its nontrivial zeros on the critical line remain central topics in analytic number theory and large-scale computation. This work develops a numerical framework that replaces classical Gram-point bracketing with a real-to-complex parametrization of the critical line. Combined with high-precision evaluation of the Hardy Z function using the Riemann-Siegel formula with Gabcke type remainder control, this parametrization induces a Valley Scanner algorithm that identifies local minima of the absolute value of Z and refines them using safeguarded Newton iterations. The method exploits the mountain-valley geometry of the Z function rather than sign changes, and is implemented in a cloud based C language and MPFR pipeline with parallel execution on multi-core CPU instances. The paper reports Zero computations from the classical low lying range up to heights near 1e20, compares the observed spacing of zeros with Riemann - von Mangoldt predictions across several test windows, and summarizes consistency checks based on independent datasets and a local ball test. The work also introduces a fully real staircase formulation of the explicit-formula correction term for the Chebyshev function, expressed directly in terms of the zero ordinates and derived quantities. All numerical datasets, Docker images, and reproducibility materials are publicly archived via Zenodo and GitHub.</description>

      <title>Solving fuzzy linear systems in Gaussian PDMF space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04709v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We solve the fuzzy linear systems in a fuzzy number space $\mathcal{X}$, namely the Gaussian probability density membership function (Gaussian-PDMF) space. The fuzzy linear systems include two types: the semi-fuzzy linear system (SFLS) and the fully-fuzzy linear system (FFLS). First, we solve the SFLS $A \bm{\tilde{x}}= \bm{\tilde{b}}$, where $A\in \mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$ is a real-valued matrix, $\bm{\tilde{b}}$ is a fuzzy number vector, and $\bm{\tilde{x}}$ is the unknown fuzzy number vector. The elements of both $\bm{\tilde{b}}$ and $\bm{\tilde{x}}$ belong to $\mathcal{X}$. We present the Cramer's rule to calculate the solution with square matrix $A$ and find out that its solution set is a $5(n-R(A))$ dimensional affine space with $A\in \mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$ and $R(A)$ being the rank of $A$. The explicit form of the solution for RREF matrix $A$ is stated to ensure usability for modeling. Secondly, we solve the FFLS $\bm{\tilde{A}}\bm{\tilde{x}}=\bm{\tilde{b}}$, where $\bm{\tilde{A}}$ is a fuzzy matrix with all components in $\mathcal{X}$. We analyze its solution set and present the parametric form of solutions under the fuzzy RREF matrix. We then adapt Gaussian elimination method to fuzzy matrices and systems by restricting it to the unit group of ring $\mathcal{X}$, proving the equivalence of solution sets after elementary row operations. We also establish the connection between FFLS and SFLS by confining elements of $\bm{\tilde{A}}$ to a subset of $\mathcal{X}$ that forms a field. Two numerical examples are given to illustrated our method. All results in this paper are explicit since the Gaussian-PDMF space $\mathcal{X}$, to which the membership function of the fuzzy number belongs, possesses a complete algebraic structure. The proposed framework offers a systematical tool for solving the mathematical models using fuzzy linear systems with uncertainty and fuzziness.</description>

      <title>Schur-Convex Curvature on Dihedral Exponential Families and the Golden-Ratio Stationary Point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20845v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the Schur-complement curvature of D_N-equivariant folded exponential families on the simplex. Our main structural results are: (i) the curvature kappa_Schur(theta) is convex in the log-parameter theta = ln(q); (ii) it admits a unique stationary point at the golden ratio value q* = phi^-2 (in particular for N = 12); and (iii) it obeys a quadratic folded law kappa_Schur = A(N, m_rho^2) I_1^2 + B(N, m_rho^2) (I_2 - I_1^2), with coefficients A, B determined explicitly by the projector metric of radius m_rho^2. Taken together, these results show that convexity and symmetry alone enforce both the location and the functional form of the "golden lock-in."
  Beyond their intrinsic interest, these findings identify D_12 as the minimal dihedral lattice where parity (mod 2) and three-cycle (mod 3) constraints coexist, producing a structurally stable equilibrium at the golden ratio. This places the golden ratio not as an accident of parameterization but as a necessary consequence of convex geometry under dihedral symmetry. Possible applications include harmonic analysis on group orbits, invariant convex optimization, and the structure of tilings or quasicrystal-like systems.</description>
