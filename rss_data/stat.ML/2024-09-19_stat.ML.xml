      <title>Outlier Detection with Cluster Catch Digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel family of outlier detection algorithms based on Cluster Catch Digraphs (CCDs), specifically tailored to address the challenges of high dimensionality and varying cluster shapes, which deteriorate the performance of most traditional outlier detection methods. We propose the Uniformity-Based CCD with Mutual Catch Graph (U-MCCD), the Uniformity- and Neighbor-Based CCD with Mutual Catch Graph (UN-MCCD), and their shape-adaptive variants (SU-MCCD and SUN-MCCD), which are designed to detect outliers in data sets with arbitrary cluster shapes and high dimensions. We present the advantages and shortcomings of these algorithms and provide the motivation or need to define each particular algorithm. Through comprehensive Monte Carlo simulations, we assess their performance and demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of our algorithms across various settings and contamination levels. We also illustrate the use of our algorithms on various real-life data sets. The U-MCCD algorithm efficiently identifies outliers while maintaining high true negative rates, and the SU-MCCD algorithm shows substantial improvement in handling non-uniform clusters. Additionally, the UN-MCCD and SUN-MCCD algorithms address the limitations of existing methods in high-dimensional spaces by utilizing Nearest Neighbor Distances (NND) for clustering and outlier detection. Our results indicate that these novel algorithms offer substantial advancements in the accuracy and adaptability of outlier detection, providing a valuable tool for various real-world applications.

      <title>Symmetry-Based Structured Matrices for Efficient Approximately Equivariant Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There has been much recent interest in designing symmetry-aware neural networks (NNs) exhibiting relaxed equivariance. Such NNs aim to interpolate between being exactly equivariant and being fully flexible, affording consistent performance benefits. In a separate line of work, certain structured parameter matrices -- those with displacement structure, characterized by low displacement rank (LDR) -- have been used to design small-footprint NNs. Displacement structure enables fast function and gradient evaluation, but permits accurate approximations via compression primarily to classical convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In this work, we propose a general framework -- based on a novel construction of symmetry-based structured matrices -- to build approximately equivariant NNs with significantly reduced parameter counts. Our framework integrates the two aforementioned lines of work via the use of so-called Group Matrices (GMs), a forgotten precursor to the modern notion of regular representations of finite groups. GMs allow the design of structured matrices -- resembling LDR matrices -- which generalize the linear operations of a classical CNN from cyclic groups to general finite groups and their homogeneous spaces. We show that GMs can be employed to extend all the elementary operations of CNNs to general discrete groups. Further, the theory of structured matrices based on GMs provides a generalization of LDR theory focussed on matrices with cyclic structure, providing a tool for implementing approximate equivariance for discrete groups. We test GM-based architectures on a variety of tasks in the presence of relaxed symmetry. We report that our framework consistently performs competitively compared to approximately equivariant NNs, and other structured matrix-based compression frameworks, sometimes with a one or two orders of magnitude lower parameter count.</description>

      <title>Cartan moving frames and the data manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to employ the language of Cartan moving frames to study the geometry of the data manifolds and its Riemannian structure, via the data information metric and its curvature at data points. Using this framework and through experiments, explanations on the response of a neural network are given by pointing out the output classes that are easily reachable from a given input. This emphasizes how the proposed mathematical relationship between the output of the network and the geometry of its inputs can be exploited as an explainable artificial intelligence tool.</description>

      <title>Fitting Multilevel Factor Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine a special case of the multilevel factor model, with covariance given by multilevel low rank (MLR) matrix~\cite{parshakova2023factor}. We develop a novel, fast implementation of the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, tailored for multilevel factor models, to maximize the likelihood of the observed data. This method accommodates any hierarchical structure and maintains linear time and storage complexities per iteration. This is achieved through a new efficient technique for computing the inverse of the positive definite MLR matrix. We show that the inverse of an invertible PSD MLR matrix is also an MLR matrix with the same sparsity in factors, and we use the recursive Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury matrix identity to obtain the factors of the inverse. Additionally, we present an algorithm that computes the Cholesky factorization of an expanded matrix with linear time and space complexities, yielding the covariance matrix as its Schur complement. This paper is accompanied by an open-source package that implements the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Decomposing Gaussians with Unknown Covariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Common workflows in machine learning and statistics rely on the ability to partition the information in a data set into independent portions. Recent work has shown that this may be possible even when conventional sample splitting is not (e.g., when the number of samples $n=1$, or when observations are not independent and identically distributed). However, the approaches that are currently available to decompose multivariate Gaussian data require knowledge of the covariance matrix. In many important problems (such as in spatial or longitudinal data analysis, and graphical modeling), the covariance matrix may be unknown and even of primary interest. Thus, in this work we develop new approaches to decompose Gaussians with unknown covariance. First, we present a general algorithm that encompasses all previous decomposition approaches for Gaussian data as special cases, and can further handle the case of an unknown covariance. It yields a new and more flexible alternative to sample splitting when $n&gt;1$. When $n=1$, we prove that it is impossible to partition the information in a multivariate Gaussian into independent portions without knowing the covariance matrix. Thus, we use the general algorithm to decompose a single multivariate Gaussian with unknown covariance into dependent parts with tractable conditional distributions, and demonstrate their use for inference and validation. The proposed decomposition strategy extends naturally to Gaussian processes. In simulation and on electroencephalography data, we apply these decompositions to the tasks of model selection and post-selection inference in settings where alternative strategies are unavailable.</description>

      <title>On the generalization ability of coarse-grained molecular dynamics models for non-equilibrium processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One essential goal of constructing coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) models is to accurately predict non-equilibrium processes beyond the atomistic scale. While a CG model can be constructed by projecting the full dynamics onto a set of resolved variables, the dynamics of the CG variables can recover the full dynamics only when the conditional distribution of the unresolved variables is close to the one associated with the particular projection operator. In particular, the model's applicability to various non-equilibrium processes is generally unwarranted due to the inconsistency in the conditional distribution. Here, we present a data-driven approach for constructing CGMD models that retain certain generalization ability for non-equilibrium processes. Unlike the conventional CG models based on pre-selected CG variables (e.g., the center of mass), the present CG model seeks a set of auxiliary CG variables based on the time-lagged independent component analysis to minimize the entropy contribution of the unresolved variables. This ensures the distribution of the unresolved variables under a broad range of non-equilibrium conditions approaches the one under equilibrium. Numerical results of a polymer melt system demonstrate the significance of this broadly-overlooked metric for the model's generalization ability, and the effectiveness of the present CG model for predicting the complex viscoelastic responses under various non-equilibrium flows.</description>

      <title>Partially Observable Contextual Bandits with Linear Payoffs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The standard contextual bandit framework assumes fully observable and actionable contexts. In this work, we consider a new bandit setting with partially observable, correlated contexts and linear payoffs, motivated by the applications in finance where decision making is based on market information that typically displays temporal correlation and is not fully observed. We make the following contributions marrying ideas from statistical signal processing with bandits: (i) We propose an algorithmic pipeline named EMKF-Bandit, which integrates system identification, filtering, and classic contextual bandit algorithms into an iterative method alternating between latent parameter estimation and decision making. (ii) We analyze EMKF-Bandit when we select Thompson sampling as the bandit algorithm and show that it incurs a sub-linear regret under conditions on filtering. (iii) We conduct numerical simulations that demonstrate the benefits and practical applicability of the proposed pipeline.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Decomposition and Error Margin Detection of Homodyned-K Distribution in Quantitative Ultrasound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Homodyned K-distribution (HK-distribution) parameter estimation in quantitative ultrasound (QUS) has been recently addressed using Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs). BNNs have been shown to significantly reduce computational time in speckle statistics-based QUS without compromising accuracy and precision. Additionally, they provide estimates of feature uncertainty, which can guide the clinician's trust in the reported feature value. The total predictive uncertainty in Bayesian modeling can be decomposed into epistemic (uncertainty over the model parameters) and aleatoric (uncertainty inherent in the data) components. By decomposing the predictive uncertainty, we can gain insights into the factors contributing to the total uncertainty. In this study, we propose a method to compute epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties for HK-distribution parameters ($\alpha$ and $k$) estimated by a BNN, in both simulation and experimental data. In addition, we investigate the relationship between the prediction error and both uncertainties, shedding light on the interplay between these uncertainties and HK parameters errors.</description>

      <title>The Sample Complexity of Smooth Boosting and the Tightness of the Hardcore Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Smooth boosters generate distributions that do not place too much weight on any given example. Originally introduced for their noise-tolerant properties, such boosters have also found applications in differential privacy, reproducibility, and quantum learning theory. We study and settle the sample complexity of smooth boosting: we exhibit a class that can be weak learned to $\gamma$-advantage over smooth distributions with $m$ samples, for which strong learning over the uniform distribution requires $\tilde{\Omega}(1/\gamma^2)\cdot m$ samples. This matches the overhead of existing smooth boosters and provides the first separation from the setting of distribution-independent boosting, for which the corresponding overhead is $O(1/\gamma)$.
  Our work also sheds new light on Impagliazzo's hardcore theorem from complexity theory, all known proofs of which can be cast in the framework of smooth boosting. For a function $f$ that is mildly hard against size-$s$ circuits, the hardcore theorem provides a set of inputs on which $f$ is extremely hard against size-$s'$ circuits. A downside of this important result is the loss in circuit size, i.e. that $s' \ll s$. Answering a question of Trevisan, we show that this size loss is necessary and in fact, the parameters achieved by known proofs are the best possible.</description>

      <title>PieClam: A Universal Graph Autoencoder Based on Overlapping Inclusive and Exclusive Communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose PieClam (Prior Inclusive Exclusive Cluster Affiliation Model): a probabilistic graph model for representing any graph as overlapping generalized communities. Our method can be interpreted as a graph autoencoder: nodes are embedded into a code space by an algorithm that maximizes the log-likelihood of the decoded graph, given the input graph. PieClam is a community affiliation model that extends well-known methods like BigClam in two main manners. First, instead of the decoder being defined via pairwise interactions between the nodes in the code space, we also incorporate a learned prior on the distribution of nodes in the code space, turning our method into a graph generative model. Secondly, we generalize the notion of communities by allowing not only sets of nodes with strong connectivity, which we call inclusive communities, but also sets of nodes with strong disconnection, which we call exclusive communities. To model both types of communities, we propose a new type of decoder based the Lorentz inner product, which we prove to be much more expressive than standard decoders based on standard inner products or norm distances. By introducing a new graph similarity measure, that we call the log cut distance, we show that PieClam is a universal autoencoder, able to uniformly approximately reconstruct any graph. Our method is shown to obtain competitive performance in graph anomaly detection benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Recurrent Interpolants for Probabilistic Time Series Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sequential models such as recurrent neural networks or transformer-based models became \textit{de facto} tools for multivariate time series forecasting in a probabilistic fashion, with applications to a wide range of datasets, such as finance, biology, medicine, etc. Despite their adeptness in capturing dependencies, assessing prediction uncertainty, and efficiency in training, challenges emerge in modeling high-dimensional complex distributions and cross-feature dependencies. To tackle these issues, recent works delve into generative modeling by employing diffusion or flow-based models. Notably, the integration of stochastic differential equations or probability flow successfully extends these methods to probabilistic time series imputation and forecasting. However, scalability issues necessitate a computational-friendly framework for large-scale generative model-based predictions. This work proposes a novel approach by blending the computational efficiency of recurrent neural networks with the high-quality probabilistic modeling of the diffusion model, which addresses challenges and advances generative models' application in time series forecasting. Our method relies on the foundation of stochastic interpolants and the extension to a broader conditional generation framework with additional control features, offering insights for future developments in this dynamic field.</description>

      <title>Adversarial attacks on neural networks through canonical Riemannian foliations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.00922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.00922v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep learning models are known to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Adversarial learning is therefore becoming a crucial task. We propose a new vision on neural network robustness using Riemannian geometry and foliation theory. The idea is illustrated by creating a new adversarial attack that takes into account the curvature of the data space. This new adversarial attack, called the two-step spectral attack is a piece-wise linear approximation of a geodesic in the data space. The data space is treated as a (degenerate) Riemannian manifold equipped with the pullback of the Fisher Information Metric (FIM) of the neural network. In most cases, this metric is only semi-definite and its kernel becomes a central object to study. A canonical foliation is derived from this kernel. The curvature of transverse leaves gives the appropriate correction to get a two-step approximation of the geodesic and hence a new efficient adversarial attack. The method is first illustrated on a 2D toy example in order to visualize the neural network foliation and the corresponding attacks. Next, we report numerical results on the MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets with the proposed technique and state of the art attacks presented in Zhao et al. (2019) (OSSA) and Croce et al. (2020) (AutoAttack). The result show that the proposed attack is more efficient at all levels of available budget for the attack (norm of the attack), confirming that the curvature of the transverse neural network FIM foliation plays an important role in the robustness of neural networks. The main objective and interest of this study is to provide a mathematical understanding of the geometrical issues at play in the data space when constructing efficient attacks on neural networks.</description>

      <title>Bagged Polynomial Regression and Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.08609v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Series and polynomial regression are able to approximate the same function classes as neural networks. However, these methods are rarely used in practice, although they offer more interpretability than neural networks. In this paper, we show that a potential reason for this is the slow convergence rate of polynomial regression estimators and propose the use of \textit{bagged} polynomial regression (BPR) as an attractive alternative to neural networks. Theoretically, we derive new finite sample and asymptotic $L^2$ convergence rates for series estimators. We show that the rates can be improved in smooth settings by splitting the feature space and generating polynomial features separately for each partition. Empirically, we show that our proposed estimator, the BPR, can perform as well as more complex models with more parameters. Our estimator also performs close to state-of-the-art prediction methods in the benchmark MNIST handwritten digit dataset. We demonstrate that BPR performs as well as neural networks in crop classification using satellite data, a setting where prediction accuracy is critical and interpretability is often required for addressing research questions.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Changepoint Detection: Penalty Learning through Deep Learning Techniques</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00856v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Changepoint detection, a technique for identifying significant shifts within data sequences, is crucial in various fields such as finance, genomics, medicine, etc. Dynamic programming changepoint detection algorithms are employed to identify the locations of changepoints within a sequence, which rely on a penalty parameter to regulate the number of changepoints. To estimate this penalty parameter, previous work uses simple models such as linear or tree-based models. This study introduces a novel deep learning method for predicting penalty parameters, leading to demonstrably improved changepoint detection accuracy on large benchmark supervised labeled datasets compared to previous methods.</description>

      <title>An Asymptotically Optimal Coordinate Descent Algorithm for Learning Bayesian Networks from Gaussian Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11977v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the problem of learning Bayesian networks from continuous observational data, generated according to a linear Gaussian structural equation model. We consider an $\ell_0$-penalized maximum likelihood estimator for this problem which is known to have favorable statistical properties but is computationally challenging to solve, especially for medium-sized Bayesian networks. We propose a new coordinate descent algorithm to approximate this estimator and prove several remarkable properties of our procedure: the algorithm converges to a coordinate-wise minimum, and despite the non-convexity of the loss function, as the sample size tends to infinity, the objective value of the coordinate descent solution converges to the optimal objective value of the $\ell_0$-penalized maximum likelihood estimator. Finite-sample statistical consistency guarantees are also established. To the best of our knowledge, our proposal is the first coordinate descent procedure endowed with optimality and statistical guarantees in the context of learning Bayesian networks. Numerical experiments on synthetic and real data demonstrate that our coordinate descent method can obtain near-optimal solutions while being scalable.</description>

      <title>ROOT-SGD: Sharp Nonasymptotics and Near-Optimal Asymptotics in a Single Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.12690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2008.12690v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of solving strongly convex and smooth unconstrained optimization problems using stochastic first-order algorithms. We devise a novel algorithm, referred to as Recursive One-Over-T SGD (ROOT-SGD), based on an easily implementable, recursive averaging of past stochastic gradients. We prove that it simultaneously achieves state-of-the-art performance in both a finite-sample, nonasymptotic sense and an asymptotic sense. On the non-asymptotic side, we prove risk bounds on the last iterate of ROOT-SGD with leading-order terms that match the optimal statistical risk with a unity pre-factor, along with a higher-order term that scales at the sharp rate of $O(n^{-3/2})$ under the Lipschitz condition on the Hessian matrix. On the asymptotic side, we show that when a mild, one-point Hessian continuity condition is imposed, the rescaled last iterate of (multi-epoch) ROOT-SGD converges asymptotically to a Gaussian limit with the Cram\'er-Rao optimal asymptotic covariance, for a broad range of step-size choices.</description>

      <title>A geometric view on probabilistically robust learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.18779v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although deep neural networks have achieved super-human performance on many classification tasks, they often exhibit a worrying lack of robustness towards adversarially generated examples. Thus, considerable effort has been invested into reformulating standard Risk Minimization (RM) into an adversarially robust framework. Recently, attention has shifted towards approaches which interpolate between the robustness offered by adversarial training and the higher clean accuracy and faster training times of RM. In this paper, we take a fresh and geometric view on one such method -- Probabilistically Robust Learning (PRL). We propose a mathematical framework for understanding PRL, which allows us to identify geometric pathologies in its original formulation and to introduce a family of probabilistic nonlocal perimeter functionals to rectify them. We prove existence of solutions to the original and modified problems using novel relaxation methods and also study properties, as well as local limits, of the introduced perimeters. We also clarify, through a suitable $\Gamma$-convergence analysis, the way in which the original and modified PRL models interpolate between risk minimization and adversarial training.</description>

      <title>Initial Guessing Bias: How Untrained Networks Favor Some Classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.00809v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding and controlling biasing effects in neural networks is crucial for ensuring accurate and fair model performance. In the context of classification problems, we provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating that the structure of a deep neural network (DNN) can condition the model to assign all predictions to the same class, even before the beginning of training, and in the absence of explicit biases. We prove that, besides dataset properties, the presence of this phenomenon, which we call \textit{Initial Guessing Bias} (IGB), is influenced by model choices including dataset preprocessing methods, and architectural decisions, such as activation functions, max-pooling layers, and network depth. Our analysis of IGB provides information for architecture selection and model initialization. We also highlight theoretical consequences, such as the breakdown of node-permutation symmetry, the violation of self-averaging and the non-trivial effects that depth has on the phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Deep Neural Network Benchmarks for Selective Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12708v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the increasing deployment of machine learning models in many socially sensitive tasks, there is a growing demand for reliable and trustworthy predictions. One way to accomplish these requirements is to allow a model to abstain from making a prediction when there is a high risk of making an error. This requires adding a selection mechanism to the model, which selects those examples for which the model will provide a prediction. The selective classification framework aims to design a mechanism that balances the fraction of rejected predictions (i.e., the proportion of examples for which the model does not make a prediction) versus the improvement in predictive performance on the selected predictions. Multiple selective classification frameworks exist, most of which rely on deep neural network architectures. However, the empirical evaluation of the existing approaches is still limited to partial comparisons among methods and settings, providing practitioners with little insight into their relative merits. We fill this gap by benchmarking 18 baselines on a diverse set of 44 datasets that includes both image and tabular data. Moreover, there is a mix of binary and multiclass tasks. We evaluate these approaches using several criteria, including selective error rate, empirical coverage, distribution of rejected instance's classes, and performance on out-of-distribution instances. The results indicate that there is not a single clear winner among the surveyed baselines, and the best method depends on the users' objectives.</description>

      <title>Computationally efficient reductions between some statistical models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07717v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of approximately transforming a sample from a source statistical model to a sample from a target statistical model without knowing the parameters of the source model, and construct several computationally efficient such reductions between canonical statistical experiments. In particular, we provide computationally efficient procedures that approximately reduce uniform, Erlang, and Laplace location models to general target families. We illustrate our methodology by establishing nonasymptotic reductions between some canonical high-dimensional problems, spanning mixtures of experts, phase retrieval, and signal denoising. Notably, the reductions are structure-preserving and can accommodate missing data. We also point to a possible application in transforming one differentially private mechanism to another.</description>

      <title>Calibration Error for Decision Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13503v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Calibration allows predictions to be reliably interpreted as probabilities by decision makers. We propose a decision-theoretic calibration error, the Calibration Decision Loss (CDL), defined as the maximum improvement in decision payoff obtained by calibrating the predictions, where the maximum is over all payoff-bounded decision tasks. Vanishing CDL guarantees the payoff loss from miscalibration vanishes simultaneously for all downstream decision tasks. We show separations between CDL and existing calibration error metrics, including the most well-studied metric Expected Calibration Error (ECE). Our main technical contribution is a new efficient algorithm for online calibration that achieves near-optimal $O(\frac{\log T}{\sqrt{T}})$ expected CDL, bypassing the $\Omega(T^{-0.472})$ lower bound for ECE by Qiao and Valiant (2021).</description>

      <title>Performance of Cross-Validated Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11265v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Background: Advanced methods for causal inference, such as targeted maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE), require certain conditions for statistical inference. However, in situations where there is not differentiability due to data sparsity or near-positivity violations, the Donsker class condition is violated. In such situations, TMLE variance can suffer from inflation of the type I error and poor coverage, leading to conservative confidence intervals. Cross-validation of the TMLE algorithm (CVTMLE) has been suggested to improve on performance compared to TMLE in settings of positivity or Donsker class violations. We aim to investigate the performance of CVTMLE compared to TMLE in various settings.
  Methods: We utilised the data-generating mechanism as described in Leger et al. (2022) to run a Monte Carlo experiment under different Donsker class violations. Then, we evaluated the respective statistical performances of TMLE and CVTMLE with different super learner libraries, with and without regression tree methods.
  Results: We found that CVTMLE vastly improves confidence interval coverage without adversely affecting bias, particularly in settings with small sample sizes and near-positivity violations. Furthermore, incorporating regression trees using standard TMLE with ensemble super learner-based initial estimates increases bias and variance leading to invalid statistical inference.
  Conclusions: It has been shown that when using CVTMLE the Donsker class condition is no longer necessary to obtain valid statistical inference when using regression trees and under either data sparsity or near-positivity violations. We show through simulations that CVTMLE is much less sensitive to the choice of the super learner library and thereby provides better estimation and inference in cases where the super learner library uses more flexible candidates and is prone to overfitting.</description>
