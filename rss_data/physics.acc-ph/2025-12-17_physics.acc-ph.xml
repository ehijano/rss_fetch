      <title>Radiative Spin Polarization in High Energy Storage Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The usual theoretical model for synchrotron radiation in circular accelerators (synchrotrons and storage rings) is to treat a single electron moving in a horizontal circle in a uniform vertical magnetic field, but the true situation in real storage rings is more complicated and exhibits much richer physics. The magnetic fields are inhomogeneous, and there is a bunch of many particles and they traverse a distribution of orbits (hence they encounter different magnetic fields). This results in so-called ``depolarizing spin resonances'' (which do not appear in a simple model of a uniform vertical magnetic field). The calculation of the equilibrium electron spin polarization requires a much more careful analysis. For example, a key insight is that, for motion in inhomogeneous magnetic fields, ``spin flip'' is in general \emph{not} a $180^\circ$ reversal of the spin orientation. The physics of radiative spin polarization involves a mix of many disciplines, and provides a good example of cross-disciplinary thinking. We shall also briefly note the connection to astrophysics. The astrophysics literature mainly treats electron motion in very strong magnetic fields, stronger than the Schwinger critical field (for example a neutron star). It is a problem of ongoing interest in astrophysics to study the radiation by electrons circulating in such strong magnetic fields. This article aims to provide the reader with a survey of the basic physics principles of radiative spin polarization, omitting low-level mathematical algebra as much as possible. Such details can be found in the literature, and are not relevant here.</description>

      <title>Influence of ion motion in a resonantly driven wakefield accelerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several different schemes for plasma wakefield acceleration using a train of drivers have been pursued, based on the resonant excitation of a plasma wave. Since these schemes rely on the plasma electron wave surviving for many periods, the motion of the plasma ions can have a significant impact on the beam--plasma interaction. In this work, simulations are used to study the impact of this ion motion on the development of the self-modulation of a long beam, directly applicable to recent experiments. It is shown that two related but distinct effects contribute to the suppression of the wakefield excitation: the loss of resonance between the drive beam and the plasma wave it excites, and phase mixing due to transverse wavebreaking. Although only the latter has previously been investigated, we show that the two effects follow the same scaling with ion mass.</description>

      <title>Positron Bunch Radiation in the System of Tightly Packed Nanotube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.08282</link>
      <description>arXiv:1512.08282v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radiation emitted by a bunch of positrons channeled in nanotubes at zero emission angle is studied taking into account medium polarization. The formation of radiation is characterized by an energy threshold that depends on the oscillation amplitude of each positron. When the bunch energy reaches the maximum value of the threshold energy, radiation is produced by all positrons in the bunch. The nanotube potential barrier is described using a harmonic model. The spectral line shape of the radiation from the positron bunch, the fundamental radiation frequency, and the number of emitted photons are determined. It is shown that a system of tightly packed carbon nanotubes can generate an intense, quasi-monochromatic, and directed beam of circularly polarized soft X-ray photons with an energy of about $3$~\SI{}{\kilo\electronvolt} (wavelength $4.1$~\SI{}{\angstrom}).</description>

      <title>FEL Gain Enhancement in an Optical Klystron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03334v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A system comprising two identical helical or planar undulators separated by a gap -- viz., an optical klystron (OK) -- is investigated. A formula for the frequency distribution of spontaneous radiation at zero angle is derived. It is shown that the spontaneous radiation line shape gradually narrows with increasing distance (up to an optimal value) between the undulators due to the constructive interference of the radiation fields formed in each of them, while the number of radiated photons decreases. The free-electron laser (FEL) gain coefficient also gradually increases, since it is proportional to the derivative of the spontaneous radiation line shape. Using the undulator parameters of the SASE XFEL and the bunch parameters of the LCLS, the total gain coefficient in the X-ray range is on the order of 2.5 and, for a different electron energy, reaches approximately 90 in the water window frequency range.</description>
