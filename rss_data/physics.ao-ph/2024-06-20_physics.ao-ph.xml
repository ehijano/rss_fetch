      <title>Reviewing climate change attribution in UK natural hazards and their impacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The field of Detection and Attribution is rapidly moving beyond weather and climate, and towards incorporating hazards and their impacts on natural and human systems. Here, we review the comprehensive literature base relevant for the UK ahead of the next Climate Change Risk Assessment. The current literature highlights a detectable and non-trivial influence of climate change in many UK impact sectors already - notably health, agriculture, and infrastructure. We found that heatwaves were the most studied hazard overall, with a unanimous consensus on a strong attributable signal of human-induced climate change in their increased frequency and intensity over the last century. The most notable gap identified overall was in attributing climate-related impacts to human influence, with a few impact studies for only a handful of the hazards assessed. Furthermore, just under half of the 29 hazards were not found to have any UK-relevant attribution studies, with most of the remainder having three or fewer. This review highlights requirements for and opportunities to develop attribution scicnce to meet the needs of the UK. Diversifying hazards and impacts studied, in conjunction with the techniques and approaches used, will undoubtedly benefit the community.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness of the Euler equations in a stably stratified ocean in isopycnal coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article is concerned with the well-posedness of the incompressible Euler equations describing a stably stratified ocean, reformulated in isopycnal coordinates. Our motivation for using this reformulation is twofold: first, its quasi-2D structure renders some parts of the analysis easier. Second, it closes a gap between the analysis performed in the paper by Bianchini and Duch{\^e}ne in 2022 in isopycnal coordinates, with shear velocity but with a regularizing term, and the analysis performed in the paper by Desjardins, Lannes, Saut in 2020 in Eulerian coordinates, without any regularizing term but without shear velocity. Our main result is an energy estimate in Sobolev spaces on the system in isopycnal coordinates, with shear velocity, without any regularizing term. With additional assumptions, it is uniform in the shallow-water parameter. The main difficulty consists in transposing to the isopycnal reformulation the symmetric structure of the system which is more straightforward in Eulerian coordinates.</description>

      <title>Can AI be enabled to dynamical downscaling? Training a Latent Diffusion Model to mimic km-scale COSMO-CLM downscaling of ERA5 over Italy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Downscaling techniques are one of the most prominent applications of Deep Learning (DL) in Earth System Modeling. A robust DL downscaling model can generate high-resolution fields from coarse-scale numerical model simulations, saving the timely and resourceful applications of regional/local models. Additionally, generative DL models have the potential to provide uncertainty information, by generating ensemble-like scenario pools, a task that is computationally prohibitive for traditional numerical simulations. In this study, we apply a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) to downscale ERA5 data over Italy up to a resolution of 2 km. The high-resolution target data consists of results from a high-resolution dynamical downscaling performed with COSMO-CLM. Our goal is to demonstrate that recent advancements in generative modeling enable DL-based models to deliver results comparable to those of numerical dynamical downscaling models, given the same input data (i.e., ERA5 data), preserving the realism of fine-scale features and flow characteristics. The training and testing database consists of hourly data from 2000 to 2020. The target variables of this study are 2-m temperature and 10-m horizontal wind components. A selection of predictors from ERA5 is used as input to the LDM, and a residual approach against a reference UNET is leveraged in applying the LDM. The performance of the generative LDM is compared with reference baselines of increasing complexity: quadratic interpolation of ERA5, a UNET, and a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) built on the same reference UNET. Results highlight the improvements introduced by the LDM architecture and the residual approach over these baselines. The models are evaluated on a yearly test dataset, assessing the models' performance through deterministic metrics, spatial distribution of errors, and reconstruction of frequency and power spectra distributions.</description>

      <title>Effects of settling on inertial particle slip velocity statistics in wall bounded flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developing reduced order models for the transport of solid particles in turbulence typically requires a statistical description of the particle-turbulence interactions. In this work, we utilize a statistical framework to derive continuum equations for the moments of the slip velocity of inertial settling Lagrangian particles in a turbulent boundary layer. Using coupled Eulerian-Lagrangian direct numerical simulations, we then identify the dominant mechanisms controlling the slip velocity variance, and find that for a range of St+, Sv+, and Re, the slip variance is primarily controlled by local differences between the "seen" variance and the particle velocity variance, while terms appearing due to the inhomogeneity of the turbulence are sub-leading until Sv+ becomes large. We also consider several comparative metrics to assess the relative magnitudes of the fluctuating slip velocity and the mean slip velocity, and we find that the vertical mean slip increases rapidly with Sv+, rendering the variance relatively small -- an effect found to be most substantial for Sv+&gt;1. Finally, we compare the results to a model of the acceleration variance Berk and Coletti (2021) based the concept of a response function described in Csanady (1963), highlighting the role of the crossing trajectories mechanism. We find that while there is good agreement for low Sv+, systematic errors remain, possibly due to implicit non-local effects arising from rapid particle settling and inhomogeneous turbulence. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of this work for modeling the transport of coarse dust grains in the atmospheric surface layer.</description>

      <title>WEATHER-5K: A Large-scale Global Station Weather Dataset Towards Comprehensive Time-series Forecasting Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Global Station Weather Forecasting (GSWF) is crucial for various sectors, including aviation, agriculture, energy, and disaster preparedness. Recent advancements in deep learning have significantly improved the accuracy of weather predictions by optimizing models based on public meteorological data. However, existing public datasets for GSWF optimization and benchmarking still suffer from significant limitations, such as small sizes, limited temporal coverage, and a lack of comprehensive variables. These shortcomings prevent them from effectively reflecting the benchmarks of current forecasting methods and fail to support the real needs of operational weather forecasting. To address these challenges, we present the WEATHER-5K dataset. This dataset comprises a comprehensive collection of data from 5,672 weather stations worldwide, spanning a 10-year period with one-hour intervals. It includes multiple crucial weather elements, providing a more reliable and interpretable resource for forecasting. Furthermore, our WEATHER-5K dataset can serve as a benchmark for comprehensively evaluating existing well-known forecasting models, extending beyond GSWF methods to support future time-series research challenges and opportunities. The dataset and benchmark implementation are publicly available at: https://github.com/taohan10200/WEATHER-5K.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Basis Function Interpolation for Adaptive In Situ Data Integration in Ocean Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.05551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.05551v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new method for combining in situ buoy measurements with Earth system models (ESMs) to improve the accuracy of temperature predictions in the ocean. The technique utilizes the dynamics \textit{and} modes identified in ESMs alongside buoy measurements to improve accuracy while preserving features such as seasonality. We use this technique, which we call Dynamic Basis Function Interpolation, to correct errors in localized temperature predictions made by the Model for Prediction Across Scales Ocean component (MPAS-O) with the Global Drifter Program's in situ ocean buoy dataset.</description>

      <title>Transferring climate change knowledge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.14780v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate and precise climate projections are required for climate adaptation and mitigation, but Earth system models still exhibit great uncertainties. Several approaches have been developed to reduce the spread of climate projections and feedbacks, yet those methods cannot capture the non-linear complexity inherent in the climate system. Using a Transfer Learning approach, we show that Machine Learning can be used to optimally leverage and merge the knowledge gained from Earth system models simulations and historical observations to more accurately project global surface air temperature fields in the 21st century. We reach an uncertainty reduction of more than 50% with respect to state-of-the-art approaches. We give evidence that our novel method provides narrower projection uncertainty together with more accurate mean climate projections, urgently required for climate adaptation.</description>

      <title>Advancing Parsimonious Deep Learning Weather Prediction using the HEALPix Mesh</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06253v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a parsimonious deep learning weather prediction model to forecast seven atmospheric variables with 3-h time resolution for up to one-year lead times on a 110-km global mesh using the Hierarchical Equal Area isoLatitude Pixelization (HEALPix). In comparison to state-of-the-art (SOTA) machine learning (ML) weather forecast models, such as Pangu-Weather and GraphCast, our DLWP-HPX model uses coarser resolution and far fewer prognostic variables. Yet, at one-week lead times, its skill is only about one day behind both SOTA ML forecast models and the SOTA numerical weather prediction model from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. We report several improvements in model design, including switching from the cubed sphere to the HEALPix mesh, inverting the channel depth of the U-Net, and introducing gated recurrent units (GRU) on each level of the U-Net hierarchy. The consistent east-west orientation of all cells on the HEALPix mesh facilitates the development of location-invariant convolution kernels that successfully propagate weather patterns across the globe without requiring separate kernels for the polar and equatorial faces of the cube sphere. Without any loss of spectral power after the first two days, the model can be unrolled autoregressively for hundreds of steps into the future to generate realistic states of the atmosphere that respect seasonal trends, as showcased in one-year simulations.</description>

      <title>Precipitation Downscaling with Spatiotemporal Video Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06071v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In climate science and meteorology, high-resolution local precipitation (rain and snowfall) predictions are limited by the computational costs of simulation-based methods. Statistical downscaling, or super-resolution, is a common workaround where a low-resolution prediction is improved using statistical approaches. Unlike traditional computer vision tasks, weather and climate applications require capturing the accurate conditional distribution of high-resolution given low-resolution patterns to assure reliable ensemble averages and unbiased estimates of extreme events, such as heavy rain. This work extends recent video diffusion models to precipitation super-resolution, employing a deterministic downscaler followed by a temporally-conditioned diffusion model to capture noise characteristics and high-frequency patterns. We test our approach on FV3GFS output, an established large-scale global atmosphere model, and compare it against six state-of-the-art baselines. Our analysis, capturing CRPS, MSE, precipitation distributions, and qualitative aspects using California and the Himalayas as examples, establishes our method as a new standard for data-driven precipitation downscaling.</description>

      <title>Symmetry breaking of rotating convection due to Non-Oberbeck-Boussinesq effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01721v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The non-Oberbeck-Boussinesq (NOB) effects arising from variations in thermal expansivity are theoretically and numerically studied in the context of rotating Rayleigh-B\'{e}nard convection under two-dimensional (2D) configuration. The thermal expansivity increases with pressure (depth), and its variation is measured by a dimensionless factor $\epsilon$. Utilizing an asymptotic expansion with weak nonlinearity, we derive an amplitude equation, revealing that NOB effects amplify the magnitude of convection. An order-$\epsilon^2$ NOB correction leads to a symmetry breaking about the horizontal mid-plane, manifested in the strengthening of convection near the bottom and its weakening near the top, forming a bottom-heavy profiles. At order $\epsilon^3$, the conjunction of NOB effects and nonlinear advection leads to a horizontal symmetry breaking. The downward cold plumes become stronger and more concentrated compared to the upward warm plumes. Numerical simulations validate the theoretical analyses in the weak nonlinear regime and confirm robust horizontal asymmetry and stronger downward plumes at very large Rayleigh numbers. This work advances our understanding of hydrothermal plumes in some winter lakes on Earth, and in the subglacial oceans on icy moons as well as tracer transport from the seafloor to the ice shell.</description>
