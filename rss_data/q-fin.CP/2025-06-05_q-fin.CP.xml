      <title>Can Artificial Intelligence Trade the Stock Market?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper explores the use of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) in stock market trading, focusing on two algorithms: Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and compares them with Buy and Hold benchmark. It evaluates these algorithms across three currency pairs, the S&amp;P 500 index and Bitcoin, on the daily data in the period of 2019-2023. The results demonstrate DRL's effectiveness in trading and its ability to manage risk by strategically avoiding trades in unfavorable conditions, providing a substantial edge over classical approaches, based on supervised learning in terms of risk-adjusted returns.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Machine Learning for High-Dimensional Option Pricing within the Uncertain Volatility Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13213v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores the application of Machine Learning techniques for pricing high-dimensional options within the framework of the Uncertain Volatility Model (UVM). The UVM is a robust framework that accounts for the inherent unpredictability of market volatility by setting upper and lower bounds on volatility and the correlation among underlying assets. By integrating advanced Machine Learning algorithms, we aim to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of option pricing under the UVM, especially when the option price depends on a large number of variables, such as in basket or path-dependent options. In this paper, we consider two approaches based on Machine Learning. The first one, termed GTU, evolves backward in time, dynamically selecting at each time step the most expensive volatility and correlation for each market state. Specifically, it identifies the particular values of volatility and correlation that maximize the expected option value at the next time step, and therefore, an optimization problem must be solved. This is achieved through the use of Gaussian Process regression, the computation of expectations via a single step of a multidimensional tree and the Sequential Quadratic Programming optimization algorithm. The second approach, referred to as NNU, leverages neural networks and frames pricing in the UVM as a control problem. Specifically, we train a neural network to determine the most adverse volatility and correlation for each simulated market state, generated via random simulations. The option price is then obtained through Monte Carlo simulations, which are performed using the values for the uncertain parameters provided by the neural network. The numerical results demonstrate that the proposed approaches can significantly improve the precision of option pricing particularly in high-dimensional contexts.</description>

      <title>Chaotic Hedging with Iterated Integrals and Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.10166v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive an $L^p$-chaos expansion based on iterated Stratonovich integrals with respect to a given exponentially integrable continuous semimartingale. By omitting the orthogonality of the expansion, we show that every $p$-integrable functional, $p \in [1,\infty)$, can be approximated by a finite sum of iterated Stratonovich integrals. Using (possibly random) neural networks as integrands, we therefere obtain universal approximation results for $p$-integrable financial derivatives in the $L^p$-sense. Moreover, we can approximately solve the $L^p$-hedging problem (coinciding for $p = 2$ with the quadratic hedging problem), where the approximating hedging strategy can be computed in closed form within short runtime.</description>

      <title>A new architecture of high-order deep neural networks that learn martingales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03789v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new deep-learning neural network architecture based on high-order weak approximation algorithms for stochastic differential equations (SDEs) is proposed. The architecture enables the efficient learning of martingales by deep learning models. The behaviour of deep neural networks based on this architecture, when applied to the problem of pricing financial derivatives, is also examined. The core of this new architecture lies in the high-order weak approximation algorithms of the explicit Runge--Kutta type, wherein the approximation is realised solely through iterative compositions and linear combinations of vector fields of the target SDEs.</description>

      <title>A Causation-Based Framework for Pricing and Cost Allocation of Energy, Reserves, and Transmission in Modern Power Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24159v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The increasing vulnerability of power systems has heightened the need for operating reserves to manage contingencies such as generator outages, line failures, and sudden load variations. Unlike energy costs, driven by consumer demand, operating reserve costs arise from addressing the most critical credible contingencies - prompting the question: how should these costs be allocated through efficient pricing mechanisms? As an alternative to previously reported schemes, this paper presents a new causation-based pricing framework for electricity markets based on contingency-constrained energy and reserve scheduling models. Major salient features include a novel security charge mechanism along with the explicit definition of prices for up-spinning reserves, down-spinning reserves, and transmission services. These features ensure more comprehensive and efficient cost-reflective market operations. Moreover, the proposed nodal pricing scheme yields revenue adequacy and neutrality while promoting reliability incentives for generators based on the cost-causation principle. An additional salient aspect of the proposed framework is the economic incentive for transmission assets, which are remunerated based on their use to deliver energy and reserves across all contingency states. Numerical results from two case studies illustrate the performance of the proposed pricing scheme.</description>
