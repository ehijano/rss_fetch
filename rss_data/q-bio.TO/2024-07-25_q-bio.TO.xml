      <title>Quantifying variabilities in cardiac digital twin models of the electrocardiogram</title>

Abstract: CDT of human cardiac EP are digital replicas of patient hearts that match like-for-like clinical observations.
  The ECG, as the most prevalent non-invasive observation of cardiac electrophysiology, is considered an ideal target for CDT calibration. Recent advanced CDT calibration methods have demonstrated their ability to minimize discrepancies between simulated and measured ECG signals, effectively replicating all key morphological features relevant to diagnostics. However, due to the inherent nature of clinical data acquisition and CDT model generation pipelines, discrepancies inevitably arise between the real physical electrophysiology in a patient and the simulated virtual electrophysiology in a CDT.
  In this study, we aim to qualitatively and quantitatively analyze the impact of these uncertainties on ECG morphology and diagnostic markers. We analyze residual beat-to-beat variability in ECG recordings obtained from healthy subjects and patients. Using a biophysically detailed and anatomically accurate computational model of whole-heart electrophysiology combined with a detailed torso model calibrated to closely replicate measured ECG signals, we vary anatomical factors (heart location, orientation, size), heterogeneity in electrical conductivities in the heart and torso, and electrode placements across ECG leads to assess their qualitative impact on ECG morphology.
  Our study demonstrates that diagnostically relevant ECG features and overall morphology appear relatively robust against the investigated uncertainties. This resilience is consistent with the narrow distribution of ECG due to residual beat-to-beat variability observed in both healthy subjects and patients.</description>

      <title>Establishing Truly Causal Relationship Between Whole Slide Image Predictions and Diagnostic Evidence Subregions in Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the field of deep learning-driven Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification, Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) has gained significant attention due to its ability to be trained using only slide-level diagnostic labels. Previous MIL researches have primarily focused on enhancing feature aggregators for globally analyzing WSIs, but overlook a causal relationship in diagnosis: model's prediction should ideally stem solely from regions of the image that contain diagnostic evidence (such as tumor cells), which usually occupy relatively small areas. To address this limitation and establish the truly causal relationship between model predictions and diagnostic evidence regions, we propose Causal Inference Multiple Instance Learning (CI-MIL). CI-MIL integrates feature distillation with a novel patch decorrelation mechanism, employing a two-stage causal inference approach to distill and process patches with high diagnostic value. Initially, CI-MIL leverages feature distillation to identify patches likely containing tumor cells and extracts their corresponding feature representations. These features are then mapped to random Fourier feature space, where a learnable weighting scheme is employed to minimize inter-feature correlations, effectively reducing redundancy from homogenous patches and mitigating data bias. These processes strengthen the causal relationship between model predictions and diagnostically relevant regions, making the prediction more direct and reliable. Experimental results demonstrate that CI-MIL outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, CI-MIL exhibits superior interpretability, as its selected regions demonstrate high consistency with ground truth annotations, promising more reliable diagnostic assistance for pathologists.</description>
