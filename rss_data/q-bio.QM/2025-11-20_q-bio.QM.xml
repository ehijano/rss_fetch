      <title>Leveraging NCBI Genomic Metadata for Epidemiological Insights: Example of Enterobacterales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerous studies have utilized NCBI data for genomic analysis, gene annotation, and identifying disease-associated variants, yet NCBI's epidemiological potential remains underexplored. This study demonstrates how NCBI datasets can be systematically leveraged to extract and interpret infectious disease patterns across spatial and temporal dimensions. Using Enterobacterales as a case study, we analyzed over 477,000 genomic records and metadata, including collection date, location, host species, and isolation source. We compared trends of Escherichia coli and Salmonella in NCBI data with CDC's National Outbreak Reporting System (NORS). While both datasets showed consistent seasonal peaks and foodborne sources, NCBI data revealed broader host species (e.g., wildlife, environmental reservoirs), greater isolate diversity, and finer spatial-temporal resolution. These insights were enabled by our open-source Python package, EpiNCBI_V1, developed for real-time downloading, filtering, and cleaning of pathogen genomic metadata from NCBI. This work highlights the value of integrating genomic repositories into public health analytics to enhance surveillance, outbreak detection, and cross-species transmission tracking globally.</description>

      <title>Izzy: a high-throughput metagenomic read simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulated microbial communities are used in benchmarking microbial abundance estimators and other bioinformatic utilities. To match current data scales, large simulated samples are needed, and many. The speed of current implementations might create bottlenecks for scientists testing new innovations. Here, a new implementation is introduced, based on existing error models. The new implementation, Izzy, provides up to a 60x speedup while maintaining a simple and easy-to-use interface.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Prediction of Species-Specific Plant Responses to Spectral-Shifting Films from Leaf Phenotypic and Photosynthetic Traits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The application of spectral-shifting films in greenhouses to shift green light to red light has shown variable growth responses across crop species. However, the yield enhancement of crops under altered light quality is related to the collective effects of the specific biophysical characteristics of each species. Considering only one attribute of a crop has limitations in understanding the relationship between sunlight quality adjustments and crop growth performance. Therefore, this study aims to comprehensively link multiple plant phenotypic traits and daily light integral considering the physiological responses of crops to their growth outcomes under SF using artificial intelligence. Between 2021 and 2024, various leafy, fruiting, and root crops were grown in greenhouses covered with either PEF or SF, and leaf reflectance, leaf mass per area, chlorophyll content, daily light integral, and light saturation point were measured from the plants cultivated in each condition. 210 data points were collected, but there was insufficient data to train deep learning models, so a variational autoencoder was used for data augmentation. Most crop yields showed an average increase of 22.5% under SF. These data were used to train several models, including logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, XGBoost, and feedforward neural network (FFNN), aiming to binary classify whether there was a significant effect on yield with SF application. The FFNN achieved a high classification accuracy of 91.4% on a test dataset that was not used for training. This study provide insight into the complex interactions between leaf phenotypic and photosynthetic traits, environmental conditions, and solar spectral components by improving the ability to predict solar spectral shift effects using SF.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of three-dimensional shapes of normal and disease-related erythrocytes from partial observations using multi-fidelity neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconstruction of 3D erythrocyte or red blood cell (RBC) morphology from partial observations, such as microscope images, is essential for understanding the physiology of RBC aging and the pathology of various RBC disorders. In this study, we propose a multi-fidelity neural network (MFNN) approach to fuse high-fidelity cross-sections of an RBC, with a morphologically similar low-fidelity reference 3D RBC shape to recover its full 3D surface. The MFNN predictor combines a convolutional neural network trained on low-fidelity reference RBC data with a feedforward neural network that captures nonlinear morphological correlations, and augments training with surface area and volume constraints for regularization in the low-fidelity branch. This approach is theoretically grounded by a topological homeomorphism between a sphere and 3D RBC surfaces, with training data generated by dissipative particle dynamics simulations of stomatocyte-discocyte-echinocyte transformation. Benchmarking across diverse RBC shapes observed in normal and aged populations, our results show that the MFNN predictor can reconstruct complex RBC morphologies with over 95% coordinate accuracy when provided with at least two orthogonal cross-sections. It is observed that informative oblique cross-sections intersecting spicule tips of echinocytes improve both local and global feature reconstruction, highlighting the value of feature-aware sampling. Our study further evaluates the influence of sampling strategies, shape dissimilarity, and noise, showing enhanced robustness under physically constrained training. Altogether, these results demonstrate the capability of MFNN to reconstruct the 3D shape of normal and aged RBCs from partial cross-sections as observed in conventional microscope images, which could facilitate the quantitative analysis of RBC morphological parameters in normal and disease-related RBC samples.</description>

      <title>A meaningful prediction of functional decline in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis based on multi-event survival analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02076v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a degenerative disorder of the motor neurons that causes progressive paralysis in patients. Current treatment options aim to prolong survival and improve quality of life. However, due to the heterogeneity of the disease, it is often difficult to determine the optimal time for potential therapies or medical interventions. In this study, we propose a novel method to predict the time until a patient with ALS experiences significant functional impairment (ALSFRS-R &lt;= 2) for each of five common functions: speaking, swallowing, handwriting, walking, and breathing. We formulate this task as a multi-event survival problem and validate our approach in the PRO-ACT dataset (N = 3220) by training five covariate-based survival models to estimate the probability of each event over the 500 days following the baseline visit. We then predict five event-specific individual survival distributions (ISDs) for a patient, each providing an interpretable estimate of when that event is likely to occur. The results show that covariate-based models are superior to the Kaplan-Meier estimator at predicting time-to-event outcomes in the PRO-ACT dataset. Additionally, our method enables practitioners to make individual counterfactual predictions -- where certain covariates can be changed -- to estimate their effect on the predicted outcome. In this regard, we find that Riluzole has little or no impact on predicted functional decline. However, for patients with bulbar-onset ALS, our model predicts significantly shorter time-to-event estimates for loss of speech and swallowing function compared to patients with limb-onset ALS (log-rank p&lt;0.001, Bonferroni-adjusted alpha=0.01). The proposed method can be applied to current clinical examination data to assess the risk of functional decline and thus allow more personalized treatment planning.</description>

      <title>Symbiotic causal network of seagrass-bacteria-alga-diatom interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13799v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Seagrass meadows contribute to the conservation of marine ecosystems, reduction in global warming impacts and pathogen controls. However, the decline in seagrass habitats due to environmental loads has become an urgent global issue. One way to address this issue is to better understand healthy seagrass habitats. Here, we estimate the structural characteristics of symbiotic and metabolic systems in sediments from eight coastal regions of Japan, with each region containing both seagrass-covered areas and adjacent unvegetated areas. Notably, seagrasses commonly maintain a balanced symbiotic relationship characterized by a positive association with cable bacteria (Desulfobulbaceae), nitrogen-cycling bacteria (Hyphomonadaceae), and coral alga (Corallinophycidae) and a negative association with diatoms (Diatomea). Furthermore, seagrass growth conditions influence metabolic pathways by activating nitrogen-related metabolism while attenuating methanogenesis. Our findings highlight the crucial roles of marine plants and their symbiotic systems in ensuring environmental conservation within the context of blue carbon storage across environmental gradients.</description>

      <title>Explicit modeling of density dependence in spatial capture-recapture models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09431v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Density dependence occurs at the individual level and thus is greatly influenced by spatial local heterogeneity in habitat conditions. However, density dependence is often evaluated at the population level, leading to difficulties or even controversies in detecting such a process. Bayesian individual-based models such as spatial capture-recapture (SCR) models provide opportunities to study density dependence at the individual level, but such an approach remains to be developed and evaluated. In this study, we developed a SCR model that links habitat use to apparent survival and recruitment through density dependent processes at the individual level. Using simulations, we found that the model can properly inform habitat use, but tends to underestimate the effect of density dependence on apparent survival and recruitment. The reason for such underestimations is likely due to the difficulties of the current model in identifying the locations of unobserved individuals without using environmental covariates to inform these locations. How to accurately estimate the locations of unobserved individuals, and thus density dependence, remains a challenging topic in spatial statistics and statistical ecology.</description>

      <title>TrackStudio: An Integrated Toolkit for Markerless Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07624v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Markerless motion tracking has advanced rapidly in the past 10 years and currently offers powerful opportunities for behavioural, clinical, and biomechanical research. While several specialised toolkits provide high performance for specific tasks, using existing tools still requires substantial technical expertise. There remains a gap in accessible, integrated solutions that deliver sufficient tracking for non-experts across diverse settings.
  TrackStudio was developed to address this gap by combining established open-source tools into a single, modular, GUI-based pipeline that works out of the box. It provides automatic 2D and 3D tracking, calibration, preprocessing, feature extraction, and visualisation without requiring any programming skills. We supply a user guide with practical advice for video acquisition, synchronisation, and setup, alongside documentation of common pitfalls and how to avoid them.
  To validate the toolkit, we tested its performance across three environments using either low-cost webcams or high-resolution cameras, including challenging conditions for body position, lightning, and space and obstructions. Across 76 participants, average inter-frame correlations exceeded 0.98 and average triangulation errors remained low (&lt;13.6mm for hand tracking), demonstrating stable and consistent tracking. We further show that the same pipeline can be extended beyond hand tracking to other body and face regions. TrackStudio provides a practical, accessible route into markerless tracking for researchers or laypeople who need reliable performance without specialist expertise.</description>
