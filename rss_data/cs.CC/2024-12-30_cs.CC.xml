      <title>Positivity of Schubert Coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Schubert coefficients $c_{u,v}^w$ are structure constants describing multiplication of Schubert polynomials. Deciding positivity of Schubert coefficients is a major open problem in Algebraic Combinatorics. We prove a positive rule for this problem based on two standard assumptions.</description>

      <title>Reforming an Unfair Allocation by Exchanging Goods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fairly allocating indivisible goods is a frequently occurring task in everyday life. Given an initial allocation of the goods, we consider the problem of reforming it via a sequence of exchanges to attain fairness in the form of envy-freeness up to one good (EF1). We present a vast array of results on the complexity of determining whether it is possible to reach an EF1 allocation from the initial allocation and, if so, the minimum number of exchanges required. In particular, we uncover several distinctions based on the number of agents involved and their utility functions. Furthermore, we derive essentially tight bounds on the worst-case number of exchanges needed to achieve EF1.</description>

      <title>An unholy trinity: TFNP, polynomial systems, and the quantum satisfiability problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The theory of Total Function NP (TFNP) and its subclasses says that, even if one is promised an efficiently verifiable proof exists for a problem, finding this proof can be intractable. Despite the success of the theory at showing intractability of problems such as computing Brouwer fixed points and Nash equilibria, subclasses of TFNP remain arguably few and far between. In this work, we define two new subclasses of TFNP borne of the study of complex polynomial systems: Multi-homogeneous Systems (MHS) and Sparse Fundamental Theorem of Algebra (SFTA). The first of these is based on B\'ezout's theorem from algebraic geometry, marking the first TFNP subclass based on an algebraic geometric principle. At the heart of our study is the computational problem known as Quantum SAT (QSAT) with a System of Distinct Representatives (SDR), first studied by [Laumann, L\"auchli, Moessner, Scardicchio, and Sondhi 2010]. Among other results, we show that QSAT with SDR is MHS-complete, thus giving not only the first link between quantum complexity theory and TFNP, but also the first TFNP problem whose classical variant (SAT with SDR) is easy but whose quantum variant is hard. We also show how to embed the roots of a sparse, high-degree, univariate polynomial into QSAT with SDR, obtaining that SFTA is contained in a zero-error version of MHS. We conjecture this construction also works in the low-error setting, which would imply SFTA is contained in MHS.</description>

      <title>Lower bounds for quantum-inspired classical algorithms via communication complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15686v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum-inspired classical algorithms provide us with a new way to understand the computational power of quantum computers for practically-relevant problems, especially in machine learning. In the past several years, numerous efficient algorithms for various tasks have been found, while an analysis of lower bounds is still missing. Using communication complexity, in this work we propose the first method to study lower bounds for these tasks. We mainly focus on lower bounds for solving linear regressions, supervised clustering, principal component analysis, recommendation systems, and Hamiltonian simulations. For those problems, we prove a quadratic lower bound in terms of the Frobenius norm of the underlying matrix. As quantum algorithms are linear in the Frobenius norm for those problems, our results mean that the quantum-classical separation is at least quadratic. As a generalisation, we extend our method to study lower bounds analysis of quantum query algorithms for matrix-related problems using quantum communication complexity. Some applications are given.</description>
