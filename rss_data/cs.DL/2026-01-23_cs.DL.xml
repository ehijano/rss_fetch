      <title>MEDFORD in a Box: Improvements and Future Directions for a Metadata Description Language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scientific research metadata is vital to ensure the validity, reusability, and cost-effectiveness of research efforts. The MEDFORD metadata language was previously introduced to simplify the process of writing and maintaining metadata for non-programmers. However, barriers to entry and usability remain, including limited automatic validation, difficulty of data transport, and user unfamiliarity with text file editing. To address these issues, we introduce MEDFORD-in-a-Box (MIAB), a documentation ecosystem to facilitate researcher adoption and earlier metadata capture. MIAB contains many improvements, including an updated MEDFORD parser with expanded validation routines and BagIt export capability. MIAB also includes an improved VS Code extension that supports these changes through a visual IDE. By simplifying metadata generation, this new tool supports the creation of correct, consistent, and reusable metadata, ultimately improving research reproducibility.</description>

      <title>The Rise of Large Language Models and the Direction and Impact of US Federal Research Funding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federal research funding shapes the direction, diversity, and impact of the US scientific enterprise. Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly diffusing into scientific practice, holding substantial promise while raising widespread concerns. Despite growing attention to AI use in scientific writing and evaluation, little is known about how the rise of LLMs is reshaping the public funding landscape. Here, we examine LLM involvement at key stages of the federal funding pipeline by combining two complementary data sources: confidential National Science Foundation (NSF) and National Institutes of Health (NIH) proposal submissions from two large US R1 universities, including funded, unfunded, and pending proposals, and the full population of publicly released NSF and NIH awards. We find that LLM use rises sharply beginning in 2023 and exhibits a bimodal distribution, indicating a clear split between minimal and substantive use. Across both private submissions and public awards, higher LLM involvement is consistently associated with lower semantic distinctiveness, positioning projects closer to recently funded work within the same agency. The consequences of this shift are agency-dependent. LLM use is positively associated with proposal success and higher subsequent publication output at NIH, whereas no comparable associations are observed at NSF. Notably, the productivity gains at NIH are concentrated in non-hit papers rather than the most highly cited work. Together, these findings provide large-scale evidence that the rise of LLMs is reshaping how scientific ideas are positioned, selected, and translated into publicly funded research, with implications for portfolio governance, research diversity, and the long-run impact of science.</description>
