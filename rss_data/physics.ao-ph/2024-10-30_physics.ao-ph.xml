      <title>CloudCast -- Total Cloud Cover Nowcasting with Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cloud cover plays a critical role in weather prediction and impacts several sectors, including agriculture, solar power generation, and aviation. Despite advancements in numerical weather prediction (NWP) models, forecasting total cloud cover remains challenging due to the small-scale nature of cloud formation processes. In this study, we introduce CloudCast, a convolutional neural network (CNN) based on the U-Net architecture, designed to predict total cloud cover (TCC) up to five hours ahead. Trained on five years of satellite data, CloudCast significantly outperforms traditional NWP models and optical flow methods. Compared to a reference NWP model, CloudCast achieves a 24% lower mean absolute error and reduces multi-category prediction errors by 46%. The model demonstrates strong performance, particularly in capturing the large-scale structure of cloud cover in the first few forecast hours, though later predictions are subject to blurring and underestimation of cloud formation. An ablation study identified the optimal input features and loss functions, with MAE-based models performing the best. CloudCast has been integrated into the Finnish Meteorological Institute's operational nowcasting system, where it improves cloud cover forecasts used by public and private sector clients. While CloudCast is limited by a relatively short skillful lead time of about three hours, future work aims to extend this through more complex network architectures and higher-resolution data. CloudCast code is available at https://github.com/fmidev/cloudcast.</description>

      <title>Optical turbulence in the atmospheric surface layer at the Pamir Plateau Muztagh-ata site</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we conducted a detailed analysis of optical turbulence in the Atmospheric Surface Layer (ASL) at Muztagh-ata site during on-site testing. We utilized ultrasonic anemometers positioned on a 30-meter tower to collect and process data at five height levels, obtaining data from October 1, 2021 to the present. We investigated the behavior of optical turbulence parameters (\(C_n^2\) and seeing \(\varepsilon\)) in the ASL. Nighttime \(C_n^2\) primarily fluctuated in the range of \(10^{-16}\) to \(10^{-14}\), exhibiting an exponential decrease with height. During the day, it showed a \(h^{-0.82}\) dependency, while at night, it displayed a \(h^{-0.48}\) dependency. Additionally, we presented the distribution of seeing across different layers within the ASL, showing a gradual decrease with increasing height, with a median seeing of 0.24 arcseconds at nighttime and 0.48 arcseconds at daytime between 6-30m. We investigated the relationship between surface temperature inversion, seeing in the ASL, and wind speed at the site. Our results show that under temperature inversion conditions, seeing significantly improves and is often accompanied by low to moderate wind speeds, while high wind speeds are usually associated with poorer seeing. Preliminary calculations and observational results, combined with the high altitude and unique geographical location, suggest that Muztagh-ata site has the potential to be an outstanding optical astronomical observatory in the western plateau of china.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Simulations of Tropical Cyclones using Adaptive Mesh Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tropical cyclones (TCs) are powerful, natural phenomena that can severely impact populations and infrastructure. Enhancing our understanding of the mechanisms driving their intensification is crucial for mitigating these impacts. To this end, researchers are pushing the boundaries of TC simulation resolution down to scales of just a few meters. However, higher resolution simulations come with significant computational challenges, increasing both time and energy costs. Adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) is a technique widely used in computational fluid dynamics but has seen limited application in atmospheric simulations. This study explores the use of h-adaptive grids using the spectral element discretization technique to accelerate TC simulations while allowing very high resolutions in certain parts of the domain. By applying AMR to a rapidly intensifying TC test case, we demonstrate that AMR can replicate the results of uniform grid simulations in terms of mean and local wind speed maxima while dramatically reducing computational costs. We show that AMR can speed up dry TC simulations by a factor of 2 - 13 for the set of tested refinement criteria. Additionally, we show that TC intensity changes as resolution is increased and that AMR can deliver high-resolution simulations at the cost of coarser static simulations. Our findings indicate that AMR and spectral element methods are promising tools for enhancing TC simulations.</description>

      <title>PACER: Physics Informed Uncertainty Aware Climate Emulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21657v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Climate models serve as critical tools for evaluating the effects of climate change and projecting future climate scenarios. However, the reliance on numerical simulations of physical equations renders them computationally intensive and inefficient. While deep learning methodologies have made significant progress in weather forecasting, they are still unstable for climate emulation tasks. Here, we propose PACER, a lightweight 684K parameter Physics Informed Uncertainty Aware Climate Emulator. PACER emulates temperature and precipitation stably for 86 years while only being trained on greenhouse gas emissions data. We incorporate a fundamental physical law of advection-diffusion in PACER accounting for boundary conditions and empirically estimating the diffusion co-efficient and flow velocities from emissions data. PACER has been trained on 15 climate models provided by ClimateSet outperforming baselines across most of the climate models and advancing a new state of the art in a climate diagnostic task.</description>

      <title>Online Test of a Neural Network Deep Convection Parameterization in ARP-GEM1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we present the integration of a neural network-based parameterization into the global atmospheric model ARP-GEM1, leveraging the Python interface of the OASIS coupler. This approach facilitates the exchange of fields between the Fortran-based ARP-GEM1 model and a Python component responsible for neural network inference. As a proof-of-concept experiment, we trained a neural network to emulate the deep convection parameterization of ARP-GEM1. Using the flexible Fortran/Python interface, we have successfully replaced ARP-GEM1's deep convection scheme with a neural network emulator. To assess the performance of the neural network deep convection scheme, we have run a 5-years ARP-GEM1 simulation using the neural network emulator. The evaluation of averaged fields showed good agreement with output from an ARP-GEM1 simulation using the physics-based deep convection scheme. The Python component was deployed on a separate partition from the general circulation model, using GPUs to increase inference speed of the neural network.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Global Ocean Modeling for Seasonal to Decadal Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15412v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate ocean dynamics modeling is crucial for enhancing understanding of ocean circulation, predicting climate variability, and tackling challenges posed by climate change. Despite improvements in traditional numerical models, predicting global ocean variability over multi-year scales remains challenging. Here, we propose ORCA-DL (Oceanic Reliable foreCAst via Deep Learning), the first data-driven 3D ocean model for seasonal to decadal prediction of global ocean circulation. ORCA-DL accurately simulates three-dimensional ocean dynamics and outperforms state-of-the-art dynamical models in capturing extreme events, including El Ni\~no-Southern Oscillation and upper ocean heatwaves. This demonstrates the high potential of data-driven models for efficient and accurate global ocean forecasting. Moreover, ORCA-DL stably emulates ocean dynamics at decadal timescales, demonstrating its potential even for skillful decadal predictions and climate projections.</description>

      <title>AI-based climate model evaluation through the lens of heatwave storylines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09120v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: AI-based weather and climate models are emerging as accurate and computationally efficient tools. Beyond weather forecasting, they also show promise to accelerate storyline analyses. We rigorously evaluate NeuralGCM's ability to reproduce an extreme heatwave against physics-based climate model. NeuralGCM accurately replicates the targeted event, and generates stable and realistic mid-century projections. However, due to the absence of land feedbacks, NeuralGCM underestimates the projected warming amplitude compared to physics-based model benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Assessment of Abrupt Shifts in CMIP6 Models using Edge Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19498v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Research over the past decade has shown that multiple elements of the climate system, such as the Arctic Winter sea ice or the Amazon rainforest, could undergo abrupt shifts, but there are large uncertainties regarding their timing and spatial extent. In this study we investigated when and where abrupt shifts occur in the latest generation of climate models (CMIP6) under a scenario of a 1% annual increase in CO$_2$. We considered 82 ocean, atmosphere, and land variables across 57 models. We used a Canny edge detection method -- adapted for spatiotemporal dimensions -- to detect abrupt shifts occurring on time scales from years to decades. Then, we performed a connected component analysis to quantify the spatial extent of these shifts. The systems analyzed include the North Atlantic subpolar gyre, Tibetan Plateau, land permafrost, Amazon rainforest, Antarctic sea ice, monsoon systems, Arctic summer sea ice, Arctic winter sea ice, and Barents sea ice. With the exception of the monsoons systems, we found abrupt shifts in multiple models per system. We observed a considerable variation across the different CMIP6 models in terms of timing and spatial extent. Higher levels of global warming increased the risk of abrupt shifts in CMIP6 models. Even at a global warming level of 1.5 $^\circ \text{C}$, six out of ten studied climate subsystems showed abrupt shifts that cover a substantial area in multiple models.</description>
