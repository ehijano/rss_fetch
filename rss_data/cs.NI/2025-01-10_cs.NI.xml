      <title>An Analysis on Stabilizability and Reliability Relationship in Wireless Networked Control Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stabilizability of wireless networked control systems (WNCSs) is a deterministic binary valued parameter proven to hold if the communication data rate is higher than the sum of the logarithm of unstable eigenvalues of the open-loop control system. In this analysis, it is assumed that the communication system provides a fixed deterministic transmission rate between the sensors and controllers. Due to the stochastic parameters of communication channels, such as small-scale fading, the instantaneous rate is an intrinsically stochastic parameter. In this sense, it is a common practice in the literature to use the deterministic ergodic rate in analyzing the asymptotic stabilizability. Theoretically, there exists no work in the literature investigating how the ergodic rate can be incorporated into the analysis of asymptotic stabilizability. Considering the stochastic nature of channel parameters, we introduce the concept of probability of stabilizability by interconnecting communication link reliability with the system's unstable eigenvalues and derive a closed-form expression that quantifies this metric. Numerical results are provided to visualize how communication and control systems' parameters affect the probability of stabilizability of the overall system.</description>

      <title>Topology-aware Microservice Architecture in Edge Networks: Deployment Optimization and Implementation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a ubiquitous deployment paradigm, integrating microservice architecture (MSA) into edge networks promises to enhance the flexibility and scalability of services. However, it also presents significant challenges stemming from dispersed node locations and intricate network topologies. In this paper, we have proposed a topology-aware MSA characterized by a three-tier network traffic model encompassing the service, microservices, and edge node layers. This model meticulously characterizes the complex dependencies between edge network topologies and microservices, mapping microservice deployment onto link traffic to accurately estimate communication delay. Building upon this model, we have formulated a weighted sum communication delay optimization problem considering different types of services. Then, a novel topology-aware and individual-adaptive microservices deployment (TAIA-MD) scheme is proposed to solve the problem efficiently, which accurately senses the network topology and incorporates an individual-adaptive mechanism in a genetic algorithm to accelerate the convergence and avoid local optima. Extensive simulations show that, compared to the existing deployment schemes, TAIA-MD improves the communication delay performance by approximately 30% to 60% and effectively enhances the overall network performance. Furthermore, we implement the TAIA-MD scheme on a practical microservice physical platform. The experimental results demonstrate that TAIA-MD achieves superior robustness in withstanding link failures and network fluctuations.</description>

      <title>QMDB: Quick Merkle Database</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Updating, managing, and proving world state are key bottlenecks facing the execution layer of blockchains today. Existing storage solutions are not flash-optimized and suffer from high flash write amplification and excessive DRAM requirements, forcing a trade-off between throughput and decentralization. We present the Quick Merkle Database (QMDB), an SSD-optimized authenticated data structure that delivers a superset of the features of existing databases. QMDB's append-only design enables 1 SSD read per state access, $O(1)$ I/Os for updates, and in-memory Merkleization on a DRAM footprint small enough to fit on consumer-grade PCs. We demonstrate that QMDB offers a significant leap in throughput ($6 \times$ over RocksDB and $8 \times$ over a state-of-the-art verifiable database) and validate its scalability on datasets up to 15 billion entries ($10 \times$ Ethereum's state size in 2024). Our projections indicate QMDB could store a theoretical maximum of 280 billion entries on a single machine, far exceeding current blockchain requirements. QMDB scales across both commodity and enterprise hardware, achieving up to 2 million state updates per second. QMDB sets a new benchmark for verifiable databases, alleviating today's storage bottlenecks, lowering barriers to blockchain participation, and unlocking new blockchain applications.</description>

      <title>Can vehicular cloud replace edge computing?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Edge computing (EC) consists of deploying computation resources close to the users, thus enabling low-latency applications, such as augmented reality and online gaming. However, large-scale deployment of edge nodes can be highly impractical and expensive. Besides EC, there is a rising concept known as Vehicular Cloud Computing (VCC). VCC is a computing paradigm that amplifies the capabilities of vehicles by exploiting part of their computational resources, enabling them to participate in services similar to those provided by the EC. The advantage of VCC is that it can opportunistically exploit part of the computation resources already present on vehicles, thus relieving a network operator from the deployment and maintenance cost of EC nodes. However, it is still unknown under which circumstances VCC can enable low-latency applications without EC. In this work, we show that VCC has the potential to effectively supplant EC in urban areas, especially given the higher density of vehicles in such environments. The goal of this paper is to analyze, via simulation, the key parameters determining the conditions under which this substitution of EC by VCC is feasible. In addition, we provide a high level cost analysis to show that VCC is much less costly for a network operator than adopting EC.</description>

      <title>Relative Phase Equivariant Deep Neural Systems for Physical Layer Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the era of telecommunications, the increasing demand for complex and specialized communication systems has led to a focus on improving physical layer communications. Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a promising solution avenue for doing so. Deep neural receivers have already shown significant promise in improving the performance of communications systems. However, a major challenge lies in developing deep neural receivers that match the energy efficiency and speed of traditional receivers. This work investigates the incorporation of inductive biases in the physical layer using group-equivariant deep learning to improve the parameter efficiency of deep neural receivers. We do so by constructing a deep neural receiver that is equivariant with respect to the phase of arrival. We show that the inclusion of relative phase equivariance significantly reduces the error rate of deep neural receivers at similar model sizes. Thus, we show the potential of group-equivariant deep learning in the domain of physical layer communications.</description>

      <title>Distributed Learning and Inference Systems: A Networking Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning models have achieved, and in some cases surpassed, human-level performance in various tasks, mainly through centralized training of static models and the use of large models stored in centralized clouds for inference. However, this centralized approach has several drawbacks, including privacy concerns, high storage demands, a single point of failure, and significant computing requirements. These challenges have driven interest in developing alternative decentralized and distributed methods for AI training and inference. Distribution introduces additional complexity, as it requires managing multiple moving parts. To address these complexities and fill a gap in the development of distributed AI systems, this work proposes a novel framework, Data and Dynamics-Aware Inference and Training Networks (DA-ITN). The different components of DA-ITN and their functions are explored, and the associated challenges and research areas are highlighted.</description>

      <title>Optimal Scheduling in a Quantum Switch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With a growing number of quantum networks in operation, there is a pressing need for performance analysis of quantum switching technologies. A quantum switch establishes, distributes, and maintains entanglements across a network. In contrast to a classical switching fabric, a quantum switch is a two sided queueing network. The switch generates Link Level Entanglements (LLEs), which are then fused to process the networks entanglement requests. Our proof techniques analyse a two time scale separation phenomenon at the fluid scale for a general switch topology. This allows us to demonstrate that the optimal fluid dynamics are given by a scheduling algorithm that solves a certain average reward Markov Decision Process.</description>

      <title>Deterministic and Reliable Software-Defined Vehicles: key building blocks, challenges, and vision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17287v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As vehicle systems become increasingly complex, with more features, services, sensors, actuators, and processing units, it is important to view vehicles not just as modes of transportation moving toward full autonomy, but also as adaptive systems that respond to the needs of their occupants. Vehicular services can be developed to support these adaptations. However, the increasing complexity of vehicular service development, even with current standardizations, best practices and guidelines, are insufficient to tackle the high complexity of development, with expectations of up to 1 (U.S.) billion lines of code for a fully (level 5) autonomous vehicle. Within this survey, the paradigm of Deterministic Software Defined Vehicles is explored, aiming to enhance the quality and ease of developing automotive services by focusing on service-oriented architectures, virtualization techniques, and the necessary deterministic intra- and inter-vehicular communications. Considering the main open challenges for such verticals, a vision architecture towards improved services development and orchestration is presented, focusing on: a) a deterministic network configurator; b) a data layer configurator; c) a hypervisor configurator; d) the vehicle abstraction layer; and e) a software orchestrator.</description>

      <title>Interpreting Deep Neural Network-Based Receiver Under Varying Signal-To-Noise Ratios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16768v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel method for interpreting neural networks, focusing on convolutional neural network-based receiver model. The method identifies which unit or units of the model contain most (or least) information about the channel parameter(s) of the interest, providing insights at both global and local levels -- with global explanations aggregating local ones. Experiments on link-level simulations demonstrate the method's effectiveness in identifying units that contribute most (and least) to signal-to-noise ratio processing. Although we focus on a radio receiver model, the method generalizes to other neural network architectures and applications, offering robust estimation even in high-dimensional settings.</description>

      <title>Optimal Routing and Link Configuration for Covert Heterogeneous Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07059v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nodes in contemporary radio networks often have multiple interfaces available for communication: WiFi, cellular, LoRa, Zigbee, etc. This motivates understanding both link and network configuration when multiple communication modalities with vastly different capabilities are available to each node. In conjunction, covertness or the hiding of radio communications is often a significant concern in both commercial and military wireless networks. We consider the optimal routing problem in wireless networks when nodes have multiple interfaces available and intend to hide the presence of the transmission from attentive and capable adversaries. We first consider the maximization of the route capacity given an end-to-end covertness constraint against a single adversary and we find a polynomial-time algorithm for optimal route selection and link configuration. We further provide optimal polynomial-time algorithms for two important extensions: (i) statistical uncertainty during optimization about the channel state information for channels from system nodes to the adversary; and, (ii) maintaining covertness against multiple adversaries. Numerical results are included to demonstrate the gains of employing heterogeneous radio resources and to compare the performance of the proposed approach versus alternatives.</description>

      <title>CensorLab: A Testbed for Censorship Experimentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16349v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Censorship and censorship circumvention are closely connected, and each is constantly making decisions in reaction to the other. When censors deploy a new Internet censorship technique, the anti-censorship community scrambles to find and develop circumvention strategies against the censor's new strategy, i.e., by targeting and exploiting specific vulnerabilities in the new censorship mechanism. We believe that over-reliance on such a reactive approach to circumvention has given the censors the upper hand in the censorship arms race, becoming a key reason for the inefficacy of in-the-wild circumvention systems. Therefore, we argue for a proactive approach to censorship research: the anti-censorship community should be able to proactively develop circumvention mechanisms against hypothetical or futuristic censorship strategies. To facilitate proactive censorship research, we design and implement CensorLab, a generic platform for emulating Internet censorship scenarios. CensorLab aims to complement currently reactive circumvention research by efficiently emulating past, present, and hypothetical censorship strategies in realistic network environments. Specifically, CensorLab aims to (1) support all censorship mechanisms previously or currently deployed by real-world censors; (2) support the emulation of hypothetical (not-yet-deployed) censorship strategies including advanced data-driven censorship mechanisms (e.g., ML-based traffic classifiers); (3) provide an easy-to-use platform for researchers and practitioners enabling them to perform extensive experimentation; and (4) operate efficiently with minimal overhead. We have implemented CensorLab as a fully functional, flexible, and high-performance platform, and showcase how it can be used to emulate a wide range of censorship scenarios, from traditional IP blocking and keyword filtering to hypothetical ML-based censorship mechanisms.</description>
