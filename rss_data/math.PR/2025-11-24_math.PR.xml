      <title>Hipster random walks, random series-parallel graph and random homogeneous systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a class of random homogeneous systems. Our main result says that under suitable general assumptions, these systems converge weakly, upon a suitable normalization, to the probability distribution with density $\frac34 \, (1-x^2) \, {\bf 1}_{\{ x\in (-1, \, 1)\} }$. Two special cases are of particular interest: for the effective resistance of the critical random series-parallel graph, our result gives an affirmative answer to a conjecture of Hambly and Jordan (Adv. Appl. Probab. 2004) and further conjectures of Addario-Berry et al. (Probab.Theory Related Fields 2020) and Derrida whereas for the hipster random walk, we recover a previous result of Addario-Berry et al.~(Probab. Theory Related Fields 2020).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.16973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a class of time-inhomogeneous SDEs with jumps, we establish criteria for the existence and uniqueness of the nonnegative solutions, and examine the extinction, the explosion together with the contractivity of the solutions, which generalize and improve upon earlier results in the literature. As an application, we study the aforementioned properties for a class of mean field SDEs.</description>

      <title>A mixed fractional CIR model: positivity and an implicit Euler scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a Cox--Ingersoll--Ross (CIR) type short rate model driven by a mixed fractional Brownian motion. Let $M=B+B^H$ be a one-dimensional mixed fractional Brownian motion with Hurst index $H&gt;1/2$, and let $\mathbf{M}=(M,\mathbb{M}^{\mathrm{It\hat{o}}})$ denote its canonical It\^o rough path lift. We study the rough differential equation \begin{equation}\label{eqn1} \dd r_t = k(\theta-r_t)\,\dd t + \sigma\sqrt{r_t}\,\dd\mathbf{M}_t,\qquad r_0&gt;0, \end{equation} and prove that, under the Feller condition $2k\theta&gt;\sigma^2$, the unique rough path solution is almost surely strictly positive for all times. The proof relies on an It\^o type formula for rough paths, together with refined pathwise estimates for the mixed fractional Brownian motion, including L\'evy's modulus of continuity for the Brownian part and a law of the iterated logarithm for the fractional component. As a consequence, the positivity property of the classical CIR model extends to this non-Markovian rough path setting. We also establish the convergence of an implicit Euler scheme for the associated singular equation obtained by a square-root transformation.</description>

      <title>Backward Stochastic Differential Equations with Nonlinear Expectation Reflection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a kind of constrained backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs) such that the nonlinear expectation of the composition of a loss function and the solution remains above zero. The existence and uniqueness result is established with the help of the Skorokhod problem and the method of contraction mapping. We provide the comparison properties for the pointwise value of the solutions and the expectation of the solutions, respectively. In addition, a similar BSDE with risk measure reflection is proposed, which can be applied to the superhedging for contingent claims under risk management constraints.</description>

      <title>Central limit theorem for the range of critical branching random walk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study second order fluctuations for the size of the range of a critical branching random walk (BRW) in $\mathbb Z^d$. We consider the BRW with geometric offspring indexed by the Kesten tree, and show that the size of its range has linear variance when $d&gt;8$, and satisfies a central limit theorem (CLT) with Gaussian limiting distribution when $d&gt;16$. The proof relies on the stationarity of the model under depth-first exploration, a general CLT by Dedecker and Merlev\`ede [7], a truncation technique exploiting the local independence of tree structures, and a recursion argument for moment bounds.</description>

      <title>Quartic variation of the solution to the semilinear stochastic heat equation: limit behavior and asymptotic independence with respect to the data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work concerns the limit behavior of the quartic variation (i.e., the power variation of order four) with respect to the time variable of the solution to the semilinear stochastic heat equation with space-time white noise. In a first step, we prove that this sequence satisfies a Central Limit Theorem and we deduce a similar result for the viscosity parameter estimator associated with the quartic variation. Then, by using a recent variant of the Stein-Malliavin calculus, we analyze the asymptotic independence between the quartic variation (as well as the associated viscosity parameter estimator) and the data used to construct it.</description>

      <title>Weak approximation for Gaussian processes from renewal processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In previous works, Bardina and Rovira (2023) constructed a family of processes that converge strongly towards Brownian motion, defined from renewal processes, are constructed. In this paper we prove that some of these processes can be utilized to build approximations of Gaussian processes such as fractional Brownian motion or multiple Stratonovich integrals and we provide sufficient conditions on renewal processes to ensure that the convergence holds. An illustrative example of such a Gaussian process is the fractional Brownian motion with any Hurst parameter.</description>

      <title>Kac-Stroock type approximations for the Brownian motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present paper we show that the processes $X_n = \{X_n(t) \colon t \in [0,1]\}$, $n \in \mathbb{N}$, defined by $X_n(t) = \sqrt{n}C\int_0^t (-1)^{L(nu)} du$, where $L = \{L(t) \colon t \geq 0\}$ is a renewal processes whose inter-arrival times satisfy some integrability conditions and $C &gt; 0$ is some normalizing constant, weakly converge, in the space of continuous functions over $[0,1]$, $\mathcal{C}([0,1])$, to the Brownian motion as $n$ approaches infinity. Thus, generalizing the result of D. W. Stroock (1982), where $L$ is taken to be a standard Poisson process. In particular, we see that these results are a mere consequence of Donsker's invariance principle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.17284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article studies regularity properties of multiplicative stochastic processes on infinite-dimensional Lie groups. We investigate conditions under which these processes admit c\`adl\`ag modifications and derive bounds on their local behavior. Our approach builds on the local equivalence of Banach-Lie groups and Banach spaces via the exponential and logarithm, allowing us to transfer analytic estimates and structural results.</description>

      <title>The Atlas Model and SDEs with Boundary Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the mean-field limit of the Atlas model and its connection to SDEs with dependence on the distribution of hitting and local times. The Atlas model describes a system of Brownian particles on the real line, where only the lowest ranked particle receives a positive drift, proportional to the number of particles. We show that in the mean-field limit the particle system converges to a novel SDE with reflection at a moving boundary, whose motion is such that the average local time spent at the boundary grows at a constant rate. In general, the boundary is represented by a measure, so the reflection must be interpreted in a relaxed sense. However, for sufficiently regular initial particle profiles, we prove that the boundary is a continuous function. Our analysis relies on a reformulation of the problem via McKean--Vlasov SDEs with interaction through hitting and local times.</description>

      <title>On Solving Chance-Constrained Models with Gaussian Mixture Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study linear chance-constrained problems where the coefficients follow a Gaussian mixture distribution. We provide mixed-binary quadratic programs that give inner and outer approximations of the chance constraint based on piecewise linear approximations of the standard normal cumulative density function. We show that $O\left(\sqrt{\ln(1/\tau)/\tau} \right)$ pieces are sufficient to attain $\tau$-accuracy in the chance constraint. We also show that any desired optimality gap can be achieved under a constraint qualification condition by controlling the approximation accuracy. Extensive computations using a commercial solver show that problems with up to one thousand random coefficients specified with up to fifteen Gaussian mixture components, generated under diverse settings, can be solved to near optimality within 18 hours, while satisfying chance constraint satisfaction probabilities of up to $0.999$. The solution times are significantly lower for problems with fewer random coefficients and mixture terms. For example, problems with one hundred random coefficients, ten mixture terms, and a constraint satisfaction probability of $0.999$ can be solved in a minute or less. Sample average approximations fail to provide meaningful solutions even for the smaller problems.</description>

      <title>Local wellposedness of the 2d Anderson-Gross-Pitaevskii equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, the local wellposedness of a general Gross-Pitaevskii equation with rough potential is proven in dimension 2. The class of rough potentials we are considering is large enough to contain the spatial white noise and thus a renormalization procedure may be needed. We first construct the associated Schr\"odinger operator from its quadratic form. Then, the regularity of elements of its domain is explored. This allows to use a paracontrolled approach in order to obtain Strichartz estimates, which are used to prove the local wellposedness by a contraction argument.</description>

      <title>Quadratic Mean-Field BSDEs and Exponential Utility Maximization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study real-valued mean-field backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs) of the form \[ Y_t = \xi + \int_t^T \widetilde{\mathbb E}\, g(s, Z_s, \tilde Z_s)\, ds - \int_t^T Z_s \, dW_s, \] where $\tilde Z$ denotes an independent copy of $Z$ and $\widetilde{\mathbb E}$ the expectation with respect to $\tilde Z$. Under a \emph{separately quadratic} growth assumption (H\textsubscript{q}) on the generator $g$ in $(Z,\tilde Z)$, together with a bounded terminal condition, we prove existence and uniqueness of solutions in $\mathbb S^\infty \times \mathbb H^2_{\mathrm{BMO}}$. Our approach departs from classical fixed-point arguments and instead combines Malliavin calculus with refined BMO and stability estimates: we first obtain uniform $\mathbb S^\infty$-bounds for $Z$ in a Lipschitz setting with bounded Malliavin derivative, and then pass to the quadratic case by approximation, using a stability result in $\mathbb S^2\times\mathbb H^2$. This closes the gap between the quadratic BSDE results of Cheridito and Nam (2017) and Hao et al. (2025).
  In the second part of the paper, we extend the framework to generators of the form $g(t,z,\tilde z,\bar z)$ satisfying a \emph{fully coupled quadratic} condition (H\textsubscript{q}$'$). In this general regime we establish existence and uniqueness under a smallness condition on the centered terminal variable. As an application, we solve a mean-field exponential utility maximization problem with a collective liability, thereby generalizing the classical utility maximization framework of Hu et al. (2005) to a fully coupled quadratic mean-field setting.</description>

      <title>Fast Decoding for Non-Adaptive Learning of Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi Random Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of learning an unknown graph via group queries on node subsets, where each query reports whether at least one edge is present among the queried nodes. In general, learning arbitrary graphs with \(n\) nodes and \(k\) edges is hard in the non-adaptive setting, requiring \(\Omega\big(\min\{k^2\log n,\,n^2\}\big)\) tests even when a small error probability is allowed. We focus on learning Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi (ER) graphs \(G\sim\ER(n,q)\) in the non-adaptive setting, where the expected number of edges is \(\bar{k}=q\binom{n}{2}\), and we aim to design an efficient testing--decoding scheme achieving asymptotically vanishing error probability. Prior work (Li--Fresacher--Scarlett, NeurIPS 2019) presents a testing--decoding scheme that attains an order-optimal number of tests \(O(\bar{k}\log n)\) but incurs \(\Omega(n^2)\) decoding time, whereas their proposed sublinear-time algorithm incurs an extra \((\log \bar{k})(\log n)\) factor in the number of tests. We extend the binary splitting approach, recently developed for non-adaptive group testing, to the ER graph learning setting, and prove that the edge set can be recovered with high probability using \(O(\bar{k}\log n)\) tests while attaining decoding time \(O(\bar{k}^{1+\delta}\log n)\) for any fixed \(\delta&gt;0\).</description>

      <title>A Proof of Talagrand's Creating Large Sets Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Talagrand conjectured that if a family of sets $\mathcal{F}$ over $X = \{ 1,2,\cdots, N \}$ is of large measure, then constant times of unions of sets in $\mathcal{F}$ will cover a large portion of the power set of $X$. This conjecture is a central open problem at the intersection of combinatorics and probability theory, and was described by Talagrand as a personal favorite. This paper provides a proof confirming this conjecture.</description>

      <title>Empirical universality and non-universality of local dynamics in the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several recent works have aimed to design algorithms for optimizing the Hamiltonians of spin glass models from statistical physics. While Montanari (2018) eventually gave a sophisticated message-passing algorithm to do this nearly optimally for the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) model, Parisi (2003) observed earlier that a simple yet unusual algorithm seems to perform just as well: perform local reluctant search, repeatedly making the local adjustment improving the objective function by the smallest possible amount. This is in contrast to the more intuitive local greedy search that repeatedly makes the local adjustment improving the objective by the largest possible amount. We study empirically how the performance of these algorithms depends on the distribution of entries of the coupling matrix in the SK model. We find evidence that, while the runtime of greedy search enjoys universality over a broad range of distributions, the runtime of reluctant search surprisingly is not universal, sometimes depending quite sensitively on the entry distribution. We propose that one mechanism leading to this non-universality is a change in the behavior of reluctant search when the couplings have discrete support on an evenly-spaced grid, and give experimental results supporting this proposal and investigating other properties of a distribution that might affect the performance of reluctant search.</description>

      <title>Optimal Strategy in "Guess Who?": Beyond Binary Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.03327</link>
      <description>arXiv:1509.03327v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: "Guess Who?" is a popular two player game where players ask "Yes"/"No" questions to search for their opponent's secret identity from a pool of possible candidates. This is modeled as a simple stochastic game. Using this model, the optimal strategy is explicitly found. Contrary to popular belief, performing a binary search is \emph{not} always optimal. Instead, the optimal strategy for the player who trails is to make certain bold plays in an attempt catch up. This is discovered by first analyzing a continuous version of the game where players play indefinitely and the winner is never decided after finitely many rounds.</description>

      <title>Convergence of trees with a given degree sequence and of their associated laminations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2111.07748v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study uniform rooted plane trees with given degree sequence. We show, under some natural hypotheses on the degree sequence, that these trees converge toward the so-called Inhomogeneous Continuum Random Tree after renormalisation. Our proof relies on the convergence of a modification of the well-known Lukasiewicz path. We also give a unified treatment of the limit, as the number of vertices tends to infinity, of the fragmentation process derived by cutting-down the edges of a tree with a given degree sequence, including its geometric representation by a lamination-valued process. The latter is a collection of nested laminations that are compact subsets of the unit disk made of non-crossing chords. In particular, we prove an equivalence between Gromov-weak convergence of discrete trees and the convergence of their associated lamination-valued processes.</description>

      <title>The Gaussian free-field as a stream function: continuum version of the scale-by-scale homogenization result</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00709v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This note is about a drift-diffusion process $X$ with a time-independent, divergence-free drift $b$, where $b$ is a smooth Gaussian field that decorrelates over large scales. In two space dimensions, this just fails to fall into the standard theory of stochastic homogenization, and leads to a borderline super-diffusive behavior. In a previous paper by Chatzigeorgiou, Morfe, Otto, and Wang (2022), precise asymptotics of the annealed second moments of $X$ were derived by characterizing the asymptotics of the effective diffusivity $\lambda_L$ in terms of an artificially introduced large-scale cut-off $L$. The latter was carried out by a scale-by-scale homogenization, and implemented by monitoring the corrector $\phi_L$ for geometrically increasing cut-off scales $L^+=ML$. In fact, proxies $(\tilde\phi_L,\tilde\sigma_L)$ for the corrector and flux corrector were introduced incrementally and the residuum $f_L$ estimated.
  In this short supplementary note, we reproduce the arguments of the above paper in the continuum setting of $M\downarrow 1$. This has the advantage that the definition of the proxies $(\tilde\phi_L,\tilde\sigma_L)$ becomes more transparent -- it is given by a simple It\^{o} SDE with $\ln L$ acting as a time variable. It also has the advantage that the residuum $f_L$, which is a martingale, can be efficiently and precisely estimated by It\^{o} calculus. This relies on the characterization of the quadratic variation of the (infinite-dimensional) Gaussian driver.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05168v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a degree-biased cutting process on random recursive trees, where each vertex is deleted with probability proportional to its degree. We establish the splitting property and derive the explicit distribution of the number of vertices deleted in each cut. This leads to a recursive formula for Kn, the number of cuts needed to erase a random recursive tree with n vertices. Furthermore, we show that Kn is stochastically dominated by Jn, the number of jumps made by a related walk with a barrier. We prove that Jn converges in distribution to a random variable with a spectrally negative stable distribution. Finally, we examine connections between this cutting procedure and a coalescing process on the set of n elements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15983v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note, we connect two seemingly unrelated objects: On the one hand is a two-dimensional drift-diffusion process $X$ with divergence-free and time-independent drift $b$. The drift is given by a stationary Gaussian ensemble, and we focus on the critical case where a small-scale cut-off is necessary for well-posedness and the large-scale cancellations lead to a borderline super-diffusive behavior. On the other hand is the natural diffusion $F$ on the Lie group $\textbf{SL}(2)$ of matrices of determinant one. As a consequence of this connection, the strongly non-Gaussian character of $F$ transmits to how $X$ depends on its starting point.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19762v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To what extent is the underlying distribution of a finitely supported unbiased random walk on $\mathbb{Z}$ determined by the sequence of times at which the walk returns to the origin? The main result of this paper is that, in various senses, most unbiased random walks on $\mathbb{Z}$ are determined up to equivalence by the sequence $I_1,I_2,I_3,\ldots$, where $I_n$ denotes the probability of being at the origin after $n$ steps. We also give an application to an inverse problem from asymptotic representation theory. The proof uses Laplace's method and a delicate Galois-theoretic analysis which ultimately depends on the classification of finite simple groups.</description>

      <title>Energy field of critical Ising model and examples of singular fields in QFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02554v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to prove singularity of three natural fields in QFT with respect to their natural base measure. The fields we consider are the following ones:
  (1) The near-critical limit of the $2d$ Ising model (in the $\beta$-direction) is locally singular w.r.t the critical scaling limit of $2d$ Ising. (N.B. In the $h$-direction it is not locally singular).
  (2) The $2d$ Hierarchical Sine-Gordon field is singular w.r.t the $2d$ hierarchical Gaussian Free Field for all $\beta\in[\beta_{L^2}, \beta_{BKT})$.
  (3) The Hierarchical $\Phi^4_3$ field is singular w.r.t the $3d$ hierarchical GFF.
  Item (1) gives the first strong indication that the energy field of critical $2d$ Ising model does not exist as a random Schwarz distribution on the plane. Item (2) has been proved to be singular for the non-hierarchical $2d$ Sine-Gordon sufficiently far from the BKT point in [GM24] while item (3) is proved to be singular for the non-hierarchical $3d$ $\Phi^4_3$ field in [BG21, OOT21, HKN24].
  We believe our way to detect a singular behaviour at all scales is very much down to earth and may be applicable in all settings where one has a good enough control on the so-called effective potentials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05062v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dynamics of a general structured population is modelled using a general stochastic differential equation (SDE) with an infinite decomposability property. This property allows the population to be divided into an arbitrary number of allelic components, also known as stochastic neutral fractions. When demographic noise is small, a fast-slow principle provides a general formula for the effective population size in structured populations. To illustrate this approach, we revisit several examples from the literature, including expansion fronts.</description>

Abstract: We consider infinite-dimensional random diffusion dynamics for the Asakura--Oosawa model of interacting hard spheres of two different sizes. We construct a solution to the corresponding SDE with collision local times, analyse its reversible measures, and observe the emergence of an attractive short-range depletion interaction between the large spheres. We study the Gibbs measures associated to this new interaction, exploring connections to percolation and optimal packing.</description>

      <title>Emergence of microbial host dormancy during a persistent virus epidemic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04943v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a minimal stochastic individual-based model for a microbial population challenged by a persistent (lytic) virus epidemic. We focus on the situation in which the resident microbial host population and the virus population are in stable coexistence upon arrival of a single new ``mutant'' host individual. We assume that this mutant is capable of switching to a reversible state of dormancy upon contact with virions as a means of avoiding infection by the virus. At the same time, we assume that this new dormancy trait comes with a cost, namely a reduced individual reproduction rate. We prove that there is a non-trivial range of parameters where the mutants can nevertheless invade the resident population with strictly positive probability (bounded away from 0) in the large population limit. Given the reduced reproductive rate, such an invasion would be impossible in the absence of either the dormancy trait or the virus epidemic. We explicitly characterize the parameter regime where this emergence of a (costly) host dormancy trait is possible, determine the success probability of a single invader and the typical amount of time it takes the successful mutants to reach a macroscopic population size. We conclude this study by an investigation of the fate of the population after the successful emergence of a dormancy trait. Heuristic arguments and simulations suggest that after successful invasion, either both host types and the virus will reach coexistence, or the mutants will drive the resident hosts to extinction while the virus will stay in the system.</description>

      <title>Some developments of exchangeable measure-valued P\'{o}lya sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01594v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Measure-valued P\'{o}lya sequences (MVPS) are processes whose dynamics are governed by generalized P\'{o}lya urn schemes with infinitely many colors. Assuming a general reinforcement rule, exchangeable MVPSs can be viewed as extensions of Blackwell and MacQueen's P\'{o}lya sequence, which characterizes an exchangeable sequence whose directing random measure has a Dirichlet process prior distribution. Here, we show that the prior distribution of any exchangeable MVPS is a Dirichlet process mixture with respect to a latent parameter that is associated with the atoms of an emergent conditioning $\sigma$-algebra. As the mixing components have disjoint supports, the directing random measure can be interpreted as a random histogram with bins randomly located on these same atoms. Furthermore, we extend the basic exchangeable MVPS to include a null component in the reinforcement, which corresponds to the presence of a fixed component in the directing random measure. Finally, we examine the effects of relaxing exchangeability to conditional identity in distribution (c.i.d.) and find out that the two are equivalent for balanced MVPSs. The paper features a complementary study of some properties of probability kernels that underlies the analysis of exchangeable and c.i.d. MVPSs.</description>

      <title>Contraction of Markovian Operators in Orlicz Spaces and Error Bounds for Markov Chain Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11200v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel concept of convergence for Markovian processes within Orlicz spaces, extending beyond the conventional approach associated with $L_p$ spaces. After showing that Markovian operators are contractive in Orlicz spaces, our key technical contribution is an upper bound on their contraction coefficient, which admits a closed-form expression. The bound is tight in some settings, and it recovers well-known results, such as the connection between contraction and ergodicity, ultra-mixing and Doeblin's minorisation. Specialising our approach to $L_p$ spaces leads to a significant improvement upon classical Riesz-Thorin's interpolation methods.
  Furthermore, by exploiting the flexibility offered by Orlicz spaces, we can tackle settings where the stationary distribution is heavy-tailed, a severely under-studied setup. The technical tools introduced lend themselves to providing novel bounds on the contraction coefficient (SDPI constant) of information-theoretic divergences. We thus provide a variety of examples in which we show an improvement over the state of the art. As an application of the framework put forward in the paper, we introduce tighter bounds on the mixing time of Markovian processes, better exponential concentration bounds for MCMC methods, and better lower bounds on the burn-in period. To conclude, we show how our results can be used to prove the concentration of measure phenomenon for a sequence of Markovian random variables.</description>

Abstract: We consider an insurance company which faces financial risk in the form of insurance claims and market-dependent surplus fluctuations. The company aims to simultaneously control its terminal wealth (e.g. at the end of an accounting period) and the ruin probability in a finite time interval by purchasing reinsurance. The target functional is given by the expected utility of terminal wealth perturbed by a modified Gerber-Shiu penalty function. We solve the problem of finding the optimal reinsurance strategy and the corresponding maximal target functional via neural networks. The procedure is illustrated by a numerical example, where the surplus process is given by a Cram\'er-Lundberg model perturbed by a mean-reverting Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process.</description>

      <title>A General Approach to the Shape Transition of Run-and-Tumble Particles: The 1D PDMP Framework for Invariant Measure Regularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02274v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Run-and-tumble particles (RTPs) have emerged as a paradigmatic example for studying nonequilibrium phenomena in statistical mechanics. The invariant measure of a wide class of RTPs subjected to a potential possesses a density that is continuous at high tumble rates but exhibits divergences at low ones. This key feature, known as shape transition, constitutes a qualitative indicator of the relative closeness (continuous density) or strong deviation (diverging density) from the equilibrium setting. Furthermore, the points at which the density diverges correspond to the configurations where the system spends most of its time in the low tumble rate regime. Building on and extending existing results concerning the regularity of the invariant measure of one-dimensional dynamical systems with random switching, we show how to characterize the shape transition even in situations where the invariant measure cannot be computed explicitly. Our analysis confirms shape transition as a robust, general feature of RTPs subjected to a potential. We also refine the regularity theory for the invariant measure of one-dimensional dynamical systems with random switching.</description>

      <title>Longest increasing subsequences for distributions with atoms, and an inhomogeneous Hammersley process</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05775v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A famous result by Hammersley and Versik-Kerov states that the length $L_n$ of the longest increasing subsequence among $n$ iid continuous random variables grows like $2\sqrt{n}$. We investigate here the asymptotic behavior of $L_n$ for distributions with atoms. For purely discrete random variables, we characterize the asymptotic order of $L_n$ through a variational problem and provide explicit estimates for classical distributions. The proofs rely on a coupling with an inhomogeneous version of the discrete-time continuous-space Hammersley process. This reveals that, in contrast to the continuous case, the discrete setting exhibits a wide range of growth rates between $\mathcal{O}(1)$ and $o(\sqrt{n})$, depending on the tail behavior of the distribution. We can then easily deduce the asymptotics of $L_n$ for a completely arbitrary distribution.</description>

      <title>Divide, Interact, Sample: The Two-System Paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09162v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mean-field, ensemble-chain, and adaptive samplers have historically been viewed as distinct approaches to Monte Carlo sampling. In this paper, we present a unifying {two-system} framework that brings all three under one roof. In our approach, an ensemble of particles is split into two interacting subsystems that propose updates for each other in a symmetric, alternating fashion. This cross-system interaction ensures that the overall ensemble has $\rho(x)$ as its invariant distribution in both the finite-particle setting and the mean-field limit. The two-system construction reveals that ensemble-chain samplers can be interpreted as finite-$N$ approximations of an ideal mean-field sampler; conversely, it provides a principled recipe to discretize mean-field Langevin dynamics into tractable parallel MCMC algorithms. The framework also connects naturally to adaptive single-chain methods: by replacing particle-based statistics with time-averaged statistics from a single chain, one recovers analogous adaptive dynamics in the long-time limit without requiring a large ensemble. We derive novel two-system versions of both overdamped and underdamped Langevin MCMC samplers within this paradigm. Across synthetic benchmarks and real-world posterior inference tasks, these two-system samplers exhibit significant performance gains over the popular No-U-Turn Sampler, achieving an order of magnitude higher effective sample sizes per gradient evaluation.</description>

      <title>Wiener-Type Theorems for the Laplace Transform. With Applications to Ground State Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02867v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the behavior of a probability measure near the bottom of its support in terms of time averaged quotients of its Laplace transform. We discuss how our results are connected to both rank-one perturbation theory as well as renewal theory. We further apply our results in order to derive criteria for the existence and non-existence of ground states for a finite dimensional quantum system coupled to a bosonic field.</description>
