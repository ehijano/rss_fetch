      <title>Updated constraints on the primordial power spectrum at sub-Mpc scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The primordial power spectrum of matter density perturbations contains highly valuable information about new fundamental physics, in particular cosmological inflation, but is only very weakly constrained observationally for small cosmological scales $k\gtrsim 3\,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$. We derive novel constraints, $\mathcal{P}_\mathcal{R}(k)\lesssim 5\cdot10^{-6}$ over a large range of such scales, from the formation of ultracompact minihalos in the early universe. Unlike most existing constraints of this type, our results do not rest on the assumption that dark matter can annihilate into ordinary matter.</description>

      <title>SPT-3G D1: CMB temperature and polarization power spectra and cosmology from 2019 and 2020 observations of the SPT-3G Main field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present measurements of the temperature and E-mode polarization angular power spectra of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) from observations of 4% of the sky with SPT-3G, the current camera on the South Pole Telescope (SPT). The maps used in this analysis are the deepest used in a CMB TT/TE/EE analysis to date. The maps and resulting power spectra have been validated through blind and unblind tests. The measurements of the lensed EE and TE spectra are the most precise to date at l=1800-4000 and l=2200-4000, respectively. Combining our TT/TE/EE spectra with previously published SPT-3G CMB lensing results, we find parameters for the standard LCDM model consistent with Planck and ACT-DR6 with comparable constraining power. We report a Hubble constant of $H_0=66.66\pm0.60$ km/s/Mpc from SPT-3G alone, 6.2 sigma away from local measurements from SH0ES. For the first time, combined ground-based (SPT+ACT) CMB primary and lensing data have reached Planck's constraining power on some parameters, a milestone for CMB cosmology. The combination of these three CMB experiments yields the tightest CMB constraints to date, with $H_0=67.24\pm0.35$ km/s/Mpc, and the amplitude of clustering $\sigma_8=0.8137\pm0.0038$. CMB data alone show no evidence for physics beyond LCDM; however, we observe a 2.8 sigma difference in LCDM between CMB and baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) results from DESI-DR2, which is relaxed in extended models. The combination of CMB and BAO yields 2-3 sigma shifts from LCDM in the curvature of the universe, the amplitude of CMB lensing, or the dark energy equation of state. It also drives mild preferences for models that address the Hubble tension through modified recombination or variations in the electron mass in a non-flat universe. This work highlights the growing power of ground-based CMB experiments and lays a foundation for further cosmological analyses with SPT-3G.</description>

      <title>Dark Classification Matters: Searching for Primordial Black Holes with LSST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present projected constraints on the abundance of primordial black holes (PBHs) as a constituent of dark matter, based on microlensing observations from the upcoming Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) at the Vera C. Rubin Observatory. We use a catalogue of microlensing light curves simulated with Rubin Observatory's OpSims to demonstrate that competitive constraints crucially rely on minimising the false positive rate (FPR) of the classification algorithm. We propose the Bayesian information criterion and a Boosted Decision Tree as effective discriminators and compare their derived efficiency and FPR to a more standard $\chi^2$-test.</description>

      <title>New bounds on Memory Burdened Primordial Black Holes from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) with masses below $10^9\,\rm{g}$ are typically assumed to have negligible cosmological impact due to their rapid evaporation via Hawking radiation. However, the 'memory burden' effect, which is a quantum suppression of PBH evaporation, can dramatically alter their decay dynamics. In this work, we revisit early-Universe constraints on ultralight PBHs in this mass range, demonstrating that memory burden significantly alters previous constraints. We compute new cosmological bounds from BBN that strongly limit the presence of ultralight PBHs in the early Universe. We report that the PBHs in the mass range $10^0$-$10^2\,\rm{g}$ for $k=2$ are unconstrained by observations.</description>

      <title>The fate of Quasi-Exponential inflation in the light of ACT-DR6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have revisited quasi-exponential model of inflation in the light of recent ACT-DR6 and Planck-2018 data along with latest constraint on the amplitude of primordial gravity waves. For our analysis we have followed Mukhanov approach for inflationary equation-of-state employing Hamilton-Jacobi formulation. We find that the model is capable of mimicking Planck-2018 results by providing excellent fit to scalar spectral index and its running. Not only that, amount of primordial gravity waves is also in tune with the present observational bound, $r&lt;0.032$. But, when constraints on scalar spectral index and tensor-to-scalar ratio are considered simultaneously quasi-exponential inflation fails to live up to the Planck-2018 result. However when the combination of ACT-DR6 and Planck-2018 data is taken into account inflationary predictions from quasi-exponential model are in excellent agreement. The model also yields sublime fit to the result of joint analysis of ACT-DR6, Planck-2018 and DESI-Y1 data. Further the constraint on primordial gravity waves from the futuristic CMB missions in the likes of LiteBIRD and CMB-S4 when combined with ACT-DR6, Planck-2018 and DESI-Y1 data renders a first-class match with the inflationary predictions from quasi-exponential model of inflation. However, non-detection of primordial gravity waves by LiteBIRD and CMB-S4 will potentially rule out quasi-exponential model.</description>

      <title>Planck Constraints on Axion-Like Particles through Isotropic Cosmic Birefringence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present constraints on isotropic cosmic birefringence induced by axion-like particles (ALPs), derived from the analysis of cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization measurements obtained with the high-frequency channels of Planck. Recent measurements report a hint of isotropic cosmic birefringence, though its origin remains uncertain. The detailed dynamics of ALPs can leave characteristic imprints on the shape of the $EB$ angular power spectrum, which can be exploited to constrain specific models of cosmic birefringence. We first construct a multi-frequency likelihood that incorporates an intrinsic nonzero $EB$ power spectrum. We also show that the likelihood used in previous studies can be further simplified without loss of generality. Using this framework, we simultaneously constrain the ALP model parameters, the instrumental miscalibration angle, and the amplitudes of the $EB$ power spectrum of a Galactic dust foreground model. We find that, if ALPs are responsible for the observed cosmic birefringence, ALP masses at $\log_{10}m_{\phi}[{\rm eV}]\simeq-27.8$, $-27.5$, $-27.3$, $-27.2$, $-27.1$, as well as $\log_{10}m_{\phi}[{\rm eV}]\in[-27.0,-26.5]$, are excluded at more than $2\,\sigma$ statistical significance.</description>

      <title>Prospects for radio weak lensing: studies using LOFAR observations in the ELAIS-N1 field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We carry out a shape and weak lensing analysis of Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) radio sources and Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) optical sources within the European Large Area Infrared Space Observatory Survey-North 1 (ELAIS-N1) field. Using HSC data alone, we detect a cosmic shear correlation signal at a significance of $\sim$$9\sigma$ over a $\sim$$6.4$ deg$^2$ region. For the radio dataset, we analyse observations from both the LOFAR Two Metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) and the International LOFAR Telescope (ILT). While LoTSS provides the deepest radio imaging of ELAIS-N1 with a central source density of $\sim$2.7 arcmin$^{-2}$, its $6^{\prime\prime}$ resolution limits the accuracy of shape measurements. But, using LoTSS-matched HSC sources, we show that accurate radio shape measurements would enable us to measure the amplitude of the shear correlation function at least at $\sim$2$\sigma$ significance. In contrast, ILT observation of the field offers a superior $0.3^{\prime\prime}$ resolution. By cross-matching HSC and ILT samples, we measure a position angle correlation of $R_{\cos(2\alpha)} = 0.15 \pm 0.02$. This result highlights ILT's ability to resolve extended and diffuse emission. The current ILT observations lack the required depth for robust weak lensing measurements. To assess the potential of ILT, we use simulated data with increased observation hours. Our analysis indicates that with 3200 hours of ILT observations or deeper data, and assuming that statistical errors dominate over systematics, a shear correlation could be detected with moderate significance. To achieve this will require precise radio shear measurements and effective mitigation of point spread function (PSF) systematics.</description>

      <title>Statistical Strong Lensing as a Test of Conformal Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As an alternative gravitational theory to General Relativity (GR), Conformal Gravity (CG) can be verified through astronomical observations. Currently, Mannheim and Kazanas have provided vacuum solutions for cosmological and local gravitational systems, and these solutions may resolve the dark matter and dark energy issues encountered in GR, making them particularly valuable. For static, spherically symmetric systems, CG predicts an additional linear potential generated by luminous matter in addition to the conventional Newtonian potential. This extra potential is expected to account for the observations of galaxies and galaxy clusters without the need of dark matter. It is characterized by the parameter $\gamma^*$, which corresponds to the linear potential generated by the unit of the solar mass, and it is thus a universal constant. The value of $\gamma^\ast$ was determined by fitting the rotation curve data of spiral galaxies. These predictions of CG should also be verified by the observations of strong gravitational lensing. In this study, building upon the previous research, we tested CG via strong lensing statistics. We used a well-defined sample that consisted of both galaxies and galaxy clusters. This allowed us to test CG through statistical strong lensing in a way similar to the conventional approach in GR. As anticipated, our results were consistent with previous studies, namely that the fitted $\gamma^*$ is much larger than that from rotation curves. Intriguingly, we further discovered that, in order to fit the strong lensing data of another sample, the value of $\gamma^*$ cannot be a constant, as is required in CG. Instead, we derived a formula for $\gamma^*$ as a function of the stellar mass $M_*$ of the galaxies or galaxy clusters. It was found that $\gamma^*$ decreases as $M_*$ increases.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Gaussian Process Kernels Using Nested Sampling and ABC Rejection for H(z) Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent cosmological observations have achieved high-precision measurements of the Universe's expansion history, prompting the use of nonparametric methods such as Gaussian processes (GP) regression. We apply GP regression for reconstructing the Hubble parameter using CC data, with improved covariance modeling and latest study in CC data. By comparing reconstructions in redshift space $z$ and transformed space $\log(z+1)$ , we evaluate six kernel functions using nested sampling (NS) and approximate Bayesian computation rejection (ABC rejection) methods and analyze the construction of Hubble constant $H_0$ in different models. Our analysis demonstrates that reconstructions in $\log(z+1)$ space remain physically reasonable, offering a viable alternative to conventional $z$ space approaches, while the introduction of nondiagonal covariance matrices leads to degraded reconstruction quality, suggesting that simplified diagonal forms may be preferable for reconstruction. These findings underscore the importance of task-specific kernel selection in GP-based cosmological inference. In particular, our findings suggest that careful preliminary screening of kernel functions, based on the physical quantities of interest, is essential for reliable inference in cosmological research using GP.</description>

      <title>Low multipole mapmaking for global 21-cm experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 21-cm global signal is obscured by very bright galactic and extra galactic foreground emissions. Typical single-spectrum fit (SSF) based methods for foreground/signal separation can result in biased estimates of the cosmological signal due to the presence of spectral oscillations induced by the interaction between chromatic beams and the spatial shape of the foregrounds. Modelling this interaction requires some amount of assumed foreground information. We present a mapmaking-based approach which describes the beam-weighted observation of the sky by multiple globally-distributed antenna experiments as an observation equation. This equation is inverted in order to estimate the low-order sky modes ($\ell\lesssim10$). The resulting chromaticity-free sky monopole is then fit with a smooth foreground function and a 21-cm model. Given the insensitivity of global 21-cm experiments to small angular scales, we rely on the mean and covariance of higher-order foreground modes being known. We show that this mapmaking-based method is capable of inferring the cosmological signal in cases where a SSF with a simple beam-factor based chromaticity correction fails, even when the foreground model used in the mapmaking method features uncertainty at the 10\% level.</description>

      <title>Constraint on Momentum-coupled Dark Energy using DESI DR2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study two scalar field driven dark energy models characterized by the axion potential and the inverse power law potential, each coupled to dark matter through a momentum exchange interaction. By formulating the dynamics as an autonomous system, we identify the equilibrium points and analyze their stability. To constrain these models, we utilize observational data from Pantheon Plus Type Ia Supernovae, DES Y5, DESI DR2 BAO, and Planck 2018 CMB compressed likelihood, employing Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. Both potentials exhibit weak to strong preference over the $\Lambda$CDM model, with a particularly strong preference for the momentum-coupled scenario when Supernova data are included in the analysis. Furthermore, we find the coupling parameter to be negative, with no lower bound, for both potentials. This suggests that momentum-exchange coupling between the dark sectors cannot be ruled out. From the stability analysis, we observe that for both potentials, the late-time attractor corresponds to a dark energy dominated phase, and the scalar field can behave as a stiff fluid during the early epoch.</description>

      <title>Quasar cosmology II: joint analyses with Cosmic Microwave Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Currently, the increasing availability of accurate cosmological probes leads to the emergence of tensions between data on the one hand and between theoretical predictions and direct observations on the other. Moreover, after 25 years since the discovery of the accelerated expansion of the Universe has elected the $\Lambda$CDM model as the reference model, resolving shortcomings of the standard cosmological model seems to be an unpostponed priority. Hence, it is key to test alternative models and investigate new cosmological probes at distances that range from the late to the early Universe, namely between the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and type Ia supernovae and baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO) data. Bargiacchi et al. (2022) for the first time analysed dark energy (DE) models using quasars (QSOs) while also testing their consistency with BAO. Here, we carry on by exploring the compatibility of QSOs with both CMB data and dark energy survey measurements against the standard cosmological model and some DE extensions, such as the $w$CDM and Chevallier-Polarski-Linder parameterisations. We also consider an interacting dark matter and vacuum energy scenario, where vacuum energy perturbations affect the evolution of the matter growth rate in a decomposed Chaplygin gas model. We implement the QSO probe in Cobaya Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm, using Botzmann solver codes as Cosmic Linear Anisotropy Solving System (CLASS) for the theory predictions. Our work shows that simple DE deviations from $\Lambda$CDM model do not reconcile the data and that only more complex models of interaction in the dark sector can succeed in solving the discrepancies of probes at all scales.</description>

Abstract: Future gravitational-wave (GW) detectors are expected to detect tens of thousands of compact binary coalescences (CBC) per year, depending also on the final detectors layout. For this reason, it is essential to have a fast, reliable tool for forecasting how different detector layouts will affect parameter estimation for these events. The Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) is a common tool for tackling this problem. In this paper, we present a new open source code GWJulia to perform FIM analysis of CBC parameters, i.e., stellar black-hole binaries (BBH), neutron star binaries (BNS), and neutron star-black hole binaries (NSBH). The code is purely written in Julia, making it fast while maintaining a high level of accuracy. We consider a set of case studies to compare different Einstein Telescope (ET) designs. We compare a 10km triangular configuration with two 15km L-shaped detectors with different orientations and temperatures. We discuss also the accuracy of combinations of parameters, which is very informative for cosmology or population studies. Finally, we focus on the detection of golden events and explore how the FIM can guide posterior sampling of GW signals using a novel Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) sampler.

      <title>The Kaleidoscope Survey: Strong Gravitational Lensing in Galaxy Clusters with Radial Arcs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We measure the dark matter density profiles of six galaxy clusters: A383, MS 2137-23, MACS J0326.8-0043, MACS J1427.6-2521, MACS J0417.5-1154, and MACS J0949.8+1708. Each cluster contains at least one radial arc, a unique physical feature that allows for more precise measurements of the inner mass profile (R &lt; 50 kpc) from strong lensing. We present the first strong lensing analysis for MACS J0326 and MACS J1427. We use a combination of HST imaging and VLT/MUSE observations from the ESO Kaleidoscope Clusters Survey, a large `filler' program, to identify and measure redshifts for multiply-imaged systems and obtain the 2-D stellar velocity dispersion for each centrally-located brightest cluster galaxy (BCG). The BCG kinematics are used to subtract the baryonic mass component from the inner mass profile. We find total mass density profiles consistent with previous works using a combination of strong lensing and BCG kinematics. The overall shape of these profiles appears core-like, with an average dark matter slope measurement of $\gamma$~0.66. These results demonstrate the ongoing need for the construction of observational models for galaxy clusters, and show how galaxy-scale kinematics can be used to disentangle baryonic and dark matter concentrations in cluster cores.</description>

      <title>Quintessence and phantoms in light of DESI 2025</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse DESI BAO, CMB, and supernova data to explore the physical origin of the DESI indication for dynamical dark energy. Beyond the standard CPL parametrization, we explore truncated alternatives and quintessence models. We conclude that there is compelling evidence for dark energy to be decaying in the late universe, but the evidence for a phantom behaviour is less significant. Models without phantom behaviour are compatible with the data at the $2\sigma$ CL. Furthermore, we examine a concrete quintessence scenario with a Higgs-like potential, allowing for a direct comparison with parametrized approaches and testing its consistency with current observations. This framework enables a broader investigation of late-time cosmic evolution and reveals a $93.8\%$ preference for a future transition into an anti-de Sitter space, which may ultimately lead to a cosmological collapse of our Universe.</description>

      <title>Interpreting the 95 GeV resonance in the Two Higgs Doublet Model: Implications for the Electroweak Phase Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate if the recent mass resonance excesses seen around 95 GeV at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) can be reconciled with a first-order electroweak phase transition. Performing the first large-scale parameter scan of the Two Higgs Doublet model (2HDM) using high-temperature dimensionally reduced effective field theory, we focus on regions of parameter space consistent with interpreting the excess as an additional pseudoscalar state. We find that, in contrast to the Standard Model, the electroweak transition pattern in the 2HDM is generically first-order, proceeding either in a single or in two steps. While transition strengths can reach up to $v_c/T_c \sim 1.3$, the gravitational wave signals lie below the projected reach of future interferometer experiments and are likely insufficient to support successful electroweak baryogenesis.</description>

      <title>Test-time Scaling Techniques in Theoretical Physics -- A Comparison of Methods on the TPBench Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in complex reasoning, and test-time scaling techniques can enhance their performance with comparably low cost. Many of these methods have been developed and evaluated on mathematical reasoning benchmarks such as AIME. This paper investigates whether the lessons learned from these benchmarks generalize to the domain of advanced theoretical physics. We evaluate a range of common test-time scaling methods on the TPBench physics dataset and compare their effectiveness with results on AIME. To better leverage the structure of physics problems, we develop a novel, symbolic weak-verifier framework to improve parallel scaling results. Our empirical results demonstrate that this method significantly outperforms existing test-time scaling approaches on TPBench. We also evaluate our method on AIME, confirming its effectiveness in solving advanced mathematical problems. Our findings highlight the power of step-wise symbolic verification for tackling complex scientific problems.</description>

      <title>Exploring Fermionic Dark Matter Admixed Neutron Stars in the Light of Astrophysical Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We studied the properties of dark matter admixed-neutron stars (DMANS), considering fermionic dark matter (DM) that interacts gravitationally with hadronic matter (HM). Using relativistic mean-field equations of state (EoSs) for both components, we solved the two-fluid Tolman Oppenheimer Volkoff (TOV) equations to determine neutron star (NS) properties assuming that DM is confined within the stellar core. For hadronic matter, we employed realistic EoSs derived from low energy nuclear physics experiments, heavy-ion collision data, and NS observations. To constrain key dark matter parameters such as particle mass, mass fraction, and the coupling to mass ratio, we applied Bayesian inference, incorporating various astrophysical data including mass, radii, and NICER mass-radius distributions for PSR J0740+6620 and PSR J0030+0451. Additionally, we explored the influence of high-density HM EoSs and examined the impact of stiffer hadronic EoSs, excluding the vector meson self-interaction term. Our findings indicate that current astrophysical observations primarily constrain the dark matter fraction, while providing limited constraints on the particle mass or coupling. However, the dark matter fraction is largely insensitive to how astrophysical observations or uncertainties in the high-density EoS are incorporated. Instead, it is predominantly determined by the stiffness of the hadronic EoS at high densities, with stiffer hadronic EoSs yielding a higher dark matter mass fraction. Therefore, we conclude that the dark matter fraction plays a crucial role in shaping the properties of DMANS. Future investigations incorporating more realistic EoSs and astrophysical observations of other compact objects may provide deeper insights into dark matter.</description>

      <title>Close Hyperbolic Encounters In f(R) Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the dynamics and gravitational-wave emission from black hole pairs on unbound orbits undergoing close hyperbolic encounters (CHEs) in dense astrophysical environments. While General Relativity predicts gravitational Bremsstrahlung radiation occurring at periastron, the contribution of the scalar gravitational-wave mode in fully general f(R) gravity remains largely unexplored. We characterize the f(R) scalar mode gravitational radiation for both non-precessing and precessing hyperbolic orbits, identifying potential detection signatures for advanced gravitational wave observatories. By systematically varying orbital precession and eccentricity, we examine their influence on the emitted gravitational waves. We derive potentially detectable time delay and scalar-to-tensor amplitude ratio estimates for representative astrophysical environments and determine optimal orbital configurations for the detection of f(R) scalar gravitational waves from hyperbolic encounters. Our results provide a theoretical framework for scalar-mode signals and observables, establishing CHEs as a promising probe of f(R) gravity with future detectors.</description>

      <title>Phantom Crossing and Oscillating Dark Energy with $F(R)$ Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we shall consider how a dynamical oscillating and phantom crossing dark energy era can be realised in the context of $F(R)$ gravity. We approach the topic from a theoretical standpoint, considering all the conditions that may lead to a consistent phantom crossing behaviour and separately how the $F(R)$ gravity context may realise an oscillating dark energy era. Apart from our qualitative considerations, we study quantitatively two $F(R)$ gravity dark energy models, which are viable cosmologically and also exhibit simultaneously phantom crossing behaviour and oscillating dark energy. We consider these models by numerically solving the field equations using appropriate statefinder parameters engineered for dark energy studies. As we show, $F(R)$ provides a natural extension of Einstein's general relativity, which can naturally realise a transition from a phantom era to a quintessential era, a feature supported by recent observational data, without resorting to phantom scalar fields to realise the phantom evolution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a model that offers an explanation for the presence of (Dark Matter and) Dark Energy in the universe. A key idea is to express the volume form of the Lorentzian metric on space-time in terms of a positive function of a new scalar field multiplying a certain four-form given by the wedge product of the differential of the mimetic scalar field and a certain closed three-form. An ansatz for this three-form related to one commonly used to determine the winding number of a map from a three-dimensional hypersurface to a three-sphere is discussed. An action functional depending on the space-time metric, the new scalar field, the mimetic scalar and the three-form is proposed, and the field equations are derived. Special solutions of these equations for a Friedmann-Lema\^itre universe are presented.</description>

      <title>Multifaceted Supercooling: From PTA to LIGO</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supercooled phase transitions, as predicted, e.g., in near-conformal and confining extensions of the Standard Model (SM), are established sources of strong stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds (SGWBs). In this work, we investigate another facet of such transitions: their significant and largely uncharted impact on gravitational wave spectra originating from independent cosmological sources. Focusing on gravitational waves produced by a metastable cosmic string network, we show that an intervening supercooled phase, initiating thermal inflation, can reshape and suppress the high-frequency part of the spectrum. This mechanism reopens regions of string parameter space previously excluded by LIGO's null results, while remaining compatible with the nanohertz SGWB signal reported by pulsar timing arrays (PTAs). The resulting total spectrum typically exhibits a dual-component structure, sourced by both string decay and the phase transition itself, rendering the scenario observationally distinctive. We systematically classify the viable parameter space and identify regions accessible to upcoming detectors such as Advanced LIGO, LISA, and ET.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study stochastic inflation in the presence of higher-curvature terms non-minimally coupled to the inflaton. Focusing on quadratic curvature invariants, we single out the Gauss--Bonnet term which is known to avoid ghosts, while having non-trivial effects on the background and scalar mode evolution when coupled to the scalar field. Stochastic Klein--Gordon and Langevin equations are derived in the presence of the Gauss--Bonnet coupling, and their slow-roll and ultra-slow-roll limits are studied. By using first-passage time method, scalar power spectrum is computed in these limits. Stochastic evolution of a Gauss--Bonnet-coupled spectator field in de Sitter vacuum is also discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01124v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces ASTRA (Algorithm for Stochastic Topological RAnking), a new method for classifying galaxies into cosmic web structures -voids, sheets, filaments, and knots -- specifically designed for large spectroscopic surveys. ASTRA operates on observed galaxy positions and a corresponding random catalog, generating probabilistic cosmic web classifications for both datasets. The method's key innovation lies in using random points to trace underdense regions, enabling robust identification of cosmic voids that are poorly sampled by galaxies. We evaluate ASTRA using N-body simulations (dark matter-only and hydrodynamical) and SDSS observational data, performing both visual inspections and quantitative analyses of mass and volume distributions. The algorithm successfully produces void catalogs with size functions following theoretical expectations and demonstrates consistent environmental statistics across diverse datasets. Comparative analysis against established cosmic web classifiers confirms ASTRA's effectiveness, particularly for filament identification. By incorporating both observed and random points in its classification scheme, ASTRA provides a full cosmic web characterization without requiring density field interpolation or fixed geometric assumptions. The method's ability to quantify spatial correlations among different cosmic web components offers promising avenues for enhancing cosmological parameter constraints through non-standard clustering statistics.</description>

Abstract: Halo core tracking is a novel concept designed to efficiently follow halo substructure in large simulations. We have recently developed this concept in gravity-only simulations to investigate the galaxy-halo connection in the context of empirical and semi-analytic models. Here, we incorporate information from hydrodynamics simulations, with an emphasis on establishing a connection between cores and galaxies. We compare cores across gravity-only, adiabatic hydrodynamics, and subgrid hydrodynamics simulations with the same initial phases. We demonstrate that cores are stable entities whose halo-centric radial profiles match across the simulations. We further develop a methodology that uses merging and infall mass cuts to group cores in the hydrodynamics simulation, creating on average, a one-to-one match to corresponding galaxies. We apply this methodology to cores from the gravity-only simulation, thus creating a proxy for galaxies which approximate the populations from the hydrodynamics simulation. Our results pave the way to incorporate inputs from smaller-scale hydrodynamics simulations directly into large-scale gravity-only runs in a principled manner.</description>

      <title>Implications of feedback solutions to the $S_8$ tension for the baryon fractions of galaxy groups and clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05716v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent large-scale structure (LSS) surveys have revealed a persistent tension in the value of $S_8$ compared to predictions from the standard cosmological model. This tension may suggest the need for new physics beyond the standard model, but an accurate characterisation of baryonic effects is essential to avoid biases. Although some studies indicate that baryonic effects are too small to resolve this tension, others propose that more aggressive feedback mechanisms could reconcile differences between cosmic microwave background (CMB) measurements and low-redshift LSS observations. In this paper, we investigate the role of baryonic effects in alleviating the $S_8$ tension. We extend the SP(k) model (Salcido et al. 2023), which was trained on hundreds of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations to map the suppression of the matter power spectrum to the baryon fraction in groups and clusters, to predict the required baryon fraction for a given $P(k)$ suppression. We then compare predictions from recent cosmic shear (weak lensing) analyses with the latest baryon budget measurements from X-ray and weak gravitational lensing studies. Our findings show that studies marginalising over baryonic effects while fixing cosmological parameters to a Planck-like cosmology predict strong $P(k)$ suppression and baryon fractions that are much lower than existing low-redshift baryon budget estimates of galaxy groups and clusters. Conversely, most studies that marginalise over both cosmological parameters and baryonic effects imply baryon fractions that are consistent with observations but lower values of $S_8$ than inferred from the CMB. Unless the observed baryon fractions are biased high by a factor of several, these results suggest that a mechanism beyond baryonic physics alone is required to modify or slow down the growth of structure in the universe in order to resolve the $S_8$ tension.</description>

      <title>Caught in the cosmic web: environmental effects on subhalo abundance and internal density profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09226v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the high-resolution $N$-body cosmological simulation COLOR, we explore the cosmic web (CW) environmental effects on subhalo populations and their internal properties. We use CaCTus, which incorporates an implementation of the state-of-the-art segmentation method NEXUS+, to delineate the simulation volume into nodes, filaments, walls, and voids. We group host haloes by virial mass and segment each mass bin into consecutive CW elements. This reveals that subhalo populations in hosts within specific environments differ on average from the cosmic mean. The subhalo mass function is affected strongly, where hosts in filaments typically contain more subhaloes ($5$ to $20\%$), while hosts in voids are subhalo-poor, with $25\%$ fewer subhaloes. We find that the abundance of the most massive subhaloes, with reduced masses of $\mu\equiv M_\mathrm{sub}/M_{200}$ is most sensitive to the CW environment. A corresponding picture emerges when looking at subhalo mass fractions, $f_\mathrm{sub}$, where the filament hosts are significantly more `granular' (having higher $f_\mathrm{sub}$) than the cosmic mean, while the void hosts have much smoother density distributions (with $f_\mathrm{sub}$ lower by $2$ - $20\%$ than the mean). Finally, when we look at the subhalo internal kinematic $V_{\rm max}$-$R_{\rm max}$ relations, we find that subhaloes located in the void and wall hosts exhibit density profiles with lower concentrations than the mean, while the filament hosts demonstrate much more concentrated mass profiles. Across all our samples, the effect of the CW environment generally strengthens with decreasing host halo virial mass. Our results show that host location in the large-scale CW introduces significant systematic effects on internal subhalo properties and population statistics.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing the Thermal Sunyaev Zeldovich Power Spectrum from Planck using the ABS Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09967v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study employs a novel approach for reconstructing the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich (tSZ) effect power spectrum from Planck data using the Analytical Blind Separation (ABS) method. The ABS method improves the recovery of weak signals, by applying eigenmode exclusion for low signal-to-noise ratio regimes and introducing a shift parameter to stabilize calculations. Validation through simulated Planck data demonstrates the robustness of ABS in reconstructing the tSZ power spectrum, even under challenging conditions. In the analysis of the {\it Planck} PR3 full-mission data, ABS shows lower amplitudes at $\ell \gtrsim 300$ compared to the {\it Planck} 2015 band powers using the MILCA and NILC foreground cleaning methods. In our analysis, we include or exclude the trispectrum contribution to the statistical uncertainty to enable comparison with previous studies and to test the robustness of our results. When the trispectrum contribution is included, and after marginalizing over residual foreground components, we find that the overall amplitude of the tSZ power spectrum is 34\% lower than the ``Planck 2015'' best-fit amplitude, 24\% lower than the ``Battaglia 2012'' model, and 12\% lower than the ``Bolliet 2018'' best-fit amplitude. These differences correspond to $3.0\sigma$, $1.78\sigma$, and $0.75\sigma$, respectively, in terms of the associated statistical uncertainties. Across all cases, the tSZ band power remains unaffected by template choice. These findings highlight the potential of the ABS method as a promising alternative for tSZ power spectrum analysis.</description>

      <title>The SRG/eROSITA All-Sky Survey : Subaru/HSC-SSP weak-lensing mass measurements for the eRASS1 Galaxy Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09952v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We performed individual weak-lensing (WL) mass measurements for 78 eROSITA's first All-Sky Survey (eRASS1) clusters in the footprint of Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP) S19A. We did not adopt priors on the eRASS1 X-ray quantities or assumption of the mass and concentration relation. In the sample, we found three clusters are misassociated with optical counterparts and 12 clusters are poorly fitted with an NFW profile. The average mass for the 12 poor-fit clusters changes from $\sim 10^{14}h_{70}^{-1}M_\odot$ to $\sim 2\times 10^{13}h_{70}^{-1}M_\odot$ when lensing contamination from surrounding mass structures is taken into account. The scaling relations between the true mass and cluster richness and X-ray count-rate agree well with the results of the eRASS1 western Galactic hemisphere region based on count-rate-inferred masses, which were calibrated with the HSC-SSP, DES, and KiDS surveys. We developed a Bayesian framework for inferring the mass-concentration relation of the cluster sample, explicitly incorporating the effects of weak-lensing mass calibration in the mass-concentration parameter space. The redshift-dependent mass and concentration relation is in excellent agreement with predictions of dark-matter-only numerical simulations and previous studies using X-ray-selected clusters. Based on the two-dimensional (2D) WL analysis, the offsets between the WL-determined centers and the X-ray centroids for 36 eRASS1 clusters with high WL S/N can be described by two Gaussian components. We find that the miscentering effect with X-ray centroids is smaller than that involving peaks in the galaxy maps. Stacked mass maps support a small miscentering effect, even for clusters with a low WL S/N. The projected halo ellipticity is $\langle \varepsilon \rangle=0.45$ at $M_{200}\sim 4\times10^{14}h_{70}^{-1}M_\odot$.</description>

      <title>Optimal parameterizations for observational constraints on thawing dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02028v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time-varying dark energy is often modeled in observational analyses through generic parameterizations of its equation of state $w(z)$, which typically use two free parameters $\{w_0, w_a\}$ to span a broad range of behaviors as a function of redshift. However, this broad range of behaviors can only approximately capture the dynamics of any given microphysical theory of dark energy. A complementary approach is to use targeted parameterizations designed to model specific classes of dynamical dark energy with greater precision. Focusing on the class of thawing dark energy, we quantify and compare the precision with which nineteen generic and targeted parameterizations can capture the dynamics of physically motivated thawing quintessence theories. We find that a targeted parameterization derived from a Pad\'e expansion of $w$ is the most reliable of these, producing accurate reconstructions of $w(z)$, the expansion history $H(z)$, and cosmological parameters such as $H_0$ and $\Omega_m$ for a broad range of microphysical theories.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Anisotropic Cosmic Birefringence from CMB B-mode Polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13154v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cosmic birefringence$-$the rotation of the polarization plane of light as it traverses the universe$-$offers a direct observational window into parity-violating physics beyond the Standard Model. In this work, we revisit the anisotropic component of cosmic birefringence, which leads to the generation of $B$-mode polarization in the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Using an exact theoretical treatment beyond the thin last-scattering surface approximation, we constrain the amplitude of anisotropic birefringence with combined polarization data from SPTpol, ACT, POLARBEAR, and BICEP. The joint analysis yields a best-fit amplitude of $A_{\rm CB} = 0.42^{+0.40}_{-0.34} \times 10^{-4}$, consistent with zero within $2\sigma$, and we place a 95\% confidence-level upper bound of $A_{\rm CB} &lt; 1 \times 10^{-4}$. The constraint is not dominated by any single experiment and remains robust under the inclusion of a possible isotropic rotation angle. These results provide leading constraints on anisotropic cosmic birefringence from CMB $B$-mode polarization and illustrate the potential of upcoming experiments to improve sensitivity to parity-violating effects in the early universe.</description>

      <title>Extended datasamples under the lens of Brane World Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15002v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work revises the Brane World Theory known as Randall-Sundrum with the modification of an exponential, redshift-dependent brane tension. This model is studied in a scenario assuming no dark energy, with the aim of determining whether it can reproduce the universe's acceleration on its own, without the addition of a dark energy fluid. Bayesian statistical analysis is performed in order to constrain the free parameters of each scenario using SLS, SNIa, OHD, and BAO data samples, the last two considering newly added data points. Both Planck and Riess priors for h are used and compared. In both cases, we are able to reproduce the late-time accelerated expansion in agreement with observational data. Interesting consistencies at the transition redshift zt with LCDM are found, suggesting that this might be a suitable model for studying the evolution of the universe up to the present date. However, some pathologies are detected in this model, namely a "Big Rip" divergence of H(z) at z = 1, as well as a strong dependence between the functional form of the brane tension and the future evolution of the universe.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter Spike surrounding Supermassive Black Holes Binary and the Nanohertz Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.17143v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The NANOGrav, PPTA, EPTA, CPTA and MPTA collaborations have reported compelling evidence for the existence of the Stochastic Gravitational-Wave Background (SGWB). This inferred background's amplitude and frequency spectrum align closely with the astrophysical predictions for a signal originating from the population of supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries. Considering these findings, we explore the possibility of detecting dark matter (DM) spikes surrounding SMBHs, which could alter the gravitational-wave waveform and influence the SGWB. We show that the evolution of SMBH binaries, driven by both gravitational radiation and the dynamic friction of the surrounding DM spike, presents observable effects in the nHz frequency domain of the SGWB. We also employ the Bayesian inference method to fit the SGWB spectra from the NANOGrav, EPTA, and PPTA. The model with DM spike improves the fittings to the former two data sets. The spike slope $\gamma_{\rm sp}$ is slightly smaller than 1, which may suggest that the spike is flattened during the inspiral of the SMBHBs.</description>

      <title>Gauge-dependence of Scalar Induced Gravitational Waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00083v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this review we look into the gauge-dependence of scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) that are second-order tensors produced by first-order scalar-modes. The method includes deriving the background, first- and second-order Einstein field equations without imposing a gauge. We address the gauge-invariant approach and study the source-term of SIGWs in three different gauges, synchronous, Poisson and uniform curvature gauge. We find that numerically computed kernels in all three gauges behave closely with minimal discrepancy. As expected, when going in sub-horizon modes, $k\tau\gg1$, the discrepancy decreases and the behavior matches, pointing to a gauge-invariant observable.</description>

      <title>The THESAN-ZOOM project: Long-term imprints of external reionization on galaxy evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02927v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of ionizing external ultraviolet (UV) radiation on low-mass haloes ($M_{h}&lt;10^{10}M_\odot$) at high redshift using $1140M_\odot$ baryonic resolution zoom-in simulations of seven regions from the THESAN-ZOOM project. We compare three simulation sets that differ in the treatment of external UV radiation: one employing a uniform UV background initiated at z=10.6 in addition to radiation transport for local sources, another with the same background starting at z=5.5, and the default configuration in which the large-scale radiation field from the parent THESAN-1 simulation box acts as a boundary condition. The multi-phase interstellar medium (ISM) model, combined with its high mass resolution, allows us to resolve all star-forming haloes and capture the back-reaction of ionizing radiation on galaxy properties during the epoch of reionization. When present, external UV radiation efficiently unbinds gas in haloes with masses below $10^9M_\odot$ and suppresses subsequent star formation. As a result, in simulations with early reionization, minihaloes fail to form stars from pristine gas, leading to reduced metal enrichment of gas later accreted by more massive haloes. Consequently, haloes with masses below $10^{10}M_\odot$ at all simulated epochs (z&gt;3) exhibit lower metallicities and altered metallicity distributions. The more accurate and realistic shielding from external UV radiation, achieved through self-consistent radiative transfer, permits the existence of a cold but low-density gas phase down to z=3. These findings highlight the importance of capturing a patchy reionization history in high-resolution simulations targeting high-redshift galaxy formation. We conclude that at minimum, a semi-numerical model that incorporates spatially inhomogeneous reionization and a non-uniform metallicity floor is necessary to accurately emulate metal enrichment in minihaloes.</description>

      <title>Systematic biases from ignoring environmental tidal effects in gravitational wave observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10746v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Binary black hole systems are typically assumed to evolve in vacuum. However, the environment surrounding the binary components can influence their properties, such as their tidal deformability, affecting the gravitational waveform produced by the binary and its interpretation in gravitational wave data analysis. In this work we focus on next-generation experiments, such as the Einstein Telescope and LISA, and we quantify the systematic biases in gravitational wave observations that arise when tidally deformed binaries are interpreted as occurring in vacuum. We consider binaries over a range of masses and we compare different phenomenological models for the dynamical evolution of the tidal deformability. We find that systematic biases could significantly affect the measurability of the binary parameters if tidal effects are not carefully modeled.</description>

      <title>Primordial neutrinos fade to gray: constraints from cosmological observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07178v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of potentially large distortions of the relic neutrino spectra on cosmological observables. To that end, we consider a phenomenological model of "gray" spectral distributions, described by a single parameter, which generalizes the traditional $y$-distortions to possibly large negative values. Implementing these distortions in the primordial nucleosynthesis code PRIMAT, we can constrain the distortion parameter along with the presence of extra radiation, exploiting the complementarity of big bang nucleosynthesis and cosmic microwave background measurements to disentangle gravitational and non-thermal effects. These constraints rule out a distortion where more than $\sim 1/2$ of the neutrinos' energy density is replaced by dark radiation. Nonetheless, we find that large distortions, accompanied with extra radiation, are allowed-and even slightly preferred in some cases-by current cosmological observations. As this scenario would require substantial modifications to the physics of neutrino decoupling in the early Universe, these observational constraints call for a renewed attention on the possibility of large deviations from the standard cosmological model in the neutrino sector.</description>
