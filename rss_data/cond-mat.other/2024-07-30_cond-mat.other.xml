      <title>Successive ferroelectric orders and magnetoelectric coupling without long-range magnetic order in highly frustrated pyrochlore compounds: Sm$_2$Ti$_{2-x}$V$_x$O$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sm$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$, a member of rare-earth titanate pyrochlores, exhibits dipolar-octupolar antiferromagnetism below $T_N$ = 0.35 K. We observed two ferroelectric transitions at 182 ($T_{FE1}$) and 52 K ($T_{FE2}$), significantly higher than $T_N$ for Sm$_2$Ti$_{2-x}$V$_x$O$_7$ ($x$ = 0, 0.1). Although the ferroelectric transition temperatures remain unchanged, the polarization value decreases considerably with V doping. A structural transition to a polar $R3m$ rhombohedral phase from the cubic $Fd\bar{3}m$ structure occurs at $T_{FE1}$, involving a distortion in the pyochlore lattice. Remarkably, significant linear magnetoelectric coupling is observed in both compounds, with further enhancement of magnetoelectric coupling due to magnetic V doping. The existence of magnetoelectric coupling without long-range magnetic order in a frustrated pyrochlore system could enable the tailoring of magnetoelectric coupling properties, which can be further fine-tuned through V doping. The emergence of ferroelectricity in a frustrated magnetic system introduces an intriguing aspect to these compounds and paves the way for developing ferroelectric order driven by the alleviation of magnetic frustration in pyrochlore systems.</description>

      <title>Nanowrinkle Waveguide in Graphene for Enabling Secure Dirac Fermion Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Localized states in graphene have garnered significant attention in quantum information science due to their potential applications. Despite graphene's superior transport and electronic properties compared to other semiconductors, achieving nanoscale confinement remains challenging due to its gapless nature. In this study, we explore the unique transport properties along nanowrinkles in monolayer graphene. We demonstrate the creation of a one-dimensional conduction channel by alternating pseudo-magnetic fields along the nanowrinkle, enabling ballistic Dirac fermion transport without leakage. This suggests a feasible method for secure quantum information transfer over long distances. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to bent nanowrinkles, showcasing well-guided Dirac fermion propagation unless the bent angle is sufficiently large. Our demonstration of the nanowrinkle waveguide in graphene introduces a novel approach to controlling Dirac fermion transport through strain engineering, for quantum information technology applications.</description>

      <title>Topological Properties of Single-Particle States Decaying into a Continuum due to Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09957v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate how topological Chern numbers can be defined when single-particle states hybridize with continua. We do so exemplarily in a bosonic Haldane model at zero temperature with an additional on-site decay of one boson into two and the conjugate fusion of two bosons into one. Restricting the Hilbert space to two bosons at maximum, the exact self-energy is accessible. We use the bilinear Hamiltonian $H_0$ corrected by the self-energy $\Sigma$ to compute Chern numbers by two different approaches. The results are gauged against a full many-body calculation in the Hilbert space where possible. We establish numerically and analytically that the effective Hamiltonian $H_\text{eff}=H_0(\vec k) +\Sigma(\omega,\vec k)$ reproduces the correct many-body topology if the considered band does not overlap with the continuum. In case of overlaps, one can extend the definition of the Chern number to the non-Hermitian $H_\text{eff}$ and there is evidence that the Chern number changes at exceptional points. But the bulk-boundary correspondence appears to be no longer valid and edge modes delocalize.</description>

      <title>The stochastic relativistic advection diffusion equation from the Metropolis algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04185v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study an approach to simulating the stochastic relativistic advection-diffusion equation based on the Metropolis algorithm. We show that the dissipative dynamics of the boosted fluctuating fluid can be simulated by making random transfers of charge between fluid cells, interspersed with ideal hydrodynamic time steps. The random charge transfers are accepted or rejected in a Metropolis step using the entropy as a statistical weight. This procedure reproduces the expected strains of dissipative relativistic hydrodynamics in a specific (and non-covariant) hydrodynamic frame known as the density frame. Numerical results, both with and without noise, are presented and compared to relativistic kinetics and analytical expectations. An all order resummation of the density frame gradient expansion reproduces the covariant dynamics in a specific model. In contrast to all other numerical approaches to relativistic dissipative fluids, the dissipative fluid formalism presented here is strictly first order in gradients and has no non-hydrodynamic modes. The physical naturalness and simplicity of the Metropolis algorithm, together with its convergence properties, make it a promising tool for simulating stochastic relativistic fluids in heavy ion collisions and for critical phenomena in the relativistic domain.</description>
