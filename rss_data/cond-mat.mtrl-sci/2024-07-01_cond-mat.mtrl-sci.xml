      <title>Pressure Tuning the Mixture of Eu$^{2+}$ and Eu$^{3+}$ in Eu$_4$Bi$_6$Se$_{13}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The investigation of crystallographic, electronic, and magnetic characteristics, especially the mixed valences of Eu$^{2+}$ and Eu$^{3+}$ under pressure of a novel europium-based bismuth selenide compound, Eu$_4$Bi$_6$Se$_{13}$, presented. This new compound adopts a monoclinic crystal structure classified under the P$2_1$/m space group (#11). It exhibits distinctive structural features, including substantial Eu-Se coordination numbers, Bi-Se ladders, and linear chains of Eu atoms that propagate along the b-axis. Electronic resistivity assessments indicate that Eu$_{4}$Bi$_{6}$Se$_{13}$ exhibits weak metallic behaviors. Magnetic characterization reveals uniaxial magnetic anisotropy, with a notable spin transition at approximately 1.2 T when the magnetic field is oriented along the b-axis. This behavior, coupled with the specific Eu-Eu interatomic distances and the magnetic saturation observed at low fields, supports the identification of metamagnetic properties attributable to the flipping of europium spins. The Curie-Weiss analysis of the magnetic susceptibility measured both perpendicular and parallel to the b-axis and high-pressure partial fluorescence yield (PFY) results detected by X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) reveal the tendency of the material to enter a mixed valent state where the trivalent state becomes more prominent with the pressure increase or temperature decrease.</description>

      <title>Origin of the Anisotropic Beer-Lambert Law from Dichroism and Birefringence in $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The anisotropic optical absorption edge of $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ follows a modified Beer-Lambert law having two effective absorption coefficients. The absorption coefficient of linearly polarized light reduces to the least absorbing direction beyond a critical penetration depth, which itself depends on polarization and wavelength. To understand this behavior, a Stokes vector analysis is performed to track the polarization state as a function of depth. The weakening of the absorption coefficient is associated with a gradual shift of linear polarization to the least absorbing crystallographic direction in the plane, which is along the a-exciton within the (010) plane or along the b-exciton in the (001) plane. We show that strong linear dichroism near the optical absorption edge causes this shift in $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$, which arises from the anisotropy and spectral splitting of the physical absorbers i.e., excitons. The linear polarization shift is accompanied by a variation in the ellipticity due to the birefringence of $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$. Analysis of the phase relationship between the incoming electric field to that at a certain depth reveals the phase speed as an effective refractive index, which varies along different crystallographic directions. The critical penetration depth is shown to be correlated with the depth at which the ellipticity is maximal. Thus, the anisotropic Beer-Lambert law arises from the interplay of both the dichroic and birefringent properties of $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast high-temperature sintering of dense and textured alumina</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crystallographic texture engineering in ceramics is essential to achieve direction-specific properties. Current texture engineering methods are time-consuming, energy extensive, or can lead to unnecessary diffusion of added dopants. Herein, we explore ultrafast high-temperature sintering (UHS) to prepare dense and textured alumina using templated grain growth (TGG). From a slurry containing alumina microplatelets coated with Fe3O4 nanoparticles dispersed in a matrix of alumina nanoparticles, green bodies with oriented microplatelets were prepared using magnetic assisted slip casting (MASC). The effects of the sintering temperature, time and heating rate on the density and microstructure of the obtained ceramics were then studied. We found that TGG occurs for a temperature range between 1640 and 1780 {\deg}C and 10 s sintering time. Sintering at 1700 {\deg}C for 10 s led to dense and textured alumina with anisotropic grains thanks to the Fe3O4 coating, which did not have the time to diffuse. The highest texture and relative density were obtained with a heating rate of ~5,500 {\deg}C/min, leading to texture-dependent anisotropic mechanical properties. This study opens new avenues for fabricating textured ceramics in ultra-short times.</description>

      <title>The role of lattice thermal conductivity suppression by dopants from a holistic perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dopants play an important role in improving electrical and thermal transport. In the traditional perspective, a dopant suppresses lattice thermal conductivity kL by adding point defect (PD) scattering term to the phonon relaxation time, which has been adopted for decades. In this study, we propose an innovative perspective to solve the kL of defective systems-the holistic approach, i.e., treating dopant and matrix as a holism. This approach allows us to handle the influences from defects explicitly by the calculations of defective systems, about their changed phonon dispersion, phonon-phonon and electron-phonon interaction, etc, due to the existence of dopants. The kL reduction between defective MxNb1-xFeSb (M=V, Ti) and NbFeSb is used as an example for the holistic approach, and comparable results with experiments are obtained. It is notable that light elemental dopants also induced the avoided-crossing behavior. It can be further rationalized by a one-dimensional atomic chain model. The mass and force constant imbalance generally generates the avoided-crossing phonons, mathematically in a similar way as the coefficients in traditional PD scattering, but along a different direction in kL reduction. Our work provides another perspective for understanding the mechanism of dopants influence in material's thermal transport.</description>

      <title>Reconsidering the nonlinear emergent inductance: time-varying Joule heating and its impact on the AC electrical response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A nonlinearly enhanced electrical reactance, $\Im Z$, under a large AC current has been measured to explore emergent inductors, which constitute a new class of inductors based on the spin-transfer torque effect. A nonlinear $\Im Z$ has been observed in conducting magnets that contain noncollinear spin textures and interpreted as the realization of an inductance due to current-induced spin dynamics. However, curious behavior has concomitantly been observed. For instance, the nonlinear $\Im Z$ always has a cutoff frequency of $10^0$--$10^4$ Hz, which is much lower than the resonance frequency of a ferromagnetic domain wall, $\sim$10$^7$ Hz; furthermore, the temperature and magnetic field variations in $\Im Z$ appear to be considerably correlated with those in the temperature derivative of resistance. This behavior appears to be difficult to understand in terms of the current-induced spin dynamics, and therefore, the earlier interpretation of the nonlinear $\Im Z$ should be further verified. Here, we theoretically and experimentally show that time-varying Joule heating and its impact on the AC electrical response can naturally explain these observations. In the experimental approach, we study the nonlinear AC electrical response of two conducting materials that exhibit no magnetic order, CuIr$_2$S$_4$ and 1$T$'-MoTe$_2$. Under time-varying Joule heating, a nonlinearly enhanced $\Im Z$ with the curious behavior mentioned above is observed in both systems. Our study implies that the nonlinear $\Im Z$ previously observed in noncollinear magnets includes a considerable contribution of the Joule-heating-induced apparent AC impedance.</description>

      <title>A compositional ordering-driven morphotropic phase boundary in ferroelectric solid solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferroelectric solid solutions usually exhibit giant dielectric response and high piezoelectricity in the vicinity of the morphotropic phase boundary (MPB), where the structural phase transitions between the rhombohedral and the tetragonal phases as a result of the composition or strain variation. Here, we propose a compositional ordering-driven MPB in the specified compositional solid solutions. By preforming machine-learning potential based molecular dynamics simulations on lead zirconate titanate, we find a phase transition from the rhombohedral to tetragonal phase with the decrease of compositional ordering, leading to the MPB on temperature-ordering phase diagram. The compositional ordering-driven MPB can enhances the piezoelectricity with a magnitude comparable to that at the composition-driven MPB. Finally, we demonstrate that the mechanism of high piezoelectricity is polarization rotation driven by external field. This work provides an additional degree of freedom, compositional ordering, to design the high-performance piezoelectric materials.</description>

      <title>Magnetic structure and electronic properties of mixed-metal Ruddlesden-Popper oxide LaSrCo$_{1/2}$Fe$_{1/2}$O$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomic, electronic, and magnetic structure of LaSrCo$_{1/2}$Fe$_{1/2}$O$_4$ mixed-metal Ruddlesden-Popper oxide is investigated theoretically using self-consistent ACBN0 DFT + $U$ approach. We show that the electronic and magnetic properties strongly depend on the distribution of transition-metal and La/Sr ions in the lattice. Fe-Fe exchange is found to be antiferromagnetic, whereas Co-Co and Fe-Co exchange is ferromagnetic. We find that Co spin states depend on the distribution in both La/Sr and transition-metal ions. The most energetically favorable configuration is ferromagnetic, whereas the majority of metastable configurations are antiferromagnetic. LaSrCo$_{1/2}$Fe$_{1/2}$O$_4$ was synthesized using spray-pyrolysis method. Magnetization measurements revealed antiferromgnetic behavior, thus indicating presence of metastable configurations in the synthesized material. In addition, we show that in complex systems, such as mixed-metal Ruddlesden-Popper phases, Hubbard $U$ values have to be determined for each crystallographically non-equivalent site.</description>

      <title>Screening of half-Heuslers with temperature-induced band convergence and enhanced thermoelectric properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enhancing band convergence is an effective way to optimize the thermoelectric (TE) properties of materials. However, the temperature-induced band renormalization is commonly ignored. By employing the recently-developed electron-phonon renormalization (EPR) method, the nature of band renormalization in half-Heusler (HH) compounds TiCoSb and NbFeSb is revealed, and the key factors for temperature-induced conduction band convergence in HH are found out. Using these as the screening criteria, 3 out of 274 HHs (TiRhBi, TiPtSn, NbPtTl) are then stood out from our MatHub-3d database. Taking TiPtSn as the example, it shows the conduction band convergence at mid-high temperature, and further resulting in enhanced Seebeck coefficient S: e.g., at 600 K with electron concentration 10^20 cm^-3, the predicted S with and without renormalized band is 352.83 uV/K and 289.52 uV/K, respectively. Herein, the former is closer to our measurement value of 338.79 uV/K. Besides, the effective masses obtained from calculation and experiment are both enlarged with temperature, indicating the existence of band convergence. Our work demonstrates for the first time the significance of adding the temperature effect on electronic structure in the design of potential high-performance TE materials.</description>

      <title>Electronic Correlations in Multiferroic van der Waals CuCrP$_2$S6: Insights From X-Ray Spectroscopy and DFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electronic structure of high-quality van der Waals multiferroic CuCrP$_2$S6 crystals was investigated applying photoelectron spectroscopy methods in combination with DFT analysis. Using X-ray photoelectron and near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy at the Cu L2,3 and Cr L2,3 absorption edges we determine the charge states of ions in the studied compound. Analyzing the systematic NEXAFS and resonant photoelectron spectroscopy data at the Cu/Cr L2,3 absorption edges allowed us to assign the CuCrP$_2$S6 material to a Mott-Hubbard type insulator and identify different Auger-decay channels (participator vs. spectator) during absorption and autoionization processes. Spectroscopic and theoretical data obtained for CuCrP$_2$S6 are very important for the detailed understanding of the electronic structure and electron-correlations phenomena in different layered materials, that will drive their further applications in different areas, like electronics, spintronics, sensing, and catalysis.</description>

      <title>The role of magnetic dipolar interactions in skyrmion lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions are promising candidates for information and storage technologies. In the last years, magnetic multilayer systems have been tuned to enable room-temperature skyrmions, stable even in the absence of external magnetic field. There are several models describing the properties of an isolated skyrmion in a homogeneous background for single repetition multilayer stack, however, the description on how the equilibrium skyrmion size in lattices scales with increasing the number of repetitions of the stack remains unaddressed. This question is essential for fundamental and practical perspectives, as the behaviour of an ensemble of skyrmions differs from the isolated case. Based on a multilayer stack hosting a skyrmion lattice, we have carried out a series of imaging experiments scaling up the dipolar interaction by repeating $n$ times the multilayer unit, from $n =1$ up to $n=30$. We have developed an analytical description for the skyrmion radius in the whole multilayer regime, $i.e.$, from thin to thick film limits. Furthermore, we provide insight on how nucleation by an externally applied field can give rise to a lattice with more skyrmions (thus, overfilled) than the predicted by the calculations.</description>

      <title>Myriad of Terahertz Magnons with All-Optical Magnetoelectric Functionality for Efficient Spin-Wave Computing in Honeycomb Magnet Co4Ta2O9</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Terahertz (THz) magnonics represent the notion of mathematical algebraic operations of magnons such as addition and subtraction in THz regime which is an emergent dissipationless ultrafast alternative to existing data processing technologies. Spin waves on antiferromagnets with a twist in spin order host such magnons in THz regime, which possess advantage of higher processing speeds, additional polarization degree of freedom and longer propagation lengths compared to that of gigahertz magnons in ferromagnets. While interaction among THz magnons is the crux of algebra operations, it requires magnetic orders with closely spaced magnon modes for easier experimental realization of their interactions. Herein, rich wealth of magnons spanning a narrow energy range of 0.4 to 10 meV is unraveled in Co4Ta2O9 using magneto-THz spectroscopy. Rare multitude of ten excitation modes, either of magnons or hybrid magnon-phonon modes is presented. Among other attributes, spin lattice interaction suggests a correlation among spin and local lattice distortion, magnetostriction, and magnetic exchange interaction signifying a THz magnetoelectric effect. This unification of structural, magnetic and dielectric facets, and their magnetic field control in a narrow spectrum unwinds the mechanism underneath the system's complexity while the manifestation of multitude of spin excitation modes is a potential source to design multiple channels in spin-wave computing based devices.</description>

      <title>When is the Four-phonon Effect in Half-Heusler Materials more Pronounced?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suppressed three-phonon scattering processes have been considered to be the direct cause of materials exhibiting significant higher-order four-phonon interactions. However, after calculating the phonon-phonon interactions of 128 Half-Heusler materials by high-throughput, we find that the acoustic phonon bandwidth dominates the three-phonon and four-phonon scattering channels and keeps them roughly in a co-increasing or decreasing behavior. The $aao$ and $aaa$ three-phonon scattering channels in Half-Heusler materials are weakly affected by the acoustic-optical gap and acoustic bunched features respectively only when acoustic phonon bandwidths are close. Finally, we found that Half-Heusler materials with smaller acoustic bandwidths tend to have a more pronounced four-phonon effect, although three-phonon scattering may not be significantly suppressed at this time.</description>

      <title>MnRhBi3: A Cleavable Antiferromagnetic Metal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cleavable metallic antiferromagnets may be of use for low-dissipation spintronic devices; however, few are currently known. Here we present orthorhombic MnRhBi3 as one such compound and present a thorough study of its physical properties. Exfoliation is demonstrated experimentally, and the cleavage energy and electronic structure are examined by density functional theory calculations. It is concluded that MnRhBi3 is a van der Waals layered material that cleaves easily between neighboring Bi layers, and that the Bi atoms have lone pairs extending into the van der Waals gaps. A series of four phase transitions are observed below room temperature, and neutron diffraction shows that at least two of the transitions involve the formation of antiferromagnetic order. Anomalous thermal expansion points to a crystallographic phase transition and/or strong magnetoelastic coupling. This work reveals a complex phase evolution in MnRhBi3 and establishes this cleavable antiferromagnetic metal as an interesting material for studying the interplay of structure, magnetism, and transport in the bulk and ultrathin limits as well as the role of lone pair electrons in interface chemistry and proximity effects in van der Waals heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Discovering one molecule out of a million: inverse design of molecular hole transporting semiconductors tailored for perovskite solar cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inverse design of tailored organic molecules for specific optoelectronic devices of high complexity holds an enormous potential, but has not yet been realized1,2. The complexity and literally infinite diversity of conjugated molecular structures present both, an unprecedented opportunity for technological breakthroughs as well as an unseen optimization challenge. Current models rely on big data which do not exist for specialized research films. However, a hybrid computational and high throughput experimental screening workflow allowed us to train predictive models with as little as 149 molecules. We demonstrate a unique closed-loop workflow combining high throughput synthesis and Bayesian optimization that discovers new hole transporting materials with tailored properties for solar cell applications. A series of high-performance molecules were identified from minimal suggestions, achieving up to 26.23% (certified 25.88%) power conversion efficiency in perovskite solar cells. Our work paves the way for rapid, informed discovery in vast molecular libraries, revolutionizing material selection for complex devices. We believe that our approach can be generalized to other emerging fields and indeed accelerate the development of optoelectronic semiconductor devices in general.</description>

      <title>CSPBench: a benchmark and critical evaluation of Crystal Structure Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crystal structure prediction (CSP) is now increasingly used in discovering novel materials with applications in diverse industries. However, despite decades of developments and significant progress in this area, there lacks a set of well-defined benchmark dataset, quantitative performance metrics, and studies that evaluate the status of the field. We aim to fill this gap by introducing a CSP benchmark suite with 180 test structures along with our recently implemented CSP performance metric set. We benchmark a collection of 13 state-of-the-art (SOTA) CSP algorithms including template-based CSP algorithms, conventional CSP algorithms based on DFT calculations and global search such as CALYPSO, CSP algorithms based on machine learning (ML) potentials and global search, and distance matrix based CSP algorithms. Our results demonstrate that the performance of the current CSP algorithms is far from being satisfactory. Most algorithms cannot even identify the structures with the correct space groups except for the template-based algorithms when applied to test structures with similar templates. We also find that the ML potential based CSP algorithms are now able to achieve competitive performances compared to the DFT-based algorithms. These CSP algorithms' performance is strongly determined by the quality of the neural potentials as well as the global optimization algorithms. Our benchmark suite comes with a comprehensive open-source codebase and 180 well-selected benchmark crystal structures, making it convenient to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of CSP algorithms from future studies. All the code and benchmark data are available at https://github.com/usccolumbia/cspbenchmark</description>

      <title>A simple model for short-range ordering kinetics in multi-principal element alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Short-range ordering (SRO) in multi-principal element alloys influences material properties such as strength and corrosion. While some degree of SRO is expected at equilibrium, predicting the kinetics of its formation is challenging. We present a simplified isothermal concentration-wave (CW) model to estimate an effective relaxation time of SRO formation. Estimates from the CW model agree to within a factor of five with relaxation times obtained from kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) simulations when above the highest ordering instability temperature. The advantage of the CW model is that it only requires mobility and thermodynamic parameters, which are readily obtained from alloy mobility databases and Metropolis Monte Carlo simulations, respectively. The simple parameterization of the CW model and its analytical nature make it an attractive tool for the design of processing conditions to promote or suppress SRO in multicomponent alloys.</description>

      <title>Wannier function localisation using Bloch intrinsic atomic orbitals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the Intrinsic Atomic Orbital (IAO) method for localisation of molecular orbitals to calculate well-localised generalised Wannier functions in crystals using the Pipek--Mezey locality metric. We furthermore present a one-shot diabatic Wannierisation procedure that aligns the phases of the Bloch functions, providing immediate Wannier localisation, which serves as an excellent initial guess for optimisation. We test our Wannier localisation implementation on a number of solid state systems, highlighting the effectiveness of the diabatic preparation, especially for localising core bands. Partial charges of Wannier functions generated using Bloch IAOs align well with chemical intuition, which we demonstrate through the example of adsorption of CO on a MgO surface.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive screening of plasma-facing materials for nuclear fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasma-facing materials (PFMs) represent one of the most significant challenges for the design of future nuclear fusion reactors. Inside the reactor, the divertor will experience the harshest material environment: intense bombardment of neutrons and plasma particles coupled with large and intermittent heat fluxes. The material designated to cover this role in ITER is tungsten (W). While no other materials have shown the potential to match the properties of W, many drawbacks associated with its application remain, including: cracking and erosion induced by a low recrystallization temperature combined with a high ductile-brittle transition temperature and neutron-initiated embrittlement; surface morphology changes (fuzz layer) due to plasma-W interaction with subsequent risk of spontaneous material melting and delamination; low oxidation resistance. This work aims to produce a structured and comprehensive materials screening of PFMs candidates based on known inorganic materials. The methodology applied in this study to identify the most promising PFM candidates combines peer-reviewed data present in the Pauling File database and DFT calculations of two key PFMs defects, namely the surface binding energy and the formation energy of a hydrogen interstitial. The crystal structures and their related properties, extracted from the Pauling File, are ranked according to the heat-balance equation of a PFM subject to the heat loads in the divertor region of an ITER-like tokamak. The materials satisfying the requirements are critically compared with the state-of-the-art literature, defining an optimal subset where to perform the first-principles electronic structure calculations. The majority of previously known PFMs are captured by this screening process, confirming its reliability. Additionally, less familiar refractory materials suggest performance that calls for further investigations.</description>

      <title>First-principles study of the order-disorder transition in the AlCrTiV high entropy alloy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The AlCrTiV high entropy alloy undergoes an order-disorder transition from body centered cubic (Strukturbericht A2) at high temperatures to the CsCl structure (B2) at intermediate temperatures. We model this transition using first principles Monte Carlo/molecular dynamics simulations. Simulation results yield the temperature-dependent energy, entropy, heat capacity, occupancy fluctuations, and diffraction patterns. The contribution of chemical disorder to the entropy is calculated on the basis of point and pair cluster frequencies. The simulated structures exhibit compensated ferrimagnetism, and the Fermi level lies in a pseudogap. Sensitivity of structure and magnetism to the exchange-correlation functional is discussed, and neutron diffraction experiments are proposed to help resolve the true chemical order.</description>

      <title>Stabilizing charge density wave by mixing transition metal elements in monolayer XS$_2$ with trigonal-prismatic coordination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electronic structure and phonon dispersion of XS$_2$ with X = Co, Tc, Ti, Ru, Nb, and Rh in the monolayer MoS$_2$ structure with trigonal-prismatic coordination are studied from first principles. Although each XS$_2$ is dynamically unstable, CoS$_2$, TcS$_2$, RuS$_2$, and RhS$_2$ can be stabilized by developing charge density waves in the (2$\times$2) supercell, leading to metal-insulator transitions. Without really needing the metal-insulator transitions and large atomic distortions, additional energy may be gained in the total energy by mixing transition metal elements to create high-entropy combinations for X, presenting a wide range of high-entropy XS$_2$ compounds that exhibit a variety of band structures, including direct- and indirect-gap semiconductors, metals, and semimetals.</description>

      <title>Atomic cluster expansion interatomic potential for defects and thermodynamics of Cu-W system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The unique properties exhibited in immiscible metals, such as excellent strength, hardness, and radiation-damage tolerance, have stimulated the interest of many researchers. As a typical immiscible metal system, the Cu-W nano-multilayers combine the plasticity of copper and the strength of tungsten, making it a suitable candidate for applications in aerospace, nuclear fusion engineering, and electronic packaging etc. To understand the atomistic origin of the defects and thermodynamics of the Cu-W immiscible system, we have developed an accurate machine learning interatomic potential (ML-IAP) for Cu-W based on the atomic cluster expansion (ACE) method. The Cu-W ACE potential can faithfully reproduce the fundamental properties of Cu and W predicted by density functional theory (DFT). Moreover, the thermodynamical properties, such as the melting point, coefficient of thermal expansion, diffusion coefficient, and equation of the state curve of the Cu-W solid solution, are calculated and compared against DFT and experiments. Monte Carlo Molecular Dynamics (MC-MD) simulations performed with the Cu-W ACE potential predict the experimentally observed phase separation and uphill diffusion phenomena. Our findings not only provide an accurate ACE potential for describing the Cu-W immiscible system, but also shed light on understanding the atomistic mechanism during the Cu-W nano-multilayers formation process.</description>

      <title>Adaptive energy reference for machine-learning models of the electronic density of states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electronic density of states (DOS) provides information regarding the distribution of electronic states in a material, and can be used to approximate its optical and electronic properties and therefore guide computational material design. Given its usefulness and relative simplicity, it has been one of the first electronic properties used as target for machine-learning approaches going beyond interatomic potentials. A subtle but important point, well-appreciated in the condensed matter community but usually overlooked in the construction of data-driven models, is that for bulk configurations the absolute energy reference of single-particle energy levels is ill-defined. Only energy differences matter, and quantities derived from the DOS are typically independent on the absolute alignment. We introduce an adaptive scheme that optimizes the energy reference of each structure as part of training, and show that it consistently improves the quality of ML models compared to traditional choices of energy reference, for different classes of materials and different model architectures. On a practical level, we trace the improved performance to the ability of this self-aligning scheme to match the most prominent features in the DOS. More broadly, we believe that this work highlights the importance of incorporating insights into the nature of the physical target into the definition of the architecture and of the appropriate figures of merit for machine-learning models, that translate in better transferability and overall performance.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Behavior of the Dielectric and Pyroelectric Responses of Ferroelectric Fine-Grained Ceramics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revealed the anomalous temperature behavior of the giant dielectric permittivity and unusual frequency dependences of the pyroelectric response of the fine-grained ceramics prepared by the spark plasma sintering of the ferroelectric BaTiO3 nanoparticles. The temperature dependences of the electro-resistivity indicate the frequency-dependent transition in the electro-transport mechanisms between the lower and higher conductivity states accompanied by the maximum in the temperature dependence of the loss angle tangent. The pyroelectric thermal-wave probing revealed the existence of the spatially inhomogeneous counter-polarized ferroelectric state at the opposite surfaces of the ceramic sample. We described the anomalous temperature behavior of the giant dielectric response and losses using the core-shell model for ceramic grains and modified Maxwell-Wagner approach. We assume that core shells and grain boundaries, which contain high concentration of space charge carriers due to the presence of graphite inclusions in the inter-grain space, can effectively screen weakly conductive ferroelectric grain cores. The superparaelectric-like state with a giant dielectric response can appear in the paraelectric shells and inter-grain space due to the step-like thermal activation of localized polarons in the spatial regions, agreeing with experimentally observed frequency-dependent transition of the electro-transport mechanism. The obtained results can be the key for the description of complex electrophysical properties inherent to the strongly inhomogeneous media with electrically coupled insulating ferroelectric nanoregions and semiconducting superparaelectric-like regions.</description>

      <title>Polarization spontaneous and piezo: fundamentals and their implementation in ab initio calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fundamental properties of spontaneous and piezo polarization are reformulated and critically reviewed. It was demonstrated that Landau definition of polarization as a dipole density could be used to the infinite systems. The difference between the bulk polarization and surface polarity are distinguished thus creating clear identification of both components. The local model of spontaneous polarization was created and used to calculate spontaneous polarization as the electric dipole density. It was shown that the proposed local model correctly predicts c-axis spontaneous polarization values of the nitride wurtzite semiconductors. It was also shown that the proposed model predicts zero polarization in the plane perpendicular to the c-axis, in accordance with symmetry requirements. In addition, the model results are in accordance with polarization equal to zero for zinc blende lattice. These data confirm the basic correctness of the proposed model. The spontaneous polarization values obtained for all wurtzite III nitrides (BN, AlN, GaN and InN) are in basic agreement with the earlier calculations using Berry phase and slab models of Bernardini et al. {Bernardini et al. Phys Rev B 56 (2001) R10024 &amp; 63 (2001) 193201} but not with Dreyer et al. {Dreyer et al. Phys. Rev X 6 (2016) 021038}. Wurtzite nitride superlattices ab initio calculations were performed to derive polarization-induced fields in the coherently strained lattices showing good agreement with the polarization values. The strained superlattice data were used to determine the piezoelectric parameters of wurtzite nitrides obtaining the values that were in basic agreement with the earlier data. Zinc blende superlattices were also modeled using ab initio calculations showing results that are in agreement with the absence of polarization of all nitrides in zinc blende symmetry.</description>

      <title>Substrate interference and strain in the second harmonic generation from MoSe$_2$ monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear optical materials of atomic thickness--such as non-centrosymmetric 2H transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers--have a second order nonlinear susceptibility ($\chi^{(2)}$) whose intensity can be tuned by strain. However, whether $\chi^{(2)}$ is enhanced or reduced by tensile strain is a subject of conflicting reports. Here, we grow high-quality MoSe$_2$ monolayers under controlled biaxial strain created by two different substrates, and study their linear and non-linear optical responses with a combination of experimental and theoretical approaches. A 15-fold overall enhancement in second harmonic generation (SHG) intensity is observed on MoSe$_2$ monolayers grown on SiO$_2$ when compared to its value when on a Si$_3$N$_4$ substrate. A seven-fold enhancement was ascertained to substrate interference, and a factor of two to the enhancement of $\chi^{(2)}$ arising from biaxial strain: substrate interference and strain are independent handles to engineer the SHG strength of non-centrosymmetric 2D materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nickel nanoparticles (Ni NPs), thanks to their peculiar properties, are interesting materials for many applications including catalysis, hydrogen storage, and sensors. In this work, Ni NPs are synthesized in aqueous solution by a simple and rapid procedure with cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) as a capping agent, and are extensively characterized by dynamic light scattering (DLS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and atomic force microscopy (AFM). We investigated their shape, dimension, and their distribution on the surfaces of SiO2 and epitaxial graphene (EG) samples. Ni NPs have an average diameter of ~11 nm, with a narrow size dispersion, and their arrangement on the surface is strongly dependent on the substrate. EG samples functionalized with Ni NPs are further characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), as made and after thermal annealing above 350{\deg}C to confirm the degradation of CTAB and the presence of metallic Ni(0). Moreover, high resolution scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) topographies reveal the structural stability of the NPs up to 550 {\deg}C.</description>

      <title>Point-Spread Function of the Optics in Scanning Electron Microscopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Point-spread function of the probe forming optics ($PSF_{optics} $) is reported for the first time in an uncorrected (without multipole correctors) scanning electron microscope (SEM). In an SEM, the electron probe information is lost as the beam interacts with the specimen. We show how the probe phase information can be recovered from reconstructed probe intensity estimates. Controlled defocus was used to capture a focal-series of SEM images of $28.5\;nm $ gold ($\mathrm{Au} $) nanoparticles ($\mathrm{NPs} $) on a carbon ($\mathrm C $) film. These images were used to reconstruct their respective probe intensities to create a focal-series of probe intensities, which were the input to the phase retrieval pipeline. Using the complete description (intensity and phase) of the electron probe wavefunction at the specimen plane, we report the $PSF_{optics} $ for multiple data sets for beam energy $E\;=20\;keV\; $. This work opens up new possibilities for an alternative way of aberration correction and aberration-free imaging in scanning electron microscopy.</description>

      <title>Analytical exciton energies in monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive an analytical expression for $s$-state exciton energies in monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs): $E_{\text{ns}}=-{\text{Ry}}^*\times P_n/{(n-1/2+0.479\, r^*_0/\kappa)^2}$, $n=1,2,...$, where $r^*_0$ and $\kappa$ are the dimensionless screening length and dielectric constant of the surrounding medium; $\text{Ry}^*$ is an effective Rydberg energy scaled by the dielectric constant and exciton reduced mass; $P_n(r^*_0/\kappa)$ is a function of variables $n$ and $r^*_0/\kappa$. Its values are around 1.0 so we consider it a term that corrects the Rydberg energy. Despite the simple form, the suggested formula gives exciton energies with high precision compared to the exact numerical solutions that accurately describe recent experimental data for a large class of TMDC materials, including WSe$_2$, WS$_2$, MoSe$_2$, MoS$_2$, and MoTe$_2$. To achieve these results, we have developed a so-called regulated perturbation theory by combining the conventional perturbation method with several elements of the Feranchuk-Komarov operator method, including the Levi-Civita transformation, the algebraic calculation technique via the annihilation and creation operators, and the introduction of a free parameter to optimize the convergence rate of the perturbation series. This universal form of exciton energies could be helpful in various physical analyses, including retrieval of the material parameters such as reduced exciton mass and screening length from the available measured exciton energies.</description>

      <title>Microheater hotspot engineering for repeatable multi-level switching in foundry-processed phase change silicon photonics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonvolatile photonic integrated circuits employing phase change materials have relied either on optical switching mechanisms with precise multi-level control but poor scalability or electrical switching with seamless integration and scalability but mostly limited to a binary response. Recent works have demonstrated electrical multi-level switching; however, they relied on the stochastic nucleation process to achieve partial crystallization with low demonstrated repeatability and cyclability. Here, we re-engineer waveguide-integrated microheaters to achieve precise spatial control of the temperature profile (i.e., hotspot) and, thus, switch deterministic areas of an embedded phase change material cell. We experimentally demonstrate this concept using a variety of foundry-processed doped-silicon microheaters on a silicon-on-insulator platform to trigger multi-step amorphization and reversible switching of Sb$_{2}$Se$_{3}$ and Ge$_{2}$Sb$_{2}$Se$_{4}$Te alloys. We further characterize the response of our microheaters using Transient Thermoreflectance Imaging. Our approach combines the deterministic control resulting from a spatially resolved glassy-crystalline distribution with the scalability of electro-thermal switching devices, thus paving the way to reliable multi-level switching towards robust reprogrammable phase-change photonic devices for analog processing and computing.</description>

      <title>Calculation of crystal defects induced in CaWO$_{4}$ by 100 eV displacement cascades using a linear Machine Learning interatomic potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We determine the energy stored in the crystal defects induced by $\mathcal{O}(10-100)$\,eV nuclear recoils in low-threshold CaWO$_{4}$ cryogenic detectors. A Machine Learning interatomic potential is developed to perform molecular dynamics simulations. We show that the energy spectra expected from Dark Matter and neutrino coherent scattering are affected by the crystal defects and we provide reference predictions. We discuss the special case of the spectrum of nuclear recoils induced by neutron capture, which could offer a unique sensitivity to the calculated stored energies.</description>

      <title>Synthesis and characterization of the novel breathing pyrochlore compound Ba3Tm2Zn5O11</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, a novel material from the rare-earth based breathing pyrochlore family, Ba3Tm2Zn5O11, was successfully synthesized. Powder X-ray diffraction and high-resolution powder neutron diffraction confirmed phase purity and crystal structure, while thermogravimetric analysis revealed incongruent melting behavior compared to its counterpart, Ba3Yb2Zn5O11. High-quality single crystals of Ba3Tm2Zn5O11 were grown using the traveling solvent floating zone technique and assessed using Laue diffractometer and single crystal X-ray diffraction. Thermodynamic characterization indicated paramagnetic behavior down to 0.05 K, and inelastic neutron scattering measurements identified distinct crystal electric field bands. Additional low-energy excitation studies on single crystals revealed dispersionless bands at 0.8 and 1 meV. Computed phonon dispersions from first principles calculations ruled out phonons as the source of these modes, further illustrating the puzzling and unique properties of Ba3Tm2Zn5O11.</description>

      <title>Theory of Refraction, Ray-Wave Tilt, Hidden Momentum, and Apparent Topological Phases in Isotropy-Broken Materials based on Electromagnetism of Moving Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the problems of physics arguably greater in stature than even mathematical Hilberts problems is the mysterious nature of electromagnetic momentum in materials. In this paper we show that the difference between the Minkowski and Abraham momenta, which is composed of the Roentgen and Shockley hidden momenta, is directly related to the phenomenon of refraction and the tilt of rays from the wavefront propagation direction. We demonstrate that individual electromagnetic waves with non-unit indices of refraction n appear as quasistatic high-k waves to an observer in the proper frames of the waves. When Lorentz transformed into the material rest frames these high-k waves are Fresnel-Fizeau dragged from rest to their phase velocities and acquire longitudinal hidden momentum and related refractive properties. On the material level all electromagnetic waves belong to Fresnel wave surfaces topologically classified according to hyperbolic phases by Durach and determined from the electromagnetic material parameters. To moving observers, material parameters appear modified, which leads not only to the alterations of Fresnel wave surfaces, but even the topological classes of the materials may appear differently in moving frames. We discuss the phenomenon of the electromagnetic momentum tilt, defined as non-zero angle between Abraham and Minkowski momenta or equivalently between the rays and the wavefront propagation direction. We show that momentum tilt is only possible in isotropy-broken media, where E and H fields can be longitudinally polarized in presence of electric and magnetic bound charge waves. The momentum tilt can be understood as differential aberration of rays and waves when observed in material rest frame.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing Surface and Bulk Electromagnetism via Their Dynamics in an Intrinsic Magnetic Topological Insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The indirect exchange interaction between local magnetic moments via surface electrons has been long predicted to bolster the surface ferromagnetism in magnetic topological insulators (MTIs), which facilitates the quantum anomalous Hall effect. This unconventional effect is critical to determining the operating temperatures of future topotronic devices. However, the experimental confirmation of this mechanism remains elusive, especially in intrinsic MTIs. Here we combine time-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with time-resolved magneto-optical Kerr effect measurements to elucidate the unique electromagnetism at the surface of an intrinsic MTI MnBi2Te4. Theoretical modeling based on 2D Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida interactions captures the initial quenching of a surface-rooted exchange gap within a factor of two but over-estimates the bulk demagnetization by one order of magnitude. This mechanism directly explains the sizable gap in the quasi-2D electronic state and the nonzero residual magnetization in even-layer MnBi2Te4. Furthermore, it leads to efficient light-induced demagnetization comparable to state-of-the-art magnetophotonic crystals, promising an effective manipulation of magnetism and topological orders for future topotronics.</description>

      <title>Enhancement in Photoluminescence of Pt/Ag-Pt Embedded ZrO2 Thin Films by Plasma Co-sputtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Platinum, Silver-Platinum embedded Zirconia (Pt/Ag-Pt ZrO2) thin films have been fabricated on silicon wafers and glass substrates using the plasma co-sputtering method. Zirconia thin films are of significant technological importance due to their remarkable electrical, optical, and mechanical properties, as well as their high melting temperature of 2715{\deg}C, which makes them increasingly attractive for various applications. In this study, ZrO2 thin films were deposited for 3 minutes, followed by the deposition of Pt-Ag/Pt onto the fabricated zirconia thin films, with deposition times ranging from 15 to 60 seconds. The varying deposition times of Pt-Ag/Pt influenced the optical and electronic properties of the thin films due to alterations in their surface roughness. The characteristics of the grown zirconia and Pt/Ag-Pt sputtered zirconia nanostructures were investigated using Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), X-ray Diffraction (XRD), UV-visible spectroscopy, and Photoluminescence spectroscopy. The optical transmittance of these thin films was examined across the visible and near-infrared spectral ranges. The investigation revealed various properties, such as enhanced photoluminescence and the emergence of new peaks in the visible range spectra. Plasmonic peaks were induced, and an increase in the sharpness of these peaks was observed between 403.15 nm and 512.10 nm for the Pt/Ag-Pt deposited samples. This enhancement in photoluminescence is attributed to the plasmonic properties of Pt-Ag nanoparticles on the zirconia thin film. The study demonstrates that these optically tuned thin film coatings, with their enhanced photoluminescence properties, can significantly improve the heat-resistance capacity of devices, mitigating issues related to overheating and device shutdown.</description>

      <title>Unusual Pore Volume Dependence of Water Sorption in Monolithic Metal-Organic Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monolithic metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), which have a continuous structure composed of small primary MOF particles and amorphous networks, are demonstrated to possess larger pore volume and thus better larger gas uptake capacity compared to their powder forms. Here, we systematically investigated the water vapor adsorption kinetics in a prototypical MOF, i.e., MOF-801. Our results show that the total pore volume (average pore diameter) of the monolithic MOF-801 is 0.831 cm3/g (5.20 nm) which is much larger than that of powder MOF-801, i.e., 0.488 cm3/g (1.95 nm). Unexpectedly, we find that the water uptake capacity of monolithic MOF-801 is much lower than that of powder MOF-801 when the RH ranges from 10% to 90%. Our molecular dynamics simulations further demonstrate that the unexpected water uptake capacity of monolithic MOF-801 at RH of 10%~90% is caused by the water film formed by the capillary condensation in these mesopores of monolithic MOF-801. The water molecules can overcome the capillary force when the RH is higher than 90%, and then leads to the increase of the corresponding water uptake capacity of monolithic MOF-801. Our findings reveal the underlying mechanisms for water adsorption kinetics in both powder and monolithic MOFs, which could motivate and benefit the new passive cooling or water harvesting system design based on MOFs.</description>

      <title>Local and Global Reciprocity in Orbital-Charge-Coupled Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The coupled transport of the charge and orbital angular momentum of electrons is at the heart of orbitronics. Here, we discuss the reciprocal relation between the direct and inverse orbital Hall effects (OHEs) in thin films. We argue that the conventional orbital current is ill-defined as it does not satisfy the reciprocal relation owing to non-conservation of the orbital angular momentum. We resolve the problem by adopting the definition of the so-called \emph{proper} orbital current, which is directly related to orbital accumulation. We prove the reciprocal relation between the \emph{global} response of orbital and charge currents. However, we show that their \emph{local} distributions are generally different, especially due to gigantic contributions at surfaces, which may lead to unintuitive results when charge and orbital currents are locally measured. We demonstrate our predictions by first-principles calculations on W(110) and Pt(111) thin films. In W(110), the direct and inverse OHEs are severely non-reciprocal locally in each layer although the total responses are exactly reciprocal. Interestingly, the SHEs are almost reciprocal locally in each layer. On the other hand, in Pt(111), both OHEs and SHEs are locally non-reciprocal, which we attribute to the pronounced spin-orbit interaction. We propose that the locally distinct responses may be used to distinguish the spin and orbital currents in experiments.</description>

      <title>Frequency-resolved Raman Thermometry Analysis via a Multi-layer Heat Transfer Model for Bulk and Low-dimensional Materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Raman thermometry is advantageous for measuring the thermal transport of low-dimensional materials due to its non-contact nature. Transient Raman methods have improved the accuracy of steady-state Raman thermometry by removing the need for accurate temperature calibration and laser absorption evaluation. However, current methods often resort to finite element analysis (FEA) to decipher the measured signals. This step is time-consuming and impedes its ubiquitous adaptation. In this work, we replace the FEA by fitting the transient-state Raman signal to a three-dimensional (3D) analytical heat transfer model for measuring the thermal conductivity of two bulk layered materials [i.e., molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) and bismuth selenide (Bi2Se3) crystals] and the interfacial thermal conductance (h) of CVD-grown MoS2 and molybdenum di-selenide (MoSe2) on quartz (SiO2). Our measured results agree reasonably well with literature and theoretical calculations. We also performed a quantitative sensitivity analysis to give insights on how to improve the measurement sensitivity. Our work provides an efficient way to process the data of transient-based Raman thermometry for high throughput measurements.</description>

      <title>Establishing Deep InfoMax as an effective self-supervised learning methodology in materials informatics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The scarcity of property labels remains a key challenge in materials informatics, whereas materials data without property labels are abundant in comparison. By pretraining supervised property prediction models on self-supervised tasks that depend only on the "intrinsic information" available in any Crystallographic Information File (CIF), there is potential to leverage the large amount of crystal data without property labels to improve property prediction results on small datasets. We apply Deep InfoMax as a self-supervised machine learning framework for materials informatics that explicitly maximises the mutual information between a point set (or graph) representation of a crystal and a vector representation suitable for downstream learning. This allows the pretraining of supervised models on large materials datasets without the need for property labels and without requiring the model to reconstruct the crystal from a representation vector. We investigate the benefits of Deep InfoMax pretraining implemented on the Site-Net architecture to improve the performance of downstream property prediction models with small amounts (&lt;10^3) of data, a situation relevant to experimentally measured materials property databases. Using a property label masking methodology, where we perform self-supervised learning on larger supervised datasets and then train supervised models on a small subset of the labels, we isolate Deep InfoMax pretraining from the effects of distributional shift. We demonstrate performance improvements in the contexts of representation learning and transfer learning on the tasks of band gap and formation energy prediction. Having established the effectiveness of Deep InfoMax pretraining in a controlled environment, our findings provide a foundation for extending the approach to address practical challenges in materials informatics.</description>

      <title>Core-level signature of long-range charge-density-wave order and short-range excitonic correlations probed by attosecond broadband spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strongly-correlated quantum materials are characterized by a multitude of time- and energy-scales that govern quasiparticle interactions and excitations, and a precise understanding of their ground state properties necessitate an access to experimental observables that are both sensitive to the establishment of long-range order and short-range correlations. Advances in attosecond core-level spectroscopes have successfully unlocked the fastest process involving carrier dynamics in these systems, yet they are not traditionally regarded as an appropriate probe for long-range order due to their local charge sensitivity or for the low-energy physics that governs the ground-state properties of strongly-correlated materials. Here, employing a unique cryogenic attosecond broadband extreme-ultraviolet beamline, we identified clear core-level signatures of long-range charge-density-wave (CDW) formation in an excitonic insulator candidate, titanium diselenide in its 1T phase, although equilibrium measurements of the same core levels in either photoemission or absorption spectroscopy showed no observable signals about the phase transition. Leveraging intrinsic sensitivity to short-range charge excitations in core-level absorption spectra, we observed direct time-domain evidence for incoherent excitonic correlations in the normal-state of the material, whose presence has been subjected to a long-standing debate in equilibrium experiments due to the existence of CDW phonon fluctuations in a similar part of the phase space. Our results demonstrated the importance of simultaneous accesses to long- and short-range ordering with underlying dynamical processes spanning decades of time- and energy-scales, making attosecond broadband spectroscopy an indispensable tool for both understanding the equilibrium phase diagram and for discovering novel, nonequilibrium states in correlated materials.</description>

      <title>Influence of fluid rheology on multistability in the unstable flow of polymer solutions through pore constriction arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diverse chemical, energy, environmental, and industrial processes involve the flow of polymer solutions in porous media. The accumulation and dissipation of elastic stresses as the polymers are transported through the tortuous, confined pore space can lead to the development of an elastic flow instability above a threshold flow rate. This flow instability can generate complex flows with strong spatiotemporal fluctuations, despite the low Reynolds number ($\mathrm{Re} \ll 1$); for example, in 1D ordered arrays of pore constrictions, this unstable flow can be multistable, with distinct pores exhibiting distinct unstable flow states. Here, we examine how this multistability is influenced by fluid rheology. Through experiments using diverse polymer solutions having systematic variations in fluid shear-thinning or elasticity, in pore constriction arrays of varying geometries, we show that the onset of multistability can be described using a single dimensionless parameter. This parameter, the streamwise Deborah number, compares the stress relaxation time of the polymer solution to the time required for the fluid to be advected between pore constrictions. Our work thus helps to deepen understanding of the influence of fluid rheology on elastic instabilities, helping to establish guidelines for the rational design of polymeric fluids with desirable flow behaviors.</description>

      <title>Generalized Topology in Lattice Models without Chiral Symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model is a fundamental lattice model used to study topological physics. Here, we propose a new versatile one-dimensional (1D) lattice model that extends beyond the SSH model. Our 1D model breaks chiral symmetry and has generalized topology characterized by a projected winding number $W_{1D,P}=1$. When this model is extended to 2D, it can generate a second-order topological insulator (SOTI) phase. The generalized topology of the SOTI phase is protected by a pair of opposite winding numbers $W_{2D,P}^{\pm}=\pm1$, which count the opposite phase windings of a projected vortex and antivortex pair defined in the manifold of the entire parameter space. Thus, the topology of our models is robust and the end (corner) modes are independent of the selection of unit cells and boundary configurations. More significantly, we demonstrate that the model is very general and can be inherently realized in many categories of crystalline materials such as BaHCl.</description>

      <title>Unifying thermophotovoltaic performance metrics with technoeconomics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermophotovoltaics (TPV) are becoming a promising new heat engine with rapid recent gains in performance. Their performance is characterized by two metrics: efficiency and power density. As we bridge the gap between lab-scale and system-scale devices, we need to understand how each of these metrics impacts the technoeconomics of a TPV system. In this work, we develop a technoeconomic metric based on the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) to understand how the metrics should be weighted relative to each other in terms of importance. We find that systems with high infrastructure and fuel costs should prioritize TPV efficiency, while systems where the TPV cell cost dominates should prioritize power density. We then evaluate how concrete cell improvements could improve the technoeconomics of five example systems, identifying the most impactful specific properties. Namely, improving spectral control with sub-bandgap reflectance is the most effective at reducing LCOE in systems with high infrastructure cost, while increasing view factor and reducing series resistance are most critical in systems with high TPV cell cost. Improving just 1-2 of these properties can reduce the LCOE by 30-50%. This study therefore helps researchers understand which performance metric is more important for their application and how to achieve high values of this performance metric.</description>

      <title>Contrasting magnetothermal conductivity in sibling Co-based honeycomb-lattice antiferromagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Honeycomb-lattice antiferromagnets have attracted wide attention for exploration of exotic heat transport and their interplay with magnetic excitations. In this work, we have revealed a contrasting behavior in the magneto-thermal conductivity (MTC) between two Co-based honeycomb-lattice magnets Co4M2O9 (M = Nb, Ta), despite their identical lattice structures and quite similar magnetism. Co4Ta2O9 exhibits enhanced MTC of about 550% at 9 T of an in-plane magnetic field, comparable to other honeycomb-magnets, while MTC for Co4Nb2O9 reaches only ~30%. This marked difference is ascribed to distinct features in the field-induced evolution of magnetic excitations that resonantly scatter phonons. This finding sheds light on implicit impacts of non-magnetic ions on thermal transport, and hints at the potential for broad heat-transport tunability while preserving magnetism and lattice structures.</description>

      <title>Quantitative evaluation method for magnetoelastic coupling between surface acoustic waves and spin waves using electrical and optical measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coupling and hybridization of different elementary excitations leads to new functionalities. In phononics and spintronics, magnetoelastic coupling between Rayleigh-type surface acoustic wave (SAW) and spin wave (SW) has recently attracted much attention. Quantitatively evaluating and comparing the coupled system are essential to develop the study of the magnetoelastic SAW-SW coupling. So far, previous studies of SAW-SW coupling have employed a quantity called coupling strength. However, it is still challenging to compare the coupling strength values among studies fairly because the quantity depends on the device geometry and the applied magnetic field angle, which are not unified among the previous studies. Here, we focus on a practical constant composed of a magnetoelastic constant and a strain amplitude that depends only on the material properties. We demonstrate a versatile evaluation technique to evaluate the practical constant by combining electrical measurements and optical imaging. An essential part of the technique is an analysis that can be used under off-resonance conditions where SAW and SW resonance frequencies do not match. Existing analysis can only handle the case under on-resonance conditions. Our analysis makes it possible to observe the magnetoelastic couplings between SAW with resonance frequencies that can be imaged optically and SW with resonance frequencies in the gigahertz range. Our demonstrated technique, which uses electrical and optical measurements under off-resonance conditions, can significantly advance research on SAW-SW coupled systems.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Assisted 3D Printing of Thermoelectric Materials of Ultrahigh Performances at Room Temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermoelectric energy conversion is an attractive technology for generating electricity from waste heat and using electricity for solid-state cooling. However, conventional manufacturing processes for thermoelectric devices are costly and limited to simple device geometries. This work reports an extrusion printing method to fabricate high-performance thermoelectric materials with complex 3D architectures. By integrating high-throughput experimentation and Bayesian optimization (BO), our approach significantly accelerates the simultaneous search for the optimal ink formulation and printing parameters that deliver high thermoelectric performances while maintaining desired shape fidelity. A Gaussian process regression (GPR)-based machine learning model is employed to expeditiously predict thermoelectric power factor as a function of ink formulation and printing parameters. The printed bismuth antimony telluride (BiSbTe)-based thermoelectric materials under the optimized conditions exhibit an ultrahigh room temperature zT of 1.3, which is by far the highest in the printed thermoelectric materials. The machine learning-guided ink-based printing strategy can be highly generalizable to a wide range of functional materials and devices for broad technological applications.</description>

      <title>Efficient spin accumulation carried by slow relaxons in chiral tellurium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient conversion between charge currents and spin signals is crucial for realizing magnet-free spintronic devices. However, the strong spin-orbit coupling that enables such a conversion, causes rapid relaxation of spins, making them difficult to transport over large length scales. Here, we show that spin-momentum entanglement at the Fermi surface of chiral tellurium crystals leads to the appearance of slow collective relaxation modes. These modes, called relaxons, resemble the persistent spin helix, a collective spin-wave excitation with extended lifetime observed in quantum wells. The slow relaxons dominate the electrically generated spin and orbital angular momentum accumulation in tellurium and make it possible to combine a very high 50% conversion efficiency with a long spin lifetime. These results, obtained from the exact solution of the Boltzmann transport equation, show that chiral crystals can be used for highly efficient generation and transmission of spin signals over long distances in spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Bulk and fracture process zone contribution to the rate-dependent adhesion amplification in viscoelastic broad-band materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The contact between a rigid Hertzian indenter and an adhesive broad-band viscoelastic substrate is considered. The material behaviour is described by a modified power law model, which is characterized by only four parameters, the glassy and rubbery elastic moduli, a characteristic exponent n and a timescale ${\tau}_0$. The maximum adherence force that can be reached while unloading the rigid indenter from a relaxed viscoelastic half-space is studied by means of a numerical implementation based on the boundary element method, as a function of the unloading velocity, preload and by varying the broadness of the viscoelastic material spectrum. Through a comprehensive numerical analysis we have determined the minimum contact radius that is needed to achieve the maximum amplification of the pull-off force at a specified unloading rate and for different material exponents n. The numerical results are then compared with the prediction of Persson and Brener viscoelastic crack propagation theory, providing excellent agreement. However, comparison against experimental tests for a glass lens indenting a PDMS substrate show data can be fitted with the linear theory only up to an unloading rate of about $100 \textrm{ $\mu$}$m/s showing the fracture process zone rate-dependent contribution to the energy enhancement is of the same order of the bulk dissipation contribution. Hence, the limitations of the current numerical and theoretical models for viscoelastic adhesion are discussed in light of the most recent literature results.</description>

      <title>Spin relaxation of localized electrons in monolayer MoSe$_2$: importance of random effective magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Hanle and spin polarization recovery effects on resident electrons in a monolayer MoSe$_2$ on EuS. We demonstrate that localized electrons provide the main contribution to the spin dynamics signal at low temperatures below 15~K for small magnetic fields of only a few mT. The spin relaxation of these electrons is determined by random effective magnetic fields due to a contact spin interaction, namely the hyperfine interaction with the nuclei in MoSe$_2$ or the exchange interaction with the magnetic ions of the EuS film. From the magnetic field angular dependence of the spin polarization we evaluate the anisotropy of the intervalley electron $g$-factor and the spin relaxation time. The non-zero in-plane $g$-factor $|g_x|\approx 0.1$, the value of which is comparable to its dispersion, is attributed to randomly localized electrons in the MoSe$_2$ layer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.13465v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the magnetic and ferroelectric ordering of magnetoelectric multiferroic materials at the nanoscale necessitates a versatile imaging method with high spatial resolution. Here, soft X-ray ptychography is employed to simultaneously image the ferroelectric and antiferromagnetic domains in an 80 nm thin freestanding film of the room-temperature multiferroic BiFeO$_3$ (BFO). The antiferromagnetic spin cycloid of period 64 nm is resolved by reconstructing the corresponding resonant elastic X-ray scattering in real space and visualized together with mosaic-like ferroelectric domains in a linear dichroic contrast image at the Fe L$_3$ edge. The measurements reveal a near perfect coupling between the antiferromagnetic and ferroelectric ordering by which the propagation direction of the spin cycloid is locked orthogonally to the ferroelectric polarization. In addition, the study evinces both a preference for in-plane propagation of the spin cycloid and changes of the ferroelectric polarization by 71{\deg} between multiferroic domains in the epitaxial strain-free, freestanding BFO film. The results provide a direct visualization of the strong magnetoelectric coupling in BFO and of its fine multiferroic domain structure, emphasizing the potential of ptychographic imaging for the study of multiferroics and non-collinear magnetic materials with soft X-rays.</description>

Abstract: Alloys based on lanthanum phosphate (LaPO$_{4}$) are often employed as thermal barrier coatings, due to their low thermal conductivity and structural stability over a wide temperature range. To enhance the thermal-insulation performance of these alloys, it is essential to comprehensively understand the fundamental physics governing their heat conduction. Here, we employ the Wigner formulation of thermal transport in conjunction with first-principles calculations to elucidate how the interplay between anharmonicity and compositional disorder determines the thermal properties of La$_{1{-}x}$Gd$_{x}$PO$_{4}$ alloys, and discuss the fundamental physics underlying the emergence and coexistence of particle-like and wave-like heat-transport mechanisms. We also show how the Wigner transport equation describes correctly the thermodynamic limit of a compositionally disordered crystal, while the Boltzmann transport equation does not. Our predictions for microscopic vibrational properties (temperature-dependent Raman spectrum) and for macroscopic thermal conductivity are validated against experiments. Finally, we leverage these findings to devise strategies to optimize the performance of thermal barrier coatings.</description>

      <title>Spin-glass states generated in a van der Waals magnet by alkali-ion intercalation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17554v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tuning magnetic properties in layered van der Waals (vdW) materials has captured a significant attention due to the efficient control of ground-states by heterostructuring and external stimuli. Electron doping by electrostatic gating, interfacial charge transfer and intercalation is particularly effective in manipulating the exchange and spin-orbit properties, resulting in a control of Curie temperature ($T_{\text{C}}$) and magnetic anisotropy. Here, we discover an uncharted role of intercalation to generate magnetic frustration. As a model study, we intercalate Na atoms into the vdW gaps of pristine Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$ (CGT) where generated magnetic frustration leads to emerging spin-glass states coexisting with a ferromagnetic order. A series of dynamic magnetic susceptibility measurements/analysis confirms the formation of magnetic clusters representing slow dynamics with a distribution of relaxation times. The intercalation also modifies other macroscopic physical parameters including the significant enhancement of $T_{\text{C}}$ from 66\,K to 240\,K and the switching of magnetic easy-hard axis direction. Our study identifies intercalation as a unique route to generate emerging frustrated spin states in simple vdW crystals.</description>

Abstract: Controlling the Mott transition through strain engineering is crucial for advancing the development and application of memristive and neuromorphic computing devices. Yet, Mott insulators are heterogeneous due to intrinsic phase boundaries and extrinsic defects, posing significant challenges to fully understanding the impact of local microscopic distortions on the local Mott transition. Addressing these challenges demands structural characterizations at the relevant length scale. Here, using a synchrotron-based scanning X-ray nanoprobe, we studied the real-space structural heterogeneity during the structural phase transition in a V2O3 thin film. Through temperature-dependent metal-insulator phase coexistence mapping, we report a variation in the local transition temperature of up to 7 K across the film and the presence of the transition hysteresis at the nanoscale. Furthermore, a detailed quantitative analysis demonstrates that the spatial heterogeneity of the transition is closely tied to the tilting of crystallographic planes in the pure insulating phase. Our work highlights the impact of local heterogeneity on the Mott transition and lays the groundwork for future innovations in harnessing strain heterogeneity within Mott systems for the next-generation computational technologies.</description>

Abstract: Passive transformation of waves via nonlinear systems is ubiquitous in settings ranging from acoustics to optics and electromagnetics. Passivity is of particular importance for responding rapidly to stimuli and nonlinearity enormously expands signal transformability compared to linear systems due to the breaking of superposition. It is well known that different types of nonlinearity yield vastly different effects on propagating signals, which raises the question of ``what precise nonlinearity is the best for a given wave tailoring application?'' Considering a one-dimensional spring-mass chain as a testbed, we couple the shape optimization of structures for tailored nonlinear constitutive responses with reduced-order nonlinear dynamical inverse design. Using minimization of peak kinetic energy transmission from impact as a case study, we identify ideal nonlinear constitutive responses and the geometries needed to achieve them. As part of this, we show the large sensitivity of this metric to small changes in nonlinearity, and thus the need for high precision, free-form nonlinearity tailoring. We validate our predictions using impact experiments in a chain of nonlinear springs and masses. This work sets the foundation for broader passive nonlinear mechanical wave tailoring material design, with applications to computing, signal processing, shock mitigation, and autonomous materials.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Limits of Charge Carrier Mobilities in Layered Halide Perovskites</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12960v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Layered halide perovskites have emerged as potential alternatives to three-dimensional halide perovskites due to their improved stability and larger material phase space, allowing fine-tuning of structural, electronic, and optical properties. However, their charge carrier mobilities are significantly smaller than that of three-dimensional halide perovskites, which has a considerable impact on their application in optoelectronic devices. Here, we employ state-of-the-art ab initio approaches to unveil the electron-phonon mechanisms responsible for the diminished transport properties of layered halide perovskites. Starting from a prototypical ABX$_{3}$ halide perovskite, we model the case of $n=1$ and $n=2$ layered structures and compare their electronic and transport properties to the three-dimensional reference. The electronic and phononic properties are investigated within density functional theory (DFT) and density functional perturbation theory (DFPT), while transport properties are obtained via the ab initio Boltzmann transport equation. The vibrational modes contributing to charge carrier scattering are investigated and associated with polar-phonon scattering mechanisms arising from the long-range Fr\"ohlich coupling and deformation potential scattering processes. Our investigation reveals that the lower mobilities in layered systems primarily originates from the increased electronic density of states at the vicinity of the band edges, while the electron-phonon coupling strength remains similar. Such increase is caused by the dimensionality reduction and the break in octahedra connectivity along the stacking direction. Our findings provide a fundamental understanding of the electron-phonon coupling mechanisms in layered perovskites and highlight the intrinsic limitations of the charge carrier transport in these materials.</description>

Abstract: The synergetic approach proposed here is based on characteristic instability of chemical bonding in the form of the bond wave considered as the spatiotemporal correlation between the elementary acts of bond exchange. In frames of the model, glass transition represents the dimensionality transition: from the 3D bond wave in glass-forming liquid to the 2D bond wave in glass. The model displays non-crystalline long-range order, semi-deterministic behavior of viscosity, and information field as a necessary condition for glass formation.</description>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) such as generative pretrained transformers (GPTs) have shown potential for various commercial applications, but their applicability for materials design remains underexplored. In this article, we introduce AtomGPT, a model specifically developed for materials design based on transformer architectures, to demonstrate the capability for both atomistic property prediction and structure generation. We show that a combination of chemical and structural text descriptions can efficiently predict material properties with accuracy comparable to graph neural network models, including formation energies, electronic bandgaps from two different methods and superconducting transition temperatures. Furthermore, we demonstrate that AtomGPT can generate atomic structures for tasks such as designing new superconductors, with the predictions validated through density functional theory calculations. This work paves the way for leveraging LLMs in forward and inverse materials design, offering an efficient approach to the discovery and optimization of materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10647v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply density functional theory to investigate interactions between electronic and vibrational states in crystal defects with multi-mode dynamical Jahn-Teller (JT) systems. Our focus is on transitions between orbital singlet and degenerate orbital doublet characterized by $E \otimes (e \oplus e \oplus \cdots)$ JT coupling, which frequently occurs in crystal defects that are investigated for applications in quantum information science. We utilize a recently developed methodology to model the photoluminescence (PL) spectrum of the negatively charged split nickel-vacancy center (NiV$^{-}$) in diamond, where JT-active modes significantly influence electron-phonon interactions. Our results validate the effectiveness of the methodology in accurately reproducing the observed 1.4 eV PL lineshape. The strong agreement between our theoretical predictions and experimental observations reinforces the identification of the 1.4 eV PL center with the NiV$^{-}$ complex.

      <title>Direct Observation of Dendrites Nucleation in Li Metal Battery by Machine Learning Accelerated Molecular Simulations under Realistic Electrochemical Conditions</title>

Abstract: Uncontrollable dendrites growth during electrochemical cycles leads to low Coulombic efficiency and critical safety issues in Li metal batteries. Hence, a comprehensive understanding of the dendrite formation mechanism is essential for further enhancing the performance of Li metal batteries. Machine learning accelerated molecular dynamics (MD) simulations can provide atomic-scale resolution for various key processes at an ab-initio level accuracy. However, traditional MD simulation tools hardly capture Li electrochemical depositions, due to lack of an electrochemical constant potential (ConstP) condition. In this work, we propose a ConstP approach that combines a machine learning force field with the charge equilibration method to reveal the dynamic process of Li dendrites nucleation at Li metal anode surfaces. Our results show that both dead Li cluster formation and inhomogeneous Li electro-depositions can induce Li dendrites nucleation. We further reveal that the local aggregation of Li atoms in amorphous inorganic components of solid electrolyte interphase is the key factor triggering the nucleation process. Overall, our simulations provide microscopic insights for Li dendrites formations in Li metal anodes. More importantly, we present an efficient and accurate simulation method for modeling realistic ConstP conditions, which holds considerable potential for broader applications in modeling of complex electrochemical interfaces.</description>

      <title>Irida-Graphene Phonon Thermal Transport via Non-equilibrium Molecular Dynamics Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15855v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, a new 2D carbon allotrope called Irida-Graphene (Irida-G) was proposed. Irida-G consists of a flat sheet topologically arranged into 3-6-8 carbon rings exhibiting metallic and non-magnetic properties. In this study, we investigated the thermal transport properties of Irida-G using classical reactive molecular dynamics simulations. The findings indicate that Irida-G has an intrinsic thermal conductivity of approximately 215 W/mK at room temperature, significantly lower than that of pristine graphene. This decrease is due to characteristic phonon scattering within Irida-G's porous structure. Additionally, the phonon group velocities and vibrational density of states for Irida-G were analyzed, revealing reduced average phonon group velocities compared to graphene. The thermal conductivity of Irida-G is isotropic and shows significant size effects, transitioning from ballistic to diffusive heat transport regimes as the system length increases. These results suggest that while Irida-G has lower thermal conductivity than graphene, it still holds potential for specific thermal management applications, sharing characteristics with other two-dimensional materials.</description>

      <title>Machine learning the screening factor in the soft bond valence approach for rapid crystal structure estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17197v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Development of new functional ceramics is important for several applications, including electrochemical batteries and fuel cells. Computational prescreening and selection of such materials can help discover novel materials but is challenging due to the high cost of electronic structure calculations which would be needed to compute the structures and properties of interest such as the material's stability and ion diffusion properties. The soft bond valence (SoftBV) approach is attractive for rapid prescreening among multiple compositions and structures, but the simplicity of the approximation can make the results inaccurate. We explore the possibility of enhancing the accuracy of the SoftBV approach when estimating crystal structures by adapting the parameters of the approximation to the chemical composition. Specifically, on the examples of perovskite- and spinel-type oxides that have been proposed as promising solid-state ionic conductors, the screening factor, an independent parameter of the SoftBV approximation, is modeled using linear and non-linear methods as a function of descriptors of chemical composition. We find that making the screening factor a function of composition can noticeably improve the ability of SoftBV to correctly model structures, in particular new, putative crystal structures whose structural parameters are yet unknown. We also analyze the relative importance of nonlinearity and coupling in improving the model and find that while the quality of the model is improved by including nonlinearity, coupling is relatively unimportant. While using a neural network showed no improvement over linear regression, the recently proposed GPR-NN method that is a hybrid between a single hidden layer neural network and kernel regression showed substantial improvement, enabling the prediction of structural parameters of new ceramics with accuracy on the order of 1%.</description>

      <title>The local structure, electronic and optical properties of Pb(Mg$_{1/3}$Nb$_{2/3}$)O$_3$-PbTiO$_3$: first-principles study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18723v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pb(Mg$_{1/3}$Nb$_{2/3}$)O$_3$-PbTiO$_3$ perovskite-based crystals attract considerable scientific interest due to their interesting properties and possible use in piezoelectricity and photovoltaics. To understand the local structure and fundamental properties of such materials, in this work, we focused on the study within the density functional theory of structural, electronic, and optical properties of Pb[(Mg$_{1/3}$Nb$_{2/3}$)$_{0.75}$Ti$_{0.25}$]O$_3$. Using GGA(PBEsol) approximation for structure optimization gives a good agreement with experimental data. Through the variation in Hubbard $U$ parameters to GGA(PBEsol) functional, we achieve the bandgap for the Pb[(Mg$_{1/3}$Nb$_{2/3}$)$_{0.75}$Ti$_{0.25}$]O$_3$ which is in good agreement with the experimental results. The study of the bond populations showed that the Mg-O bond demonstrates no covalency, whereas there is a significant Ti-O and Nb-O covalent bonding. Such different bonding characteristics must be responsible for the relaxor properties of Pb[(Mg$_{1/3}$Nb$_{2/3}$)$_{0.75}$Ti$_{0.25}$]O$_3$ compound. In addition, the investigations of the optical properties of the Pb[(Mg$_{1/3}$Nb$_{2/3}$)$_{0.75}$Ti$_{0.25}$]O$_3$ by adopting Hubbard $U$ corrections, modifying the error of the GGA approximation, and confirming the electronic analysis, were performed.</description>

      <title>MOSP: A User-interface Package for Simulating Metal Nanoparticle Structure and Reactivity under Operando Conditions</title>

Abstract: Structures of metal nanoparticles (NPs) significantly influence their catalytic reactivities. Recent in situ experimental observations of dramatic structural changes in NPs have underscored the need to establish a dynamic structure-property relationship that accounts for the reconstruction of NPs in reactive environments. Here, we present the MOSP, a free and open-source graphical user interface (GUI) package designed to simulate the structure and reactivity of metal NPs under operando conditions. MOSP integrates two models: the multiscale structure reconstruction (MSR) model predicting equilibrium metal NP structures under specific reaction conditions and the kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) model simulating the reaction dynamics. This combination allows for the exploration of the dynamic structure-property relationships of NPs. MOSP enhances user accessibility through its intuitive GUI, facilitating easy input, post-processing, and visualization of simulation data. This article is the release note of MOSP, focusing on its implementation and functionality.</description>

      <title>Low temperature spin Seebeck effect in non-magnetic vanadium dioxide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.02594v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spin Seebeck effect (SSE) is sensitive to thermally driven magnetic excitations in magnetic insulators. Vanadium dioxide in its insulating low temperature phase is expected to lack magnetic degrees of freedom, as vanadium atoms are thought to form singlets upon dimerization of the vanadium chains. Instead, we find a paramagnetic SSE response in VO2 films that grows as the temperature decreases below 50 K. The field and temperature dependent SSE voltage is qualitatively consistent with a general model of paramagnetic SSE response and inconsistent with triplet spin transport. Quantitative estimates find a spin Seebeck coefficient comparable in magnitude to that observed in strongly magnetic materials. The microscopic nature of the magnetic excitations in VO2 requires further examination.</description>

      <title>Shear-induced diffusivity in supercooled liquids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18412v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Taylor-Aris theory of shear diffusion predicts that the effective diffusivity of a tracer molecule in a sheared liquid is enhanced by a term quadratic in the shear rate. In sheared supercooled liquids, instead, the observed enhancement is linear in the shear rate. This is a fundamental observation for the physics of nonequilibrium liquids for which no theory or fundamental understanding is available. We derive a formula for the effective molecular diffusivity in supercooled liquids under shear flow based on the underlying Smoluchowski equation with shear (Smoluchowski diffusion-convection equation) with an energy barrier representing a crowded energy landscape. The obtained formula correctly recovers the effective diffusivity with a correction term linear in the shear rate, in agreement with results from numerical simulations of different liquids as well as with earlier experimental results on shear melting of colloidal glass. The theory predictions are supported by comparisons with molecular simulations of supercooled water and supercooled Lennard-Jones liquids, which confirm that the predicted enhancement of diffusivity is inversely proportional to temperature and directly proportional to the zero shear viscosity.</description>

Abstract: A home-built compact system that functions as both a transfer stage for deterministic transfer processes and a mask aligner for contact photolithography, is constructed. The precision translation sample stage and optical microscope are shared between the two modes. In the transfer mode, assisted by either an adhesive or a heating element, the setup has been used to deterministically transfer freestanding semiconductors, 2D materials, and van der Waals electrodes. When configured in photolithography mode, the proposed instrument has been employed to fabricate various micro-scale patterns and devices, with minimum feature sizes of ~1-2 um achieved. Our prototype instrument provides a feasible solution for preforming high quality deterministic transfer and photolithography processes on one single tool in house.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity at 9 K in Pb-Bi Alloy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14773v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the present work, we report the synthesis of Pb-Bi alloy with enhanced Tc of up to 9K, which is higher than that of Pb. The alloy is synthesized via a solid-state reaction route in the vacuum-encapsulated quartz tube at 7000C in an automated furnace. The synthesized sample is characterized by X-ray Diffraction(XRD) and Energy dispersive X-ray analysis(EDAX) for its phase purity and elemental composition. Rietveld refinement of XRD reveals that the end product is a majority hexagonal Pb7Bi3, with minor rhombohedral Bi. The electronic transport measurement shows metallic behavior with the Debye temperature of 108K and a superconductivity transition temperature (Tc) below 9K, which is the maximum to date for any reported Pb-Bi alloy, Pb or Bi at ambient pressure. Partial substitution of Bi at the Pb site may modify the free density of electronic states within the BCS model to attain the optimum Tc, which is higher by around 2K from the reported Tc of Pb. The superconductor phase diagram derived from magneto-transport measurements reveals that the synthesized alloy is a conventional superconductor with an upper critical field (Hc2) of 3.9 Tesla, which lies well within the Pauli paramagnetic limit. The magnetization measurements carried out following ZFC(Zero Field Cool) protocols infer that the synthesized alloy is a bulk superconductor below 9K. The isothermal M-H(Magnetization vs. Field) measurements performed below Tc establish it as a type-II superconductor. The specific heat capacity measurements show that the Pb-Bi alloy is a strongly coupled bulk superconductor below around 9K with possibly two superconducting gaps.</description>

      <title>Controlled Spalling of Single Crystal 4H-SiC Bulk Substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19716v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We detail several scientific and engineering innovations which enable the controlled spalling of 10 - 50 micron thick films of single crystal 4H silicon carbide (4H-SiC) from bulk substrates. 4H-SiC's properties, including high thermal conductivity and a wide bandgap, make it an ideal candidate for high-temperature, high-voltage power electronic devices. Moreover, 4H-SiC has been shown to be an excellent host of solid-state atomic defect qubits for quantum computing and quantum networking. Because 4H-SiC single crystal substrates are expensive (due to long growth times and limited yield), techniques for removal and transfer of bulk-quality films in the tens-of-microns thickness range are highly desirable to allow for substrate reuse and integration of the separated films. In this work we utilize novel approaches for stressor layer thickness control and spalling crack initiation to demonstrate controlled spalling of 4H-SiC, the highest fracture toughness material spalled to date. Additionally, we demonstrate substrate re-use, bonding of the spalled films to carrier substrates, and explore the spin coherence of the spalled films. In preliminary studies we are able to achieve coherent spin control of neutral divacancy ($VV^{0}$) qubit ensembles and measure a quasi-bulk spin $T_{2}$ of 79.7 $\mu$s in such spalled films.</description>

      <title>Ferromagnetic resonance response in square artificial spin ice: roles of geometry in vertex dynamics and magnetic configurations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01720v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artificial spin ice (ASI) represents a class of uniquely structured superlattices comprising geometrically arranged interacting nanomagnets. This arrangement facilitates the exploration of magnetic frustration phenomena and related spin wave dynamics, contributing to the field of magnonics. In this work, we present a compressive study of spin wave dynamics in square ASI lattices using micromagnetic simulations, explicitly focusing on ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) and oscillation modes. We investigate how variations in the aspect ratio of nanomagnets dimensions influence magnetic excitations in both saturated and remanent states. We analyze the frequency variations of FMR peaks corresponding to edges and bulk oscillation modes in relation to both magnetic configuration and nanomagnets dimensions. We emphasize the remanent state of square ASI vertex configurations, particularly focusing on their characteristic energy states (Type I, Type II, Type III, and Type IV), while detailing how symmetries influence oscillation modes. We observe distinct FMR responses originating from vertices, exhibiting unique characteristics for each energy state. Our results offer a potential method of utilizing the FMR technique to identify energy states in ASI systems.</description>

      <title>CMOS-compatible Strain Engineering for High-Performance Monolayer Semiconductor Transistors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09792v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strain engineering has played a key role in modern silicon electronics, having been introduced as a mobility booster in the 1990s and commercialized in the early 2000s. Achieving similar advances with two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors in a CMOS (complementary metal oxide semiconductor) compatible manner would radically improve the industrial viability of 2D transistors. Here, we show silicon nitride capping layers can impart strain to monolayer MoS2 transistors on conventional silicon substrates, enhancing their electrical performance with a low thermal budget (350 {\deg}C), CMOS-compatible approach. Strained back-gated and dual-gated MoS2 transistors demonstrate median increases up to 60% and 45% in on-state current, respectively. The greatest improvements are found when both transistor channels and contacts are reduced to ~200 nm, reaching saturation currents of 488 uA/um, higher than any previous reports at such short contact pitch. Simulations reveal that most benefits arise from tensile strain lowering the contact Schottky barriers, and that further reducing device dimensions (including contacts) will continue to offer increased strain and performance improvements.</description>
