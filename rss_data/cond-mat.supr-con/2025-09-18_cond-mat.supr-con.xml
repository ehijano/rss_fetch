      <title>Nematic Enhancement of Superconductivity in Multilayer Graphene via Quantum Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multilayer graphene materials have recently emerged as a fascinating versatile platform for correlated electron phenomena, hosting superconductivity, fractional quantum Hall states, and correlated insulating phases. A particularly striking experimental observation is the recurring correlation between nematicity in the normal state -- manifested by spontaneous breaking of the underlying $C_3$ symmetry -- and the stabilization of robust superconducting phases. Despite its ubiquity across different materials, devices and experiments, this trend has thus far lacked a clear microscopic explanation. In this work, we identify a concrete mechanism linking nematic order to enhanced superconductivity. We demonstrate that $C_3$-symmetry breaking strongly reshapes the Bloch wavefunctions near the Fermi level, producing a pronounced enhancement and redistribution of the so-called quantum metric. This effect drastically amplifies superconducting pairing mediated by the quantum geometric Kohn-Luttinger mechanism [G. Shavit \it{et al.}, \href{https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.134.176001}{Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 176001 (2025)}]. Our analysis reveals that nematicity naturally boosts the superconducting coupling constant in experimentally relevant density regimes, providing a compelling explanation for observed correlations. These results establish the central role of geometric effects in graphene superconductivity and highlight nematicity as a promising avenue for engineering stronger unconventional superconducting states.</description>

      <title>A Computational Picture of Hydride Formation and Dissipation In Nb SRF Cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Research linking surface hydrides to Q-disease, and the subsequent development of methods to eliminate surface hydrides, is one of the great successes of SRF cavity R&amp;D. We use time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau to extend the theory of hydride dissipation to sub-surface hydrides. Just as surface hydrides cause Q-disease behavior, we show that sub-surface hydrides cause high-field Q-slope (HFQS) behavior. We find that the abrupt onset of HFQS is due to a transition from a vortex-free state to a vortex-penetration state. We show that controlling hydride size and depth through impurity doping can eliminate HFQS.</description>

      <title>Optimally Tensile Strained La3Ni2O7 Films as Candidate High-Temperature Superconductors on Designer Ba1-xSrxO (001) and SrO-SrTiO3 Substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experiments have observed superconductivity up to 48 K in La3Ni2O7-derived films under compressive strain imposed by the SrLaAlO4 substrate, while such films on the SrTiO3 substrate with tensile strain have failed to reach the superconducting state. Here we propose to broadly expand the choices of materials platforms to achieve high-Tc superconducting La3Ni2O7 films by proposing designer substrates of Ba1-xSrxO (x = 0 - 1) that allow to continuously tune the strain in the films from being tensile to compressive. Our systematic study of the structural and electronic reconstructions of the strained La3Ni2O7 bilayer film leads to the central finding that at the optimal tensile strain of ~2% (x ~0.25), the spectral weight of the Ni dz2 orbital is peaked right at the Fermi level, and its hybridization with the Ni dx2-y2 orbital is substantially enhanced. Consequently, the expected Tc should be unprecedentedly high, at least substantially higher than those achieved in the compressive regime. Furthermore, our detailed thickness-dependent energetic analyses show that such films can be stably grown for thicknesses equal to or beyond the bilayer regime, and predict that the SrO-terminated SrTiO3 should also be able to stabilize the films with optimal tensile strain and higher Tc's.</description>

      <title>Spin-Polarized Josephson Supercurrent in Nodeless Altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-range propagation of equal-spin triplet Cooper pairs typically occurs in ferromagnet/$s$-wave superconductor junctions, where net magnetization plays a crucial role. Here, we propose a fundamentally different scenario in which Josephson supercurrents mediated exclusively by spin-triplet pairings emerge in systems with \textit{zero} net magnetization. We identify collinear altermagnets, particularly a subclass termed nodeless altermagnets, as ideal platforms to realize this phenomenon. These materials host spin-split Fermi surfaces that do not intersect altermagnetic nodal lines and support maximal spin-valley polarization, yielding fully spin-polarized electronic states at each valley. Consequently, Josephson junctions based on nodeless altermagnets sustain supercurrents solely through spin-polarized triplet pairing correlations, simultaneously contributed by spin-up Cooper pairs from one valley and spin-down Cooper pairs from the other. Furthermore, controlling the relative local inversion-symmetry breaking at the two interfaces enables a robust 0--$\pi$ transition without fine tuning, while adjusting the junction orientation allows a crossover between pure triplet and mixed singlet-triplet states. Our work thus establishes nodeless altermagnets as a unique platform for altermagnetic superconductors with magnetization-free spin-polarized supercurrents.</description>

      <title>Persistent Fluctuating Superconductivity and Planckian Dissipation in Fe(Te,Se)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Increasingly intricate phase diagrams in new classes of superconductors host fascinating interactions between superconductivity, diverse quantum phases, and quantum critical dynamics. The native superfluids, however, often exhibit much lower density and much greater inhomogeneity than conventional superfluids. This may render the superconductivity susceptible to fluctuations that are ordinarily assumed to be frozen out far below the superconducting transition temperature $T_c$, calling into question the degree to which the superconducting state is fully coherent. In this work, we leverage terahertz spectroscopy to demonstrate strongly fluctuating superconductivity in topological compositions of the multiband iron-based superconductor Fe(Te,Se). These fluctuations are found to persist undiminished far below $T_c$ and converge upon the limit of Planckian dissipation above $T_c$. These results indicate that extended quantum fluctuations dominate the electrodynamics of both the superconducting and Planckian-dissipative precursor states of Fe(Te,Se), and demonstrate that the assumption of phase coherence must be rigorously validated in emerging classes of unconventional superconductors.</description>

      <title>Room temperature reactive sputtering deposition of titanium nitride with high sheet kinetic inductance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting thin films with high intrinsic kinetic inductance $L_{k}$ are important for high-sensitivity detectors, enabling strong coupling in hybrid quantum systems, and enhancing nonlinearities in quantum devices. We report the room-temperature reactive sputtering of titanium nitride thin films with a critical temperature $T_{c}$ of \SI{3.8}{K} and a thickness of \SI{27}{nm}. Fabricated into resonators, these films exhibit a sheet kinetic inductance $L_{k, \square}$ of 394~$\textrm{pH}/\square$, as inferred from resonant frequency measurements. %from this film and measure quality factors of $4\times 10^{4}$; these quality factors are likely limited by the low resistivity wafer. X-ray diffraction analysis confirms the formation of stoichiometric TiN, with no residual unreacted titanium. The films also demonstrate a characteristic sheet resistivity of 475~$\Omega/\square$, yielding an impedance an order of magnitude higher than conventional 50~$\Omega$ resonators. This property could enhance microwave single\textendash photon coupling strength by an order of magnitude, offering transformative potential for hybrid quantum systems and quantum sensing. Furthermore, the high $L_{k}$ enables Kerr nonlinearities comparable to state\textendash of\textendash the\textendash art quantum devices. Combined with its relatively high $T_{c}$, this thin film presents a promising platform for superconducting devices, including amplifiers and qubits operating at higher temperatures.</description>

      <title>Characterization of superconducting germanide and germanosilicide films of Pd, Pt, Rh and Ir formed by solid-phase epitaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Facilitated by recent advances in strained Ge/SiGe quantum well (QW) growth technology, superconductor-semiconductor hybrid devices based on group IV materials have been developed, potentially augmenting the functionality of quantum circuits. The formation of highly transparent superconducting platinum germanosilicide (PtSiGe) contacts to Ge/SiGe heterostructures by solid-phase epitaxy between Pt and SiGe has recently been reported, although with a relatively low critical temperature $&lt;1\,\mathrm{K}$. Here, we present a comparative study of the superconducting properties of Pt, Pd, Rh, and Ir germanides, along with an in-depth characterization of Ir(Si)Ge films formed by solid-phase epitaxy. For films fabricated under optimal epitaxy conditions, we report $T_\mathrm{c}=3.4\,\mathrm{K}$ ($2.6\,\mathrm{K}$ for IrGe (IrSiGe). High-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (HRSTEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) reveal that Ir reacts with Ge substrates to form a polycrystalline IrGe layer with a sharp IrGe/Ge interface.</description>

      <title>A model for intertwined orders in cuprates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We model the intertwined orders in the cuprate pseudogap as a textured antiferromagnet (AFM), where the texture arises from confining competing phases on topological defects, i.e., arrays of AFM domain walls. Three branches of texture are found, which can be interpreted as a strongly frustrated remnant of an underlying eutectoid phase diagram. This model can describe many key features of intertwined orders in cuprates, including the trisected superconducting dome, and provides clear evidence for a doping/hopping-parameter-dependent Mott-Slater transition in cuprates.</description>

      <title>Phase Transition Dynamics Induced by Strong Radio-Frequency Fields in ReBCO High Temperature Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Probing the dynamics of superconductor phase transitions induced by strong electromagnetic fields is vital to designing high power devices leveraging these materials. The development of high temperature superconductors (HTS) is particularly interesting due to critical temperatures ($T_c$) approaching 90 K, the ability to support high current densities, and their ability to operate in strong static magnetic fields. This work aims to determine the transition dynamics of these materials at radio-frequencies (rf) in the microwave range where they have enormous potential for new applications ranging from particle accelerators to dark matter searches. We have tested two types of coatings formed from rare earth barium copper oxide (REBCO): a film deposited by electron-beam physical vapor deposition, and HTS conductor tapes soldered to a copper substrate with exposed REBCO surfaces. Testing was performed via a hemispherical transverse-electric mode cavity that maximizes the surface rf magnetic field and minimizes the surface electric field on a 2-inch diameter sample. We report on steady-state measurements at low rf power, as well as fully time-resolved transition dynamics on the microsecond timescale seen for the first time with strong surface rf fields.</description>

      <title>Comment on `High-resolution Measurements of Thermal Conductivity Matrix and Search for Thermal Hall Effect in La$_2$CuO$_4$'</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, Jiayi Hu and co-workers reported that they did not resolve any thermal Hall signal in La$_2$CuO$_4$ by `high resolution' measurements, setting an upper bound of $|\kappa_{xy}| &lt;2\times 10^{-3}~$Wm$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$ at 20 K. Two points have apparently escaped their attention. First, thermal Hall signals with an amplitude well below this resolution bound have been detected in disordered perovskites. Second, the longitudinal thermal conductivity of their sample is significantly lower than the La$_2$CuO$_4$ sample displaying a thermal Hall signal. We find that a moderate reduction of $\kappa_{xx}$ in SrTiO$_3$ is concomitant with a drastic attenuation of $\kappa_{xy}$. A trend emerges across several families of insulators: the amplitude of $\kappa_{xy}$ anti-correlates with disorder.</description>

      <title>Field-free transverse Josephson diode effect in altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that altermagnets (AMs) with Rashba spin--orbit coupling can host a transverse Josephson diode effect (TJDE) without any external magnetic field. AMs combine zero net magnetization with spin-polarized Fermi surfaces, enabling the simultaneous breaking of inversion and time-reversal symmetries. We propose a four-terminal Josephson junction where a longitudinal phase bias between opposite superconducting terminals generates transverse supercurrents in the unbiased terminals. These transverse currents exhibit both a diode-like nonreciprocity and a finite anomalous phase offset, revealing a transverse anomalous Josephson effect (AJE). For certain parameter regimes, the transverse current becomes unidirectional, and the TJDE efficiency can exceed 1000\%, demonstrating exceptionally strong diode behavior. Remarkably, the magnitude and direction of the TJDE and transverse AJE are tunable by rotating the N\'eel vector. Our results establish altermagnets as a versatile platform for engineering field-free nonreciprocal superconducting transport in multiterminal devices.</description>

      <title>Helical Superconductors with Multiple Majorana Kramers Pairs in Rashba Bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02008v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The momentum dependence of Rashba spin-orbit coupling (RSOC) is a key ingredient for engineering topological superconductors (TSCs), but research has largely focused on the linear-in-momentum form. This focus has restricted time-reversal invariant TSCs to helical $p$-wave states with only a single Majorana Kramers pair, whose existence is tied to the criterion of an odd number of Fermi surfaces (FSs). In this Letter, we demonstrate that a bilayer system with pure cubic RSOC and intrinsic odd-parity pairing on a single FS yields a rare 2D helical $f$-wave TSC. This state is characterized by a large mirror Chern number (MCN) of ${\cal N}_{\text{M}}=3$ and hosts three Kramers pairs of Majorana edge modes. Remarkably, the interplay of linear and cubic RSOCs in this bilayer can generate a helical hybrid $p+f$-wave TSC with an even larger MCN of ${\cal N}_{\text{M}}=4$ from a normal state with two FSs, thereby circumventing the conventional odd-FS criterion. Our work establishes higher-order RSOC as a powerful design principle for realizing TSCs with multiple Majorana Kramers channels, fundamentally reshapes the helical hybrid for helical TSCs, and holds immediate relevance for tunable platforms like oxide heterostructures.</description>

Abstract: The discovery of superconducting states in multilayer rhombohedral graphene with spin and valley polarization has raised an interesting question: how does superconductivity cope with time-reversal symmetry breaking? In this work, using Ginzburg-Landau theory and microscopic calculation, we predict the existence of a new superconducting state at low electron density, which exhibits a spontaneously formed lattice of vortices and antivortices hosting Majorana zero-modes in their cores. We further identify this vortex-antivortex lattice (VAL) state in the experimental phase diagram and describe its experimental manifestations.</description>

      <title>Engineering subgap states in superconductors by altermagnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03364v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the realization and control of subgap states by tailored altermagnetic fields on unconventional superconductors. When the symmetries of altermagnetism and unconventional superconductivity align, we demonstrate the emergence of bulk zero-energy flat bands, giving rise to a zero-bias conductance peak. The symmetry and strength of $d$- and $g$-wave altermagnets strongly affect the surface Andreev states from $d$-wave and chiral $d$- and $p$-wave superconductors. As a result, distinct types of subgap states are realized, including curved and flat bands, that can be detected by tunneling spectroscopy. Furthermore, we find that the altermagnetism-induced subgap states give rise to a large spin conductance at zero net magnetization which helps identify the strength of the underlying altermagnetism and superconductivity. Our results offer a solid route for designing and manipulating subgap states in superconducting systems, which can be useful for functionalizing superconducting spintronic devices.</description>
