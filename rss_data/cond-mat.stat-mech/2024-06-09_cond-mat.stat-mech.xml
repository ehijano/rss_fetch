      <title>Out-of-equilibrium Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how out-of-equilibrium states thermalize under quantum unitary dynamics is an important problem in many-body physics. In this work, we propose a statistical ansatz for the matrix elements of non-equilibrium initial states in the energy eigenbasis. The approach is inspired by the Eigenstate Thermalisation Hypothesis (ETH) but the proposed ansatz exhibits different scaling. Importantly, exponentially small cross-correlations between the observable and the initial state matrix elements determine relaxation dynamics toward equilibrium. We numerically verify scaling and cross-correlation, point out the emergent universality of the high-frequency behavior, and outline possible generalizations.</description>

      <title>Long-term memory induced correction to Arrhenius law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kramers escape problem is a paradigmatic model for the kinetics of rare events, which are usually characterized by Arrhenius law. So far, analytical approaches have failed to capture the kinetics of rare events in the important case of non-Markovian processes with long-term memory, as occurs in the context of reactions involving proteins, long polymers, or strongly viscoelastic fluids. Here, based on a minimal model of non-Markovian Gaussian process with long-term memory, we determine quantitatively the mean FPT to a rare configuration and provide its asymptotics in the limit of a large energy barrier $E$. Our analysis unveils a correction to Arrhenius law, induced by long-term memory, which we determine analytically. This correction, which we show can be quantitatively significant, takes the form of a second effective energy barrier $E'&lt;E$ and captures the dependence of rare event kinetics on initial conditions, which is a hallmark of long-term memory. Altogether, our results quantify the impact of long-term memory on rare event kinetics, beyond Arrhenius law.</description>

      <title>Unraveling-induced entanglement phase transition in diffusive trajectories of continuously monitored noninteracting fermionic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The competition between unitary quantum dynamics and dissipative stochastic effects, as emerging from continuous-monitoring processes, can culminate in measurement-induced phase transitions. Here, a many-body system abruptly passes, when exceeding a critical measurement rate, from a highly entangled phase to a low-entanglement one. We consider a different perspective on entanglement phase transitions and explore whether these can emerge when the measurement process itself is modified, while keeping the measurement rate fixed. To illustrate this idea, we consider a noninteracting fermionic system and focus on diffusive detection processes. Through extensive numerical simulations, we show that, upon varying a suitable \textit{unraveling parameter} -- interpolating between measurements of different quadrature operators -- the system displays a transition from a phase with area-law entanglement to one where entanglement scales logarithmically with the system size. Our findings may be relevant for tailoring quantum correlations in noisy quantum devices and for conceiving optimal classical simulation strategies.</description>

      <title>Fast Brownian cluster dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an efficient method to perform overdamped Brownian dynamics simulations in external force fields and for particle interactions that include a hardcore part. The method applies to particle motion in one dimension, where it is possible to update particle positions by repositioning particle clusters as a whole. These clusters consist of several particles in contact. They form because particle collisions are treated as completely inelastic rather than elastic ones. Updating of cluster positions in time steps is carried out by cluster fragmentation and merging procedures. The presented method is particularly powerful at high collision rates in densely crowded systems, where collective movements of particle assemblies is governing the dynamics. As an application, we simulate the single-file diffusion of sticky hard spheres in a periodic potential.</description>

      <title>Dynamical correlation functions in the Ising field theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study finite temperature dynamical correlation functions of the magnetization operator in the one-dimensional Ising quantum field theory. Our approach is based on a finite temperature form factor series and on a Fredholm determinant representation of the correlators. While for space-like separations the Fredholm determinant can be efficiently evaluated numerically, for the time-like region it has convergence issues inherited from the form factor series. We develop a method to compute the correlation functions at time-like separations based on the analytic continuation of the space-time coordinates to complex values. Using this numerical technique, we explore all space-time and temperature regimes in both the ordered and disordered phases including short, large, and near-light-cone separations at low and high temperatures. We confirm the existing analytic predictions for the asymptotic behavior of the correlations except in the case of space-like correlations in the paramagnetic phase. For this case we derive a new closed form expression for the correlation length that has some unusual properties: it is a non-analytic function of both the space-time direction and the temperature, and its temperature dependence is non-monotonic.</description>

      <title>Defects induce phase transition from dynamic to static rippling in graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many of graphene's remarkable properties are intrinsically linked to its inherent ripples. Defects, whether naturally present or artificially introduced, are known to have a strong impact on the rippling of graphene. However, how defects alter ripple dynamics in two-dimensional (2D) materials in general, and graphene in particular, remains largely unexplored. Here, using machine learning-driven molecular dynamics simulations, we reveal a fundamental connection between defect concentration and ripple dynamics in freestanding graphene sheets. Specifically, we find that at a critical concentration of approximately 0.1%, dynamic rippling undergoes a transition from freely propagating to static ripples. This is in quantitative alignment with the experimentally observed turning point in the non-monotonic scaling of the Young's modulus and emphasises the critical interplay between defects and material dynamics. Our work not only unveils the significant impact of defects on rippling dynamics in graphene but also paves the way to design two-dimensional devices with tailored properties.</description>

      <title>Effects of nonlinearity on Anderson localization of surface gravity waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anderson localization is a multiple-scattering phenomenon of linear waves propagating within a disordered medium. Discovered in the late 50s for electrons, it has since been observed experimentally with cold atoms and with classical waves (optics, microwaves, and acoustics), but whether wave localization is enhanced or weakened for nonlinear waves is a long-standing debate. Here, we show that the nonlinearity strengthens the localization of surface-gravity waves propagating in a canal with a random bottom. We also show experimentally how the localization length depends on the nonlinearity, which has never been reported previously with any type of wave. To do so, we use a full space-and-time-resolved wavefield measurement as well as numerical simulations. The effects of the disorder level and the system's finite size on localization are also reported. We also highlight the first experimental evidence of the macroscopic analog of Bloch's dispersion relation of linear hydrodynamic surface waves over periodic bathymetry.</description>

      <title>Operator entanglement growth quantifies complexity of cellular automata</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cellular automata (CA) exemplify systems where simple local interaction rules can lead to intricate and complex emergent phenomena at large scales. The various types of dynamical behavior of CA are usually categorized empirically into Wolfram's complexity classes. Here, we propose a quantitative measure, rooted in quantum information theory, to categorize the complexity of classical deterministic cellular automata. Specifically, we construct a Matrix Product Operator (MPO) of the transition matrix on the space of all possible CA configurations. We find that the growth of entropy of the singular value spectrum of the MPO reveals the complexity of the CA and can be used to characterize its dynamical behavior. This measure defines the concept of operator entanglement entropy for CA, demonstrating that quantum information measures can be meaningfully applied to classical deterministic systems.</description>

      <title>Freezing, melting and the onset of glassiness in binary mixtures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We clarify the relationship between freezing, melting and the onset of glassy dynamics in the prototypical glass-forming Kob-Andersen mixture. Our starting point is a precise definition of the onset of glassiness, as expressed by the emergence of an inflection in the time-dependent correlation functions. By scanning the temperature-composition phase diagram of the model, we find that the onset temperature barely varies with concentration, unlike the freezing temperature, which shows a marked drop at the eutectic point. We observe, however, a surprising correspondence between the onset of glassiness and the solidus line, along which the underlying crystalline phases melt. At fixed concentration, the freezing and onset temperatures display similar pressure dependencies, which are very well predicted by the isomorph theory and are encoded in the variation of the excess entropy. While our results rule out a general connection between thermodynamic metastability and glassiness, they call for a careful assessment of the role of crystalline precursors in glass-forming liquids.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian formulation and aspects of integrability of generalised hydrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generalised Hydrodynamics (GHD) describes the large-scale inhomogeneous dynamics of integrable (or close to integrable) systems in one dimension of space, based on a central equation for the fluid density or quasi-particle density: the GHD equation. We consider a new, general form of the GHD equation: we allow for spatially extended interaction kernels, generalising previous constructions. We show that the GHD equation, in our general form and hence also in its conventional form, is Hamiltonian. This holds also including force terms representing inhomogeneous external potentials coupled to conserved densities. To this end, we introduce a new Poisson bracket on functionals of the fluid density, which is seen as our dynamical field variable. The total energy is the Hamiltonian whose flow under this Poisson bracket generates the GHD equation. The fluid density depends on two (real and spectral) variables so the GHD equation can be seen as a $2+1$-dimensional classical field theory. We further show the system admits an infinite set of conserved quantities that are in involution for our Poisson bracket, hinting at integrability of this field theory.</description>

      <title>Higher-order modeling of face-to-face interactions</title>

Abstract: The most fundamental social interactions among humans occur face to face. Their features have been extensively studied in recent years, owing to the availability of high-resolution data on individuals' proximity. Mathematical models based on mobile agents have been crucial to understand the spatio-temporal organization of face-to-face interactions. However, these models focus on dyadic relationships only, failing to characterize interactions in larger groups of individuals. Here, we propose a model in which agents interact with each other by forming groups of different sizes. Each group has a degree of social attractiveness, based on which neighboring agents decide whether to join. Our framework reproduces different properties of groups in face-to-face interactions, including their distribution, the correlation in their number, and their persistence in time, which cannot be replicated by dyadic models. Furthermore, it captures homophilic patterns at the level of higher-order interactions, going beyond standard pairwise approaches. Our work sheds light on the higher-order mechanisms at the heart of human face-to-face interactions, paving the way for further investigation of how group dynamics at a microscopic scale affects social phenomena at a macroscopic scale.</description>

Abstract: Generic open quantum systems are notoriously difficult to simulate unless one looks at specific regimes. In contrast, classical dissipative systems can often be effectively described by stochastic processes, which are generally less computationally expensive. Here, we use the paradigmatic case of a dissipative quantum oscillator to give a pedagogic introduction into the modelling of open quantum systems using quasiclassical methods, i.e. classical stochastic methods that use a 'quantum' noise spectrum to capture the influence of the environment on the system. Such quasiclassical methods have the potential to offer insights into the impact of the quantum nature of the environment on the dynamics of the system of interest whilst still being computationally tractable.</description>

      <title>Instability in the quantum restart problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.06100v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Repeatedly-monitored quantum walks with a rate $1/\tau$ yield discrete-time trajectories which are inherently random. With these paths the first-hitting time with sharp restart is studied. We find an instability in the optimal mean hitting time, which is not found in the corresponding classical random walk process. This instability implies that a small change in parameters can lead to a rather large change of the optimal restart time. We show that the optimal restart time versus $\tau$, as a control parameter, exhibits sets of staircases and plunges. The plunges, are due to the mentioned instability, which in turn is related to the quantum oscillations of the first-hitting time probability, in the absence of restarts. Furthermore, we prove that there are only two patterns of staircase structures, dependent on the parity of the distance between the target and the source in units of lattice constant. The global minimum of the hitting time, is controlled not only by the restart time, as in classical problems, but also by the sampling time $\tau$. We provide numerical evidence that this global minimum occurs for the $\tau$ minimizing the mean hitting time, given restarts taking place after each measurement. Last but not least, we numerically show that the instability found in this work is relatively robust against stochastic perturbations in the sampling time $\tau$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17469v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transport processes in crowded periodic structures are often mediated by cooperative movements of particles forming clusters. Recent theoretical and experimental studies of driven Brownian motion of hard spheres showed that cluster-mediated transport in one-dimensional periodic potentials can proceed in form of solitary waves. We here give a comprehensive description of these solitons. Fundamental for our analysis is a static presoliton state, which is formed by a periodic arrangement of basic stable clusters. Their size follows from a geometric principle of minimum free space. Adding one particle to the presoliton state gives rise to solitons. We derive the minimal number of particles needed for soliton formation, number of solitons at larger particle numbers, soliton velocities and soliton-mediated particle currents. Incomplete relaxations of the basic clusters are responsible for an effective repulsive soliton-soliton interaction seen in measurements. A dynamical phase transition is predicted to occur in current-density relations at low temperatures. Our results provide a theoretical basis for describing experiments on cluster-mediated particle transport in periodic potentials.</description>

      <title>Lindblad dynamics from spatio-temporal correlation functions in nonintegrable spin-1/2 chains with different boundary conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18177v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the Lindblad equation in the context of boundary-driven magnetization transport in spin-$1/2$ chains. Our central question is whether the nonequilibrium steady state of the open system, including its buildup in time, can be described on the basis of the dynamics in the closed system. To this end, we rely on a previous work [Phys. Rev. B 108, L201119 (2023)], where a description in terms of spatio-temporal correlation functions has been suggested in the case of weak driving and small system-bath coupling. Because this work has focused on integrable systems and periodic boundary conditions, we here extend the analysis in three directions: We (i) consider nonintegrable systems, (ii) take into account open boundary conditions and other bath-coupling geometries, and (iii) provide a comparison to time-evolving block decimation. While we find that nonintegrability plays a minor role, the choice of the specific boundary conditions can be crucial, due to potentially nondecaying edge modes. Our large-scale numerical simulations suggest that a description based on closed-system correlation functions is an useful alternative to already existing state-of-the-art approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.13544v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is a current interest in quantum thermodynamics in the context of open quantum systems. An important issue is the consistency of quantum thermodynamics, in particular the second law of thermodynamics, i.e., the flow of heat from a hot reservoir to a cold reservoir. Here recent emphasis has been on composite system and in particular the issue regarding the application of local or global master equations. In order to contribute to this discussion we discuss two cases, namely as an example a single qubit and as a simple composite system two coupled qubits driven by two heat reservoirs at different temperatures, respectively. Applying a global Lindblad master equation approach we present explicit expressions for the heat currents in agreement with the second law of thermodynamics. The analysis is carried out in the Born-Markov approximation. We also discuss issues regarding the possible presence of coherences in the steady state.</description>

      <title>Matrix product state approximations to quantum states of low energy variance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.05200v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show how to efficiently simulate pure quantum states in one dimensional systems that have both finite energy density and vanishingly small energy fluctuations. We do so by studying the performance of a tensor network algorithm that produces matrix product states whose energy variance decreases as the bond dimension increases. Our results imply that variances as small as $\propto 1/\log N$ can be achieved with polynomial bond dimension. With this, we prove that there exist states with a very narrow support in the bulk of the spectrum that still have moderate entanglement entropy, in contrast with typical eigenstates that display a volume law. Our main technical tool is the Berry-Esseen theorem for spin systems, a strengthening of the central limit theorem for the energy distribution of product states. We also give a simpler proof of that theorem, together with slight improvements in the error scaling, which should be of independent interest.</description>

Abstract: A quantum-enhanced experiment, in which information is transduced from a system of interest and processed on a quantum computer, has the possibility of exponential advantage in sampling tasks over a traditional experiment, where only the measurement outcomes of projective or weak measurements are stored on a classical computer. In this work, we demonstrate that, similar to the measurement induced phase transition~(MIPT) occurring in traditional experiments, quantum-enhanced experiments can also show entanglement phase transitions. We introduce a noisy transduction operation which replaces projective measurements and acts independently on two qubits, recording the quantum state of one qubit in the measurement apparatus, while erasing the quantum state of the other qubit with the environment. We then construct a random brickwork circuit which shows an entanglement transition tuned by the rate of noisy transduction operations. Below the critical rate of noisy transduction, an extensive amount of entanglement is generated between regions of the system and apparatus, while above the critical rate, entanglement satisfies area law scaling. Our work delineates the prerequisites for quantum-enhanced experiments to manifest entanglement transitions, thereby establishing a foundational framework that connects quantum-enhanced sensing with emergent entanglement phenomena.</description>

      <title>Quantum-to-classical crossover in the spin glass dynamics of cavity QED simulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05682v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By solving the quench dynamics of a frustrated many-body spin-boson problem, we investigate the role of spin size on the dynamical formation of spin glass order. In particular, we observe that quantum and classical spin glasses exhibit markedly different evolution. The former displays a quick relaxation of magnetization together with an exponential dependence of the spin glass order parameter on spin size, while the latter has long-lasting prethermal magnetization and a spin glass order parameter independent of spin size. The quantum-to-classical crossover is sharp and occurs for relatively small spins, highlighting the fragility of the quantum regime. Furthermore, we show that spin glass order is resonantly enhanced when the frequency of the bosonic mediators of the interactions approaches the value of the transverse field. Our predictions are relevant for all spin glass systems with $SU(2)$ degrees of freedom away from equilibrium, and can be examined in recently developed multi-mode cavity QED experiments.</description>

      <title>W-kernel and essential subspace for frequentist evaluation of Bayesian estimators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13017v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The posterior covariance matrix W defined by the log-likelihood of each observation plays important roles both in the sensitivity analysis and frequentist evaluation of the Bayesian estimators. This study is focused on the matrix W and its principal space; we term the latter as an essential subspace. Projections to the essential subspace realize dimensional reduction in the sensitivity analysis and frequentist evaluation. A key tool for treating frequentist properties is the recently proposed Bayesian infinitesimal jackknife approximation(Giordano and Broderick (2023)). The matrix W can be interpreted as a reproducing kernel and is denoted as W-kernel. Using W-kernel, the essential subspace is expressed as a principal space given by the kernel principal component analysis. A relation to the Fisher kernel and neural tangent kernel is established, which elucidates the connection to the classical asymptotic theory. We also discuss a type of Bayesian-frequentist duality, naturally appeared from the kernel framework. Two applications are discussed: the selection of a representative set of observations and dimensional reduction in the approximate bootstrap. In the former, incomplete Cholesky decomposition is introduced as an efficient method for computing the essential subspace. In the latter, different implementations of the approximate bootstrap for posterior means are compared.</description>

      <title>Far from equilibrium field theory for strongly coupled light and matter: dynamics of frustrated multi-mode cavity QED</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11624v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Light-matter interfaces have now entered a new stage marked by the ability to engineer quantum correlated states under driven-dissipative conditions. To propel this new generation of experiments, we are confronted with the need to model non-unitary many-body dynamics in strongly coupled regimes, by transcending traditional approaches in quantum optics. In this work, we contribute to this program by adapting a functional integral technique, conventionally employed in high-energy physics, in order to obtain non-equilibrium dynamics for interacting light-matter systems. Our approach is grounded in constructing 'two-particle irreducible' (2PI) effective actions, which provide a non-perturbative and conserving framework for describing quantum evolution at a polynomial cost in time. We apply our method to complement the analysis of spin glass formation in the context of frustrated multi-mode cavity quantum electrodynamics, initiated in our accompanying work [H. Hosseinabadi, D. Chang, J. Marino, arXiv:2311.05682]. Finally, we outline the capability of the technique to describe other near-term platforms in many-body quantum optics, and its potential to make predictions for this new class of experiments.</description>

      <title>An optimization-based equilibrium measure describes non-equilibrium steady state dynamics: application to edge of chaos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10009v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding neural dynamics is a central topic in machine learning, non-linear physics and neuroscience. However, the dynamics is non-linear, stochastic and particularly non-gradient, i.e., the driving force can not be written as gradient of a potential. These features make analytic studies very challenging. The common tool is the path integral approach or dynamical mean-field theory, but the drawback is that one has to solve the integro-differential or dynamical mean-field equations, which is computationally expensive and has no closed form solutions in general. From the aspect of associated Fokker-Planck equation, the steady state solution is generally unknown. Here, we treat searching for the steady states as an optimization problem, and construct an approximate potential related to the speed of the dynamics, and find that searching for the ground state of this potential is equivalent to running an approximate stochastic gradient dynamics or Langevin dynamics. Only in the zero temperature limit, the distribution of the original steady states can be achieved. The resultant stationary state of the dynamics follows exactly the canonical Boltzmann measure. Within this framework, the quenched disorder intrinsic in the neural networks can be averaged out by applying the replica method, which leads naturally to order parameters for the non-equilibrium steady states. Our theory reproduces the well-known result of edge-of-chaos, and further the order parameters characterizing the continuous transition are derived, and the order parameters are explained as fluctuations and responses of the steady states. Our method thus opens the door to analytically study the steady state landscape of the deterministic or stochastic high dimensional dynamics.</description>

      <title>Decoherence rate in random Lindblad dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04705v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Open quantum systems undergo decoherence, which is responsible for the transition from quantum to classical behavior. The time scale in which decoherence takes place can be analyzed using upper limits to its rate. We examine the dynamics of open chaotic quantum systems governed by random Lindblad operators sourced from Gaussian and Ginibre ensembles with Wigner-Dyson symmetry classes. In these systems, the ensemble-averaged purity decays monotonically as a function of time. This decay is governed by the decoherence rate, which is upper-bounded by the dimension of their Hilbert space and is independent of the ensemble symmetry. These findings hold upon mixing different ensembles, indicating the universal character of the decoherence rate limit. Moreover, our findings reveal that open chaotic quantum systems governed by random Lindbladians tend to exhibit the most rapid decoherence, regardless of the initial state. This phenomenon is associated with the concentration of the decoherence rate near its upper bound. Our work identifies primary features of decoherence in dissipative quantum chaos, with applications ranging from quantum foundations to high-energy physics and quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Krylov complexity of density matrix operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09522v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantifying complexity in quantum systems has witnessed a surge of interest in recent years, with Krylov-based measures such as Krylov complexity ($C_K$) and Spread complexity ($C_S$) gaining prominence. In this study, we investigate their interplay by considering the complexity of states represented by density matrix operators. After setting up the problem, we analyze a handful of analytical and numerical examples spanning generic two-dimensional Hilbert spaces, qubit states, quantum harmonic oscillators, and random matrix theories, uncovering insightful relationships. For generic pure states, our analysis reveals two key findings: (I) a correspondence between moment-generating functions (of Lanczos coefficients) and survival amplitudes, and (II) an early-time equivalence between $C_K$ and $2C_S$. Furthermore, for maximally entangled pure states, we find that the moment-generating function of $C_K$ becomes the Spectral Form Factor and, at late-times, $C_K$ is simply related to $NC_S$ for $N\geq2$ within the $N$-dimensional Hilbert space. Notably, we confirm that $C_K = 2C_S$ holds across all times when $N=2$. Through the lens of random matrix theories, we also discuss deviations between complexities at intermediate times and highlight subtleties in the averaging approach at the level of the survival amplitude.</description>

      <title>Generalizing measurement-induced phase transitions to information exchange symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13271v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we investigate the conditions for quantum back action to result in a phase transition in the information dynamics of a monitored system. We introduce a framework that captures a wide range of experiments encompassing probes comprised of projective measurements and probes which more generally transfer quantum information from the system to a quantum computer. Our framework explicitly uses a model of unitary evolution which couples system, apparatus and environment. Information dynamics is investigated using the R\'enyi and von-Neumann entropies of the evolving state, and we construct a replica theory for them. We identify the possible replica symmetries an experiment can possess and discuss their spontaneous symmetry breaking. In particular, we identify a minimum subgroup whose spontaneous symmetry breaking results in an entanglement transition. This symmetry is only possible when the information in the apparatus is as informative about the dynamics of the system as the information transferred to the environment. We call this requirement the information exchange symmetry and quantify it by a relationship between the entropies. We then show how the entanglement transition can be understood as the spontaneously breaking of the information exchange symmetry and without referring to the replica theory. Information exchange symmetry breaking is then shown to generalize the phenomenology of the measurement-induced phase transition (MIPT). We apply this theory to the brickwork quantum-enhanced experiment introduced in an accompanying Letter [1] in the case where the unitaries are chosen from the Haar measure, and identify a distinct universality from the MIPT. This notion of information exchange symmetry breaking generalizes the MIPT, and provides a framework for understanding the dynamics of quantum information in quantum-enhanced experiments.</description>

      <title>Superadiabatic dynamical density functional theory for colloidal suspensions under homogeneous steady-shear</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16599v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The superadiabatic dynamical density functional theory (superadiabatic-DDFT) is a promising new method for the study of colloidal systems out-of-equilibrium. Within this approach the viscous forces arising from interparticle interactions are accounted for in a natural way by treating explicitly the dynamics of the two-body correlations. For bulk systems subject to spatially homogeneous shear we use the superadiabatic-DDFT framework to calculate the steady-state pair distribution function and the corresponding viscosity for low values of the shear-rate. We then consider a variant of the central approximation underlying this superadiabatic theory and obtain an inhomogeneous generalization of a rheological bulk theory due to Russel and Gast. This paper thus establishes for the first time a connection between DDFT approaches, formulated to treat inhomogeneous systems, and existing work addressing nonequilibrium microstructure and rheology in bulk colloidal suspensions.</description>
