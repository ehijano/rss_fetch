      <title>Turbulent mesoscale convection in the Boussinesq limit and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mesoscale convection covers an intermediate scale range between small-scale turbulence and the global organization of the convection flow. It is often characterized by an order of the convection patterns despite very high Rayleigh numbers and strong turbulent fluctuations. In this review, we discuss several aspects of mesoscale convection, which have been investigated by three-dimensional direct numerical simulations. The numerical studies are performed in a characteristic configuration of a plane layer that is heated from below and cooled from above or subject to constant heat flux at the top and bottom boundaries. We discuss the role of the thermal and mechanical boundary conditions for structure formation and study the impact of the domain shape as well as the Prandtl number. With respect to the latter, we focus on low values that arise in astrophysical convection and are partly not anymore accessible in laboratory experiments with liquid metals. Beside these experiments in the Boussinesq approximation, we report studies of non-Boussinesq mesoscale convection. This is done by investigating effects of compressibility and temperature dependence of material properties. The kinetic energy dissipation rate turns out to remain a central quantity for the turbulent mixing in compressible convection. Their different components, statistics, relation to the turbulent viscosity, and the multifractal properties are discussed.</description>

      <title>Transport by waves and turbulence: Dilute suspensions in stably stratified plane Poiseuille flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the transport dynamics of negatively buoyant passive sediment in a thermally stratified plane Poiseuille flow using numerical simulation, exploring the influence of large-scale coherent structures on sediment transport processes. Sediment concentration fields are passively solved with settling velocities of $V_s = 0.005$, $V_s = 0.01$ and $V_s = 0.02$, made dimensionless by the friction velocity. Strong buoyancy forces in the core have a profound impact on sediment transport, leading to two-layer sediment concentration profiles with concentration gradients increasing with sediment settling velocity, $V_s$. When compared to unstratified flow, stratification leads to considerably larger differences in concentration profiles and higher order statistics between the three different sediments. When scalar statistics are appropriately scaled by either $\theta_\tau$ for temperature or $V_s \overline{c}$ for sediment, where $\theta_\tau$ is the thermal shear temperature and $\overline{c}$ is the vertically varying mean sediment concentration, scalar statistics collapse to near common vertical profiles. Collapse is explained by revisiting the gradient diffusion hypothesis, which links scalar fluxes to respective mean gradients. However, collapse of scalars is poor in the channel core where large concentration gradients coincide with large-scale mixing events. Here the differences between vertical turbulent diffusivities of sediment and temperature increase with increasing $V_s$, reaching 20% for $V_s = 0.02$. Discrepancies arise due to a breakdown of the linear gradient diffusion hypothesis. Predictions using the gradient diffusion hypothesis are expected to worsen with increasing settling velocity, indicating that classical models poorly predict dilute particle transport in strongly stratified flows, which are common in a range of environmental and industrial settings.</description>

      <title>Wave induced fracture of a sea ice analog</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study at the laboratory scale the rupture of thin floating sheets made of a brittle material under wave induced mechanical forcing. We show that the rupture occurs where the curvature is maximum, and the break up threshold strongly depends on the wave properties. We observe that the corresponding critical stress for fracture depends on the forcing wavelength: our observations are thus incompatible with a critical stress criteria for fracture. Our measurements can rather be rationalized using a energy criteria: a fracture propagates when the material surface energy is lower than the released elastic energy, which depends on the forcing geometry. Our results suggest that current models of sea ice fracture by ocean waves could be refined.</description>

      <title>Using Diffusion Models for Reducing Spatiotemporal Errors of Deep Learning Based Urban Microclimate Predictions at Post-Processing Stage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is a powerful tool for modeling turbulent flow and is commonly used for urban microclimate simulations. However, traditional CFD methods are computationally intensive, requiring substantial hardware resources for high-fidelity simulations. Deep learning (DL) models are becoming popular as efficient alternatives as they require less computational resources to model complex non-linear interactions in fluid flow simulations. A major drawback of DL models is that they are prone to error accumulation in long-term temporal predictions, often compromising their accuracy and reliability. To address this shortcoming, this study investigates the use of a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) as a novel post-processing technique to mitigate error propagation in DL models' sequential predictions. To address this, we employ convolutional autoencoder (CAE) and U-Net architectures to predict airflow dynamics around a cubic structure. The DDPM is then applied to the models' predictions, refining the reconstructed flow fields to better align with high-fidelity statistical results obtained from large-eddy simulations. Results demonstrate that, although deep learning models provide significant computational advantages over traditional numerical solvers, they are susceptible to error accumulation in sequential predictions; however, utilizing DDPM as a post-processing step enhances the accuracy of DL models by up to 65% while maintaining a 3 times speedup compared to traditional numerical solvers. These findings highlight the potential of integrating denoising diffusion probabilistic models as a transformative approach to improving the reliability and accuracy of deep learning-based urban microclimate simulations, paving the way for more efficient and scalable fluid dynamics modeling.</description>

      <title>Resonance of an object floating within a surface wavefield</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the interaction between floating cylindrical objects and surface waves in the gravity regime. Given that the impact of resonance phenomena associated with floating bodies, particularly at laboratory scales, remains underexplored, we focus on the influence of the floaters' resonance frequency on wave emission. We study the response of floating rigid cylinders to external mechanical perturbations. Using an optical reconstruction technique to measure wave fields, we study the natural resonance frequency of the floaters in geometry and their response to incoming waves. The results indicate that the resonance frequency is influenced by the interplay between the cylinder geometry and the solid-to-fluid density ratio. Experiments with incoming waves demonstrate that floaters diffract waves, creating complex patterns of diffusion and retro-diffusion while radiating secondary waves that interfere with the incident wavefield. Minimal wave generation is observed at resonance frequencies. These findings provide insights for elucidating the behavior of larger structures, such as sea ice floes, in natural wave fields.</description>

      <title>Phase-field lattice Boltzmann method for two-phase electrohydrodynamic flows induced by Onsager-Wien effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The leaky dielectric model is widely used in simulating two-phase electrohydrodynamic (EHD) flows. One critical issue with this classical model is the assumption of Ohmic conduction, which makes it inadequate for describing the newly discovered EHD flows caused by the Onsager-Wien effect [Ryu et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 104, 104502 (2010)]. In this paper, we proposed a phase-field lattice Boltzmann (LB) method for two-phase electrohydrodynamic flows induced by the Onsager-Wien effect. In this scheme, two LB equations are employed to resolve the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations and the conservative Allen-Cahn equation, while another three LB equations are used for solving the charge conservation equations and the electric potential equation. After we validate the developed LB method, we perform a series of numerical simulations of droplet deformation under EHD conduction phenomena. Our numerical results indicate that the presence of the Onsager-Wien effect has a significant impact on droplet deformation and charge distribution. Also, it is interesting to note that, apart from the heterocharge layers near the electrodes, a charge cloud may form between the droplet interface and the electrode in some cases. To thoroughly understand the droplet dynamics, the effects of the reference length d, the applied voltage {\Delta}{\psi}, the permittivity ratio {\epsilon}r, and the ionic mobility ratio {\mu}r on droplet deformation and charge distribution are all investigated in detail.</description>

      <title>Three Simple Stokeslet Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exact results for three trajectories of small numbers of particles interacting hydrodynamically through Stokeslets are presented. First, the middle particle in a vertical trio of particles sediments at a constant velocity for all time. Second, a horizontal pair of particles sedimenting toward a rigid wall undergo a finite and surprisingly constant horizontal displacement in the limit of large initial separations. Third, a pair of particles sedimenting in a quadratic flow, such as that of a fluid pumped in the direction of gravity, oscillates in a periodic orbit and admits a Hamiltonian formulation.</description>

      <title>Lateral turbulent jet in rarefied environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lateral jets play a crucial role in controlling the trajectory and aerodynamic heating of hypersonic vehicles. However, the complex interaction between turbulent and rarefaction effects has rarely been examined. This study fills this knowledge gap by employing the newly developed GSIS-SST method [J. Fluid Mech. 1002 (2025) A10], which combines the shear stress transport (SST) model for turbulent flow and the general synthetic iterative scheme (GSIS) for rarefied gas flow. It is found that, at altitudes from 50 km to 80 km, the maximum relative difference in the pitch moment between the GSIS-SST and pure GSIS (SST) reaches 28% (20%). While the jet is supposed to reduce the surface heat flux, its turbulence significantly diminishes this reduction, e.g., the GSIS-SST predicts a heat flux about one order of magnitude higher than the GSIS when the jet pressure ratio is 1.5. Increasing the angle of attack intensifies local turbulence, resulting in expanded discrepancies in shear stress and heat flux between GSIS-SST and GSIS. These insights enhance our comprehension of lateral jet flows and highlight the importance of accounting for both turbulent and rarefaction effects in medium-altitude hypersonic flight.</description>

      <title>Experimental study of Su-Schrieffer-Heeger edge modes for water waves in linear and nonlinear regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper experimentally investigates topologically protected edge modes in a water wave channel through a direct geometric mapping to the one-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model. By designing a periodic channel with alternating widths, we replicate the key features of the SSH model, leading to the emergence of robust zero-energy sloshing edge modes localized at the boundaries. Experimental data show excellent agreement with theoretical predictions, supported by two-dimensional numerical simulations. In the nonlinear regime, two distinct bifurcations are observed, indicating the appearance of secondary resonances. This study highlights the relevance of the SSH model for water wave systems and provides an accessible method to explore topological edge states in classical wave systems.</description>

      <title>Heat transport model for the transition between scaling regimes in quasistatic and full magnetoconvection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In magnetoconvection, the flow is governed by the interplay between gravitational buoyancy and the Lorentz force, with one of these forces dominating in different regimes. In this paper, we develop a model with a single adjustable parameter that accurately captures the smooth transition from a buoyancy-dominated regime to one dominated by the Lorentz force. A perturbative extension of the model accounts for distinct transition features that occur at high Prandtl numbers. We validate the model for magnetoconvection in both the quasistatic regime and at finite magnetic Reynolds numbers using data from direct numerical simulations and existing experimental data sets. The model contains a natural extension to rotating convection and offers a potential generalisation to rotating magnetoconvection.</description>

      <title>Skin formation in evaporating colloidal droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When a droplet containing a concentrated suspension evaporates in a dry environment, a layer often forms at the interface accumulating non-volatile material. Such a "skin layer" experiences strong stresses and eventually turns mechanically unstable at the last stage of evaporation. Predicting the formation of such skin layer or particle shell and its properties is a crucial problem for applications and constitutes a multi-scale problem, from the micro/nanoscopic scale of the particles to the millimetric size of the droplets. Interestingly, its physical description lies at the interface between deterministic macroscopic evaporation models and microscopic stochastic particles interactions and diffusion. In this work we present a general theoretical approach to obtain the time-dependent particle concentration profile in an implicit manner, for the general case of diffusion-limited evaporation of spherical droplets, and more generally to all 1D non linear diffusion-limited cases with particles pressure and mobility terms of rational form. This approach is compared successfully to numerical solutions obtained using a finite element solver in the limit of high P\'eclet numbers, and to 2D Brownian dynamics simulations. Our results show that the concentration profiles and shell formation onset depend nontrivially on the initial packing fraction. By analyzing these profiles, we determine the position where the glassy layer forms, whose formation is expected to play a critical role in shell buckling. This model provides a robust framework for predicting the size and maximum aspect ratio of the resulting clusters.</description>

      <title>Measurement of surface tension coefficients of liquids based on equal thickness interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The surface tension coefficient is a key parameter in fluid mechanics. The conventional method to measure it is to determine the critical surface tension that causes the rupture of a liquid film. However, this method has a large error because the surface tension coefficient is very sensitive to environmental factors. In this paper, we propose a new method based on equal thickness interference to study the mathematical model of the stationary liquid surface shape and measure it by the interference technique. This method enables the accurate measurement of the liquid surface tension coefficient. The experimental results demonstrate that this method has the advantages of high accuracy, low cost, and simple instrumentation. The maximum measurement error is less than 3.1\%. Moreover, this method can be applied to measure the liquid-liquid interfacial tension, which has a good application prospect.</description>

      <title>Multiscale discrete Maxwell boundary condition for the discrete unified gas kinetic scheme for all Knudsen number flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a multiscale boundary condition for the discrete unified gas kinetic scheme (DUGKS) is developed for gas flows in all flow regimes. Based on the discrete Maxwell boundary condition (DMBC), this study addresses the limitations of the original DMBC used in DUGKS. Specifically, it is found that the DMBC produces spurious velocity slip and temperature jump, which are proportional to the mesh size and the momentum accommodation coefficient. The proposed multiscale DMBC is implemented by ensuring that the reflected original distribution function excludes collision effects. Theoretical analyses and numerous numerical tests show that the multiscale DMBC can achieve exactly the non-slip and non-jump conditions in the continuum limit and accurately captures non-equilibrium phenomena across a wide range of Knudsen numbers. The results demonstrate that the DUGKS with the multiscale DMBC can work properly for wall boundary conditions in all flow regimes with a fixed discretization in both space and time, without limitations on the thickness of the Knudsen layer and relaxation time.</description>

      <title>Modal Force Partitioning -- A Method for Determining the Aerodynamic Loads for Decomposed Flow Modes with Application to Aeroacoustic Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aerodynamic loads play a central role in many fluid dynamics applications, and we present a method for identifying the structures (or modes) in a flow that make dominant contributions to the time-varying aerodynamic loads in a flow. The method results from the combination of the force partitioning method (Menon and Mittal, J. Fluid Mech., 907:A37, 2021) and modal decomposition techniques such as Reynolds decomposition, triple decomposition, and proper orthogonal decomposition, and is applied here to three distinct flows - two-dimensional flows past a circular cylinder and an airfoil, and the three-dimensional flow over a revolving rectangular wing. We show that force partitioning applied to modal decomposition of velocity fields results in complex, and difficult to interpret inter-modal interactions. We therefore propose and apply modal decomposition directly to the $Q$-field associated with these flows. The variable $Q$ is a non-linear observable that is typically used to identify vortices in a flow, and we find that the direct decomposition of $Q$ leads to results that are more amenable to interpretation. We also demonstrate that this modal force partitioning can be extended to provide insights into the far-field aeroacoustic loading noise of these flows.</description>

Abstract: This work presents a hybrid pressure face-centred finite volume (FCFV) solver to simulate steady-state incompressible Navier-Stokes flows. The method leverages the robustness, in the incompressible limit, of the hybridisable discontinuous Galerkin paradigm for compressible and weakly compressible flows to derive the formulation of a novel, low-order face-based discretisation. The incompressibility constraint is enforced in a weak sense, by introducing an inter-cell mass flux defined in terms of a new, hybrid variable, representing the pressure at the cell faces. This results in a new hybridisation strategy where cell variables (velocity, pressure and deviatoric strain rate tensor) are expressed as a function of velocity and pressure at the barycentre of the cell faces. The hybrid pressure formulation provides first-order convergence of all variables, including the stress, independently of cell type, stretching and distortion. Numerical benchmarks of Navier-Stokes flows at low and moderate Reynolds numbers, in two and three dimensions, are presented to evaluate accuracy and robustness of the method. In particular, the hybrid pressure formulation outperforms the FCFV method when convective effects are relevant, achieving accurate predictions on significantly coarser meshes.</description>

      <title>Stability of a passive viscous droplet in a confined active nematic liquid crystal</title>

Abstract: The translation and shape deformations of a passive viscous Newtonian droplet immersed in an active nematic liquid crystal under circular confinement are analyzed using a linear stability analysis. We focus on the case of a sharply aligned active nematic in the limit of strong elastic relaxation in two dimensions. Using an active liquid crystal model, we employ the Lorentz reciprocal theorem for Stokes flow to study the growth of interfacial perturbations as a result of both active and elastic stresses. Instabilities are uncovered in both extensile and contractile systems, for which growth rates are calculated and presented in terms of the dimensionless ratios of active, elastic, and capillary stresses, as well as the viscosity ratio between the two fluids. We also extend our theory to analyze the inverse scenario, namely, the stability of an active nematic droplet surrounded by a passive viscous layer. Our results highlight the subtle interplay of capillary, active, elastic, and viscous stresses in governing droplet stability. The instabilities uncovered here may be relevant to a plethora of biological active systems, from the dynamics of passive droplets in bacterial suspensions to the organization of subcellular compartments inside the cell and cell nucleus.</description>

      <title>Vertical shear instabilities in rotating stellar radiation zones: effects of the full Coriolis acceleration and thermal diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rotation deeply impacts the structure and the evolution of stars. To build coherent 1D or multi-D stellar structure and evolution models, we must systematically evaluate the turbulent transport of momentum and matter induced by hydrodynamical instabilities of radial and latitudinal differential rotation in stably stratified thermally diffusive stellar radiation zones. In this work, we investigate vertical shear instabilities in these regions. The full Coriolis acceleration with the complete rotation vector at a general latitude is taken into account. We formulate the problem by considering a canonical shear flow with a hyperbolic-tangent profile. We perform linear stability analysis on this base flow using both numerical and asymptotic Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin-Jeffreys (WKBJ) methods. Two types of instabilities are identified and explored: inflectional instability, which occurs in the presence of an inflection point in shear flow, and inertial instability due to an imbalance between the centrifugal acceleration and pressure gradient. Both instabilities are promoted as thermal diffusion becomes stronger or stratification becomes weaker. Effects of the full Coriolis acceleration are found to be more complex according to parametric investigations in wide ranges of colatitudes and rotation-to-shear and rotation-to-stratification ratios. Also, new prescriptions for the vertical eddy viscosity are derived to model the turbulent transport triggered by each instability. We foresee that the inflectional instability will be responsible for turbulent transport in the equatorial region of strongly-stratified radiative zones in slowly rotating stars while the inertial instability triggers turbulence in the polar regions of weakly-stratified radiative zones in fast-rotating stars.</description>

      <title>Large eddy simulation of ocean mesoscale eddies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mesoscale eddies produce lateral (2D) fluxes that need to be parameterized in eddy-permitting (1/4-degree) global ocean models due to insufficient horizontal resolution. Here, we systematically apply methods from the 3D LES community to parameterize lateral vorticity fluxes produced by mesoscale eddies leveraging an explicit filtering approach together with a dynamic procedure. The developed subfilter closure is implemented into the GFDL MOM6 ocean model and is evaluated in an idealized double-gyre configuration, both a-priori and a-posteriori. For sufficiently resolved grids, the LES simulations converge to the filtered high-resolution data. However, limitations in the proposed closure are observed when the filter scale approaches the energy-containing scales: the a-priori performance drops and a-posteriori experiments fail to converge to the filtered high-resolution data. Nevertheless, the proposed closure is accurate in predicting the mean flow in a-posteriori simulations at all resolutions considered (1/2-1/8 degrees). Finally, we propose parameterizing the thickness fluxes using a Bardina model which further improves simulations at the coarsest resolutions (1/2-1/3 degrees).</description>

      <title>Rotational mobility in spherical membranes: The interplay between Saffman-Delbr\"uck length and inclusion size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mobility of particles in fluid membranes is a fundamental aspect of many biological processes. In a 1975 paper [1], Saffman and Delbr\"uck demonstrated how the presence of external Stokesian solvents is crucial in regularising the apparently singular flow within an infinite flat membrane. In the present paper, we extend this classical work and compute the rotational mobility of a rigid finite-sized particle located inside a spherical membrane embedded in Stokesian solvents. Treating the particle as a spherical cap, we solve for the flow semi-analytically as a function of the Saffman-Delbr\"uck (SD) length (ratio of membrane to solvent viscosity) and the solid angle formed by the particle. We study the dependence of the mobility and flow on inclusion size and SD length, recovering the flat-space mobility as a special case. Our results will be applicable to a range of biological problems including rotational Brownian motion, the dynamics of lipid rafts, and the motion of aquaporin channels in response to water flow. Our method will provide a novel way of measuring a membrane's viscosity from the rotational diffusion of large inclusions, for which the commonly used planar Saffman-Delbr\"uck theory does not apply.</description>

      <title>An OpenFOAM face-centred solver for incompressible flows robust to mesh distortion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00450v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents an overview of mesh-induced errors commonly experienced by cell-centred finite volumes (CCFV), for which the face-centred finite volume (FCFV) paradigm offers competitive solutions. In particular, a robust FCFV solver for incompressible laminar flows is integrated in OpenFOAM and tested on a set of steady-state and transient benchmarks. The method outperforms standard simpleFoam and pimpleFoam algorithms in terms of optimal convergence, accuracy, stability, and robustness. Special attention is devoted to motivate and numerically demonstrate the ability of the FCFV method to treat non-orthogonal, stretched, and skewed meshes, where CCFV schemes exhibit shortcomings.</description>
