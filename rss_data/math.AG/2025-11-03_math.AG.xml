      <title>Rank $2$ aCM and Ulrich bundles on Fano and Calabi--Yau double coverings of $\mathbb{P}^3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove existence of aCM and Ulrich sheaves respect to ample and globally generated polarisations on a class of special finite coverings $f:X\to\mathbb{P}^n$, which in particular contains cyclic ones. In the case of rank $2$ on double coverings, we have a precise description of the zero loci of such sheaves which allows us to study their geometry and classify all possible such bundles in the case $X$ is regular. We show that on a general double covering of $\mathbb{P}^3$ branched along a divisor of degree $4,6,8$ all the above sheaves exist and, when stable, we compute the dimension of their component in the moduli spaces.</description>

Abstract: Let ${\bf C}$ be a smooth geometrically connected projective curve over a finite field, and let $A$ be the affine algebra of its regular functions outside a fixed place of ${\bf C}$. We give precise relationships between the Mahler successive minima of normed $A$-lattices and the Harder-Narasimhan slopes of vector bundles over ${\bf C}$ using their category equivalence.</description>

      <title>Free curves and fundamental groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that klt Fano varieties and certain lc Fano varieties contain free higher-genus curves in their smooth loci. Our methods also allow us to find free curves on varieties in positive characteristic and on quasiprojective varieties, under a natural positivity condition on the tangent bundle. We then use the existence of free curves to deduce finiteness of the fundamental group of the smooth locus in these settings.
  The paper includes an appendix by de Jong that establishes the K\"unneth formula for tame \'etale fundamental groups.</description>

      <title>Families of Hitchin Systems in Type-D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Coulomb branch geometry of a 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ SCFT is encoded in the data of a complex integrable system. In class-S, this is the Hitchin System (of ADE type) on the punctured curves $C$ on which we compactified from 6d to 4d. As we vary the complex structure of $C$, these fit together to form a (nontrivial!) bundle of Hitchin systems over the moduli space of complex structures of $C$ (the ``conformal manifold'' of the family of SCFTs). We carry out that construction for type-D. Compared to the type-A case, the construction is much more complicated because of local constraints at the punctures. Those local constraints were studied in [1]. Here, we work out their implications for the global bundle of spectral (Seiberg-Witten) curves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.27299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a theory of noncommutative Poisson extensions. For an augmented dg algebra \(A\), we show that any shifted double Poisson bracket on \(A\) induces a graded Lie algebra structure on the reduced cyclic homology. Under the Kontsevich--Rosenberg principle, we further prove that the noncommutative Poisson extension is compatible with noncommutative Hamiltonian reduction. Moreover, we show that shifted double Poisson structures are independent of the choice of cofibrant resolutions and that they induce shifted Poisson structures on the derived moduli stack of representations.</description>

      <title>$m$-Pseudo-effectivity and a Monge-Amp\`ere-Type Equation for Forms of Positive Degree</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.27362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given an $n$-dimensional compact K\"ahler manifold, we continue our study of $m$-positivity in two ways. We first propose generalisations of the notions of pseudo-effective and big Bott-Chern cohomology classes of bidegree $(1,\,1)$ by relaxing the standard positivity hypotheses to their $m$-counterparts after we have proved a Lamari-type duality lemma in bidegree $(m,\,m)$. Independently, we propose a Monge-Amp\`ere-type non-linear pde whose distinctive feature is that its solutions, if any, are forms of positive degree rather than functions. We prove a form of uniqueness for the solutions and, under the assumption that a solution exists, we give a geometric application involving the $m$-bigness notion introduced in the first part.</description>

      <title>Birational geometry of quiver varieties and other GIT quotients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.09623v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that all projective crepant resolutions of Nakajima quiver varieties satisfying natural conditions are also Nakajima quiver varieties. More generally, we classify the small birational models of many Geometric Invariant Theory (GIT) quotients by introducing a sufficient condition for the GIT quotient of an affine variety $V$ by the action of a reductive group $G$ to be a relative Mori Dream Space. Two surprising examples illustrate that our new condition is optimal. When the condition holds, we show that the linearisation map identifies a region of the GIT fan with the Mori chamber decomposition of the relative movable cone of $V /\!/_{\theta} G$. If $V/\!/_{\theta} G$ is a crepant resolution of $Y\!\!:= V/\!/_{0} G$, then every projective crepant resolution of $Y$ is obtained by varying $\theta$. Under suitable conditions, we show that this is the case for quiver varieties and hypertoric varieties. Similarly, for any finite subgroup $\Gamma\subset \mathrm{SL}(3,\mathbb{C})$ whose nontrivial conjugacy classes are all junior, we obtain a simple geometric proof of the fact that every projective crepant resolution of $\mathbb{C}^3/\Gamma$ is a fine moduli space of $\theta$-stable $\Gamma$-constellations.</description>

      <title>Key varieties for prime $\mathbb{Q}$-Fano threefolds defined by Freudenthal triple systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.01057v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we concern with the classification of complex prime $\mathbb{Q}$-Fano $3$-folds of anti-canonical codimension 4 which are produced, as weighted complete intersections of appropriate weighted projectivizations of certain affine varieties related with $\mathbb{P}^{1}\times\mathbb{P}^{1}\times\mathbb{P}^{1}$-fibrations. Such affine varieties or their appropriate weighted projectivizations are called key varieties for prime $\mathbb{Q}$-Fano 3-folds. We realize that the equations of the key varieties can be described conceptually by Freudenthal triple systems (FTS, for short). The paper consists of two parts. In Part 1, we revisit the general theory of FTS; the main purpose of Part 1 is to derive the conditions of so called strictly regular elements in FTS so as to fit with our description of key varieties. Then, in Part 2, we define several key varieties for prime $\mathbb{Q}$-Fano 3-folds from the conditions of strictly regular elements in FTS. Among other things obtained in Part 2, we show that there exists a $14$-dimensional factorial affine variety $\mathfrak{U}_{\mathbb{A}}^{14}$ of codimension $4$ in an affine $18$-space with only Gorenstein terminal singularities, and we construct examples of prime $\mathbb{Q}$-Fano $3$-folds of No.20544 in [GRDB] as weighted complete intersections of the weighted projectivization of $\mathfrak{U}_{\mathbb{A}}^{14}$ in the weighted projective space $\mathbb{P}(1^{15},2^{2},3)$. We also clarify in Part 2 a relation between $\mathfrak{U}_{\mathbb{A}}^{14}$ and the $G_{2}^{(4)}$-cluster variety, which is a key variety for prime $\mathbb{Q}$-Fano 3-folds constructed in [CD].</description>

      <title>Deformations and Simultaneous Resolution of Determinantal Surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.02982v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper uses reconstruction algebras to construct simultaneous resolution of determinantal surfaces. The main new difference to the classical case is that, in addition to the quiver of the reconstruction algebra, certain noncommutative relations, namely those of the canonical algebra of Ringel, are required. All the relations of the reconstruction algebra except the canonical relation are then deformed, and these deformed relations together with variation of the GIT quotient achieve the simultaneous resolution.</description>

Abstract: In our previous research, we constructed the affine varieties $\Sigma_{\mathbb{A}}^{13}$ and $\Pi_{\mathbb{A}}^{14}$ whose partial projectivizations admit $\mathbb{P}^{2}\times\mathbb{P}^{2}$-fibrations with relative Picard number one. In this paper, we produce prime quasi-smooth $\mathbb{Q}$-Fano 3-folds which are anticanonically embedded of codimension four and belong to 23 (resp.8) classes in the Graded Ring Database [GRDB], as weighted complete intersections in weighted projectivizations of $\Sigma_{\mathbb{A}}^{13}$ (resp.$\Pi_{\mathbb{A}}^{14}$ or its cone). We also show that a general member of the anticanonical linear system of a general prime $\mathbb{Q}$-Fano $3$-fold constructed in this way is a quasi-smooth $K3$ surface with at worst Du Val singularities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18113v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a generalization of the McKay correspondence in positive characteristic regarding the Euler characteristic of crepant resolutions of quotient singularities given by finite subgroups of the special linear group. As the main result, we prove that this generalization holds for groups with a specific semidirect product structure, using the wild McKay correspondence over finite fields as mass formulas. Furthermore, two additional examples with more complicated structures are also given. Based on our main result, we propose a conjectural form of the generalized McKay correspondence in the modular case.</description>

Abstract: Our work begins by providing a derived characterization of rational singularities for pairs in the sense of Schwede--Takagi. This characterization both generalizes and independently obtains a result of Lank--Venkatesh in the special case of varieties with rational singularities. As an application, we introduce a categorical invariant that measures the failure of rationality for pairs on affine varieties which are locally complete intersections.</description>

      <title>TokenBlowUp: Resolving Representational Singularities in LLM Token Spaces via Monoidal Transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19747v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent work has provided compelling evidence challenging the foundational manifold hypothesis for the token embedding spaces of Large Language Models (LLMs). These findings reveal the presence of geometric singularities around polysemous tokens, which can lead to representational instability. Existing methodologies, which presuppose a smooth data manifold, are ill-equipped to address such intrinsic structural flaws. In this paper, we formalize this problem in the language of scheme theory and propose a rigorous resolution by applying the scheme-theoretic blow-up at each singular point. This procedure replaces a singular point in the ambient affine scheme with its exceptional divisor, which we identify as a canonical geometric space -- a projective space of directions -- that houses the disambiguated semantic meanings of the token. This process of ``representational desingularization'' constructs a new geometric landscape for embeddings. We prove a formal theorem guaranteeing the geometric regularization of this new space, showing that the original pathologies are resolved. Finally, we outline the architectural implications of our framework, arguing for a paradigm shift from static look-ups to dynamic, geometrically-grounded computation.</description>

      <title>Approximate Fiber Products of Schemes and Their \'Etale Homotopical Invariants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15616v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The classical fiber product in algebraic geometry provides a powerful tool for studying loci where two morphisms to a base scheme, $\phi: X \to S$ and $\psi: Y \to S$, coincide exactly. This condition of strict equality, however, is insufficient for describing many real-world applications. This paper develops a new framework to study and quantify the nature of approximate alignment between morphisms in the context of arithmetic geometry, using the tools of {\'e}tale homotopy theory. We introduce the central object of our work, the \textit{{\'e}tale mismatch torsor}, a sheaf of torsors over the product scheme $X \times_S Y$. The structure of this sheaf serves as a rich, intrinsic, and purely algebraic object amenable to both qualitative classification and quantitative analysis of the global relationship between the two morphisms. Our main results are twofold. First, we provide a complete classification of these structures, establishing a bijection between their isomorphism classes and the first {\'e}tale cohomology group $H_{\text{\'e}t}^1(X \times_S Y, \underline{\pi_1^{\text{\'e}t}(S)})$. Second, we construct a canonical filtration on this classifying cohomology group based on the theory of infinitesimal neighborhoods. This filtration induces a new invariant, which we term the \textit{order of mismatch}, providing a hierarchical, algebraic measure for the degree of approximation between the morphisms. We apply this framework to the concrete case of generalized Howe curves over finite fields, demonstrating how both the characteristic class and its order reveal subtle arithmetic properties.</description>

Abstract: We construct a family of special cycle classes on the regular integral model of an orthogonal Shimura variety, and show that these cycle classes appear as Fourier coefficients of a Siegel modular form. Passing to the generic fiber of the Shimura variety recovers a result of Bruinier and Raum, originally conjectured by Kudla.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.04115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the coherent cohomology of automorphic sheaves corresponding to Siegel modular forms $f$ of low weight on ${\rm GSp}(4)$ Shimura varieties. Inspired by the work of Prasanna--Venkatesh on singular cohomology of locally symmetric spaces, we propose a conjecture that explains all the contributions of a Hecke eigensystem to coherent cohomology in terms of the action of a motivic cohomology group. Under some technical conditions, we prove that our conjecture is equivalent to Beilinson's conjecture for the adjoint $L$-function of $f$. We also prove some unconditional results in special cases. For a lift $f$ of a Hilbert modular form $f_0$ to ${\rm GSp}(4)$, we produce elements in the motivic cohomology group for which the conjecture holds, using the results of Ramakrishnan on the Asai $L$-function of $f_0$. For a lift $f$ of a Bianchi modular form $f_0$ to ${\rm GSp}(4)$, we show that our conjecture for $f$ is equivalent to the conjecture of Prasanna-Venkatesh for $f_0$, thus establishing a connection between the motivic action conjectures for locally symmetric spaces of non-hermitian type and those for coherent cohomology of Shimura varieties.</description>

      <title>Zariski-Nagata Theorems for Singularities and the Uniform Izumi-Rees Property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00759v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce and explore the Uniform Izumi-Rees Property in Noetherian rings with applications to multiplicity theory and containment relationships among symbolic powers of ideals. As an application, we prove that if $R$ is a normal domain essentially of finite type over a field, there exists a constant $C$ so that for all prime ideals $\mathfrak{p}\subseteq \mathfrak{q}\in\mbox{Spec}(R)$, if $\mathfrak{p}\subseteq \mathfrak{q}^{(t)}$, then for all $n\in\mathbb{N}$, there is a containment of symbolic powers $\mathfrak{p}^{(Cn)}\subseteq \mathfrak{q}^{(tn)}$.</description>

      <title>Quantum $K$-theoretic divisor axiom for flag manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16150v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove an identity for (torus-equivariant) 3-point, genus 0, $K$-theoretic Gromov-Witten invariants of flag manifolds $G/P$, which can be thought of as a replacement for the ``divisor axiom'' in their (torus-equivariant) quantum $K$-theory. This identity enables us to compute these invariants when two insertions are Schubert classes and the other a Schubert divisor class. Our type-independent proof utilizes the Chevalley formula for the (torus-equivariant) quantum $K$-theory ring of flag manifolds, which computes multiplications by Schubert divisor classes in terms of the quantum Bruhat graph.</description>

      <title>The Brian\c{c}on-Skoda theorem for pseudo-rational and Du Bois singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11540v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Suppose $J = (f_1, \dots, f_n)$ is an $n$-generated ideal in a ring $R$. We prove a general Brian\c{c}on-Skoda-type containment relating the integral closure of powers of $J$ with ordinary powers of $J$. We prove that our result implies the full standard Brian\c{c}on-Skoda containment $\overline{J^{n+k-1}} \subseteq J^k$ for pseudo-rational singularities (for instance regular rings), and even for the weaker condition of birational derived splinters. Our methods also yield the containment $\overline{J^{n+k}} \subseteq J^k$ for Du Bois singularities and even for a characteristic-free generalization.
  We also show that our containment implies other well-known closure-based Brian\c{c}on-Skoda results $\overline{J^{n+k-1}} \subseteq (J^k)^{\mathrm{cl}}$ where, for instance, $\mathrm{cl}$ is tight or plus closure in characteristic $p &gt; 0$, or $\mathrm{ep}$ closure or extension and contraction from $\widehat{R^+}$ in mixed characteristic. Our proof relies on a study of the tensor product of the derived image of the structure sheaf of a partially normalized blowup of $J$ with the Buchsbaum-Eisenbud complex (equivalently the Eagon-Northcott complex) associated to $(f_1,\dots,f_n)^k$.</description>
