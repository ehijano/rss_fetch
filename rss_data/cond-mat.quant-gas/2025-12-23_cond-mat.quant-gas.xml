      <title>Quasi-two-dimensional soliton in a self-repulsive spin-orbit-coupled dipolar binary condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the formation of solitons in a uniform quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D) spin-orbit (SO) coupled self-repulsive binary dipolar and nondipolar Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) using the mean-field Gross-Pitaevskii equation. For a weak SO coupling, in a nondipolar BEC, one can have three types of degenerate solitons: a multi-ring soliton with intrinsic vorticity of angular momentum projection $+1$ or $-1$ in one component and 0 in the other, a circularly-asymmetric soliton and a stripe soliton with stripes in the density. For an intermediate SO couplings, the multi-ring soliton ceases to exist and there appears a square-lattice soliton with a spatially-periodic pattern in density on a square lattice, in addition to the degenerate circularly-asymmetric and stripe solitons. In the presence of a dipolar interaction, with the polarization direction aligned in the quasi-2D plane, only the degenerate circularly-asymmetric and stripe solitons appear.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric and chiral dynamics of two-component anyons with synthetic gauge flux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the non-equilibrium dynamics in a one-dimensional two-component anyon-Hubbard model, which can be mapped to an extended Bose-Hubbard ladder with density-dependent hopping phase and synthetic gauge flux. Through numerical simulations of two-particle dynamics and the symmetry analysis, we reveal the asymmetric transport with broken inversion symmetry and two dynamical symmetries in the expansion dynamics. The expansion of two-component anyons is dynamically symmetric under spatial inversion and component flip, when the sign of anyonic statistics phase or the signs of gauge flux and interaction are changed. In the non-interacting case, we show the dynamical suppression induced by both the statistics phase and gauge flux. In the interacting case, we demonstrate that both chiral and antichiral dynamics can be exhibited and tuned by the statistics phase and gauge flux. The dynamical phase regimes with respect to the chiral-antichiral dynamics are obtained. These findings highlight the rich dynamical phenomena arising from the interplay of anyonic exchange statistics, synthetic gauge fields, and interactions in multi-component anyons.</description>

      <title>On the origin of energy gaps in quasicrystalline potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasicrystals, structures that are ordered yet aperiodic, defy conventional band theory, confining most studies to finite-size real-space numerics. We overcome this limitation with a configuration-space framework that predicts and explains the positions and origins of energy gaps in quasicrystalline potentials. We find that a hierarchy of gaps stems from resonant hybridization between increasingly distant neighboring sites, pinning the integrated density of states below these gaps to specific irrational areas in configuration space. Large-scale simulations of a lowest-band tight-binding model built from localized Wannier functions show excellent agreement with these predictions. By moving beyond finite-size numerics, this study advances the understanding of quasicrystalline potentials, paving the way for new explorations of their quantum properties in the infinite-size limit.</description>

      <title>Full Quantum Work Statistics for Non-Homogeneous Many-Body Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nonequilibrium thermodynamics of interacting quantum many-body systems is investigated within the framework of thermal time-dependent density functional theory using a generalized linear-response formulation for the full quantum work statistics. A first-principles route is established to reconstruct the relaxation function that underlies linear-response theory, thereby moving beyond phenomenological descriptions and enabling a consistent evaluation of all moments of the dissipated-work distribution in interacting systems. The predictive power of the approach is demonstrated for the Hubbard model subject to a staggered external potential, where the evolution of the relaxation dynamics across the Mott-to-band-insulator crossover reveals how distinct many-body phases shape the out-of-equilibrium thermodynamic response. These results provide a microscopic and transferable framework for quantum thermodynamics in correlated systems, bridging thermal density functional theory and nonequilibrium work statistics.</description>

      <title>Superfluid fraction in the crystal phase of the inner crust of neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the most extended layer of the inner crust of neutron stars, nuclear matter is believed to form a crystal of clusters immersed in a superfluid neutron gas. Here we analyze this phase of matter within fully self-consistent Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov calculations using Skyrme-type energy density functionals for the mean field and a separable interaction in the pairing channel. The periodicity of the lattice is taken into account using Bloch boundary conditions, in order to describe the interplay between band structure and superfluidity. A relative flow between the clusters and the surrounding neutron gas is introduced in a time-independent way. As a consequence, the complex order parameter develops a phase, and in the rest frame of the superfluid one finds a counterflow between neutrons inside and outside the clusters. The neutron superfluid fraction is computed from the resulting current. Our results indicate that at densities above 0.03 fm$^{-3}$, more than 90% of the neutrons are effectively superfluid, independently of the detailed choice of the interaction, cluster charge, and lattice geometry. This fraction is only slightly lower than the one obtained recently within linear response theory on top of the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer approximation, and it approaches the hydrodynamic limit for strong pairing. As a consequence, it is likely that the inner crust alone can provide a sufficient superfluid angular momentum reservoir to explain pulsar glitches.</description>

      <title>Emergent $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry breaking of collective modes with topological critical phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.00450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2103.00450v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spontaneous breaking of parity-time ($\mathcal{PT}$) symmetry yields rich critical behavior in non-Hermitian systems, and has stimulated much interest, albeit most previous studies were performed within the single-particle or mean-field framework. Here, by studying the collective excitations of a Fermi superfluid with $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric spin-orbit coupling, we uncover an emergent $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry breaking in the Anderson-Bogoliubov (AB) collective modes, even as the superfluid ground state retains an unbroken $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry. {The critical point of the transition is marked by a non-analytic kink in the speed of sound, which derives from the coalescence and annihilation of the AB mode and its hole partner, reminiscent of the particle-antiparticle annihilation. The system consequently becomes immune to low-frequency external perturbations at the critical point, a phenomenon associated with the spectral topology of the complex quasiparticle dispersion. This critical phenomenon offers a fascinating route toward perturbation-free quantum states.</description>

      <title>Geometric filtering effect in expanding Bose-Einstein condensate shells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12309v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A shell-shaped Bose-Einstein condensate released from its confinement expands radially both outwards and inwards, displaying a self-interference pattern characterized by a density peak surrounded by a halo. Here we analyze how an external imprinting or the thermal fluctuations of the condensate phase influence this expansion. In both cases, we find that the curved geometry filters the imploding finite angular-momentum modes via a radial centrifugal potential, so that only the condensate state can reach the origin and form the central peak. As a consequence, we observe a pronounced dependence of the central density on the imprinting strength and on temperature. This geometric filtering effect characterizes the free expansion of curved atomic gases in contrast with flat counterparts, it is easily observable in the available experimental platforms, and enables two-dimensional shells thermometry via simple absorption-imaging techniques.</description>

      <title>Trion ordering in the attractive three-color Hubbard model on a $\pi$-flux square lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06284v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultracold multicomponent fermions (atoms/molecules) loaded in optical lattices provide an ideal platform for simulating SU($N$) Hubbard models that host unconventional many-body quantum states beyond SU(2). A prime example is the attractive three-color Hubbard model, in which trion states emerge at strong coupling. Nevertheless, much of its trion ordering on two-dimensional lattices remains uncertain. Here, we employ the determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) method to simulate the attractive three-color Hubbard model on a $\pi$-flux square lattice at half filling. We show that color-dependent attractive interaction can induce coexisting charge density wave (CDW) and N\'eel ordered states in the three-color $\pi$-flux Hubbard model. In particular, enhanced charge fluctuations (cf. honeycomb lattice) cause much stronger N\'eel ordering on the $\pi$-flux square lattice. The coexisting charge and N\'eel orders survive up to a melting temperature, at which they vanish simultaneously. The Ginzburg-Landau (GL) analysis on the coexistence of CDW and N\'eel orders demonstrates how color-dependent Hubbard interactions stabilize coexisting orders from the perspective of GL free energy principle.</description>

      <title>Loop Algorithm for Quantum Transverse Ising Model in a Longitudinal Field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17835v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum transverse Ising model and its extensions play a critical role in various fields, such as statistical physics, quantum magnetism, quantum simulations, and mathematical physics. Although it does not suffer from the sign problem in most cases, the corresponding quantum Monte Carlo algorithm performs inefficiently, especially at a large longitudinal field. The main hindrance is the lack of loop update method which can strongly decrease the auto-correlation between Monte Carlo steps. Here, we successfully develop a loop algorithm with a novel merge-unmerge process. It demonstrates a great advantage over the state-of-the-art algorithm when implementing it to simulate the Rydberg atom chain and Kagome qubit ice. This advanced algorithm suits various systems such as Rydberg atom arrays, trapped ions, quantum materials, and quantum annealers.</description>

      <title>Inter-species topological phases via a dynamical gauge field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05390v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We uncover a class of inter-species topological phases in a one-dimensional lattice, loaded with two species of non-identical particles interacting via a dynamical gauge field (DGF). Two types of topological states are found to emerge from different inter-species topology activated by the DGF. Specifically, edge confined states with co-localization of both species arise from an extrinsic inter-species topology, which can be decomposed into the single-particle topology for each species. On the other hand, bulk bound states with extended distribution emerge from an intrinsic inter-species topology that cannot be understood from single-particle ones. The two classes of inter-species topology are found to be independent of each other, characterized by different sets of inter-species topological invariants. Thus, their topological states can coexist in certain parameter regimes and compete with each other, leading to distinguished dynamical signatures. We further propose a feasible cold-atom realization of our model to demonstrate experimental accessibility of inter-species topological phases. Our work establishes inter-species topology as a new organizing principle of topological matter, revealing how correlations between distinct particle species can generate topological phenomena beyond single-particle paradigms.</description>

      <title>Single Sr Atoms in Optical Tweezer Arrays for Quantum Simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19816v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on the realization of a platform for trapping and manipulating individual $^{88}$Sr atoms in optical tweezers. A first cooling stage based on a blue shielded magneto-optical trap (MOT) operating on the $^1S_0$ -&gt; $^1P_1$ transition at 461 nm enables us to trap approximately $4\times 10^6$ atoms at a temperature of 6.8 mK. Further cooling is achieved in a narrow-line red MOT using the $^1S_0$ -&gt; $^3P_1$ intercombination transition at 689 nm, bringing $4\times 10^5$ atoms down to 5 $\mu$K and reaching a density of $\approx 10^{10}$ cm$^{-3}$. Atoms are then loaded into 813 nm tweezer arrays generated by crossed acousto-optic deflectors and tightly focused onto the atoms with a high-numerical-aperture objective. Through light-assisted collision processes we achieve the collisional blockade, which leads to single-atom occupancy with a probability of about $50\%$. The trapped atoms are detected via fluorescence imaging with a fidelity of $99.986(6)\%$, while maintaining a survival probability of $97(2)\%$. The release-and-recapture measurement provides a temperature of $12.92(5)$ $\mu$K for the atoms in the tweezers, and the ultra-high-vacuum environment ensures a vacuum lifetime higher than 7 min. These results demonstrate a robust alkaline-earth tweezer platform that combines efficient loading, cooling, and high-fidelity detection, providing the essential building blocks for scalable quantum simulation and quantum information processing with Sr atoms.</description>

      <title>Deriving the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis from Eigenstate Typicality and Kinematic Principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13348v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) provides a powerful framework for understanding thermalization in isolated quantum many-body systems, yet a complete and conceptually transparent derivation has remained elusive. In this work, we derive the structure of ETH from a minimal dynamical principle, which we term the eigenstate typicality principle (ETP), together with general kinematic ingredients arising from entropy maximization, Hilbert-space geometry, and locality. ETP asserts that in quantum-chaotic systems, energy eigenstates are statistically indistinguishable, with respect to local measurements, from states drawn from the Haar measure on a narrow microcanonical shell. Within this framework, diagonal ETH arises from concentration of measure, provided that eigenstate typicality holds. The structure of off-diagonal matrix elements is then fixed by entropic scaling and the finite-time dynamical correlations of local observables, with ETP serving as the dynamical bridge to energy eigenstates, without invoking random-matrix assumptions. Our results establish ETH as a consequence of entropy, Hilbert-space geometry, and chaos-induced eigenstate typicality, and clarify its regime of validity across generic quantum-chaotic many-body systems, thereby deepening our understanding of quantum thermalization and the emergence of statistical mechanics from unitary many-body dynamics.</description>

      <title>Wave-packet dynamics in pseudo-Hermitian lattices: Coexistence of Hermitian and non-Hermitian wavefronts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15333v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates wave-packet dynamics in non-Hermitian lattice systems and reveals a surprising phenomenon: The simultaneous propagation of two distinct wavefronts, one traveling at the non-Hermitian velocity and the other at the Hermitian velocity. We show that this dual-front behavior arises naturally in systems governed by a pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonian. Using the paradigmatic Hatano-Nelson model as our primary example, we demonstrate that this coexistence is essential for understanding a wide array of unconventional dynamical effects, including abrupt ``non-Hermitian reflections'', sudden shifts of Gaussian wave-packets, and disorder-induced emergent packets seeded by the small initial tails. We present analytic predictions that closely match numerical simulations. These results may offer new insight into the topology of non-Hermitian systems and point toward measurable experimental consequences.</description>
