      <title>Continuum limit of the adaptive Kuramoto model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of the adaptive Kuramoto model in the continuum limit with slow adaptation. This model is distinguished by dense multistability, where multiple states coexist for the same system parameters. The underlying cause of this multistability is that some oscillators can lock at different phases or switch between locking and drifting depending on their initial conditions. We identify new states, such as two-cluster states. To simplify the analysis we introduce an approximate reduction of the model via row-averaging of the coupling matrix. We derive a self-consistency equation for the reduced model and present a stability diagram illustrating the effects of positive and negative adaptation. Our theoretical findings are validated through numerical simulations of a large finite system. Comparisons to previous work highlight the significant influence of adaptation on synchronization behavior.</description>

      <title>Optimization dynamics and fluctuations in the self-organization of vascular networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The model by Hu and Cai [Phys. Rev. Lett., Vol. 111(13) (2013)1 ] describes the self-organization of vascular networks for transport of fluids from source to sinks. Diameters, and thereby conductances, of vessel segments evolve so as to minimize a cost functional E. The cost is the trade-off between the power required for pumping the fluid and the energy consumption for vessel maintenance. The model has been used to show emergence of cyclic structures in the presence of locally fluctuating demand, i.e. non-constant net flow at sink nodes. Under rapid and sufficiently large fluctuations, the dynamics exhibits bistability of tree-like and cyclic network structures. We compare these solutions in terms of the cost functional E. Close to the saddle-node bifurcation giving rise to the cyclic solutions, we find a parameter regime where the tree-like solution rather than the cyclic solution is cost-optimal. Further increase of fluctuation amplitude then leads to an additional transition at which the cyclic solution becomes optimal. The findings hold both in a small system of one source and two sinks and in an empirical vascular network with hundreds of sinks. In the small system, we further analyze the case of slower fluctuations, i.e., on the same time scale as network adaptation. We find that the noisy dynamics settles around the cyclic structures even when these structures are not cost-optimal.</description>

      <title>The Complex Interplay Between Risk Tolerance and the Spread of Infectious Diseases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Risk-driven behavior provides a feedback mechanism through which individuals both shape and are collectively affected by an epidemic. We introduce a general and flexible compartmental model to study the effect of heterogeneity in the population with regards to risk tolerance. The interplay between behavior and epidemiology leads to a rich set of possible epidemic dynamics. Depending on the behavioral composition of the population, we find that increasing heterogeneity in risk tolerance can either increase or decrease the epidemic size. We find that multiple waves of infection can arise due to the interplay between transmission and behavior, even without the replenishment of susceptibles. We find that increasing protective mechanisms such as the effectiveness of interventions, the number of risk-averse people in the population, and the duration of intervention usage reduces the epidemic overshoot. When the protection is pushed past a critical threshold, the epidemic dynamics enter an underdamped regime where the epidemic size exactly equals the herd immunity threshold. Lastly, we can find regimes where epidemic size does not monotonically decrease with a population that becomes increasingly risk-averse.</description>

      <title>Learn one size to infer all: Exploiting translational symmetries in delay-dynamical and spatio-temporal systems using scalable neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.03706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.03706v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We design scalable neural networks adapted to translational symmetries in dynamical systems, capable of inferring untrained high-dimensional dynamics for different system sizes. We train these networks to predict the dynamics of delay-dynamical and spatio-temporal systems for a single size. Then, we drive the networks by their own predictions. We demonstrate that by scaling the size of the trained network, we can predict the complex dynamics for larger or smaller system sizes. Thus, the network learns from a single example and, by exploiting symmetry properties, infers entire bifurcation diagrams.</description>

      <title>Symmetry's Edge in Cortical Dynamics: Multiscale Dynamics of Ensemble Excitation and Inhibition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.11965v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Creating a quantitative theory for the cortex poses several challenges and raises numerous questions. For instance, what are the significant scales of the system? Are they micro, meso or macroscopic? What are the relevant interactions? Are they pairwise, higher order or mean-field? And what are the control parameters? Are they noisy, dissipative or emergent?
  To tackle these issues, we suggest using an approach akin to what has transformed our understanding of the state of matter. This includes identifying invariances in the ensemble dynamics of various neuron functional classes, searching for order parameters that connect important degrees of freedom and distinguish macroscopic system states, and identifying broken symmetries in the order parameter space to comprehend the emerging laws when many neurons interact and coordinate their activation.
  By utilizing multielectrode and multiscale neural recordings, we measure the scale-invariant balance between excitatory and inhibitory neurons at a population level, referred to as ensemble E/I balance. This differs from the input E/I balance typically studied at the single-neuron level, focusing instead on the collective behavior of large neural populations. We investigate a set of parameters that can assist us in differentiating between various functional system states (such as the wake/sleep cycle) and pinpointing broken symmetries that serve different information processing and memory functions. Furthermore, we identify broken symmetries that result in pathological states like seizures.
  This study provides new insights into the multiscale dynamics of excitation and inhibition in cortical networks, advancing our understanding of the underlying principles governing neural computation and dysfunction.</description>

      <title>Emergence of power-law distributions in self-segregation reaction-diffusion processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.14083v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many natural or human-made systems encompassing local reactions and diffusion processes exhibit spatially distributed patterns of some relevant dynamical variable. These interactions, through self-organization and critical phenomena, give rise to power-law distributions, where emergent patterns and structures become visible across vastly different scales. Recent observations reveal power-law distributions in the spatial organization of, e.g., tree clusters and forest patch sizes. Crucially, these patterns do not follow a spatially periodic order but rather a statistical one. Unlike the spatially periodic patterns elucidated by the Turing mechanism, the statistical order of these particular vegetation patterns suggests an incomplete understanding of the underlying mechanisms. Here, we present a novel self-segregation mechanism, driving the emergence of power-law scalings in pattern-forming systems. The model incorporates an Allee-logistic reaction term, responsible for the local growth, and a nonlinear diffusion process accounting for positive interactions and limited resources. According to a self-organized criticality (SOC) principle, after an initial decrease, the system mass reaches an analytically predictable threshold, beyond which it self-segregates into distinct clusters, due to local positive interactions that promote cooperation. Numerical investigations show that the distribution of cluster sizes obeys a power-law with an exponential cutoff.</description>

      <title>Three Myths in Complexity Science and How to Resolve Them</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01762v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: From bird flocking to neural dynamics, complex systems generate fascinating structures and correlations. Often, seemingly simple dynamics lead to intricate emergent properties. Despite their visceral appeal, defining complex systems lacks universal agreement. In this paper, I will debunk three prevalent myths in complex systems and propose resolutions. This work contributes by offering a contemporary interpretation of complex systems, presenting essential definitions that benefit complexity scientists.</description>
