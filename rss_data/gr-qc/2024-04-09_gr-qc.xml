      <title>Quasinormal modes of a nonsingular spherically symmetric black hole effective model with holonomy corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the quasinormal modes of a nonsingular spherically symmetric black hole effective model with holonomy corrections. The model is based on quantum corrections inspired by loop quantum gravity. It is covariant and results in a spacetime that is regular everywhere with a parameter-dependent black bounce.
  Perturbations of these black holes due to massless scalar and electromagnetic fields have been previously calculated and some intriguing results were observed. For some modes, the frequency versus minimum-radius parameter trajectories were found to spiral and self-intersect in the complex plane. In addition, the spectrum of overtones has real frequencies that oscillate with increasing overtone number, and may even vanishing for some overtones.
  We have calculated the quasinormal modes for all massless spin perturbations, including spin-1/2, and axial- and polar-gravitational. We find that the trajectory-spirals are restricted to scalar perturbations and observe some interesting overtone behaviour for gravitational perturbations. The amount of isospectrality violation in the gravitational quasinormal mode spectra is also examined.</description>

      <title>Transdimensional inference for gravitational-wave astronomy with \texttt{Bilby}</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has become increasingly useful to answer questions in gravitational-wave astronomy using \textit{transdimensional} models where the number of free parameters can be varied depending on the complexity required to fit the data. Given the growing interest in transdimensional inference, we introduce a new package for the Bayesian inference Library (\texttt{Bilby}) called \texttt{tBilby}. The \texttt{tBilby}{} package allows users to set up transdimensional inference calculations using the existing \texttt{Bilby}{} architecture with off-the-shelf nested samplers and/or Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms. Transdimensional models are particularly helpful when we seek to test theoretically uncertain predictions described by phenomenological models. For example, bursts of gravitational waves can be modelled using a superposition of $N$ wavelets where $N$ is itself a free parameter. Short pulses are modelled with small values of $N$ whereas longer, more complicated signals are represented with a large number of wavelets stitched together. Other transdimensional models have found use describing instrumental noise and the population properties of gravitational-wave sources. We provide a few demonstrations of \texttt{tBilby}{}, including fitting the gravitational-wave signal GW150914 with a superposition of $N$ sine-Gaussian wavelets. We outline our plans to further develop the \tbilby{} code suite for a broader range of transdimensional problems.</description>

      <title>$f(R,\square R)$-gravity and equivalency with the modified GUP Scalar field models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the generalization of scalar field gravitational models with a minimum length we study the equivalent theory in modified theories of gravity. The quadratic Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) gives rise to a deformed Heisenberg algebra in the application, resulting in the emergence of additional degrees of freedom described by higher-order derivatives. The new degrees of freedom can be attributed to the introduction of a new scalar field, trasforming the resulting theory into a two-scalar field theory. Thus, in order to describe all the degrees of freedom we investigate special forms of the sixth-order modify $f\left( R,\square R\right) -$theory of gravity, where the gravitational Lagrangian has similar properties~to~that of the GUP scalar field theory. Finally, the cosmological applications are discussed, and we show that the de Sitter universe can be recovered without introducing a cosmological constant.</description>

      <title>Matter in Discrete Space-Times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The unitary representations of the Poincare group of a discrete space-time are constructed, following the Wigner method in continuum relativity. They can be interpreted as elementary particles with one significant new feature: the momentum space being the 4-torus is identified as the Brillouin zone of space-time where all physical phenomena occur. Consequently 4-momentum is defined and conserved only modulo a reciprocal lattice vector of the order of the Planck mass, implying that there is no notion of an invariant mass except when it vanishes. In particular the propagation of massive particles have superluminal phases under very large (trans-Planckian) boosts. This behaviour leads to new features in early cosmology which are not in conflict with current knowledge.</description>

      <title>Anomaly Induced Inflation in the Minimal Quartic Extension of Einstein's Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A particular extension of Einstein's General Relativity up to and including quartic terms in the curvature tensor is minimal in the sense that it has a unique maximally symmetric vacuum and only a massless spin-2 excitation in its spectrum around the vacuum. We study the inflation phase of the universe in the minimal quartic extension of Einstein's gravity in the presence of trace anomaly terms in the Standard Model and the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model and show that the theory allows a quasi-de Sitter phase with a sufficient number of $e$-foldings and is compatible with the spectral index and the tensor to scalar ratio.</description>

      <title>Analytic and Numerical Study of Scalar Perturbations in Loop Quantum Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The possibility that quantum geometry effects may alleviate the apparent tensions existing at large angular scales in the observations of the Cosmic Microwave Background explains the increasing interest in considering primordial perturbations within the framework of Loop Quantum Cosmology. In this framework, a number of approximations have been suggested to simplify the study of perturbations and derive analytic expressions for the power spectra. This study requires a new choice of vacuum state that takes into account the preinflationary background geometry, choice for which we adopt the so-called NO-AHD prescription. Here, we apply the aformentioned approximations to the investigation of scalar perturbations. We discuss two approaches to the quantization of perturbations in Loop Quantum Cosmology, namely the hybrid and the dressed metric approaches. We improve previous approximations by including slow-roll corrections in the inflationary era. Moreover, we compute numerically the primordial power spectra for the two considered approaches, and show that the analytic estimations are remarkably accurate for all observable modes. We also discuss the similarities and differences between the spectra obtained with those two approaches.</description>

      <title>New embedded wormhole solutions in Ricci inverse gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we obtain two new embedded WH solutions by using the class-I approach in the background of newly fourth-order Ricci inverse gravity. We show that the combination of these newly calculated shape functions and Ricci inverse gravity provides us with the possibility of obtaining traversable wormholes. All the required wormhole properties are discussed, along with flaring out and flatness conditions. The embedded diagrams within the scope of upper and lower universes are provided under the effect of both newly calculated embedded shape functions. All the energy conditions are explored with valid and negative regions. The presence of exotic matter is confirmed due to the negative region in all the energy conditions, specifically in the null energy condition. The Doppler effect through the red-blue shifts function is also discussed. Several key findings from the current research are described that demonstrate the validity of these wormhole solutions in Ricci inverse gravity.</description>

      <title>Observational constraints on degeneracy of non-canonical inflation driven by quartic potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here, the quartic inflationary potential $V(\phi)=\frac{\lambda}{4}\phi^4$ in non-canonical framework with a power-law Lagrangian is investigated. We demonstrate that the predictions of this potential in non-canonical framework align with the observational data of Planck 2018. We determine how the predictions of the model vary with changes in the non-canonical parameter $\alpha$ and the number of $e$-folds $N$. The sound speed, non-Gaussianity parameter, scalar spectral index, and tensor-to-scalar ratio are all influenced by $\alpha$. However, the scalar spectral index exhibits degeneracy with respect to changes in $\alpha$. It is found that, this degeneracy does not break through reheating consideration. Therefore, we investigate relic gravitational waves (GWs) and show that, the degeneracy of the model with respect to the $\alpha$ parameter can be broken using the relic GWs. Additionally, the density of relic GWs falls within the sensitivity range of GWs detectors for the specific $e$-folds number between 55 and 70.</description>

      <title>Cracking and complexity of self-gravitating dissipative compact objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of cracking refers to the tendency of a fluid distribution to "split'', once it abandons the equilibrium. In this manuscript we develop a general formalism to describe the occurrence of cracking within a dissipative fluid distribution, in comoving coordinates. The role of dissipative processes in the occurrence of cracking is brought out. Next, we relate the occurrence of cracking with the concept of complexity for self-gravitating objects defined in [1-3]. More specifically we relate the occurrence of cracking with the condition of the vanishing of the scalar function intended to measure the complexity of the fluid distribution (the complexity factor). We also relate the occurrence of cracking with the specific mode of leaving the equilibrium. Thus, we prove that leaving the equilibrium in either, the homologous (H), or the quasi--homologous regime (QH), prevents the occurrence of cracking. Also, it is shown that imposing the condition of vanishing complexity factor alone, (independently of the mode of leaving the equilibrium) prevents the occurrence of cracking in the non-dissipative geodesic case, and in the non-dissipative isotropic case. These results bring out further the relevance of the complexity factor and its related definition of complexity, in the study of self-gravitating systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational solitons (gravisolitons) are particular exact solutions of Einstein field equation in vacuum build on a given background solution. Their interpretation and importance is not yet fully clear and in this work we investigate the asymptotically behaviour of axially symmetric gravisolitons given minimal assumptions on the background metric. We develop an explicit systematic asymptotically expansion for the $N$-axialsoliton solution; we compute the leading order of the asymptotic killing vectors and we make a link with the corner symmetry proposal.</description>

      <title>Constant-roll inflation with non-minimally derivative coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the constant-roll inflation with non-minimally kinetic coupling to the Einstein tensor. With the slow-roll parameter $\eta_\phi = -\ddot{\phi}/(H\dot{\phi})$ being a constant, we calculate the power spectra for scalar and tensor perturbations, and derive the expressions for the scalar spectral tilt $n_s$, the tensor spectral tilt $n_T$, and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$. We find that the expressions for $n_s$ are different with different ordering of taking the derivative of the scalar power spectrum with respect to the scale $k$ and the horizon crossing condition $c_sk=aH$ in the constant-roll inflation, the consistency relation $r=-8n_T$ does not hold if $|\eta_\phi|$ is not small, and the duality of the tensor-to-scalar ratio between the slow-roll inflation and ultra-slow-roll inflation does not exist in inflationary models with non-minimally derivative coupling. The result offers a fresh perspective on the understanding of inflationary models with non-minimally derivative coupling and is helpful for the production of scalar induced gravitational waves in the framework of ultra-slow-roll inflation with non-minimally derivative coupling.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal Modes of Analog Rotating Black Holes in 2-Dimensional Photon-Fluid Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It was recently found that the optical field fluctuations in self-defocusing media can be described by sound waves propagating in a two-dimensional photon-fluid. This photon-fluid is controlled by the driving beam and serves as the background in which the sound waves can experience an effective curved spacetime, such that it provides a new platform of studying analog black holes. In this paper, we are interested in investigating the quasinormal modes (QNMs) of this analog black hole in the photon-fluid model. Based on the master equation of motion of the optical field fluctuations, we calculate the frequencies of quasinormal modes (QNF) with three different numerical methods to make sure the QNF we get are reliable. Besides fundamental modes, we also try to calculate the overtones up to $n=3$ aiming to uncover more properties of QNF. The effects of angular velocity $\Omega_H$ of the black hole, the overtone number $n$ and the winding number $m$ on the QNF are investigated. Under the $m$ with opposite sign, we find that both the real and imaginary part of the QNF will show strikingly contrasting behaviors when the QNF is plotted against $\Omega_H$, and the similar contrast effects are also found when comparing the influences from winding number and overtone number. We hope that this work may potentially contribute to the future detections of QNMs in experimental settings of photon-fluid.</description>

      <title>Quantum gravity modifications to the accretion onto a Kerr black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the framework of the Asymptotic Safety scenario for quantum gravity, we analyze quantum gravity modifications to the thermal characteristics of a thin accretion disk spiraling around a renormalization group improved (RGI-) Kerr black hole in the low energy regime. We focused on the quantum effects on the location of the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO), the energy flux from the disk, the disk temperature, the observed redshifted luminosity, and the accretion efficiency. The deviations from the classical general relativity due to quantum effects are described for a free parameter that arises in the improved Kerr metric as a consequence of the fact that the Newton constant turns into a running coupling $G(r)$ depending on the energy scale. We find that, both for rapid and slow rotating black holes with accretion disks in prograde and retrograde circulation, increases in the value of this parameter are accompanied by a decreasing of the ISCO, by a lifting of the peaks of the radiation properties of the disk and by an increase of the accretion mass efficiency, as compared with the predictions of general relativity. Our results confirm previously established findings in Ref. \cite{r17} where we showed that these quantum gravity effects also occur for an accretion disk around a RGI-Schwarzschild black hole.</description>

      <title>Effective-one-body waveform model for non-circularized, planar, coalescing black hole binaries: the importance of radiation reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an updated version of the TEOBResumS-Dali effective-one-body (EOB) waveform model for spin aligned binaries on non-circularized orbits. Recently computed 4PN (nonspinning) terms are incorporated in the waveform and radiation reaction. The model is informed by a restricted sample ($\sim60$) of spin-aligned, quasi-circular, Numerical Relativity (NR) simulations. In the quasi-circular limit, the model displays EOB/NR unfaithfulness ${\bar{\cal F}}^{\rm max}_{\rm EOBNR}\lesssim 10^{-2}$ (with median~ $1.06\times 10^{-3}$) (with Advanced LIGO noise and in the total mass range $10-200M_\odot$) for the dominant $\ell=m=2$ mode all over the 534 spin-aligned configurations available through the Simulating eXtreme Spacetime catalog of NR waveforms. Similar figures are also obtained with the 28 public eccentric SXS simulations and good compatibility between EOB and NR scattering angles is found. The quasi-circular limit of TEOBResumS-Dali is also found to be highly consistent with the TEOBResumS-GIOTTO quasi-circular model. We then systematically explore the importance of NR-tuning {\it also} the radiation reaction of the system. When this is done, the median of the distribution of quasi-circular ${\bar{\cal F}}^{\rm max}_{\rm EOBNR}$ is lowered to $3.92\times 10^{-4}$, though balanced by a tail up to $\sim 0.1$ for large, positive spins. The same is true for the eccentric-inspiral datasets. We conclude that an improvement of the analytical description of the spin-dependent flux (and its interplay with the conservative part) is likely to be the cornerstone to lower the EOB/NR unfaithfulness below the $10^{-4}$ level all over the parameter space, thus grazing the current NR uncertainties as well as the expected needs for next generation of GW detector like Einstein Telescope.</description>

      <title>Scalar induced gravitational waves in chiral scalar-tensor theory of gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the scalar induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) from a chiral scalar-tensor theory of gravity. The parity-violating (PV) Lagrangian contains the Chern-Simons (CS) term and PV scalar-tensor terms, which are built of the quadratic Riemann tensor term and first-order derivatives of a scalar field. We consider SIGWs in two cases, in which the semi-analytic expression to calculate SIGWs can be obtained. Then, we calculate the fractional energy density of SIGWs with a monochromatic power spectrum for the curvature perturbation. We find that the SIGWs in chiral scalar-tensor gravity behave differently from those in GR before and after the peak frequency, which results in a large degree of circular polarization.</description>

      <title>Cosmological fluids with boundary term couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmological models can be studied effectively using dynamical systems techniques. Starting from Brown's formulation of the variational principle for relativistic fluids, we introduce new types of couplings involving a perfect fluid, a scalar field, and boundary terms. We describe three different coupling models, one of which turns out to be particularly relevant for cosmology. Its behaviour is similar to that of models in which dark matter decays into dark energy. In particular, for a constant coupling, the model mimics well-known dynamical dark energy models while the non-constant couplings offer a rich dynamical structure, unseen before. We are able to achieve this richness whilst working in a two-dimensional phase space. This is a significant advantage which allows us to provide a clear physical interpretation of the key features and draw analogies with previously studied models.</description>

      <title>A New Perspective on Kaluza-Klein Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By assuming that the geometry of spacetime is uniquely determined by the energy momentum tensor of matter alone, i.e. without any interactions, enables us to construct the Lagrangian from which the metric of higher dimensional spacetime follows. From the geodesic equations that follow it becomes clear that the incorrect mass of elementary particles predicted by Kaluza-Klein theories arises from the assumption that in the absence of gravity the solution to the Einstein field equations reduces to the Minkowski metric. From construction of a consistent theory of $4\mathcal{D}$ electromagnetism, we find that this assumption does not only result in the incorrect mass of elementary particles, but also the incorrect value of the cosmological constant. This suggests that these incorrect predictions, which are often regarded as major flaws of Kaluza-Klein theories, just reflects the inconsistency of some postulates of general relativity and gauge theories. Abandoning this assumption results in modifications of general relativity. We show that the unified description of fundamental interactions naturally incorporates the Higgs mechanism. For non-Abelian gauge fields, we find that the manifold comprising the extra dimensions has to be a group manifold and show that the standard model is realised in 16$\mathcal{D}$ spacetime. We show that charge and spin are the same concept, but what makes them different is that the former follows from symmetry of $4\mathcal{D}$ spacetime while the latter follows from symmetry of the internal space.</description>

      <title>Second law of horizon thermodynamics during cosmic evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the second law of thermodynamics in the context of horizon cosmology, in particular, whether the change of total entropy (i.e. the sum of the entropy for the apparent horizon and the entropy for the matter fields) proves to be positive with the cosmic expansion of the universe. The matter fields inside the horizon obey the thermodynamics of an open system as the matter fields has a flux through the apparent horizon, which is either outward or inward depending on the background cosmological dynamics. Regarding the entropy of the apparent horizon, we consider different forms of the horizon entropy like the Tsallis entropy, the R\'{e}nyi entropy, the Kaniadakis entropy, or even the 4-parameter generalized entropy; and determine the appropriate conditions on the respective entropic parameters coming from the second law of horizon thermodynamics. The constraints on the entropic parameters are found in such a way that it validates the second law of thermodynamics during a wide range of cosmic era of the universe, particularly from inflation to radiation dominated epoch followed by a reheating stage. Importantly, the present work provides a model independent way to constrain the entropic parameters directly from the second law of thermodynamics for the apparent horizon.</description>

      <title>Parity violation in primordial tensor non-Gaussianities from matter bounce cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been shown that primordial tensor non-Gaussianities from a cubic Weyl action with a non-dynamical coupling are suppressed by the so-called slow-roll parameter in a conventional framework of slow-roll inflation. In this paper, we consider matter bounce cosmology in which the background spacetime is no longer quasi-de Sitter, and hence one might expect that the matter bounce models could predict non-suppressed non-Gaussianities. Nevertheless, we first show that the corresponding non-Gaussian amplitudes from the cubic Weyl term with a non-dynamical coupling are much smaller than those from the conventional slow-roll inflation, in spite of the fact that there is no slow-roll suppression. We then introduce a dynamical coupling that can boost the magnitude of graviton cubic interactions and clarify that there is a parameter region where the tensor non-Gaussianities can be enhanced and can potentially be tested by cosmic microwave background experiments.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study semi-classical particle production in non-singular bouncing cosmologies by employing the Unruh-DeWitt model of a particle detector propagating in this class of spacetimes. The scale factor for the bouncing cosmology is derived analytically and is inspired by the modified Friedmann equation employed in the loop quantum cosmology literature. We examine how the detector response varies with the free parameters in this model such as the equation of state during the contraction phase and the critical energy density during the bounce phase. We also investigate whether such a signature in the particle detector survives at late times.</description>

      <title>Little Rip and Pseudo Rip cosmological models with coupled dark energy based on a new generalized entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Little Rip (LR) and Pseudo Rip (PR) cosmological models containing two coupled fluids: dark energy and dark matter. We assume a spatially flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) universe. The interaction between the dark energy and the dark matter fluid components is described in terms of the parameters in the generalized equation of state (EoS) in presence of the bulk viscosity. We consider entropic cosmology and use a description based on a new generalized entropy function, which was proposed by Nojiri-Odintsov-Faraoni [1]. Conditions for the appearance of the (LR) and the (PR) in terms of the parameters of the (EoS) are obtained. Introducing an energy density $\rho_g$ corresponding to a specified entropy function $S_g$, together with an interaction term $Q$ in the gravitational equations of motion, we derive modified forms of the EoS parameters. We discuss the corrections of the thermodynamic parameters associated with the generalized entropy function. Properties of the late universe as well as in the early universe in this formalism are pointed out.</description>

      <title>Pulsar Timing Array Harmonic Analysis and Source Angular Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GW) influence the arrival times of radio signals coming from pulsars. Here, we investigate the harmonic space approach to describing the pulsar response to a GW. We derive and discuss the "diagonalized form" of the response, which is a sum of spin-2-weighted spherical harmonics of the GW direction multiplied by normal (spin-weight 0) spherical harmonics of the pulsar direction. We show how this allows many useful objects, for example the Hellings and Downs two-point function, to be easily calculated. The approach also provides a clear description of the gauge dependence. We then employ this harmonic approach to model the effects of angular correlations in the sky locations of GW sources (sometimes called "statistical isotropy"). To do this, we construct rotationally invariant ensembles made up of many Gaussian subensembles, each of which breaks rotational invariance. Using harmonic techniques, we compute the cosmic covariance and the total covariance of the Hellings and Downs correlation in these models. The results may be used to assess the impact of angular source correlations on the Hellings and Downs correlation, and for optimal reconstruction of the Hellings and Downs curve in models where GW sources have correlated sky locations.</description>

      <title>GW230529_181500: A Potential Primordial Binary Black Hole Merger in the Mass Gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During the fourth observing run of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA detector network, the LIGO Livingston observatory detected a coalescing compact binary, GW230529_181500, with component masses of $2.5-4.5\, M_\odot$ and $1.2-2.0\, M_\odot$ at the $90\%$ credible level. The gravitational-wave data alone is insufficient to determine whether the components are neutron stars or black holes. In this paper, we propose that GW230529_181500 originated from the merger of two primordial black holes (PBHs). We estimate a merger rate of $5.0^{+47.0}_{-4.9} \mathrm{Gpc}^{-3}\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ for compact binary coalescences with properties similar to GW230529_181500. Assuming the source is a PBH-PBH merger, GW230529-like events lead to approximately $1.7^{+36.2}_{-1.5} \times 10^{-3}$ of the dark matter in the form of PBHs. The required abundance of PBHs to explain this event is consistent with existing upper limits derived from microlensing, cosmic microwave background observations and the null detection of gravitational wave background by LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the collision dynamics of $U(1)$ gauged Q-balls by performing high-resolution numerical simulations in axisymmetry. Focusing on the case of relativistic head-on collisions, we consider the effects of the initial velocity, relative phase, relative charge, and electromagnetic coupling strength on the outcome of the collision. We find that the collision dynamics can depend strongly on these parameters; most notably, electromagnetic effects can significantly alter the outcome of the collision when the gauge coupling is large. When the gauge coupling is small, we find that the dynamics generally resemble those of ordinary (non-gauged) Q-balls.</description>

      <title>Detecting Ultralight Dark Matter Gravitationally with Laser Interferometers in Space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultralight dark matter (ULDM) is one of the leading well-motivated dark matter candidates, predicted in many theories beyond the standard model of particle physics and cosmology. There have been increasing interests in searching for ULDM in physical and astronomical experiments, mostly assuming there are additional interactions other than gravity between ULDM and normal matter. Here we demonstrate that even if ULDM has only gravitational interaction, it shall induce gravitational perturbations in solar system that may be large enough to cause detectable signals in future gravitational-wave (GW) laser interferometers in space. We investigate the sensitivities of Michelson time-delay interferometer to ULDM of various spins, and show vector ULDM with mass $m\lesssim 10^{-18}~$eV can be probed by space-based GW detectors aiming at $\mu$Hz frequencies. Our findings exhibit that GW detectors may directly probe ULDM in some mass ranges that otherwise are challenging to examine.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We continue the series of articles on the application of Landau-Ginzburg mean-field theory to unveil the basic phase structure of tensorial field theories which are characterized by combinatorially non-local interactions. Among others, this class covers tensor field theories (TFT) which lead to a new class of conformal field theories highly relevant for investigations on the AdS/CFT conjecture. Moreover, it also encompasses models within the tensorial group field theory (TGFT) approach to quantum gravity. Crucially, we find in the infrared that the effective mass of such theories generically vanishes not only at criticality but also throughout the entire phase of non-vanishing vacuum expectation value due to the non-locality of the interactions. As a consequence, one encounters there the emergence of scale invariance which is potentially enhanced to conformal invariance on configuration space.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a family of new black holes with a nontrivial horizon in Einstein-$R^2$ gravity with a negative cosmological constant. The solutions are found at the critical point where the coefficient of the $R^2$ term is fixed and the phase structure of AdS black holes of the theory is reversed.

Abstract: We present new, exact, rotating and accelerating solutions within the framework of five-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory at the Chern-Simons point. The rotating solutions describe black holes characterized by a single rotation parameter, a mass parameter, and two extra integration constants that can be interpreted as hairs of a gravitational nature. It is noteworthy that the rotation cannot be removed by a large diffeomorphism. We also extend our procedure to dimension seven, providing a new rotating black hole solution with two rotation parameters pertaining to cubic Lovelock theory with a unique vacuum.</description>

Abstract: The next generation of ground-based gravitational-wave interferometers is expected to generate a bounty of new astrophysical discoveries, with sensitivities and bandwidths greatly improved compared to current-generation detectors. These detectors will allow us to make exceptional advancements in our understanding of fundamental physics, the dynamics of dense matter, and the cosmic history of compact objects. The fundamental design aspects of these planned interferometers will enable these new discoveries; however, challenges in technical noise, data quality, and calibration have the potential to limit the scientific reach of these instruments. In this work, we evaluate the requirements of these elements for next-generation gravitational-wave science, focusing on how these areas may impact the proposed Cosmic Explorer observatory. We highlight multiple aspects of these fields where additional research and development is required to ensure Cosmic Explorer reaches its full potential.</description>

      <title>A Covariant and Manifestly Projective Invariant Formulation of Thomas-Whitehead Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thomas-Whitehead (TW) gravity is a recently formulated projectively invariant extension of Einstein-Hilbert gravity. Projective geometry was used long ago by Thomas et. al. to succinctly package equivalent paths encoded by the geodesic equation. Projective invariance in gravity has further origins in string theory through a geometric action constructed from the method of coadjoint orbits using the Virasoro Algebra. A projectively invariant connection arises from this construction, a part of which is known as the diffeomorphism field. TW Gravity exploits projective Gauss-Bonnet terms in the action functional to endow the diffeomorphism field with dynamics, while allowing the theory to collapse to General Relativity in the limit that the diffeomorphism field vanishes and the connection becomes Levi-Civita. In the original formulation of TW gravity, the diffeomorphism field is projectively invariant but not tensorial and the connection is projectively invariant but not affine. In this paper we reformulate TW gravity in terms of projectively invariant tensor fields and a projectively invariant covariant derivative, derive field equations respecting these symmetries, and show that the field equations obtained are classically equivalent across formulations. This provides a 'Rosetta Stone' between this newly constructed covariant and projective invariant formulation of TW gravity and the original formulation that was manifestly projectively invariant, but not covariant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that Debye shielding cannot be employed to constrain the cosmological abundance of magnetic monopoles, contrary to what is stated in the previous literature. Current model-independent bounds on the monopole abundance are then revisited for unit Dirac magnetic charge. We find that the Andromeda Parker bound can be employed to set an upper limit on the monopole flux at the level of $F_M\lesssim 5.3\times 10^{-19}\,\text{cm}^{-2}\text{s}^{-1}\text{sr}^{-1}$ for a monopole mass $10^{13}\,\text{GeV}/c^2\lesssim m\lesssim 10^{16}\,\text{GeV}/c^2$, which is more stringent than the MACRO direct search limit by two orders of magnitude. This translates into stringent constraints on the monopole density parameter $\Omega_M$ at the level of $10^{-7}-10^{-4}$ depending on the mass. For larger monopole masses the scenarios in which magnetic monopoles account for all or the majority of dark matter are disfavored.</description>

      <title>The cosmological collider in $R^2$ inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Starobinsky's $R^2$ inflation manifests a best-fit scenario for the power spectrum of primordial density fluctuations. Observables derived from the slow-roll picture of the $R^2$ model in the Einstein frame relies on the conformal transformation of the metric, which inevitably induces a unique exponential-type couplings of the rolling scalaron with all matter fields during inflation. The "large-field" nature of the $R^2$ model further invokes non-negligible time and scale dependence to the matter sector through such an exponential coupling, modifying not only the dynamics of matter perturbations on superhorizon scales but also their decay rates. In this work, we identify the simplest observable of the cosmological collider physics built in the background of $R^2$ inflation, focusing on the so-called "quantum primordial clock" signals created by the non-local propagation of massive scalar perturbations. Our numerical formalism based on the unique conformal coupling can have extended applications to (quasi-)single-field inflationary models with non-trivial couplings to gravity or models originated from the $f(R)$ modification of gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study radius stabilization in the Randall-Sundrum model without assuming any unnaturally large stabilizing scalar potential parameter at the boundary branes ($\gamma$) by the frequently used superpotential method. Employing a perturbative expansion in $1/\gamma^2$ and the backreaction parameter, we obtain approximate analytical expressions for the radion mass and wavefunction. We validate them through a dedicated numerical analysis, which solves the linearized coupled scalar and metric field equations exactly. It is observed that the radion mass decreases with decreasing $\gamma$. Below a critical value of $\gamma$, the radion becomes tachyonic, suggesting destabilization of the extra dimension. We also address the issue of non-Hermiticity of the differential operator that determines the radion and Kaluza-Klein (KK) mode wavefunctions in the finite $\gamma$ limit. It is accomplished by finding an explicit form of the general scalar product that re-establishes the orthogonality in the KK decomposition.</description>

      <title>Mapping indefinite causal order processes to composable quantum protocols in a spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Formalisms for higher order quantum processes provide a theoretical formalisation of quantum processes where the order of agents' operations need not be definite and acyclic, but may be subject to quantum superpositions. This has led to the concept of indefinite causal structures (ICS) which have garnered much interest. However, the interface between these information-theoretic approaches and spatiotemporal notions of causality is less understood, and questions relating to the physical realisability of ICS in a spatiotemporal context persist despite progress in their information-theoretic characterisation. Further, previous work suggests that composition of processes is not so straightforward in ICS frameworks, which raises the question of how this connects with the observed composability of physical experiments in spacetime. To address these points, we compare the formalism of quantum circuits with quantum control of causal order (QC-QC), which models an interesting class of ICS processes, with that of causal boxes, which models composable quantum information protocols in spacetime. We incorporate the set-up assumptions of the QC-QC framework into the spatiotemporal perspective and show that every QC-QC can be mapped to a causal box that satisfies these set up assumptions and acts on a Fock space while reproducing the QC-QC's behaviour in a relevant subspace defined by the assumptions. Using a recently introduced concept of fine-graining, we show that the causal box corresponds to a fine-graining of the QC-QC, which unravels the original ICS of the QC-QC into a set of quantum operations with a well-defined and acyclic causal order, compatible with the spacetime structure. Our results also clarify how the composability of physical experiments is recovered, while highlighting the essential role of relativistic causality and the Fock space structure.</description>

      <title>Autoregressive Search of Gravitational Waves: Denoising</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Because of the small strain amplitudes of gravitational-wave (GW) signals, unveiling them in the presence of detector/environmental noise is challenging. For visualizing the signals and extracting its waveform for a comparison with theoretical prediction, a frequency-domain whitening process is commonly adopted for filtering the data. In this work, we propose an alternative template-free framework based on autoregressive modeling for denoising the GW data and extracting the waveform. We have tested our framework on extracting the injected signals from the simulated data as well as a series of known compact binary coalescence (CBC) events from the LIGO data. Comparing with the conventional whitening procedure, our methodology generally yields improved cross-correlation and reduced root mean square errors with respect to the signal model.</description>

      <title>Holographic supersymmetric Renyi entropies from hyperbolic black holes with scalar hair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study holographic supersymmetric Renyi entropies from a family of hyperbolic black holes in an Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton (EMD) system under the BPS condition. We calculate the thermodynamic quantities of these hyperbolic black holes. We find a remarkably simple formula of the supersymmetric Renyi entropy that unifies (interpolates) 11 cases embeddable to 10 or 11 dimensional supergravity. It reproduces many known results in the literature, and gives new results with distinctive features. We show that the supersymmetric version of the modular entropy and the capacity of entanglement cannot be mapped to thermal quantities, due to the dependence of the temperature and the chemical potential by the BPS condition. We also calculate the entanglement spectrum. We derive the potential of the EMD system from a $V=0$ solution and obtain two neutral solutions with scalar hair as a byproduct.</description>

      <title>The impact of large-scale galaxy clustering on the variance of the Hellings-Downs correlation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The origin of the stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background, recently discovered from pulsar timing array experiments, is still unclear. If this background is of astrophysical origin, we expect the distribution of GW sources to follow the one of galaxies. Since galaxies are not perfectly isotropically distributed at large scales, but follow the cosmological large-scale structure, this would lead to an intrinsic anisotropy in the distribution of GW sources. In this work, we develop a formalism to account for this anisotropy, by considering a Gaussian ensemble of sources in each realization of the universe and then taking ensemble averages over all such realizations. We find that large-scale galaxy clustering has no impact on the Hellings-Downs curve, describing the expectation value of pulsar timing residual correlations. However, it introduces a new contribution to the variance of the Hellings-Downs correlation. Hence, due to the anisotropic distribution of sources, the measurements of pulsar timing residual correlations in our Universe may differ from the Hellings-Downs curve. This indicates that the variance of the Hellings-Downs correlation can be utilized as a new cosmological observable that might help us to unveil the nature of current background observations in the nHz band.</description>

      <title>On the geometry of silent and anisotropic big bang singularities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2101.04955v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article is the second of two in which we develop a geometric framework for analysing silent and anisotropic big bang singularities. In the present article, we record geometric conclusions obtained by combining the geometric framework with Einstein's equations. The main features of the results are the following: The assumptions do not involve any symmetry requirements and are weak enough to be consistent with most big bang singularities for which the asymptotic geometry is understood. The framework gives a clear picture of the asymptotic geometry. It also reproduces the Kasner map, conjectured in the physics literature to constitute the essence of the asymptotic dynamics for vacuum solutions to Einstein's equations. When combined with Einstein's equations, the framework yields partial improvements of the assumptions concerning, e.g., the expansion normalised Weingarten map $\mathcal{K}$ (one of the central objects of the framework, defined as the Weingarten map of the leaves of the foliation divided by the mean curvature). For example, the expansion normalised normal derivative of $\mathcal{K}$ can, under suitable assumptions concerning the eigenvalues of $\mathcal{K}$, be demonstrated to decay exponentially and $\mathcal{K}$ can be demonstrated to converge exponentially, even though we initially only impose weighted bounds on these quantities. Finally, the framework gives a unified perspective on the existing results. Moreover, in $3+1$-dimensions, the only parameters necessary to interpret the results are the eigenvalues of $\mathcal{K}$ and an additional scalar function determined by the geometry induced on the leaves of the foliation.
  In the companion article, we obtain conclusions concerning the asymptotic behaviour of solutions to linear systems of wave equations on the backgrounds consistent with the framework.</description>

Abstract: A Morris-Thorne wormhole can only be sustained by violating the null energy condition, thereby requiring the existence of "exotic matter," a requirement that many researchers consider unphysical. Using a mostly qualitative approach, it is proposed in this note that the basic problems can be overcome by purely relativistic considerations. The implication is that a Morris-Thorne wormhole is likely to be a compact stellar object.</description>

      <title>Solving the Teukolsky equation with physics-informed neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.06103v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to compute the first quasi-normal modes of the Kerr geometry via the Teukolsky equation. This technique allows us to extract the complex frequencies and separation constants of the equation without the need for sophisticated numerical techniques, and with an almost immediate implementation under the \texttt{PyTorch} framework. We are able to compute the oscillation frequencies and damping times for arbitrary black hole spins and masses, with accuracy typically below the percentual level as compared to the accepted values in the literature. We find that PINN-computed quasi-normal modes are indistinguishable from those obtained through existing methods at signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) larger than 100, making the former reliable for gravitational-wave data analysis in the mid term, before the arrival of third-generation detectors like LISA or the Einstein Telescope, where SNRs of ${\cal O}(1000)$ might be achieved.</description>

Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) from primordial black holes (PBHs) inspiralling inside neutron stars (NSs) within the Galaxy are detectable by ground-based detectors and provide a unique insight into the interior structure of NSs. To provide the most accurate templates for GW searches, we solve the Einstein equations inside NSs, and calculate the orbital motion of the captured PBH by taking the dynamical friction, accretion, and gravitational radiation into account. Armed with the most accurate GW waveforms for PBHs inspiralling inside NSs, we find that Einstein Telescope can distinguish different equations of the state of NSs. As PBHs inspiral deeper inside NSs, the GW frequency increases near the surface, then it decreases to a constant deeper inside NSs. The unique characteristics of GW frequency serve as the smoking gun of GW signals emitted by PBHs inspiralling inside NSs and can be used to probe the nuclear matter in the crust and core of NSs.</description>

Abstract: Due to the nature of gravity, non-linear effects are left imprinted in the quasi-normal modes generated in the ringdown phase of the merger of two black holes. We offer an analytical treatment of the quasi-normal modes at second-order in black hole perturbation theory which takes advantage from the fact that the non-linear sources are peaked around the light ring. As a byproduct, we describe why the amplitude of the second-order mode relative to the square of the first-order amplitude depends only weakly on the initial condition of the problem.</description>

      <title>Exact FLRW cosmological solutions via invariants of the symmetry groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.19772v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Until now, various methods have been demonstrated to solve the Friedmann-Lama\'{\i}tre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) equations in the spatially flat $(k=0)$ cosmological model. In this study, in order to solve the field equations of the spatially flat FLRW cosmological model in the presence of $\Lambda$, a new method based on the invariants of the symmetry groups which we called ISG-method, is presented. This method is based on the extended Prelle-Singer (PS) method and it uses the Lie point symmetry, $\lambda$-symmetry and Darboux polynomials (DPs). We employ this method to extract systematically the two independent first integrals (or invariants) such as $I_1 (a,\dot{a})=c_1$ and $I_2 (t,a,\dot{a})=c_2$ associated to the group of the Lie point transformations keeping the Friedmann-Einstein dynamical equation (DE), $\ddot{a}=\phi(t,a,\dot{a})$, invariant. The obtained solutions from solving the DEs of the FLRW cosmological model by the ISG-method are explicitly written, so that they are suitable for cosmological applications. Finally, as an application of the solutions we look at the age of universe in the presence of cosmological constant where the dominant matter of the universe is considered to be fluid with the state parameter $w$. In this regard, we calculate the age of universe when the dominant matter is dust.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12093v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply neural posterior estimation for fast-and-accurate hierarchical Bayesian inference of gravitational wave populations. We use a normalizing flow to estimate directly the population hyper-parameters from a collection of individual source observations. This approach provides complete freedom in event representation, automatic inclusion of selection effects, and (in contrast to likelihood estimation) without the need for stochastic samplers to obtain posterior samples. Since the number of events may be unknown when the network is trained, we split into sub-population analyses that we later recombine; this allows for fast sequential analyses as additional events are observed. We demonstrate our method on a toy problem of dark siren cosmology, and show that inference takes just a few minutes and scales to $\sim 600$ events before performance degrades. We argue that neural posterior estimation therefore represents a promising avenue for population inference with large numbers of events.</description>

Abstract: The Brownian motion of a point particle induced by quantum vacuum fluctuations of a massless real scalar field in Einstein's universe is studied. By assuming the small displacement condition, the dispersion in the momentum and position of a point particle coupled to the massless scalar field are obtained. As a consequence of the homogeneity and isotropy properties of the Einstein's Universe, we find that all components of these physical observables are identical. We also examine divergent behaviors associated to the physical momentum and position dispersions, which we attribute to the $R^1\times S^3$ compact topology of the spacetime. Finally, based on the small displacement condition assumed, we analyze the limit of validity of our investigation.</description>

Abstract: We present for the first time a study of the quasinormal modes of rapidly rotating Ellis-Bronnikov wormholes in General Relativity. We compute the spectrum of the wormholes using a spectral decomposition of the metric perturbations on a numerical background. We focus on the $M_z=2,3$ sector of the perturbations, and show that the triple isospectrality of the symmetric and static Ellis-Bronnikov wormhole is broken due to rotation, giving rise to a much richer spectrum than the spectrum of Kerr black holes. We do not find any instabilities for $M_z=2,3$ perturbations.</description>

Abstract: Cosmological dynamics are investigated in detail through systematic procedures by using the autonomous system analyses of gravitational field equations in $ f(Q) $ gravity. The explicit analyses of the late-time cosmic evolutions are demonstrated for fundamental three types of models under the presence of non-relativistic matter (i.e., dark matter and baryons) as well as radiation. The stability of cosmological solutions is also explored by examining non-hyperbolic critical points based on the center manifold theory. It is shown that the acceleration of the universe can be achieved with $ f(Q) $ gravity. Three different models were considered for the study and dynamical systems analysis technique is incorporated. The main finding of the present analyses is that cosmological solutions in $ f(Q) $ gravity can effectively fit observable datasets. This is depicted by phase space portraits and qualitative evolution of the cosmological models.</description>

      <title>Dynamic instability analysis for bumblebee black holes: the odd parity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07757v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spherical black-hole (BH) solutions have been found in the bumblebee gravity where a vector field nonminimally couples to the Ricci tensor. We study dynamic (in)stability associated with the gravitational and vector perturbations of odd parity against these bumblebee BHs. Under the plane-wave approximation, we find that bumblebee BHs do not suffer ghost instability, but gradient instability and tachyonic instability exist when the bumblebee charge exceeds certain values. The existence of the instabilities also depends on the nonminimal coupling constant $\xi$ that, there is a minimal value $\xi \sim 4\pi G$ with $G$ the gravitational constant for the instabilities to happen. The theoretical consideration for bumblebee BH stability turns out to place stronger constraints on the parameter space than those from the recent observations of supermassive BH shadows by the Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration. It is also reminiscent of Penrose's cosmic censorship conjecture since the charge of bumblebee BHs cannot be too large due to the dynamic instabilities. Specifically, for $\xi(\xi-16\pi G) &gt; 0$, we find that the charge of a bumblebee BH cannot be larger than its mass.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we compare in detail the linear and nonlinear approach to the Gravitational Waves Displacement and Velocity Memory (GWDM and GWVM) effects. We consider astrophysical situations that give rise to gravitational waves with GWVM effect, i.e. with a residual velocity (the so-called "velocity-coded memory") and discuss the possibility of future detection of the GWVM effect.</description>

      <title>Accurate analytical modeling of light rays in spherically symmetric spacetimes: Applications in the study of black hole accretion disks and polarimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18543v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present new, simple analytical formulas to accurately describe light rays in spherically symmetric static spacetimes. These formulas extend those introduced by Beloborodov and refined by Poutanen for the Schwarzschild metric. Our enhanced formulas are designed to be applicable to a broader range of spacetimes, making them particularly valuable for describing phenomena around compact objects like neutron stars and black holes. As an illustration of their application, we present analytical studies of images of thin accretion disks surrounding black holes and explore their associated polarimetry.</description>

      <title>Search for gravitationally lensed interstellar transmissions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01201v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider interstellar light transmission facilitated by gravitational lensing. We study axially-symmetric lensing configurations where the transmitter, lens, and receiver are nearly aligned. With the transmitter positioned in the focal region of the lens, we investigate the caustic formed by a diffraction-limited beam of light emitted by the transmitter. We evaluated the impact of the lens's point spread function (PSF) on the received beam. We estimate the power delivered to a receiver at interstellar distances, evaluate the major noise sources, and determine the detection sensitivity in both the noise- and signal-dominated regimes. Considering realistic assumptions about the transmitter's performance, we explore signal detection strategies enhanced by the spatial broadening of the received beam, a result of the PSF from the transmitting lens. We find that detection of the lensed optical signals from nearby stars may be done relying on established optical engineering technologies. Furthermore, a network of astronomical facilities capable of observations in multiple narrow spectral bands will benefit the search. Our results support the feasibility of interstellar power transmission via gravitational lensing, directly contributing to the ongoing optical SETI efforts.</description>

      <title>Inconsistency of modified gravity in cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01376v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that there is a fundamental flaw in the application of modified gravity theories in cosmology, taking $f(R)$ gravity as a paradigmatic example. This theory contains a scalar degree of freedom that couples to the matter stress-energy tensor but not to gravitational energy. However, when applied to cosmology this theory is unable to distinguish between gravitational and non-gravitational energy. Hence the cosmological version of the theory does not coincide with its own macroscopic average, and we show that this leads to order-one discrepancies. We argue that the same inconsistency is common to many other modified gravity theories with extra degrees of freedom. Our results put into question whether these theories can make sense as the cosmological average of a fundamental theory, hence challenging their physical significance.</description>

      <title>Quantum Big-Bounce as a phenomenology of RQM in the Mini-superspace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02802v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of a quantum Big-Bounce in the context of an isotropic Universe, filled by a self-interacting scalar field, which plays the role of a physical clock. The bouncing cosmology is the result of a scattering process, driven by the scalar field potential, which presence breaks down the frequency separation of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation, treated in strict analogy to a relativistic quantum system. Differently from previous analyses, we consider a really perturbative self-interaction potential, affecting the dynamics in a finite range of the time labeled by the scalar clock (and in particular we remove the divergent character previously allowed). The main result of the present analysis is that, when the Relativistic Quantum Mechanics formalism is properly implemented in the Mini-superspace analogy, the probability amplitude for the bounce is, both in the standard and polymerized case, characterized by a maximum in correspondence of the quasi-classical condition of a Universe minimum volume.</description>

      <title>Tipler Naked Singularities in $N$ Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02940v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A spacetime singularity, identified by the existence of incomplete causal geodesics in the spacetime, is called a (Tipler) strong curvature singularity if the volume form acting on independent Jacobi fields along causal geodesics vanishes in the approach of the singularity. It is called naked if it is the past endpoint of causal curves in spacetime. Here, we study the formation of strong curvature naked singularities arising from spherically symmetric gravitational collapse of general type-I matter fields in an arbitrarily finite number of dimensions. In the spirit of Joshi and Dwivedi [1], and Goswami and Joshi [2], we first construct regular initial data in terms of matter variables and geometric quantities, subject to the dominant and null energy conditions. Using this initial data, we derive two distinct (but not mutually exclusive) conditions, which we call the positive root condition (PRC) and the simple positive root condition (SPRC), that serve as necessary and sufficient conditions, respectively, for the existence of naked singularities. In doing so, we generalize the results of [1] and [2]. We further restrict the PRC and the SPRC by imposing the curvature growth condition (CGC) of Clarke and Krolak [3] on all causal curves that satisfy the causal convergence condition. The CGC then gives a sufficient condition ensuring that the naked singularities implying the PRC and implied by the SPRC, are of strong curvature type and hence correspond to the inextendibility of the spacetime. Using the CGC, we extend the results of [4] (that hold for dimension $N=4$) to the case $N=5$, showing that strong curvature naked singularities can occur in this case. However, for the case $N\geq6$, we show that past-incomplete causal curves that identify naked singularities do not satisfy the CGC. These results shed light on the validity of the cosmic censorship conjectures in arbitrary dimensions.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics and Perturbative Analysis of Some Newly Developed $\mathcal{F}(R,L_m, T)$ Theories Under the Scenario of Conserved Energy-momentum Tensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03682v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present work is devoted to explore some interesting cosmological features of a newly proposed theory of gravity namely $\mathcal{F}(R,L_m,T)$ theory, where $R$ and $T$ represent the Ricci scalar and trace of energy momentum-tensor, respectively. Firstly, a non-equilibrium thermodynamical description is considered on the apparent horizon of the Friedmann's cosmos. The Friedmann equations are demonstrated to be equivalent to the first law of thermodynamics, i.e., ${T_{Ah}d\varepsilon_{h}^\prime+T_{Ah}d_{i}\varepsilon_{h}^\prime=-d\hat{E}+\hat{W}dV}$, where ${d_{i}\varepsilon_{h}^\prime}$ refers to entropy production term. We also formulate the constraint for validity of generalized second law of thermodynamics and check it for some simple well-known forms of generic function $\mathcal{F}(R,L_m,T)$. Next, we develop the energy bounds for this framework and constraint the free variables by finding the validity regions for NEC and WEC. Further, we reconstruct some interesting cosmological solutions namely power law, $\Lambda$CDM and de Sitter models in this theory. The reconstructed solutions are then examined by checking the validity of GSLT and energy bounds. Lastly, we analyze the stability of all reconstructed solutions by introducing suitable perturbations in the field equations. It is concluded that obtained solutions are stable and cosmologically viable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.08407v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a scenario with axions/axion-like particles Chern-Simons gravity coupling, such that gravitational waves can be produced directly from axion wave parametric resonance in the early universe after inflation. This axion gravity term is less constrained compared to the well-searched axion photon coupling and can provide a direct and efficient production channel for gravitational waves. Such stochastic gravitational waves can be detected by either space/ground-based gravitational wave detectors or pulsar timing arrays for a broad range of axion masses and decay constants.</description>

      <title>Review of Hubble tension solutions with new SH0ES and SPT-3G data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09814v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an updated analysis of eleven cosmological models that may help reduce the Hubble tension, which now reaches the $6\sigma$ level when considering the latest SH0ES measurement versus recent CMB and BAO data, assuming $\Lambda$CDM. Specifically, we look at five classical extensions of $\Lambda$CDM (with massive neutrinos, spatial curvature, free-streaming or self-interacting relativistic relics, or dynamical dark energy) and six elaborate models featuring either a time-varying electron mass, early dark energy or some non-trivial interactions in the neutrino sector triggered by a light Majoron. We improve over previous works in several ways. We include the latest data from the South Pole Telescope as well as the most recent measurement of the Hubble rate by the SH0ES collaboration. We treat the summed neutrino mass as a free parameter in most of our models, which reveals interesting degeneracies and constraints. We define additional metrics to assess the potential of a model to reduce or even solve the Hubble tension. We validate an emulator that uses active learning to train itself during each parameter inference run for any arbitrary model. We find that the time-varying electron mass and the Majoron models are now ruled out at more than $3\sigma$. Models with a time-varying electron mass and spatial curvature or with early dark energy reduce the tension to $1.0-2.9\sigma$. Nevertheless, none of the models considered in this work is favored with enough statistical significance to become the next concordance model of Cosmology.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Supermassive Black Hole Binaries from JWST and NANOGrav</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04161v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use the recent statistics of dual active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the $James \ Webb \ Space \ Telescope$ (JWST) data at $z \sim 3.4$ to address two aspects of the feedback and evolution scenarios of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHB). We find that the JWST data provide evidence for the members of a binary black hole being 'lit' at the same time, rather than independently -- a scenario which is consistent with gas-rich mergers being responsible for concurrent AGN activity. This conclusion is supported by the recent NANOGrav Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) measurements, whose upper limits on the stochastic gravitational wave strain amplitude lie below those expected from extrapolating the dual AGN fraction. The results indicate either a 'stalling' of the binaries at the separations probed by NANOGrav, or rapid gas-driven inspirals.</description>

      <title>Towards more accurate synthetic reflection spectra: improving the calculations of returning radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05582v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new model to calculate reflection spectra of thin accretion disks in Kerr spacetimes. Our model includes the effect of returning radiation, which is the radiation that is emitted by the disk and returns to the disk because of the strong light bending near a black hole. The major improvement with respect to the existing models is that it calculates the reflection spectrum at every point on the disk by using the actual spectrum of the incident radiation. Assuming a lamppost coronal geometry, we simulate simultaneous observations of NICER and NuSTAR of bright Galactic black holes and we fit the simulated data with the latest version of RELXILL (modified to read the table of REFLIONX, which is the non-relativistic reflection model used in our calculations). We find that RELXILL with returning radiation cannot fit well the simulated data when the black hole spin parameter is very high and the coronal height and disk's ionization parameter are low, and some parameters can be significantly overestimated or underestimated. We can find better fits and recover the correct input parameters as the value of the black hole spin parameter decreases and the value of the coronal height increases.</description>

      <title>Implications of comprehensive nuclear and astrophysics data on the equations of state of neutron star matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06018v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The equations of state (EoSs) governing neutron star (NS) matter obtained for both non-relativistic and relativistic mean-field models are systematically confronted with a diverse set of terrestrial data and astrophysical observations within the Bayesian framework. The terrestrial data, spans from bulk properties of finite nuclei to the heavy-ion collisions, constrain the symmetric nuclear matter EoS and the symmetry energy up to twice the saturation density ($\rho_0$= 0.16 fm$^{-3}$). The astrophysical observations encompass the NS radius, the tidal deformability, and the lower bound on maximum mass. Three distinct posterior distributions of EoSs are generated by gradually updating the priors with different constraints: (i) only the maximum NS mass, (ii) incorporating additional terrestrial data, (iii) combining both the terrestrial data and astrophysical observations. These EoS distributions are then compared using the Kullback-Liebler divergence which highlights the significant constraints imposed on the EoSs by the currently available lower bound of NS maximum mass and terrestrial data. The remaining astrophysical observations marginally refine the EoS within the density range $\sim$ 2-3$\rho_0$. It is observed that the relativistic mean field model yields stiffer EoS around the saturation density, but predict smaller values of the speed of sound and proton fraction in the interior of massive stars.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02801v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide evidence for a correspondence between the formation of primordial black holes and the stability of circular null geodesics around the collapsing perturbation. We first show that the critical threshold of the compaction function to form a black hole in radiation is well approximated by the critical threshold for the appearance of the first unstable circular orbit. We also show that the critical exponent in the scaling law of the primordial black hole mass close to the threshold is set by the inverse of the Lyapunov coefficient of the unstable orbits when a self-similar stage is developed close to criticality.</description>

      <title>Experimental studies of black holes: status and future prospects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03522v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: More than a century ago, Albert Einstein presented his general theory of gravitation (GR) to the Prussian Academy of Sciences. One of the predictions of the theory is that not only particles and objects with mass, but also the quanta of light, photons, are tied to the curvature of space-time, and thus to gravity. There must be a critical compactness, above which photons cannot escape. These are black holes (henceforth BH). It took fifty years after the theory was announced before possible candidate objects were identified by observational astronomy. And another fifty years have passed, until we finally have in hand detailed and credible experimental evidence that BHs of 10 to 10^10 times the mass of the Sun exist in the Universe. Three very different experimental techniques, but all based on Michelson interferometry or Fourier-inversion spatial interferometry have enabled the critical experimental breakthroughs. It has now become possible to investigate the space-time structure in the vicinity of the event horizons of BHs. We briefly summarize these interferometric techniques, and discuss the spectacular recent improvements achieved with all three techniques. Finally, we sketch where the path of exploration and inquiry may go on in the next decades.</description>

      <title>Deformation-induced CPT violation in entangled pairs of neutral kaons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03600v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider description of kaon -- anti-kaon interference in the context of a theory with deformed $\cal CPT$ symmetry. In the case of such theoretical models, deviations from the standard $\cal CPT$ invariance is related to the momentum carried by the particles; in particular the rest masses of particles and antiparticles are equal. We find that the decay intensity of kaon -- anti-kaon pair has three contributing terms: the correct-parity, the wrong-parity, and the interference between them, all of which are affected by deformation. Using the fact that the presence of such terms were not observed we estimate the magnitude of deformation parameter $\kappa \gtrsim 10^{18}$ GeV, very close to the expected Planck mass scale. This raises hopes that the effect, if exists, could be detected in a near future accelerator experiments. An uncertainty of the energy measurement is crucial for accuracy of these predictions.</description>
