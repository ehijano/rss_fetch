      <title>On the independent set polynomial of graphs and claw-free graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present two new contributions to the study of the independence polynomial $Z_\GI(z)$ of a finite simple graph $\GI = (\VU,\EE)$. First, we establish a novel combinatorial expression for $Z_\GI(z)$, inspired by the connection with the abstract polymer gas models in statistical mechanics, which offers a new structural interpretation of the polynomial and may be of independent interest. Second, we provide an improved lower bound for the zero-free region of $Z_\GI(z)$ in the complex plane for the important class of claw-free graphs. Our bound exceeds the classical Shearer radius and is derived through a refined application of the Fern\'andez-Procacci criterion using properties of the local neighborhood structure in claw-free graphs. These results strengthen the connection between statistical physics, combinatorics, and graph theory, and suggest new approaches for analytic exploration</description>

      <title>The range of the des statistic for conjugacy classes in $S_n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine the range of the des statistic on every conjugacy class in the symmetric group $S_n$, prove that the minimum is $1$ (except for the identity class), and show that every intermediate value from $1$ to the maximum value is attained. We also demonstrate a constructive method to achieve every value in the range and discuss its combinatorial implications.</description>

      <title>A Unified Treatment of Some Classic Combinatorial Inequalities Using the Variance Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The "variance method" has been used to prove many classical inequalities in design theory and coding theory. The purpose of this expository note is to review and present some of these inequalities in a unified setting. I will also discuss some examples from my own research where I have employed these techniques.</description>

      <title>Separating dots with circles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a finite set of points in general position in the plane or sphere, we count the number of ways to separate those points using two types of circles: circles through three of the points, and circles through none of the points (up to an equivalence). In each case, we show the number of circles which separate the points into subsets of size k and l is independent of the configuration of points, and we provide an explicit formula in each case. We also consider how the circles change as the configuration of dots varies continuously. We show that an associated higher order Voronoi decomposition of the sphere changes by a sequence of local `moves'. As a consequence, an associated cluster algebra is independent of the configuration of dots, and only depends on the number of dots and the order of the Voronoi decomposition.</description>

      <title>Monotonicity and decompositions of random regular graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we establish several monotonicity and decomposition results in the framework of random regular graphs. Among other results, we show that, for a wide range of parameters $d_1 \leq d_2$, there exists a coupling of $G(n,d_1)$ and $G(n,d_2)$ satisfying that $G(n,d_1) \subseteq G(n,d_2)$ with high probability, confirming a conjecture of Gao, Isaev and McKay in a new regime. Our contributions include new tools for analysing contiguity and total variation distance between random regular graph models, a novel procedure for generating unions of random edge-disjoint perfect matchings, and refined estimates of Gao's bounds on the number of perfect matchings in random regular graphs. In addition, we make progress towards another conjecture of Isaev, McKay, Southwell and Zhukovskii.</description>

      <title>A Closer Look at Chapoton's q-Ehrhart Polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If $\mathcal{P}$ is a lattice polytope (i.e., $\mathcal{P}$ is the convex hull of finitely many integer points in $\mathbb{R}^d$), Ehrhart's famous theorem (1962) asserts that the integer-point counting function $|t \mathcal{P} \cap \mathbb{Z}^d|$ is a polynomial in the integer variable $t$. Chapoton (2016) proved that, given a fixed integral form $\lambda: \mathbb{Z}^d \to \mathbb{Z}$, there exists a polynomial $\text{cha}_\mathcal{P}^\lambda(q,x) \in \mathbb{Q}(q)[x]$ such that the refined enumeration function $\sum_{ \mathbf{m} \in t \mathcal{P} } q^{ \lambda(\mathbf{m}) }$ equals the evaluation $\text{cha}_\mathcal{P}^\lambda (q, [t]_q)$ where, as usual, $[t]_q := \frac{ q^t - 1 }{ q-1 }$; naturally, for $q=1$ we recover the Ehrhart polynomial. Our motivating goal is to view Chapoton's work through the lens of Brion's Theorem (1988), which expresses the integer-point structure of a given polytope via that of its vertex cones. It turns out that this viewpoint naturally yields various refinements and extensions of Chapoton's results, including explicit formulas for $\text{cha}_\mathcal{P}^\lambda(q,x)$, its leading coefficient, and its behavior as $t \to \infty$. We also prove an analogue of Chapoton's structural and reciprocity theorems for rational polytopes (i.e., with vertices in $\mathbb{Q}^d$).</description>

      <title>The only Class 0 Flower snark is the smallest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph pebbling is a game played on graphs with pebbles on their vertices. A pebbling move removes two pebbles from one vertex and places one pebble on an adjacent vertex. The pebbling number is the smallest $t$ so that from any initial configuration of $t$ pebbles it is possible, after a sequence of pebbling moves, to place a pebble on any given target vertex. Graphs whose pebbling number is equal to the number of vertices are called Class~$0$ and provide a challenging set of graphs that resist being characterized. In this note, we answer a question recently proposed by the pioneering study on the pebbling number of snark graphs: we prove that the smallest Flower snark $J_3$ is Class~$0$, establishing that $J_3$ is in fact the only Class~$0$ Flower snark.</description>

      <title>Non-affine Families of 8 x 8 Complex Hadamard Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Six non-affine 3-parameter families of complex Hadamard matrices of order 8 are presented. These families contain Hadamard matrices that are not equivalent to any previously known Hadamard matrices in the literature. Each family arises from unimodular points of an affine variety defined by palindromic polynomials. The families are given as an image of a function that solves the corresponding system of polynomials on a domain that guarantees unimodularity of the solutions</description>

      <title>Poset saturation of unions of chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A family $\mathcal{G}$ of sets is a(n induced) copy of a poset $P=(P,\leqslant)$ if there exists a bijection $b:P\rightarrow \mathcal{G}$ such that $p\leqslant q$ holds if and only if $b(p)\subseteq b(q)$. The induced saturation number sat$^*(n,P)$ is the minimum size of a family $\mathcal{F}\subseteq 2^{[n]}$ that does not contain any copy of $P$, but for any $G\in 2^{[n]}\setminus \mathcal{F}$, the family $\mathcal{F}\cup \{G\}$ contains a copy of $P$. We consider sat$^*(n,P)$ for posets $P$ that are formed by pairwise incomparable chains, i.e. $P=\bigoplus_{j=1}^mC_{i_j}$. We make the following two conjectures: (i) sat$^*(n,P)=O(n)$ for all such posets and (ii) sat$^*(n,P)=O(1)$ if not all chains are of the same size. (The second conjecture is known to hold if there is a unique longest among the chains.) We verify these conjectures in some special cases: we prove (i) if all chains are of the same length, we prove (ii) in the first unknown general case: for posets $2C_k+C_1$. Finally, we give an infinite number of examples showing that (ii) is not a necessary condition for sat$^*(n,P)=O(1)$ among posets $P=\bigoplus_{j=1}^mC_{i_j}$: we prove sat$^*(n,(\binom{2t}{t}+1)C_2)=O(1)$ for all $t\ge 1$.</description>

      <title>Cell structure of mediangle graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Genevois introduced and investigated mediangle graphs as a common generalization of median graphs (1-sekeleta of CAT(0) cube complexes) and Coxeter graphs (Cayley graphs of Coxeter groups) and studied groups acting on them. He asked if mediangle graphs can be endowed with the structure of a contractible cell complex. We answer this in the affirmative by proving that (bipartite) mediangle graphs are tope graphs of finitary Complexes of Oriented Matroids (COMs). We also show that the oriented matroids (OMs) constituting the cells of COMs arising from mediangle graphs are exactly the simplicial OMs.</description>

      <title>Algebraic aspects of the polynomial Littlewood-Offord problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a degree-$d$ polynomial $f(\xi_1,\dots,\xi_n)$ of independent Rademacher random variables $\xi_1,\dots,\xi_n$. To what extent can $f(\xi_1,\dots,\xi_n)$ concentrate on a single point? This is the so-called polynomial Littlewood-Offord problem. A nearly optimal bound was proved by Meka, Nguyen and Vu: the point probabilities are always at most about $1/\sqrt n$, unless $f$ is "close to the zero polynomial" (having only $o(n^d)$ nonzero coefficients).
  In this paper we prove several results supporting the general philosophy that the Meka-Nguyen-Vu bound can be significantly improved unless $f$ is "close to a polynomial with special algebraic structure", drawing some comparisons to phenomena in analytic number theory. In particular, one of our results is a corrected version of a conjecture of Costello on multilinear forms (in an appendix with Ashwin Sah and Mehtaab Sawhney, we disprove Costello's original conjecture).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that there exist constants $\delta_1,\delta_2&gt;0$ such that if $G$ is an $(n,d,\lambda)$-graph with $\lambda/d\le\delta_1$, then $G$ contains an induced cycle of length at least $\delta_2n/d$. We further demonstrate that, up to a constant factor, this is best possible. Utilising our techniques, we derive that the number of non-isomorphic induced subgraphs of such $G$ is at least exponential in $n\log d/d$, and further demonstrate that this is tight up to a constant factor in the exponent.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1996, Youngs proved that any quadrangulation of the real projective plane is not 3-chromatic. This result has been extended in various directions over the years, including to other non-orientable closed surfaces, higher-dimensional analogues of quadrangulations and circular colorings. In this paper, we provide a generalization which yields some of these extensions of Youngs' theorem.</description>

      <title>Large induced subgraph with a given pathwidth in outerplanar graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A long-standing conjecture by Albertson and Berman states that every planar graph of order $n$ has an induced forest with at least $\lceil \frac{n}{2} \rceil$ vertices. As a variant of this conjecture, Chappell conjectured that every planar graph of order $n$ has an induced linear forest with at least $\lceil \frac{4n}{9} \rceil$ vertices. Pelsmajer proved that every outerplanar graph of order $n$ has an induced linear forest with at least $\lceil \frac{4n+2}{7}\rceil$ vertices and this bound is sharp. In this paper, we investigate the order of induced subgraphs of outerplanar graphs with a given pathwidth. The above result by Pelsmajer implies that every outerplanar graph of order $n$ has an induced subgraph with pathwidth one and at least $\lceil \frac{4n+2}{7}\rceil$ vertices. We extend this to obtain a result on the maximum order of any outerplanar graph with at most a given pathwidth. We also give its upper bound which generalizes Pelsmajer's construction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We characterize $k$-Schur functions as the graded characters of simple modules of an additive category. This implies conjectures in Chen [thesis, UCBerkeley], and therefore establishes the algebraic framework proposed there. As a consequence, we demonstrate that transformed Macdonald polynomials are $k$-Schur positive, achieving the original motivation behind the definition of $k$-Schur functions by Lapointe-Lascoux-Morse [Duke Math. J. (2003)].</description>

      <title>Ehrhart Bounds for Panhandle and Paving Matroids Through Enumeration of Chain Forests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01640v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Panhandle matroids are a specific family of lattice-path matroids corresponding to panhandle-shaped Ferrers diagrams. Their matroid polytopes are the subpolytopes carved from a hypersimplex to form matroid polytopes of paving matroids. It has been an active area of research to determine which families of matroid polytopes are Ehrhart positive. We prove Ehrhart positivity for panhandle matroid polytopes, thus confirming a conjecture of Hanely, Martin, McGinnis, Miyata, Nasr, Vindas-Mel\'endez, and Yin (2023). Another standing conjecture posed by Ferroni (2022) asserts that the coefficients of the Ehrhart polynomial of a connected matroid are bounded above by those of the corresponding uniform matroid. We prove Ferroni's conjecture for paving matroids -- a class conjectured to asymptotically contain all matroids. These results follow from purely enumerative statements, the main one being conjectured by Hanely et. al concerning the enumeration of a certain class of ordered chain forests.</description>

For two fixed graphs F and H, two players, Max and Mini, alternately claim unclaimed edges of the complete graph Kn such that the graph G of the claimed edges must remain F-free throughout the game. The game ends when no further edges can be claimed, i.e. when G becomes F-saturated. The H-score of the game is the number of copies of H in G. Max aims to maximize the H-score, while Mini wants to minimize it. The H-score of the game when both players play optimally is denoted by s1(n, #H, F) when Max starts, and by s2(n, #H, F) when Mini starts. We study these values for several natural choices of F and H.</description>

      <title>Finding $d$-Cuts in Graphs of Bounded Diameter, Graphs of Bounded Radius and $H$-Free Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11389v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $d$-Cut problem is to decide if a graph has an edge cut such that each vertex has at most $d$ neighbours at the opposite side of the cut. If $d=1$, we obtain the intensively studied Matching Cut problem. The $d$-Cut problem has been studied as well, but a systematic study for special graph classes was lacking. We initiate such a study and consider classes of bounded diameter, bounded radius and $H$-free graphs. We prove that for all $d\geq 2$, $d$-Cut is polynomial-time solvable for graphs of diameter $2$, $(P_3+P_4)$-free graphs and $P_5$-free graphs. These results extend known results for $d=1$. However, we also prove several NP-hardness results for $d$-Cut that contrast known polynomial-time results for $d=1$. Our results lead to full dichotomies for bounded diameter and bounded radius and to almost-complete dichotomies for $H$-free graphs.</description>

      <title>Compactifications of phylogenetic systems and species of electrical networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03431v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe new spaces and maps. Our graphical map is a visual and numerical correspondence between spaces of circular electrical networks and circular planar split systems. When restricted to the planar circular electrical case, this graphical map finds the split system uniquely associated with the Kalmanson resistance distance of the dual network, matching the induced split system familiar from phylogenetics. This correspondence is extended to compactifications of the respective spaces, taking cactus networks to the cactus split systems defined herein. The graphical map preserves both network components and cactus structure, allowing an elegant enumeration of induced phylogenetic split systems via combinatorial species. We introduce the global spaces of circular planar electrical networks and circular split systems. These new spaces are also CW complexes, but the 0-cells of each are counted by the Bell numbers as opposed to the Catalan numbers. As species, the two sorts of global cacti are seen to be compositions in complementary ways.</description>

      <title>Partitioning 2-edge-coloured bipartite graphs into monochromatic cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03394v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given an $r$-edge-colouring of the edges of a graph $G$, we say that it can be partitioned into $p$ monochromatic cycles when there exists a set of $p$ vertex-disjoint monochromatic cycles covering all the vertices of $G$. In the literature of this problem, an edge and a single vertex both count as a cycle.
  We show that for every $2$-colouring of the edges of a complete balanced bipartite graph, $K_{n,n}$, it can be partitioned into at most 4 monochromatic cycles. This type of question was first studied in 1970 for complete graphs and in 1983, by Gy\'arf\'as and Lehel, for $K_{n,n}$. In 2014, Pokrovskiy showed for all $n$ that, given any $2$-colouring of its edges, $K_{n,n}$ can be partitioned into at most three monochromatic paths. It turns out that finding monochromatic cycles instead of paths is a natural question that has also been raised for other graphs. In 2015, Schaudt and Stein showed that 14 cycles are sufficient for sufficiently large $2$-edge-coloured $K_{n,n}$.</description>

      <title>Multipartite nearly orthogonal sets over finite fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07549v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a field $\mathbb{F}$ and integers $d, k$ and $\ell$, a set $A \subseteq \mathbb{F}^d$ is called $(k,\ell)$-nearly orthogonal if all vectors in $A$ are non-self-orthogonal and every $k+1$ vectors in $A$ contain $\ell + 1$ pairwise orthogonal vectors. Recently, Haviv, Mattheus, Milojevi\'{c} and Wigderson have improved the lower bound on nearly orthogonal sets over finite fields, using counting arguments and a hypergraph container lemma. They showed that for every prime $p$ and an integer $\ell$, there is a constant $\delta(p,\ell)$ such that for every field $\mathbb{F}$ of characteristic $p$ and for all integers $d \geq k \geq \ell + 1$, $\mathbb{F}^d$ contains a $(k,\ell)$-nearly orthogonal set of size $d^{\delta k / \log k}$. This nearly matches an upper bound $\binom{d+k}{k}$ coming from Ramsey theory. Moreover, they proved the same lower bound for the size of a largest set $A$ where for any two subsets of $A$ of size $k+1$ each, there is a vector in one of the subsets orthogonal to a vector in the other one. We prove a common generalisation of this result, showing that essentially the same lower bound holds for the size of a largest set $A \subseteq \mathbb{F}^d$ with the stronger property that given any family of subsets $A_1, \ldots, A_{\ell+1} \subseteq A$, each of size $k+1$, we can find a vector in each $A_i$ such that they are all pairwise orthogonal. Rather than combining both counting and container arguments, we make use of a multipartite asymmetric container lemma that allows for non-uniform co-degree conditions. This lemma was first discovered by Campos, Coulson, Serra and W\"otzel, and we provide a new and short proof for this lemma.</description>

      <title>Pattern avoidance in nonnesting permutations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00336v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonnesting permutations are permutations of the multiset $\{1,1,2,2,\dots,n,n\}$ that avoid subsequences of the form $abba$ for any $a\neq b$. These permutations have recently been studied in connection to noncrossing (also called quasi-Stirling) permutations, which are those that avoid subsequences of the form $abab$, and in turn generalize the well-known Stirling permutations. Inspired by the work by Archer et al. on pattern avoidance in noncrossing permutations, we consider the analogous problem in the nonnesting case. We enumerate nonnesting permutations that avoid each set of two or more patterns of length 3, as well as those that avoid some sets of patterns of length 4. We obtain closed formulas and generating functions, some of which involve unexpected appearances of the Catalan and Fibonacci numbers. Our proofs rely on decompositions, recurrences, and bijections.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11437v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores a full generalization of the classical corner-vector method for constructing weighted spherical designs, which we call the {\it generalized corner-vector method}. First we establish a uniform upper bound for the degree of designs obtained from the proposed method. Our proof is a hybrid argument that employs techniques in analysis and combinatorics, especially a famous result by Xu(1998) on the interrelation between spherical designs and simplical designs, and the cross-ratio comparison method for Hilbert identities introduced by Nozaki and Sawa(2013). We extensively study conditions for the existence of designs obtained from our method, and present many curious examples of degree $7$ through $13$, some of which are, to our surprise, characterized in terms of integral lattices.</description>

We prove that structures containing antichains have infinite big Ramsey degrees, and the big Ramsey degree of a 2-element chain is at least 8 and 7 for the binary variant. We deduce that the generic C-relation does not have finite big Ramsey degrees.</description>

      <title>A Unified View of Graph Regularity via Matrix Decompositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.11868</link>
      <description>arXiv:1911.11868v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove algorithmic weak and \Szemeredi{} regularity lemmas for several classes of sparse graphs in the literature, for which only weak regularity lemmas were previously known. These include core-dense graphs, low threshold rank graphs, and (a version of) $L^p$ upper regular graphs. More precisely, we define \emph{cut pseudorandom graphs}, we prove our regularity lemmas for these graphs, and then we show that cut pseudorandomness captures all of the above graph classes as special cases.
  The core of our approach is an abstracted matrix decomposition, roughly following Frieze and Kannan [Combinatorica '99] and \Lovasz{} and Szegedy [Geom.\ Func.\ Anal.\ '07], which can be computed by a simple algorithm by Charikar [AAC0 '00]. This gives rise to the class of cut pseudorandom graphs, and using work of Oveis Gharan and Trevisan [TOC '15], it also implies new PTASes for MAX-CUT, MAX-BISECTION, MIN-BISECTION for a significantly expanded class of input graphs. (It is NP Hard to get PTASes for these graphs in general.)</description>

Abstract: In the classical model of random recursive trees, trees are recursively built by attaching new vertices to old ones. What happens if vertices are allowed to freeze, in the sense that new vertices cannot be attached to already frozen ones? We are interested in the impact of freezing on the height of such trees.</description>

      <title>Pairwise Rearrangement is Fixed-Parameter Tractable in the Single Cut-and-Join Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01942v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Genome rearrangement is a common model for molecular evolution. In this paper, we consider the Pairwise Rearrangement problem, which takes as input two genomes and asks for the number of minimum-length sequences of permissible operations transforming the first genome into the second. In the Single Cut-and-Join model (Bergeron, Medvedev, &amp; Stoye, J. Comput. Biol. 2010), Pairwise Rearrangement is $\#\textsf{P}$-complete (Bailey, et. al., COCOON 2023), which implies that exact sampling is intractable. In order to cope with this intractability, we investigate the parameterized complexity of this problem. We exhibit a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm with respect to the number of components in the adjacency graph that are not cycles of length $2$ or paths of length $1$. As a consequence, we obtain that Pairwise Rearrangement in the Single Cut-and-Join model is fixed-parameter tractable by distance. Our results suggest that the number of nontrivial components in the adjacency graph serves as the key obstacle for efficient sampling.</description>

      <title>The Asymptotic Structure of Cosmological Integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06558v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a general analysis of the asymptotic behaviour of perturbative contributions to observables in arbitrary power-law FRW cosmologies, indistinctly the Bunch-Davies wavefunction and cosmological correlators. We consider a large class of scalar toy models, including conformally-coupled and massless scalars in arbitrary dimensions, that admits a first principle definition in terms of (generalised/weighted) cosmological polytopes. The perturbative contributions to an observable can be expressed as an integral of the canonical function associated to such polytopes and to weighted graphs. We show how the asymptotic behaviour of these integrals is governed by a special class of nestohedra living in the graph-weight space, both at tree and loop level. As the singularities of a cosmological process described by a graph can be associated to its subgraphs, we provide a realisation of the nestohedra as a sequential truncation of a top-dimensional simplex based on the underlying graph. This allows us to determine all the possible directions -- both in the infrared and in the ultraviolet --, where the integral can diverge as well as their divergence degree. Both of them are associated to the facets of the nestohedra, which are identified by overlapping tubings of the graph: the specific tubing determines the divergent directions while the number of overlapping tubings its degree of divergence. This combinatorial formulation makes straightforward the application of sector decomposition for extracting both leading and subleading divergences from the integral, as the sectors in which the integration domain can be tiled are identified by the collection of compatible facets of the nestohedra, with the latter that can be determined via the graph tubings. Finally, the leading divergence can be interpreted as a restriction of the canonical function of the relevant polytope onto a special hyperplane.</description>

      <title>A combinatorial approach to nonlinear spectral gaps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04394v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A seminal open question of Pisier and Mendel--Naor asks whether every degree-regular graph which satisfies the classical discrete Poincar\'e inequality for scalar functions, also satisfies an analogous inequality for functions taking values in \textit{any} normed space with non-trivial cotype. Motivated by applications, it is also greatly important to quantify the dependence of the corresponding optimal Poincar\'e constant on the cotype $q$. Works of Odell--Schlumprecht (1994), Ozawa (2004), and Naor (2014) make substantial progress on the former question by providing a positive answer for normed spaces which also have an unconditional basis, in addition to finite cotype. However, little is known in the way of quantitative estimates: the mentioned results imply a bound on the Poincar\'e constant depending super-exponentially on $q$.
  We introduce a novel combinatorial framework for proving quantitative nonlinear spectral gap estimates. The centerpiece is a property of regular graphs that we call \emph{long range expansion}, which holds with high probability for random regular graphs. Our main result is that any regular graph with the long-range expansion property satisfies a discrete Poincar\'{e} inequality for any normed space with an unconditional basis and cotype $q$, with a Poincar\'{e} constant that depends \emph{polynomially} on $q$, which is optimal. As an application, any normed space with an unconditional basis which admits a low distortion embedding of an $n$-vertex random regular graph, must have cotype at least polylogarithmic in $n$. This extends a celebrated lower-bound of Matou\v{s}ek for low distortion embeddings of random graphs into $\ell_q$ spaces.</description>

This class is strictly larger than the class of classical compactified Jacobians, as constructed by Oda-Seshadri, Simpson, Caporaso and Esteves.
  We characterize V-compactified Jacobians as the compactified Jacobians that can arise as limits of Jacobians of smooth curves under a one-parameter smoothing of the nodal curve, extending previous works on fine compactified Jacobians by Pagani-Tommasi and Viviani to the case of all compactified Jacobians.</description>

Abstract: We define a combinatorial object that can be associated with any conic-line arrangement with ordinary singularities, which we call the combinatorial Poincar\'e polynomial. We prove a Terao-type factorization statement on the splitting of such a polynomial over the rationals under the assumption that our conic-line arrangements are free and admit ordinary quasi-homogeneous singularities. Then we focus on the so-called $d$-arrangements in the plane. In particular, we provide a combinatorial constraint for free $d$-arrangements admitting ordinary quasi-homogeneous singularities.</description>
