      <title>The PLATO Multiple Star Working Group (MSWG)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The PLATO mission is scheduled for launch in December 2026. It is an ESA M-class mission designed to find small planets around bright stars via the transit technique. The light curves it obtains will be wonderful for other science goals, among which is the study of binary and multiple stars. We are creating the Multiple Star Working Group (MSWG) to bring together the community to best exploit this unique opportunity. We will assemble the many science cases, create target lists, and co-ordinate applications for PLATO observations. We include instructions on how to register your interest.</description>

      <title>Metis Observations of Alfv\'{e}nic Outflows Driven by Interchange Reconnection in a Pseudostreamer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents observations of a large pseudostreamer solar eruption and, in particular, the post-eruption relaxation phase, as captured by Metis onboard the Solar Orbiter on October 12, 2022, during its perihelion passage. Utilizing total brightness data, we observe the outward propagation of helical features up to 3 solar radii along a radial column that appears to correspond to the stalk of the pseudostreamer. The helical structures persisted for more than 3 hours following a jet-like coronal mass ejection associated with a polar crown prominence eruption. A notable trend is revealed: the inclination of these features decreases as their polar angle and height increase. Additionally, we measured their helix pitch. Despite a 2-minute time cadence limiting direct correspondence among filamentary structures in consecutive frames, we find that the Metis helical structure may be interpreted as a consequence of twist (nonlinear torsional Alfv\'{e}n waves) and plasma liberated by interchange reconnection. A comparison was performed of the helix parameters as outlined by fine-scale outflow features with those obtained from synthetic white-light images derived from the high-resolution magnetohydrodynamics simulation of interchange reconnection in a pseudostreamer topology by Wyper et al. (2022). A remarkable similarity between the simulation-derived images and the observations was found. We conjecture that these Metis observations may represent the upper end in spatial and energy scale of the interchange reconnection process that has been proposed recently as the origin of the Alfv\'{e}nic solar wind.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the Gaia Data Release 3 parallax bias at bright magnitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The combination of visual and spectroscopic orbits in binary systems enables precise distance measurements without additional assumptions, making them ideal for examining the parallax zero-point offset (PZPO) at bright magnitudes (G &lt; 13) in Gaia. We compiled 249 orbital parallaxes from 246 binary systems and used Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations to exclude binaries where orbital motion significantly impacts parallaxes. After removing systems with substantial parallax errors, large discrepancies between orbital and Gaia parallaxes, and selecting systems with orbital periods under 100 days, a final sample of 44 binaries was retained.The weighted mean PZPO for this sample is -38.9 $\pm$ 10.3 $\mu$as, compared to -58.0 $\pm$ 10.1 $\mu$as for the remaining systems, suggesting that orbital motion significantly affects parallax measurements. These formal uncertainties of the PZPO appear to be underestimated by a factor of approximately 2.0. For bright stars with independent trigonometric parallaxes from VLBI and HST, the weighted mean PZPOs are -14.8 $\pm$ 10.6 and -31.9 $\pm$ 14.1 $\mu$as, respectively. Stars with $G \leq 8$ exhibit a more pronounced parallax bias, with some targets showing unusually large deviations, likely due to systematic calibration errors in Gaia for bright stars. The orbital parallaxes dataset compiled in this work serves as a vital resource for validating parallaxes in future Gaia data releases.</description>

      <title>Investigating Solar Wind Outflows from Open-Closed Magnetic Field Structures Using Coordinated Solar Orbiter and Hinode Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ESA/NASA's Solar Orbiter (SO) allows us to study the solar corona at closer distances and from different perspectives, which helps us to gain significant insights into the origins of the solar wind. In this work, we present the analysis of solar wind outflows from two locations: a narrow open-field corridor and a small, mid-latitude coronal hole. These outflows were observed off-limb by the Metis coronagraph onboard SO and on-disk by the Extreme Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) onboard Hinode. Magnetic field extrapolations suggest that the upflow regions seen in EIS were the sources of the outflowing solar wind observed with Metis. We find that the plasma associated with the narrow open-field corridor has higher electron densities and lower outflow velocities compared to the coronal hole plasma in the middle corona, even though the plasma properties of the two source regions in the low corona are found to be relatively similar. The speed of solar wind from the open-field corridor also shows no correlation with the magnetic field expansion factor, unlike the coronal hole. These pronounced differences at higher altitudes may arise from the dynamic nature of the low-middle corona, in which reconnection can readily occur and may play an important role in driving solar wind variability.</description>

      <title>Stability and Dynamics of Three-Mode Coupling in $\delta$ Scuti Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations of $\delta$ Scuti stars find evidence of nonlinear three-mode coupling in their oscillation spectra. There are two types of three-mode coupling likely to be important in $\delta$ Scuti stars: (i) direct coupling, in which two linearly unstable modes (driven by the kappa-mechanism) excite a linearly stable mode, and (ii) parametric coupling, in which one linearly unstable mode excites two linearly stable modes. Breger &amp; Montgomery (2014) find especially strong evidence of direct coupling in the $\delta$ Scuti star KIC 8054146. However, direct coupling is inherently unstable and cannot be the mechanism by which the modes saturate and achieve nonlinear equilibrium. By integrating the amplitude equations of small mode networks, we show that the modes can achieve equilibrium if parametric coupling operates in tandem with direct coupling. Using mode parameters calculated from a $\delta$ Scuti model, we also find that parametric and direct coupling are likely to be simultaneously active. Importantly, parametric coupling does not necessarily disrupt the correlations found in KIC 8054146 between the amplitudes and phases of the directly coupled modes. We conclude that $\delta$ Scuti stars are likely impacted by both parametric and direct coupling and that accounting for both in future large mode network calculations may help explain the complicated mode dynamics observed in many $\delta$ Scuti stars.</description>

      <title>A Machine Learning-Ready Data Processing Tool for Near Real-Time Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Space weather forecasting is critical for mitigating radiation risks in space exploration and protecting Earth-based technologies from geomagnetic disturbances. This paper presents the development of a Machine Learning (ML)- ready data processing tool for Near Real-Time (NRT) space weather forecasting. By merging data from diverse NRT sources such as solar imagery, magnetic field measurements, and energetic particle fluxes, the tool addresses key gaps in current space weather prediction capabilities. The tool processes and structures the data for machine learning models, focusing on time-series forecasting and event detection for extreme solar events. It provides users with a framework to download, process, and label data for ML applications, streamlining the workflow for improved NRT space weather forecasting and scientific research.</description>

      <title>Nuclear Fusion Enhancement by Heavy Nuclear Catalysts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We seek to understand the effect of high electron density in the proximity of a heavy nucleus on the fusion reaction rates in a hot plasma phase. We investigate quantitatively the catalytic effect of gold ($Z=79$) ions embedded in an electron plasma created due to plasmonic focusing of high-intensity short laser pulses. Using self-consistent strong plasma screening, we find highly significant changes in the internuclear potential of light elements present nearby. For gold, we see a $14\,$keV change in the internuclear potential near the nuclear surface, independent of the long-distance thermal Debye-H\"uckel screening. The dense polarization cloud of electrons around the gold catalyst leads to a $\sim 1.5$ enhancement of proton-boron ($^{11}$B) fusion above $T=100\,$keV.</description>

      <title>The Magnetically Induced Radial Velocity Variation of Gliese 341 and an Upper Limit to the Mass of Its Transiting Earth-sized Planet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission identified a potential 0.88 REarth planet with a period of 7.577 days, orbiting the nearby M1V star GJ 341 (TOI 741.01). This system has already been observed by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to search for presence of an atmosphere on this planet. Here, we present an in-depth analysis of the GJ 341 system using all available public data. We provide improved parameters for the host star, an updated value of the planet radius, and support the planetary nature of the object (now GJ 341 b). We use 57 HARPS radial velocities to model the magnetic cycle and activity of the host star, and constrain the mass of GJ 341 b to upper limits of 4.0 MEarth (3 sigma) and 2.9 MEarth (1 sigma). We also rule out the presence of additional companions with M sin i &gt; 15.1 MEarth, and P &lt; 1750 days, and the presence of contaminating background objects during the TESS and JWST observations. These results provide key information to aid the interpretation of the recent JWST atmospheric observations and other future observations of this planet.</description>

      <title>Long-Term X-ray Variability on the Benchmark YSO HL Tau</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: HL Tau is one of the most well-studied Class I young stellar objects, including frequent observations at near- and mid-infrared, (sub-) millimeter, and X-ray wavelengths. We present the results of an X-ray variability monitoring campaign with XMM-Newton in 2020 and X-ray gratings spectroscopy from Chandra/HETGS in 2018. We find that the X-ray spectrum of HL Tau is consistently hot (with characteristic plasma temperatures $T \gtrsim 30$ MK) over 31 epochs spanning 20 years, which is consistent in temperature with most Class I YSOs. The high-resolution HETG spectrum indicates the presence of some cooler plasma. We characterize the variability of the star across the 31 observations and find a subset of observations with significant variability on a $\sim$21-day timescale in the observed count rate and flux. We discuss the possible origins of this variability, and identify further observations that would better constrain the nature of the changes.</description>

      <title>In-depth characterization of the Kepler-10 three-planet system with HARPS-N RVs and Kepler TTVs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The old G3V star Kepler-10 is known to host two transiting planets, the ultra-short-period super-Earth Kepler-10b ($P=0.837$ d; $R_{\rm p}=1.47~\rm R_\oplus$) and the long-period sub-Neptune Kepler-10c ($P=45.294$ d; $R_{\rm p}=2.35~\rm R_\oplus$), and a non-transiting planet causing variations in the Kepler-10c transit times. Measurements of the mass of Kepler-10c in the literature have shown disagreement, depending on the radial-velocity dataset and/or the modeling technique used. Here we report on the analysis of almost 300 high-precision radial velocities gathered with the HARPS-N spectrograph at the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo over $\sim11$~years, and extracted with the YARARA-v2 tool correcting for possible systematics and/or low-level activity variations at the spectrum level. To model these radial velocities, we used three different noise models and various numerical techniques, which all converged to the solution: $M_{\rm p, b}=3.24 \pm 0.32~\rm M_\oplus$ (10$\sigma$) and $\rho_{\rm p, b}=5.54 \pm 0.64~\rm g\;cm^{-3}$ for planet b; $M_{\rm p, c}=11.29 \pm 1.24~\rm M_\oplus$ (9$\sigma$) and $\rho_{\rm p, c}=4.75 \pm 0.53~\rm g\;cm^{-3}$ for planet c; and $M_{\rm p, d}\sin{i}=12.00 \pm 2.15~\rm M_\oplus$ (6$\sigma$) and $P=151.06 \pm 0.48$ d for the non-transiting planet Kepler-10d. This solution is further supported by the analysis of the Kepler-10c transit timing variations and their simultaneous modeling with the HARPS-N radial velocities. While Kepler-10b is consistent with a rocky composition and a small or no iron core, Kepler-10c may be a water world that formed beyond the water snowline and subsequently migrated inward.</description>

      <title>On the light-curves of disk and bulge novae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the light curves of a sample of novae, classifying them into single-peaked and multiple-peaked morphologies. Using accurate distances from Gaia, we determine the spatial distribution of these novae by computing their heights, $Z$, above the Galactic plane. We show that novae exhibiting a single peak in their light curves tend to concentrate near the Galactic plane, while those displaying multiple peaks are more homogeneously distributed, reaching heights up to 1000 pc above the plane. A KS test rejects the null hypothesis that the two distributions originate from the same population at a significance level corresponding to $4.2\sigma$.</description>

      <title>Disk reflection and energetics from the accreting millisecond pulsar SRGA J144459.2-604207</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accreting millisecond pulsars (AMSPs) are excellent laboratories to study reflection spectra and their features from an accretion disk truncated by a rapidly rotating magnetosphere near the neutron star surface. These systems also exhibit thermonuclear (type-I) bursts that can provide insights on the accretion physics and fuel composition. We explore spectral properties of the AMSP SRGA J144459.2-0604207 observed during the outburst that recently led to its discovery in February 2024. We aim to characterize the spectral shape of the persistent emission, both its continuum and discrete features, and to analyze type-I bursts properties. We employ XMM and NuSTAR overlapping observations taken during the most recent outburst from SRGA J1444. We perform spectral analysis of the persistent (i.e., non-bursting) emission employing a semi-phenomenological continuum model composed of a dominant thermal Comptonization plus two thermal contributions, and a physical reflection model. We also perform time-resolved spectral analysis of a type-I burst employing a blackbody model. We observe a broadened iron emission line, thus suggesting relativistic effects, supported by the physical model accounting for relativistically blurred reflection. The resulting accretion disk extends down to 6 gravitational radii, inclined at ~$53^{\circ}$, and only moderately ionized (log$\xi\simeq2.3$). We observe an absorption edge at ~9.7 keV that can be interpreted as an Fe XXVI edge blueshifted by an ultrafast ($\simeq0.04$c) outflow. Our broadband observations of type-I bursts do not find evidence of photospheric radius expansion. The burst recurrence time shows a dependence on the count rate with the steepest slope ever observed in these systems. We also observe a discrepancy of ~3 between the observed and expected burst recurrence time, which we discuss in the framework of fuel composition and high NS mass scenarios.</description>

      <title>TuMag: the tunable magnetograph for the Sunrise III mission</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the instruments aboard the Sunrise III mission, the Tunable Magnetograph (TuMag), is a tunable imaging spectropolarimeter in visible wavelengths. It is designed to probe the vector magnetic field and the line-of-sight velocity of the photosphere and the lower chromosphere. The quasi-simultaneous observation of two spectral lines provides excellent diagnostic measurements of the magnetic and dynamic coupling in these layers.
  The key technologies employed for TuMag are an LCVR-based polarimeter and a solid, LiNbO3 Fabry-P\'erot etalon as a spectrometer. However, it also incorporates several innovative features, such as home-made high-sensitivity scientific cameras and a double filter wheel. TuMag can sequentially observe any two out of the three spectral lines of Fe I at 525.02 and 525.06 nm and of Mg I at 517.3 nm.
  Laboratory measurements have demonstrated outstanding performance, including a wavefront root-mean-square error better than {\lambda}/13 for image quality, a full-width-at-half-maximum of 8.7 pm for the filtergraph transmission profile, and polarimetric efficiencies &gt; 0.54. Here we report on the concept, design, calibration, and integration phases of the instrument, as well as on the data reduction pipeline.</description>

      <title>Impact of accretor size on the morphology of supersonic Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fast-moving accretors are ubiquitous in astrophysics. Their interaction with surrounding gas leaves characteristic imprints, forming structures like bow shocks, Mach cones, and density trails. We study how various physical processes affect the flow structure around an accretor with a one-way surface, its accretion rate, and accretion anisotropy. These processes correspond to distinct length scales: the Bondi radius, the bow shock's stand-off distance, and the Hoyle-Lyttleton radius. We conducted adiabatic hydrodynamic simulations using a spherical coordinate grid centred on the accretor. By varying the accretor's (numerical) size across scales -- from much smaller than the stand-off distance to much larger than the Bondi radius -- we analyse how these spatial scales affect steady-state flow physics. All simulations reach a steady state. When the accretor is smaller than the stand-off distance, a bow shock forms ahead, and a nearly spherically symmetric atmosphere develops within. Accretors smaller than the Hoyle-Lyttleton radius produce a Mach cone, while larger ones exhibit a supersonic-to-subsonic flow transition on larger scales. Fully resolved simulations align with Hoyle-Lyttleton theory, showing slightly anisotropic accretion with enhanced inflow from behind. In contrast, larger accretors approach the geometrical limit, accreting mainly from the flow direction, with a low-density 'shadow' forming behind. The accretor's size strongly influences small- and large-scale morphologies. Resolving the Hoyle-Lyttleton radius is essential for capturing large-scale flow characteristics. Resolving the stand-off distance is needed only to study the bow shock: since it determines the shock's position, its non-resolution does not affect large-scale flow morphology.</description>

      <title>Secondary ionisation in hot atmospheres and interactions between planetary and stellar winds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The loss of close-in planetary atmospheres is influenced by various physical processes, such as photoionisation, which could potentially affect the atmosphere survivability on a secular timescale. The amount of stellar radiation converted into heat depends on the energy of the primary electrons produced by photoionisation and the local ionisation fraction. The Lyman-alpha line is an excellent probe for atmospheric escape. We study the interaction between the planetary and the stellar wind, the difference of the predicted mass-loss rates between 1D and 2D models, the signal of Ly-a and the impact of stellar flares. Using the PLUTO code, we perform 2D hydrodynamics simulations for four different planets. We consider planets in the size range from Neptune to Jupiter. We produce synthetic Ly-a profiles to comprehend the origin of the signal, and in particular its high velocity Doppler shift. Our results indicate a trend similar to the 1D models, with a decrease in the planetary mass-loss rate for all systems when secondary ionisation is taken into account. The mass-loss rates are found to decrease by 48% for the least massive planet when secondary ionisation is accounted for. We find nevertheless a decrease that is less pronounced in 2D than in 1D. We observe differences in the Ly-a profile between the different cases and significant asymmetries in all of them, especially for the lower mass planets. Finally, we observe that stellar flares do not affect the mass-loss rate because they act, in general, on a timescale that is too short. We find velocities in the escaping atmosphere up to 100 km/s, with the gas moving away from the star, which could be the result of the interaction with the stellar wind. Furthermore, we find that stellar flares generally occur on a timescale that is too short to have a visible impact on the mass-loss rate of the atmosphere.</description>

      <title>PDRs4All XI. Detection of infrared CH$^+$ and CH$_3^+$ rovibrational emission in the Orion Bar and disk d203-506: evidence of chemical pumping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The methylidyne cation (CH$^+$) and the methyl cation (CH$_3^+$) are building blocks of organic molecules, yet their coupled formation and excitation mechanisms remain mainly unprobed. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), with its high spatial resolution and good spectral resolution, provides unique access to the detection of these molecules. Our goal is to use the first detection of CH$^+$ and CH$_3^+$ rovibrational emission in the Orion Bar and in the protoplanetary disk d203-506, irradiated by the Trapezium cluster, to probe their formation and excitation mechanisms and constrain the physico-chemical conditions. We use spectro-imaging acquired using both the NIRSpec and MIRI-MRS instruments to study the CH$^+$ and CH$_3^+$ spatial distribution at very small scales, and compare it to excited H$_2$ emission. CH$^+$ and CH$_3^+$ emissions originate from the same region as highly excited H$_2$. Our comparison between the Bar and d203-506 reveals that both CH$^+$ and CH$_3^+$ excitation and/or formation are highly dependent on gas density. The excitation temperature of the observed CH$^+$ and CH$_3^+$ rovibrational lines is around $T$ ~ 1500 K in the Bar and $T$ ~ 800 K in d203-506. Moreover, the column densities derived from the rovibrational emission are less than 0.1 % of the total known (CH$^+$) and expected (CH$_3^+$) column densities. These results show that CH$^+$ and CH$_3^+$ level populations strongly deviate from ETL. CH$^+$ rovibrational emission can be explained by chemical formation pumping with excited H$_2$ via C$^+$ + H$_2^*$ = CH$^+$ + H. These results support a gas phase formation pathway of CH$^+$ and CH$_3^+$ via successive hydrogen abstraction reactions. However, we do not find any evidence of CH$_2^+$ emission in the JWST spectrum. Finally, observed CH$^+$ intensities coupled with chemical formation pumping model provide a diagnostic tool to trace the local density.</description>

      <title>Recovering the structure of debris disks non-parametrically from images</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Debris disks common around Sun-like stars carry dynamical imprints in their structure that are key to understanding the formation and evolution history of planetary systems. In this paper, we extend an algorithm (rave) originally developed to model edge-on disks to be applicable to disks at all inclinations. The updated algorithm allows for non-parametric recovery of the underlying (i.e., deconvolved) radial profile and vertical height of optically thin, axisymmetric disks imaged in either thermal emission or scattered light. Application to simulated images demonstrates that the de-projection and deconvolution performance allows for accurate recovery of features comparable to or larger than the beam or PSF size, with realistic uncertainties that are independent of model assumptions. We apply our method to recover the radial profile and vertical height of a sample of 18 inclined debris disks observed with ALMA. Our recovered structures largely agree with those fitted with an alternative visibility-space de-projection and deconvolution method (frank). We find that for disks in the sample with a well-defined main belt, the belt radius, fractional width and fractional outer edge width all tend to increase with age, but do not correlate in a clear or monotonic way with dust mass or stellar temperature. In contrast, the scale height aspect ratio does not strongly correlate with age, but broadly increases with stellar temperature. These trends could reflect a combination of intrinsic collisional evolution in the disk and the interaction of perturbing planets with the disk's own gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11105v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Knowledge about the internal physical structure of stars is crucial to understanding their evolution. The novel binary population synthesis code POSYDON includes a module for interpolating the stellar and binary properties of any system at the end of binary MESA evolution based on a pre-computed set of models. In this work, we present a new emulation method for predicting stellar profiles, i.e., the internal stellar structure along the radial axis, using machine learning techniques. We use principal component analysis for dimensionality reduction and fully-connected feed-forward neural networks for making predictions. We find accuracy to be comparable to that of nearest neighbor approximation, with a strong advantage in terms of memory and storage efficiency. By providing a versatile framework for modeling stellar internal structure, the emulation method presented here will enable faster simulations of higher physical fidelity, offering a foundation for a wide range of large-scale population studies of stellar and binary evolution.</description>

      <title>Enabling high mass accretion rates onto massive main sequence stars by outer envelope mass removal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03947v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the one-dimensional numerical code MESA, we simulate mass accretion at very high rates onto massive main sequence stars, M=30, 60, 80 Mo, and find that these stars can accrete up to 10% of their mass without expanding much if we consider a simultaneous mass removal by jets. In this jetted-mass-removal accretion scenario, the accretion is through an accretion disk that launches jets. When the star expands due to rapid mass accretion, it engulfs the inner zones of the accretion disk and the jets it launches. We assume that these jets remove the outer layers of the envelope. We mimic this in the one-dimensional numerical code by alternating mass addition and mass removal parts. We add mass and energy, the accretion energy, to the outer layers of the envelope, leading to rapid stellar expansion. When the star expands by a few tens of percent, we stop mass addition and start mass removal until the star returns to its initial radius. We also show that the density of the accretion disk is larger than the density of the outer layers of the inflated envelope, allowing the disk to launch jets inside the outer inflated envelope layers. Our results show that main sequence stars can accrete mass at high rates while maintaining the deep potential well, as some models of eruptive systems require, e.g., some luminous red novae, the grazing envelope evolution, and the 1837-1856 Great Eruption of Eta Carinae.</description>

      <title>Impact of radiative accelerations on the stellar characterization of FGK-type stars using spectroscopic and seismic constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05025v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chemical transport mechanisms are fundamental processes in stellar evolution models. They are responsible for the chemical distribution, and their impact determines how accurately we can characterize stars. Radiative accelerations are one of these processes. They allow the accumulation of elements at different depths in the star. We aim to assess the impact of radiative accelerations on the modeling of FGK-type stars and their impact on the prediction of surface abundances. To reduce the cost of the computation of radiative accelerations, we implemented the single-valued parameters (SVP) method in the stellar evolution code MESA. The SVP method is more efficient in calculating radiative accelerations, which enables computations of large enough grids of models for stellar characterization. Compared to models that include atomic diffusion (with only gravitational settling), the inclusion of radiative accelerations has a small effect on the inference of fundamental properties, with an impact of 2\%, 0.7\%, and 5\% for mass, radius, and age. However, the treatment of radiative accelerations is necessary to predict the chemical composition of and accurately characterize stars.</description>

      <title>Gaia 19cwm - an eclipsing dwarf nova of WZ Sge type with a magnetic white dwarf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07447v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spectral and photometric studies of the cataclysmic variable Gaia 19cwm (or ZTF19aamkwxk) have been performed. Based on the analysis of long-term variability, it is concluded that the object belongs to WZ Sge type stars. The light curves show eclipses recurring with an orbital period of $86.32048 \pm 0.00005$ min, as well as an out-of-eclipse variability with a period of $\approx 6.45$ min. The latter period is stable for $\sim 4$ years and appears to correspond to the rotation of a magnetic white dwarf, i.e., Gaia 19cwm is an intermediate polar. The Gaia 19cwm spectra show photospheric lines of the white dwarf, and Doppler tomograms demonstrate the presence of an accretion disk and a hot spot. Analysis of the eclipse light curve gives an estimates of the white dwarf mass $M_1 = 0.66\pm0.06$ M$_{\odot}$, the donor mass $M_2 = 0.073 \pm 0.015$ M$_{\odot}$, and the orbital inclination $i=83.8 \pm 1.1^{\circ}$. Modeling of the spectral energy distribution gives the white dwarf temperature of $T_{eff}\approx 13000 $ K. The X-ray luminosity $L_X = (1.6 \pm 0.3) \times 10^{31}$ erg/s allows to assign Gaia 19cwm to a small group of low-luminosity intermediate polars.</description>

      <title>The SPIRou Legacy Survey: near-infrared and optical radial velocity analysis of Gl 480 and Gl 382 using SPIRou, HARPS and CARMENES spectrographs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07086v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Context: Advancements in the field of exoplanetary research have extended radial velocity (RV) observations from the optical to the near-infrared (nIR) domain. M dwarf stars, characterized by their lower masses and higher prevalence of rocky planets, have become a focal point of investigation. This study uses data from the near-infrared spectropolarimeter SPIRou and data available in the literature from the HARPS and CARMENES spectrographs operating in the optical to analyze RVs of two nearby M dwarfs, Gl 480 and Gl 382.
  Aims: This work aims to detect and characterize exoplanetary companions around Gl 480 and Gl 382 by mitigating stellar activity effects through advanced data analysis techniques. The study seeks to improve the reliability of RV signals by integrating multi-wavelength observations and stellar activity diagnostics.
  Methods: The study employs a comprehensive approach that combines the line-by-line (LBL) framework with the Wapiti (Weighted principAl comPonent analysIs reconsTructIon) method to correct for systematics in SPIRou data. Through an extensive analysis of available stellar activity indicators and by combining optical data from the HARPS and CARMENES instruments, we perform a joint analysis of RV measurements in both the nIR and optical domains.
  Results: Our analysis confirms the detection of a planet orbiting Gl 480 with a period of $9.5537 \pm 0.0005$ d and a minimum mass of $8.8 \pm 0.7$ M$_\oplus$. Additionally, we detect a tentative signal at 6.4 d, whose significance depends strongly on the choice of Gaussian Process priors constrained by stellar activity indicators and would require further observations for confirmation. In contrast, no planetary signals are detected for Gl 382, where RV variations are dominated by stellar activity.</description>

Abstract: We present the analysis of NOEMA interferometric observations of the high-mass star-forming region W75N(B) with a focus on molecular composition and distribution of prebiotic molecules in the source's multiple cores. Over twenty molecules are identified across the region, with many being fit for column density, rotational temperature, spectral line full width half maximum, and v$_{lsr}$. This work includes the first known detection and initial analysis of complex organic molecules in the MM2 and MM3 regions. Furthermore, parameter maps were created from the six molecules that were well fit across multiple regions. The molecular emission was imaged and correlated across different molecules and the continuum to reveal structural features. From the spatial and spectral analysis of the MM1 region, these results concur with those from other studies showing that there is a difference in chemical composition between the MM1a and MM1b regions, with sulfur-bearing molecules tracing MM1a and organic molecules tracing MM1b. The molecular emission imaged toward the MM3 region reveals two peaks, possibly indicating the presence of multiple young stellar objects. These results provide detailed quantitative information about the physical parameters and distributions of molecules in this source. Additionally, these results are part of a follow-up of a single-dish survey of multiple star-forming regions and are discussed in this context.</description>
