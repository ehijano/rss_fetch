      <title>Photoluminescence Mapping over Laser Pulse Fluence and Repetition Rate as a Fingerprint of Charge and Defect Dynamics in Perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Defects in metal halide perovskites (MHP) are photosensitive, making the observer effect unavoidable when laser spectroscopy methods are applied. Photoluminescence (PL) bleaching and enhancement under light soaking and recovery in dark are examples of the transient phenomena that are consequent to the creation and healing of defects. Depending on the initial sample composition, environment, and other factors, the defect nature and evolution can strongly vary, making spectroscopic data analysis prone to misinterpretations. Herein, the use of an automatically acquired dependence of PL quantum yield (PLQY) on the laser pulse repetition rate and pulse fluence as a unique fingerprint of both charge carrier dynamics and defect evolution is demonstrated. A simple visual comparison of such fingerprints allows for assessment of similarities and differences between MHP samples. The study illustrates this by examining methylammonium lead triiodide (MAPbI3) films with altered stoichiometry that just after preparation showed very pronounced defect dynamics at time scale from milliseconds to seconds, clearly distorting the PLQY fingerprint. Upon weeks of storage, the sample fingerprints evolve toward the standard stoichiometric MAPbI3 in terms of both charge carrier dynamics and defect stability. Automatic PLQY mapping can be used as a universal method for assessment of perovskite sample quality.</description>

      <title>High-efficiency perovskite-organic blend light-emitting diodes featuring self-assembled monolayers as hole-injecting interlayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high photoluminescence efficiency, color purity, extended gamut, and solution processability make low-dimensional hybrid perovskites attractive for light-emitting diode (PeLED) applications. However, controlling the microstructure of these materials to improve the device performance remains challenging. Here, the development of highly efficient green PeLEDs based on blends of the quasi-2D (q2D) perovskite, PEA2Cs4Pb5Br16, and the wide bandgap organic semiconductor 2,7 dioctyl[1] benzothieno[3,2-b]benzothiophene (C8-BTBT) is reported. The presence of C8-BTBT enables the formation of single-crystal-like q2D PEA2Cs4Pb5Br16 domains that are uniform and highly luminescent. Combining the PEA2Cs4Pb5Br16:C8-BTBT with self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) as hole-injecting layers (HILs), yields green PeLEDs with greatly enhanced performance characteristics, including external quantum efficiency up to 18.6%, current efficiency up to 46.3 cd/A, the luminance of 45 276 cd m^-2, and improved operational stability compared to neat PeLEDs. The enhanced performance originates from multiple synergistic effects, including enhanced hole-injection enabled by the SAM HILs, the single crystal-like quality of the perovskite phase, and the reduced concentration of electronic defects. This work highlights perovskite:organic blends as promising systems for use in LEDs, while the use of SAM HILs creates new opportunities toward simpler and more stable PeLEDs.</description>

      <title>Phase-Field Modeling of Fracture with Physics-Informed Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the potential of the deep Ritz method to learn complex fracture processes such as quasistatic crack nucleation, propagation, kinking, branching, and coalescence within the unified variational framework of phase-field modeling of brittle fracture. We elucidate the challenges related to the neural-network-based approximation of the energy landscape, and the ability of an optimization approach to reach the correct energy minimum, and we discuss the choices in the construction and training of the neural network which prove to be critical to accurately and efficiently capture all the relevant fracture phenomena. The developed method is applied to several benchmark problems and the results are shown to be in qualitative and quantitative agreement with the finite element solution. The robustness of the approach is tested by using neural networks with different initializations.</description>

      <title>Improving nuclear magnetic resonance and electron spin resonance thermometry with size reduction of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermometry based on magnetic resonance has been extensively studied due to its important application in biomedical imaging. In our previous work, we showed that the spin-spin relaxation time (T2) of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) in water is a highly sensitive thermometer as T2 scales with the highly temperature-sensitive self-diffusion constant of water. In this work, in addition to temperature dependent self-diffusion constant of a fluid, we utilize the temperature dependent magnetization of 4 nm SPIONs to improve T2 sensitivity (4.96) by 1.4 times over self-diffusion (3.48) alone in hexane between 248 K and 333 K. To extend the application of NMR T2 thermometry to engineering systems, we also investigate the temperature dependence of T2 in mineral oil (Thermo Scientific, J62592), which exhibits remarkably high sensitivity (11.62) between 273 K and 353 K. This result implies that applications of NMR T2 thermometry in heat transfer fluids are promising. NMR thermometry, however, is generally not applicable to solids. Therefore, we also evaluate the potential of electron spin resonance (ESR) thermometry with SPIONs in solids between 100 K and 290 K, for potential temperature monitoring in biomedical and engineering applications. The size and concentration effects on ESR signals are studied systematically, and our results show that the temperature dependent linewidth follows a T^-2 law for 4 nm SPIONs, while the concentration of SPIONs has no impact on the temperature dependence of the ESR linewidth. The linewidth at room temperature at 9.4 GHz is 10.5 mT. Combining our NMR and ESR results, we find that to obtain higher temperature sensitivity in a magnetic resonance technique using SPIONs, SPION with a small magnetic moment, i.e., a small volume and reduced magnetization, are beneficial.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Guided Design of Non-Reciprocal and Asymmetric Elastic Chiral Metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There has been significant recent interest in the mechanics community to design structures that can either violate reciprocity, or exhibit elastic asymmetry or odd elasticity. While these properties are highly desirable to enable mechanical metamaterials to exhibit novel wave propagation phenomena, it remains an open question as to how to design passive structures that exhibit both significant non-reciprocity and elastic asymmetry. In this paper, we first define several design spaces for chiral metamaterials leveraging specific design parameters, including the ligament contact angles, the ligament shape, and circle radius. Having defined the design spaces, we then leverage machine learning approaches, and specifically Bayesian optimization, to determine optimally performing designs within each design space satisfying maximal non-reciprocity or stiffness asymmetry. Finally, we perform multi-objective optimization by determining the Pareto optimum and find chiral metamaterials that simultaneously exhibit high non-reciprocity and stiffness asymmetry. Our analysis of the underlying mechanisms reveals that chiral metamaterials that can display multiple different contact states under loading in different directions are able to simultaneously exhibit both high non-reciprocity and stiffness asymmetry. Overall, this work demonstrates the effectiveness of employing ML to bring insights to a novel domain with limited prior information, and more generally will pave the way for metamaterials with unique properties and functionality in directing and guiding mechanical wave energy.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Assisted Thermoelectric Cooling for On-Demand Multi-Hotspot Thermal Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid emergence of System-on-Chip (SoC) technology introduces multiple dynamic hotspots with spatial and temporal evolution to the system, necessitating a more efficient, sophisticated, and intelligent approach to achieve on-demand thermal management. In this study, we present a novel machine learning-assisted optimization algorithm for thermoelectric coolers (TECs) that can achieve global optimal temperature by individually controlling TEC units based on real-time multi-hotspot conditions across the entire domain. A convolutional neural network (CNN) with inception module is trained to comprehend the coupled thermal-electrical physics underlying the system and attain accurate temperature predictions with and without TECs. Due to the intricate interaction among passive thermal gradient, Peltier effect and Joule effect, a local optimal TEC control experiences spatial temperature trade-off which may not lead to a global optimal solution. To address this issue, a backtracking-based optimization algorithm is developed using the designed machine learning model to iterate all possible TEC assignments for attaining global optimal solutions. For arbitrary m by n matrix with NHS hotspots (n, m less than 10 and NHS less than 20), our algorithm is capable of providing global optimal temperature and its corresponding TEC array control in an average of 1.07 second while iterating through tens of temperature predictions behind-the-scenes. This represents a speed increase of over four orders of magnitude compared to traditional FEM strategies which take approximately 18 minutes.</description>

      <title>Time-Gated Optical Spectroscopy of Field-Effect Stimulated Recombination via Interfacial Point Defects in Fully-Processed Silicon Carbide Power MOSFETs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fully-processed SiC power metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) emit light during switching of the gate terminal, while both drain and source terminals are grounded. The emitted photons are caused by defect-assisted recombination of electrons and holes at the 4H-SiC/SiO$_2$ interface and can be detected through the SiC substrate. Here, we present time-gated spectroscopic characterization of these interfacial point defects. Unlike in previous studies, the devices were opened in such a way that the drain-contact remained electrically active. A separate examination of the photons emitted at the rising and falling transitions of the gate-source voltage enabled the extraction of two different spectral components. One of these components consists of a single transition with phonon replicas of a local vibrational mode (LVM) with an astonishingly high energy of 220 meV $\unicode{x2013}$ well above the highest phonon modes in 4H-SiC and SiO$_2$ of 120 meV and 137 meV, respectively. Based on a quantum mechanical model, we successfully fitted its emission spectrum and assigned it to donor-acceptor pair recombination involving a carbon cluster-like defect. Other transitions were assigned to EH$_{6/7}$-assisted, EK$_2$-D, and nitrogen-aluminum donor-acceptor pair recombination. Due to the relevance of these defects in the operation of SiC MOSFETs, these novel insights will contribute to improved reliability and performance of these devices.</description>

      <title>A system built for both deterministic transfer processes and contact photolithography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A home-built compact system that functions as both a transfer stage for deterministic transfer processes and a mask aligner for contact photolithography, is constructed. The precision translation and rotation sample stage and optical microscope are shared between the two modes. In the transfer mode, equipped with a heating element, the setup has been used to deterministically transfer freestanding semiconductors, 2D materials, and van der Waals electrodes. Moreover, with an upgrade cost of less than $1000, an existing transfer stage can be configured into a contact mask aligner. Photolithography patterns with feature sizes of ~1-2 um have been achieved when combining a chromium photomask and a thin photoresist layer, comparable to the performance of an entry level mask aligner such as MJB3 (Karl Suss). Our prototype instrument provides an exciting and affordable solution for preforming high quality deterministic transfer and photolithography processes on one single tool in house.</description>

      <title>Focal Volume, Acoustic Radiation Force, and Strain in Two-Transducer Regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transcranial focused ultrasound stimulation (TUS) holds promise for non-invasive neural modulation in treating neurological disorders. Most clinically relevant targets are deep within the brain, surrounded by other sensitive regions that need to be spared clinical intervention. However, in TUS, increasing frequency with the goal of improving spatial resolution reduces the effective penetration depth. We show that by using a pair of 1 MHz, orthogonally arranged transducers we improve the spatial resolution afforded by each of the transducers individually, by nearly $40$ fold, achieving a sub-cubic millimeter target volume of $0.24\ mm^3$ deep within the brain. We show that orthogonally placed transducers generate highly localized standing waves with Acoustic Radiation Force (ARF) arranged into periodic regions of compression and tension near the target. We further present an extended capability of the orthogonal setup, which is to impart selective pressures--either positive or negative, but not both--on the target. Lastly, we share our preliminary findings that strain can arise from both particle motion and ARF with the former reaching its maximum value at the focus, and the latter remaining null at the focus and reaching its maximum around the focus.
  As the field is investigating the mechanism of interaction in TUS by way of elucidating the mapping between ultrasound parameters and neural response, orthogonal transducers expand our toolbox by making it possible to conduct these investigations at much finer spatial resolutions, with localized and directed (compression vs. tension) ARF and the capability of applying selective pressures at the target.</description>

      <title>Microscale Fiber-Integrated Vector Magnetometer with On-Tip Field Biasing using NV Ensembles in Diamond Microcystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In quantum sensing of magnetic fields, ensembles of NV centers in diamond offer high sensitivity, high bandwidth and outstanding spatial resolution while operating in harsh environments. Moreover, the orientation of defect centers along four crystal axes forms an intrinsic coordinate system, enabling vector magnetometry within a single diamond crystal. While most vector magnetometers rely on a known bias magnetic field for full recovery of three-dimensional field information, employing external 3D Helmholtz coils or permanent magnets results in bulky, laboratory-bound setups, impeding miniaturization of the device. Here, a novel approach is presented that utilizes a fiber-integrated microscale coil at the fiber tip to generate a localized uniaxial magnetic field. The same fiber-tip coil is used in parallel for spin control by combining DC and microwave signals in a bias tee. To implement vector magnetometry using a uniaxial bias field, we preselect the orientation of the diamond crystal and then fully characterize it by rotating a static magnetic field in three planes of rotation. We demonstrate the measurement of vector magnetic fields in the full solid angle with a shot-noise limited sensitivity of $19.4\:\textrm{nT/Hz}^{1/2}$ and microscale spatial resolution while achieving a cross section of the fiber sensor head below $1\:\textrm{mm}^2.$</description>

      <title>Multi-mem behavior at reduced voltages in La$_{1/2}$Sr$_{1/2}$Mn$_{1/2}$Co$_{1/2}$O$_{3-x}$ perovskite modified with Sm:CeO$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neuromorphic computing aims to mimic the architecture and the information processing mechanisms of the mammalian brain, appearing as the only avenue that offers significant energy savings compared to the standard digital computers. Memcapacitive devices (which can change their capacitance between different non-volatile states upon the application of electrical stimulation) can significantly reduce the energy consumption of bioinspired circuitry. In the present work, we study the multimem (memristive and memcapacitive) behavior of devices based on thin films of the topotactic redox La$_{1/2}$Sr$_{1/2}$Mn$_{1/2}$Co$_{1/2}$O$_{3-x}$ (LSMCO) perovskite modified with Sm:Ce$O_2$ (SCO), grown on Nb:SrTiO$_{3}$ with (001) and (110) out of plane orientations. Either the self assembling at the nanoscale of both LSMCO and SCO phases or the doping with Ce(Sm) of the LSMCO perovskite were observed for different fabrication conditions and out of plane orientations. The impact of these changes on the device electrical behavior was determined. The optimum devices resulted those with (110) orientation and Ce(Sm) doping the perovskite. These devices displayed a multimem behavior with robust memcapacitance and significantly lower operation voltages (especially the RESET voltage) in comparison with devices based on pristine LSMCO. In addition, they were able to endure electrical cycling (and the concomitant perovskite topotactic redox transition between oxidized and reduced phases) without suffering nanostructural or chemical changes. We link these properties to an enhanced perovskite reducibility upon Ce(Sm) doping. Our work contributes to increase the reliability of LSMCO based multimem systems and to reduce their operating voltages closer to the 1 V threshold, which are key issues for the development of nanodevices for neuromorphic or in memory computing.</description>

      <title>Bistable Organic Electrochemical Transistors: Enthalpy vs. Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) serve as the foundation for a wide range of emerging applications, from bioelectronic implants and smart sensor systems to neuromorphic computing. Their ascent originates from a distinctive switching mechanism based on the coupling of electronic and ionic charge carriers, which gives rise to a multitude of unique characteristics. Notably, various OECT systems have been reported with significant hysteresis in their transfer curve. While being a feature sought after as non-volatile memory in neuromorphic systems, no universal explanation has yet been given for its physical origin, impeding its advanced implementation. Herein, we present a thermodynamic framework that readily elucidates the emergence of bistable OECT operation through the interplay of enthalpy and entropy. We validate our model through three experimental approaches, covering temperature-resolved characterizations, targeted material manipulation, and thermal imaging. In this context, we demonstrate the exceptional scenario where the subthreshold swing deviates from Boltzmann statistics, and we provide an alternate view on existing data in literature, which further supports our model. Finally, we leverage the bistability in form of a single-OECT Schmitt trigger, thus compacting the complexity of a multi-component circuit into a single device. These insights offer a revised understanding of OECT physics and promote their application in non-conventional computing, where symmetry-breaking phenomena are pivotal to unlock novel paradigms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interaction between phonons and magnons is a widely developing topic, especially in the field of acoustic spintronics. To discuss this interaction, it is necessary to observe two different waves (acoustic and spin waves) with the same frequency and wavelength. In the Ni80Fe20/Au/Co/Au system deposited on a silicon substrate, we observe the interaction between spin waves and surface acoustic waves using Brillouin light scattering spectroscopy. As a result, we can selectively control (activate or deactivate) the magnetoelastic interaction between the fundamental spin wave mode and surface acoustic waves by adjusting the magnetostrictive layer thickness in the multilayer. We demonstrate that by adjusting the number of layers in a multilayer structure, we can precisely control the dispersion of surface acoustic waves, with minimal impact on the fundamental spin wave mode</description>

      <title>Scale-bridging within a complex model hierarchy for investigation of a metal-fueled circular energy economy by use of Bayesian model calibration with model error quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chemical reactor network (CRN) modeling is a promising approach for scale-bridging within a model hierarchy covering a huge range of scales from micro to macro in the scope of developing an innovative metal-fueled circular energy economy. This holds if valid information from CRNs, being models of reduced complexity, can be obtained on a much denser set of operating conditions than available from experiments and elaborated simulation methods like Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). An approach for CRN calibration including model error quantification from recent literature is used for developing a CRN model of a laboratory reactor for flash ironmaking, using data from the literature. By introducing a meta model of a CRN parameter, it has been possible to calibrate a simple CRN model on an extended set of operating conditions with satisfactory results. This way, the employed coupled calibration and uncertainty quantification framework seems promising for the task of scale-bridging in the model hierarchy under investigation. Challenges for the further extension of the present work into that direction are discussed.</description>

      <title>Structure, short-range order, and phase stability of the Al$_x$CrFeCoNi high-entropy alloy: Insights from a perturbative, DFT-based analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the phase behaviour of the Al$_x$CrFeCoNi high-entropy alloy. Our approach is based on a perturbative analysis of the internal energy of the paramagnetic solid solution as evaluated within the Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker formulation of density functional theory, using the coherent potential approximation to average over disorder. Via application of a Landau-type linear response theory, we infer preferential chemical orderings directly. In addition, we recover a pairwise form of the alloy internal energy suitable for study via atomistic simulations, which in this work are performed using the nested sampling algorithm, which is well-suited for studying complex potential energy surfaces. When the underlying lattice is fcc, at low concentrations of Al, depending on the value of $x$, we predict either an $\mathrm{L}1_2$ or $\mathrm{D}0_{22}$ ordering emerging below approximately 1000 K. On the other hand, when the underlying lattice is bcc, consistent with experimental observations, we predict $\mathrm{B}2$ ordering temperatures higher than the melting temperature of the alloy, confirming that this ordered phase forms directly from the melt. For both fcc and bcc systems, chemical orderings are dominated by Al moving to one sublattice, Ni and Co the other, while Cr and Fe remain comparatively disordered. On the bcc lattice, our atomistic modelling suggests eventual decomposition into $\mathrm{B}2$ NiAl and Cr-rich phases. These results shed light on the fundamental physical origins of atomic ordering tendencies in these intriguing materials.</description>

      <title>A numerical analysis of the impact of gas pressure and dielectric material on the generation of body force in an air gas plasma actuator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plasma technology has undeniably revolutionized industrial processes in recent decades. Atmospheric pressure plasma (APP) has emerged as a prominent and widely applicable tool in various scientific disciplines. Notably, plasma-assisted flow control has become a subject of intense interest, particularly applying surface dielectric barrier discharge (SDBD) plasma actuators for aerodynamic flow control. In this study, a two-dimensional model of the SDBD plasma actuator is developed using the COMSOL Multiphysics program, incorporating air gas discharge reactions with N2/O2/Ar gases in specific ratios (0.78, 0.21, 0.01). The investigation focuses on the impact of dielectric materials (mica, silica glass, quartz, and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)) on plasma characteristics and body force within the plasma actuator under constant input parameters. Moreover, the study explores how variable pressure (760, 660, and 560 torr) in different applications influences plasma properties, ultimately affecting the magnitude of the body force in the plasma actuator. These findings contribute to optimizing plasma technology for flow control applications and enhance industrial efficiency and performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Soliton microcombs provide a chip-based, octave-spanning source for self-referencing and optical metrology. We explore use of a silicon-nitride integrated photonics foundry to manufacture octave-spanning microcombs. By group-velocity dispersion engineering with the waveguide cross-section, we shape the soliton spectrum for dispersive-wave spectral enhancements at the frequencies for f-2f self-referencing. With the optimized waveguide geometry, we control the carrier-envelope offset frequency by adjusting the resonator radius. Moreover, we demonstrate the other considerations for octave microcombs, including models for soliton spectrum design, ultra-broadband resonator external coupling, low-loss edge couplers, and the nonlinear self-interactions of few-cycle solitons. This design process permits highly repeatable creation of soliton microcombs optimized for pump operation less than 100 mW, an electronically detectable offset frequency, and high comb mode power for f-2f detection. However, these design aspects must also be made compatible with the foundry fabrication tolerance of octave microcomb devices. Our experiments highlight the potential to manufacture a single-chip solution for an octave-spanning microcomb, which is the central component of a compact microsystem for optical metrology.</description>

      <title>Tunable Nanoislands Decorated Tapered Optical Fibers Reveal Concurrent Contributions in Through-Fiber SERS Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Creating plasmonic nanoparticles on a tapered optical fiber tip enables a remote SERS sensing probe, ideal for challenging sampling scenarios like biological tissue, specific cells, on-site environmental monitoring, and deep brain structures. However, nanoparticle patterns fabricated from current bottom-up methods are mostly random, making geometry control difficult. Uneven statistical distribution, clustering, and multilayer deposition introduce uncertainty in correlating device performance with morphology. Here, we employ a tunable solid-state dewetting method to create densely packed monolayer Au nanoislands (NIs) with varied geometric parameters, directly contacting the silica TF surface. These patterns exhibit analyzable nanoparticle sizes, densities, and uniform distribution across the entire taper surface, enabling a systematic investigation of particle size, density, and analyte effects on the SERS performance of the through-fiber detection system. The study is focused on the SERS response of a widely employed benchmark Rhodamine 6G molecule and Serotonin, a neurotransmitter with high relevance for the neuroscience field. The numerical simulations and limit of detection (LOD) experiments on R6G show that the increase of the total near-field enhancement volume promotes the SERS sensitivity of the probe. However, for serotonin we observed a different behavior linked to its interaction with the nanoparticle's surface. The obtained LOD is as low as 10-7 M, a value not achieved so far in a through-fiber detection scheme. Therefore, we believe our work offers a strategy to design nanoparticle-based remote SERS sensing probes and provide new clues to discover and understand the intricate plasmonic-driven chemical reactions.</description>

      <title>Ultralow Dissipation Nanomechanical Devices from Monocrystalline Silicon Carbide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to their low mass and long coherence times, nanomechanical resonators have many applications, from biomolecule mass sensing to hybrid quantum interfaces. In many instances the performance is limited by internal material damping. Crystalline materials promise lower material dissipation, however due to fabrication challenges, amorphous materials are more commonly utilized. Crystalline silicon carbide (SiC) is particularly appealing due to its exquisite mechanical, electrical and optical properties, but to-date exhibits higher nanomechanical dissipation than both amorphous and other crystalline materials. To address this, we fabricate nanomechanical resonators thinned from bulk monocrystalline 4H-SiC. Characterization of multiple resonators of different sizes and thicknesses, allows us to discern the surface and volumetric contributions to dissipation. We measure mechanical dissipation rates as low as 2.7 mHz, more than an order-of-magnitude lower than any previous crystalline SiC resonator, yielding quality factors as high as 20 million at room temperature. We also quantify the nonlinear dissipation of SiC nanomechanical resonators for the first time, finding that it is lower than other materials. This promises higher sensitivity in applications such as mass sensing. By achieving exceptionally low dissipation in SiC resonators, our work provides a path towards improved performance in sensing and other applications.</description>

      <title>High efficient sunlight-driven CO2 hydrogenation to methanol over NiZn intermetallic catalysts under atmospheric pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The synthesis of solar methanol through direct CO2 hydrogenation using solar energy is of great importance in advancing a sustainable energy economy. In this study, non-precious NiZn intermetallic/ZnO catalyst is reported to catalyze the hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol using sunlight irradiation (1sun). The NiZn-ZnO interface is identified as the active site to stabilize the key intermediates of HxCO*. At ambient pressure, the NiZn-ZnO catalyst demonstrates a methanol production rate of 127.5 umol g-1h-1 from solar driven CO2 hydrogenation, with a remarkable 100% selectivity towards methanol in the total organic products. Notably, this production rate stands as the highest record for photothermic CO2 hydrogenation to methanol in continuous-flow reactors with sunlight as the only requisite energy input. This discovery not only paves the way for the development of novel catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol but also marks a significant stride towards a full solar-driven chemical energy storage.</description>

      <title>Chemically Stable Group IV-V Transition Metal Carbide Thin Films in Hydrogen Radical Environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hydrogen is playing a crucial role in the green energy transition. Yet, its tendency to react with and diffuse into surrounding materials poses a challenge. Therefore, it is critical to develop coatings that protect hydrogen-sensitive system components in reactive-hydrogen environments. In this work, we report group IV-V transition metal carbide (TMC) thin films as potential candidates for hydrogen-protective coatings in hydrogen radical (H*) environments at elevated temperatures. We identify three classes of TMCs based on the reduction of carbides and surface oxides (TMOx). HfC, ZrC, TiC, TaC, NbC, and VC (class A) are found to have a stable carbidic-C (TM-C) content, with a further sub-division into partial (class A1: HfC, ZrC, and TiC) and strong (class A2: TaC, NbC, and VC) surface TMOx reduction. In contrast to class A, a strong carbide reduction is observed in Co2C (class B), along with a strong surface TMOx reduction. The H*-TMC/TMOx interaction is hypothesized to entail three processes: (i) hydrogenation of surface C/O-atoms, (ii) formation of CHx/OHx species, and (iii) subsurface C/O-atoms diffusion to the surface vacancies. The number of adsorbed H-atoms required to form CHx/OHx species (i), and the corresponding energy barriers (ii) are estimated based on the change in the Gibbs free energy (DeltaG) for the reduction reactions of TMCs and TMOx. Hydrogenation of surface carbidic-C-atoms is proposed to limit the reduction of TMCs, whereas the reduction of surface TMOx is governed by the thermodynamic barrier for forming H2O.</description>

      <title>Robust electrothermal switching of optical phase change materials through computer-aided adaptive pulse optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electrically tunable optical devices present diverse functionalities for manipulating electromagnetic waves by leveraging elements capable of reversibly switching between different optical states. This adaptability in adjusting their responses to electromagnetic waves after fabrication is crucial for developing more efficient and compact optical systems for a broad range of applications including sensing, imaging, telecommunications, and data storage. Chalcogenide-based phase change materials (PCMs) have shown great promise due to their stable, non-volatile phase transition between amorphous and crystalline states. Nonetheless, optimizing the switching parameters of PCM devices and maintaining their stable operation over thousands of cycles with minimal variation can be challenging. In this paper, we report on the critical role of PCM pattern as well as electrical pulse form in achieving reliable and stable switching, extending the operational lifetime of the device beyond 13,000 switching events. To achieve this, we have developed a computer-aided algorithm that monitors optical changes in the device and adjusts the applied voltage in accordance with the phase transformation process, thereby significantly enhancing the lifetime of these reconfigurable devices. Our findings reveal that patterned PCM structures show significantly higher endurance compared to blanket PCM thin films.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Granular $\text{L}1_0$-FePt thin films with small columnar grains are essential for heat-assisted magnetic recording media. While hexagonal boron nitride(h-BN) has proven effective for promoting columnar FePt grains, we explored multilayer graphene as an alternative grain boundary material leveraging its structural similarity to h-BN. The FePt granular thin films with carbon-based grain boundary materials(GBMs) were deposited by cosputtering on Si/SiO2 substrates with substrate bias at 650{\deg}C. The RF bias and high temperature facilitated formation of interlinked graphene nanoribbons wrapping around FePt grains, yielding 7.5 nm diameter, 8 nm height grains with an order parameter of 0.78 and a perpendicular coercivity of 40 kOe. However, the formation of graphene nanoribbons could not effectively promote columnar structures, likely due to co-existing amorphous carbon in grain boundaries. Optimizing deposition to improve graphene grain boundary quality is necessary to realize this 2D material's potential for achieving desirable microstructures for HAMR media.</description>

      <title>One Trillion True Random Bits Generated with a Field Programmable Gate Array Actuated Magnetic Tunnel Junction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large quantities of random numbers are crucial in a wide range of applications. We have recently demonstrated that perpendicular nanopillar magnetic tunnel junctions (pMTJs) can produce true random bits when actuated with short pulses. However, our implementation used high-end and expensive electronics, such as a high bandwidth arbitrary waveform generator and analog-to-digital converter, and was limited to relatively low data rates. Here, we significantly increase the speed of true random number generation (TRNG) of our stochastic actuated pMTJs (SMART-pMTJs) using Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), demonstrating the generation of over $10^{12}$ bits at rates exceeding 10Mb/s. The resulting bitstreams pass the NIST Statistical Test Suite for randomness with only one XOR operation. In addition to a hundred-fold reduction in the setup cost and a thousand-fold increase in bitrate, the advancement includes simplifying and optimizing random bit generation with a custom-designed analog daughter board to interface an FPGA and SMART-pMTJ. The resulting setup further enables FPGA at-speed processing of MTJ data for stochastic modeling and cryptography.</description>

Abstract: Crystallization of rubrene, progressing from an amorphous phase to a triclinic meta-stable and ultimately to the orthorhombic stable phase, offers broad applications not only in organic electronic devices but also for in-depth studies of optical and electronic properties, including exciton distribution and dynamics. We investigate the crystallization of rubrene on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG), aiming at the growth of the preferred rubrene orthorhombic phase, which has been reported to have one of the highest charge mobilities in organic semiconductors. This is achieved through controlled heating and enhanced partial pressure. Through precise control of the initial deposition on the substrate, we investigate the growth habit of rubrene crystals by high-rate heat treatment beyond the second crystallization temperature. Furthermore, this work addresses thermal stability and photodegradation across various morphologies.</description>

Abstract: The ever-increasing amount of data from ubiquitous smart devices fosters data-centric and cognitive algorithms. Traditional digital computer systems have separate logic and memory units, resulting in a huge delay and energy cost for implementing these algorithms. Memristors are programmable resistors with a memory, providing a paradigm-shifting approach towards creating intelligent hardware systems to handle data-centric tasks. Spintronic nanodevices are promising choices as they are high-speed, low-power, highly scalable, robust, and capable of constructing dynamic complex systems. In this Review, we survey spintronic devices from a memristor point of view. We introduce spintronic memristors based on magnetic tunnel junctions, nanomagnet ensemble, domain walls, topological spin textures, and spin waves, which represent dramatically different state spaces. They can exhibit steady, oscillatory, stochastic, and chaotic trajectories in their state spaces, which have been exploited for in-memory logic, neuromorphic computing, stochastic and chaos computing. Finally, we discuss challenges and trends in realizing large-scale spintronic memristive systems for practical applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.08977v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: MoS2 nanostructures are promising catalysts for proton-exchange-membrane (PEM) electrolyzers to replace expensive noble metals. Their broadscale application demands high activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) as well as robust durability. Doping is commonly applied to enhance the HER activity of MoS2-based nanocatalysts, but the effect of dopants in the electrochemical and structural stability is yet to be discussed. Herein, we correlate operando electrochemical measurements to the structural evolution of the materials down to the nanometric scale by identical location electron microscopy and spectroscopy. The range of stable operation for MoS2 nanocatalysts with and without rhenium doping is experimentally defined. The responsible degradation mechanisms at first electrolyte contact, open circuit stabilization and HER conditions are experimentally identified and confirmed with the calculated Pourbaix diagram of Re-doped MoS2. Doping MoS2-based nanocatalysts is validated as a promising strategy for the continuous improvement of high performance and durable PEM electrolyzers.</description>

      <title>Implementation of tunable frequency-dependent stiffness elements via integrated shunted piezoelectric stacks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00560v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Piezoelectric transducers applied on or integrated in structures, combined with appropriate circuits have been extensively investigated as a smart approach to the mitigation of resonant vibrations with high relative amplitudes. \cmt{A resonant shunt circuit consisting of the capacitive piezoelectric transducer and an inductance can be configured to target specific eigenmodes of a structure, if appropriately placed and tuned. Their effect is expressed in terms of mechanical impedance of the host structure, allowing for the exchange of energy between the mechanical and electrical domain, to dramatically affect the dynamic response of the structure. By re-framing the function of resonant shunted piezoelectric transducers as frequency dependent variable stiffness elements, this paper investigates their capability to realize a frequency dependent structural mechanical connectivity, where the load path within a lattice structure can be interrupted at will for specific frequencies by tunable null-stiffness components. Here, we offer the numerical and experimental verification of this idea, by demonstrating the ability to significantly affect the dynamic response of a unit cell of an adaptive lattice metamaterial, even away from a structural resonance. In the latter case, the null-stiffness shunt leads to an additional resonance peak in the truss' dynamic response.} Its realization as additively manufactured component points to the feasibility of such structures in real life.</description>

Abstract: Scanning Kelvin probe microscopy (SKPM) is a powerful technique for investigating the electrostatic properties of material surfaces, enabling the imaging of variations in work function, topology, surface charge density, or combinations thereof. Regardless of the underlying signal source, SKPM results in a voltage image which is spatially distorted due to the finite size of the probe, long-range electrostatic interactions, mechanical and electrical noise, and the finite response time of the electronics. In order to recover the underlying signal, it is necessary to deconvolve the measurement with an appropriate point spread function (PSF) that accounts the aforementioned distortions, but determining this PSF is difficult. Here we describe how such PSFs can be determined experimentally, and show how they can be used to recover the underlying information of interest. We first consider the physical principles that enable SKPM, and discuss how these affect the system PSF. We then show how one can experimentally measure PSFs by looking at well defined features, and that these compare well to simulated PSFs, provided scans are performed extremely slowly and carefully. Next, we work at realistic scan speeds, and show that the idealised PSFs fail to capture temporal distortions in the scan direction. While simulating PSFs for these situations would be quite challenging, we show that measuring PSFs with similar scan parameters works well. Our approach clarifies the basic principles of and inherent challenges to SKPM measurements, and gives practical methods to improve results.</description>

      <title>Perovskite solar cells dominated by bimolecular recombination -- how far is the radiative limit?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05369v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Here, we report an experimental demonstration of perovskite solar cells dominated by bimolecular recombination and critically analyse their performance against radiative limits. To this end, we first establish a set of quantitative benchmark characteristics expected from solar cells limited by bimolecular recombination. Transient as well as steady state intensity dependent measurements indicate that our solar cells indeed operate at such limits with interface passivation comparable to the champion c-Si technology. Further, we identify novel characterization schemes which enable consistent back extraction of recombination parameters from transient optoelectrical and electroluminescence measurements. Remarkably, these parameters predict important features of dark current density vs. voltage characteristics (J-V) and Suns-V_OC measurements, thus validating the estimates and the methodology. Uniquely, this work provides a consistent and coherent interpretation of diverse experimental trends ranging from dark J-V, Suns-V_OC, steady state and transient intensity dependent measurements to electroluminescence quantum yield. As such, insights shared in this manuscript could have significant implications towards fundamental electronic processes in perovskite solar cells and further efficiency optimization towards Shockley-Queisser limits.</description>

      <title>Electrostatic Steering of Thermal Emission with Active Metasurface Control of Delocalized Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.07998v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically describe and experimentally demonstrate a graphene-integrated metasurface structure that enables electrically-tunable directional control of thermal emission. This device consists of a dielectric slab that acts as a Fabry-Perot (F-P) resonator supporting long-range delocalized modes bounded on one side by an electrostatically tunable metal-graphene metasurface. By varying the Fermi level of the graphene, the accumulated phase of the F-P mode is shifted, which changes the direction of absorption and emission at a fixed frequency. We directly measure the frequency- and angle-dependent emissivity of the thermal emission from a fabricated device heated to 250$^{\circ}$. Our results show that electrostatic control allows the thermal emission at 6.61 $\mu$m to be continuously steered over 16$^{\circ}$, with a peak emissivity maintained above 0.9. We analyze the dynamic behavior of the thermal emission steerer theoretically using a Fano interference model, and use the model to design optimized thermal steerer structures.</description>

      <title>Observation of an Abrupt 3D-2D Morphological Transition in Thin Al Layers Grown by MBE on InGaAs surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15341v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Among superconductor/semiconductor hybrid structures, in-situ aluminum (Al) grown on InGaAs/InAs is widely pursued for the experimental realization of Majorana Zero Mode quasiparticles. This is due to the high carrier mobility, low effective mass, and large Land\'e g-factor of InAs, coupled with the relatively high value of the in-plane critical magnetic field in thin Al films. However, growing a thin, continuous Al layer using the Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE) is challenging due to aluminum's high surface mobility and tendency for 3D nucleation on semiconductor surfaces. A study of epitaxial Al thin film growth on In0.75Ga0.25As with MBE is presented, focusing on the effects of the Al growth rate and substrate temperature on the nucleation of Al layers. We find that for low deposition rates, 0.1 {\AA}/s and 0.5 {\AA}/s, the growth continues in 3D mode during the deposition of the nominal 100 {\AA} of Al, resulting in isolated Al islands. However, for growth rates of 1.5 {\AA}/s and above, the 3D growth mode quickly transitions into island coalescence, leading to a uniform 2D Al layer. Moreover, this transition is very abrupt, happening over an Al flux increase of less than 1%. We discuss the growth mechanisms explaining these observations. The results give new insights into the kinetics of Al deposition and show that with sufficiently high Al flux, a 2D growth on substrates at close to room temperature can be achieved already within the first few Al monolayers. This eliminates the need for complex cryogenic substrate cooling and paves the way for the development of high-quality superconductor-semiconductor interfaces in standard MBE systems.</description>

      <title>Quasistatic approximation in neuromodulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00486v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define and explain the quasistatic approximation (QSA) as applied to field modeling for electrical and magnetic stimulation. Neuromodulation analysis pipelines include discrete stages, and QSA is applied specifically when calculating the electric and magnetic fields generated in tissues by a given stimulation dose. QSA simplifies the modeling equations to support tractable analysis, enhanced understanding, and computational efficiency. The application of QSA in neuro-modulation is based on four underlying assumptions: (A1) no wave propagation or self-induction in tissue, (A2) linear tissue properties, (A3) purely resistive tissue, and (A4) non-dispersive tissue. As a consequence of these assumptions, each tissue is assigned a fixed conductivity, and the simplified equations (e.g., Laplace's equation) are solved for the spatial distribution of the field, which is separated from the field's temporal waveform. Recognizing that electrical tissue properties may be more complex, we explain how QSA can be embedded in parallel or iterative pipelines to model frequency dependence or nonlinearity of conductivity. We survey the history and validity of QSA across specific applications, such as microstimulation, deep brain stimulation, spinal cord stimulation, transcranial electrical stimulation, and transcranial magnetic stimulation. The precise definition and explanation of QSA in neuromodulation are essential for rigor when using QSA models or testing their limits.</description>
