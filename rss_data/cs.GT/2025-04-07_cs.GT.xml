      <title>Understanding EFX Allocations: Counting and Variants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Envy-freeness up to any good (EFX) is a popular and important fairness property in the fair allocation of indivisible goods, of which its existence in general is still an open question. In this work, we investigate the problem of determining the minimum number of EFX allocations for a given instance, arguing that this approach may yield valuable insights into the existence and computation of EFX allocations. We focus on restricted instances where the number of goods slightly exceeds the number of agents, and extend our analysis to weighted EFX (WEFX) and a novel variant of EFX for general monotone valuations, termed EFX+. In doing so, we identify the transition threshold for the existence of allocations satisfying these fairness notions. Notably, we resolve open problems regarding WEFX by proving polynomial-time computability under binary additive valuations, and establishing the first constant-factor approximation for two agents.</description>

      <title>Tight Regret Bounds for Fixed-Price Bilateral Trade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine fixed-price mechanisms in bilateral trade through the lens of regret minimization. Our main results are twofold. (i) For independent values, a near-optimal $\widetilde{\Theta}(T^{2/3})$ tight bound for $\textsf{Global Budget Balance}$ fixed-price mechanisms with two-bit/one-bit feedback. (ii) For correlated/adversarial values, a near-optimal $\Omega(T^{3/4})$ lower bound for $\textsf{Global Budget Balance}$ fixed-price mechanisms with two-bit/one-bit feedback, which improves the best known $\Omega(T^{5/7})$ lower bound obtained in the work \cite{BCCF24} and, up to polylogarithmic factors, matches the $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{3 / 4})$ upper bound obtained in the same work. Our work in combination with the previous works \cite{CCCFL24mor, CCCFL24jmlr, AFF24, BCCF24} (essentially) gives a thorough understanding of regret minimization for fixed-price bilateral trade.
  En route, we have developed two technical ingredients that might be of independent interest: (i) A novel algorithmic paradigm, called $\textit{{fractal elimination}}$, to address one-bit feedback and independent values. (ii) A new $\textit{lower-bound construction}$ with novel proof techniques, to address the $\textsf{Global Budget Balance}$ constraint and correlated values.</description>

      <title>Hollow Victory: How Malicious Proposers Exploit Validator Incentives in Optimistic Rollup Dispute Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blockchain systems, such as Ethereum, are increasingly adopting layer-2 scaling solutions to improve transaction throughput and reduce fees. One popular layer-2 approach is the Optimistic Rollup, which relies on a mechanism known as a dispute game for block proposals. In these systems, validators can challenge blocks that they believe contain errors, and a successful challenge results in the transfer of a portion of the proposer's deposit as a reward. In this paper, we reveal a structural vulnerability in the mechanism: validators may not be awarded a proper profit despite winning a dispute challenge. We develop a formal game-theoretic model of the dispute game and analyze several scenarios, including cases where the proposer controls some validators and cases where a secondary auction mechanism is deployed to induce additional participation. Our analysis demonstrates that under current designs, the competitive pressure from validators may be insufficient to deter malicious behavior. We find that increased validator competition, paradoxically driven by higher rewards or participation, can allow a malicious proposer to significantly lower their net loss by capturing value through mechanisms like auctions. To address this, we propose countermeasures such as an escrowed reward mechanism and a commit-reveal protocol. Our findings provide critical insights into enhancing the economic security of layer-2 scaling solutions in blockchain networks.</description>

      <title>Modelling bounded rational decision-making through Wasserstein constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modelling bounded rational decision-making through information constrained processing provides a principled approach for representing departures from rationality within a reinforcement learning framework, while still treating decision-making as an optimization process. However, existing approaches are generally based on Entropy, Kullback-Leibler divergence, or Mutual Information. In this work, we highlight issues with these approaches when dealing with ordinal action spaces. Specifically, entropy assumes uniform prior beliefs, missing the impact of a priori biases on decision-makings. KL-Divergence addresses this, however, has no notion of "nearness" of actions, and additionally, has several well known potentially undesirable properties such as the lack of symmetry, and furthermore, requires the distributions to have the same support (e.g. positive probability for all actions). Mutual information is often difficult to estimate. Here, we propose an alternative approach for modeling bounded rational RL agents utilising Wasserstein distances. This approach overcomes the aforementioned issues. Crucially, this approach accounts for the nearness of ordinal actions, modeling "stickiness" in agent decisions and unlikeliness of rapidly switching to far away actions, while also supporting low probability actions, zero-support prior distributions, and is simple to calculate directly.</description>

      <title>No-Regret Learning in Stackelberg Games with an Application to Electric Ride-Hailing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of efficiently learning to play single-leader multi-follower Stackelberg games when the leader lacks knowledge of the lower-level game. Such games arise in hierarchical decision-making problems involving self-interested agents. For example, in electric ride-hailing markets, a central authority aims to learn optimal charging prices to shape fleet distributions and charging patterns of ride-hailing companies. Existing works typically apply gradient-based methods to find the leader's optimal strategy. Such methods are impractical as they require that the followers share private utility information with the leader. Instead, we treat the lower-level game as a black box, assuming only that the followers' interactions approximate a Nash equilibrium while the leader observes the realized cost of the resulting approximation. Under kernel-based regularity assumptions on the leader's cost function, we develop a no-regret algorithm that converges to an $\epsilon$-Stackelberg equilibrium in $O(\sqrt{T})$ rounds. Finally, we validate our approach through a numerical case study on optimal pricing in electric ride-hailing markets.</description>

      <title>Drawing a Map of Elections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our main contribution is the introduction of the map of elections framework. A map of elections consists of three main elements: (1) a dataset of elections (i.e., collections of ordinal votes over given sets of candidates), (2) a way of measuring similarities between these elections, and (3) a representation of the elections in the 2D Euclidean space as points, so that the more similar two elections are, the closer are their points. In our maps, we mostly focus on datasets of synthetic elections, but we also show an example of a map over real-life ones. To measure similarities, we would have preferred to use, e.g., the isomorphic swap distance, but this is infeasible due to its high computational complexity. Hence, we propose polynomial-time computable positionwise distance and use it instead. Regarding the representations in 2D Euclidean space, we mostly use the Kamada-Kawai algorithm, but we also show two alternatives. We develop the necessary theoretical results to form our maps and argue experimentally that they are accurate and credible. Further, we show how coloring the elections in a map according to various criteria helps in analyzing results of a number of experiments. In particular, we show colorings according to the scores of winning candidates or committees, running times of ILP-based winner determination algorithms, and approximation ratios achieved by particular algorithms.</description>

      <title>Efficient Mechanisms under Unawareness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the design of efficient mechanisms under asymmetric awareness and information. Unawareness refers to the lack of conception rather than the lack of information. Assuming quasi-linear utilities and private values, we show that we can implement in conditional dominant strategies a social choice function that is utilitarian ex-post efficient when pooling all awareness of all agents without the need of the social planner being fully aware ex-ante. To this end, we develop novel dynamic versions of Vickrey-Clarke-Groves mechanisms in which types are revealed and subsequently elaborated at endogenous higher awareness levels. We explore how asymmetric awareness affects budget balance and participation constraints. We show that ex-ante unforeseen contingencies are no excuse for deficits. Finally, we propose a modified reverse second price auction for efficient procurement of complex incompletely specified projects.</description>

      <title>A Game of Pawns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.04096v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce and study pawn games, a class of two-player zero-sum turn-based graph games. A turn-based graph game proceeds by placing a token on an initial vertex, and whoever controls the vertex on which the token is located, chooses its next location. This leads to a path in the graph, which determines the winner. Traditionally, the control of vertices is predetermined and fixed. The novelty of pawn games is that control of vertices changes dynamically throughout the game as follows. Each vertex of a pawn game is owned by a pawn. In each turn, the pawns are partitioned between the two players, and the player who controls the pawn that owns the vertex on which the token is located, chooses the next location of the token. Control of pawns changes dynamically throughout the game according to a fixed mechanism. Specifically, we define several grabbing-based mechanisms in which control of at most one pawn transfers at the end of each turn. We study the complexity of solving pawn games, where we focus on reachability objectives and parameterize the problem by the mechanism that is being used and by restrictions on pawn ownership of vertices. On the positive side, even though pawn games are exponentially-succinct turn-based games, we identify several natural classes that can be solved in PTIME. On the negative side, we identify several EXPTIME-complete classes, where our hardness proofs are based on a new class of games called Lock &amp; Key games, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>A Coopetition Index for Coalitions in Simple Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01383v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In simple games, larger coalitions typically wield more power, but do all players align their efforts effectively? Consider a voting scenario where a coalition forms, but needs more voters to pass a bill. The cohesion of the new group of voters hinges on whether all the new members can proficiently collaborate with the existing players to ensure the bill's passage or if subgroups form that pursue an independent alternative, thus generating antagonism among the new voters.
  This research introduces two classes of coopetition indices -- one relative and one absolute, the latter ranging from -1 to 1, to measure agents' preferences for cooperation (when positive) or competition (when negative) with the remaining players. These indices, together with a generalized group value, provide a comprehensive picture of the relevance and the cohesion of groups. We discuss the relationship with similar group indices and provide proper coopetition Banzhaf and Shapley-Owen types of indices.
  By applying our indices to the apex game and symmetric majority games, we observe that cooperation and competition frequently balance each other out, leading to null values for the Shapley-Owen and Banzhaf coopetition indices. An electoral application with real world data is also considered.</description>

      <title>Trial-and-Error Learning in Decentralized Matching Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02377v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-sided matching markets, environments in which two disjoint groups of agents seek to partner with one another, arise in several contexts. In static, centralized markets where agents know their preferences, standard algorithms can yield a stable matching. However, in dynamic, decentralized markets where agents must learn their preferences through interaction, such algorithms cannot be used. Our goal in this paper is to identify achievable stability guarantees in decentralized matching markets where (i) agents have limited information about their preferences and (ii) no central entity determines the match. Surprisingly, our first result demonstrates that these constraints do not preclude stability--simple "trial and error" learning policies guarantee convergence to a stable matching without requiring coordination between agents. Our second result shows that more sophisticated policies can direct the system toward a particular group's optimal stable matching. This finding highlights an important dimension of strategic learning: when agents can accurately model others' policies, they can adapt their own behavior to systematically influence outcomes in their favor--a phenomenon with broad implications for learning in multi-agent systems.</description>

      <title>Dependency equilibria: Boundary cases and their real algebraic geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19054v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is a significant step forward in understanding dependency equilibria within the framework of real algebraic geometry encompassing both pure and mixed equilibria. In alignment with Spohn's original definition of dependency equilibria, we propose two alternative definitions, allowing for an algebro-geometric comprehensive study of all dependency equilibria. We give a sufficient condition for the existence of a pure dependency equilibrium and show that every Nash equilibrium lies on the Spohn variety, the algebraic model for dependency equilibria. For generic games, the set of real points of the Spohn variety is Zariski dense. Furthermore, every Nash equilibrium in this case is a dependency equilibrium. Finally, we present a detailed analysis of the geometric structure of dependency equilibria for $(2\times2)$-games.</description>
