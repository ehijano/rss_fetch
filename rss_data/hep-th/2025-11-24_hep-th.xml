      <title>Growth of Cosmic Strings with Field-Dependent Tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel mechanism to produce a cosmic network of fundamental superstrings based on a time-varying string tension has been recently proposed. It has been found that fundamental superstrings can grow in a kinating background driven by the rolling of the volume modulus of Type IIB string compactifications towards the minimum of its potential. In this talk, I will generalise this analysis using dynamical systems techniques. First, I will analyse the cosmological growth of strings with a field-dependent tension in a Universe filled with a perfect fluid, finding a growth region in the phase space of this system. This machinery is then applied to both fundamental superstrings and effective strings obtained from wrapping $p$-branes on $(p-1)$- dimensional cycles. I will show how cosmological growth can be achieved in both cases not only in kinating backgrounds, but also in scaling fixed points. This talk is based on arXiv:2502.14953.</description>

      <title>Time Evolution of Multi-Party Entanglement Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the real-time dynamics of multi-party entanglement signals in chaotic quantum many-body systems including but not necessarily restricted to holographic conformal field theories. We find that scrambling dynamics generates multiparty entanglement with rich structure including: (a) qualitatively different dynamical behaviours for different signals, likely reflecting different dynamics for different kinds of entanglement patterns, (b) discontinuities indicating dynamical phase transitions in the entanglement structure, (c) transient and non-monotonic multiparty entanglement, and (d) periods during which the extensive entanglement of some regions is entirely multipartite. Our main technical tool is the membrane theory of entanglement dynamics.</description>

      <title>EFT meets CFT: Multiloop renormalization of higher-dimensional operators in general $\boldsymbol{\phi^4}$ theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The renormalization of composite operators is a fundamental aspect of quantum field theory, relevant for the description of phase transitions and high energy phenomenology. We calculate the anomalous dimensions of a large set of operators in any scalar $\phi^4$ theory in $d=4-\varepsilon$ dimensions, up to five loops in most cases. The results have applications in both effective field theory (EFT) and conformal field theory (CFT). As an EFT application, we extract the five-loop renormalization group (RG) equations of the Higgs sector of the Standard Model EFT at dimension six, and up to two loops at dimension eight, aligning our operator basis with custodial symmetry violation. Additionally, for CFT, by resumming the $\varepsilon$-expanded results at the fixed-point, we determine the entire low-lying spectrum (i.e. up to dimension six and Lorentz rank two) of the Ising, $O(n)$ and hypercubic scalar CFTs. Our work enables future conformal bootstrap studies for numerous theories of interest. We include introductions to EFT and CFT, and we illustrate our method and the structure in RG mixing matrices in several illuminating examples, which may also be of general interest. All results in the general theory are publicly available and we describe a systematic path towards applying them to more complicated CFTs.</description>

      <title>Fermions and Supersymmetry in Neural Network Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce fermionic neural network field theories via Grassmann-valued neural networks. Free theories are obtained by a generalization of the Central Limit Theorem to Grassmann variables. This enables the realization of the free Dirac spinor at infinite width and a four fermion interaction at finite width. Yukawa couplings are introduced by breaking the statistical independence of the output weights for the fermionic and bosonic fields. A large class of interacting supersymmetric quantum mechanics and field theory models are introduced by super-affine transformations on the input that realize a superspace formalism.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Spin-1/2 Particle Scattering in a Spinning Cosmic String Spacetime with Torsion, Curvature, and a Coulomb Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the scattering states of spin-1/2 particles in the spacetime of a spinning cosmic string with spacelike disclination and dislocation, with and without a Coulomb interaction. Working within the tetrad formalism, we solve the Dirac equation for several configurations of the angular momentum density $J_t$ and the torsion parameter $J_z$ that are relevant from a physical perspective. These configurations include balanced torsion ($J_t = J_z$), pure spinning strings ($J_z = 0$), pure screw dislocations ($J_t = 0$) and the general case. In all cases, the geometry modifies an effective azimuthal quantum number, and for strong rotation it introduces a geometric radial cutoff $\rho_c$ that acts as a hard wall. These factors lead to closed-form expressions for the radial wave functions, phase shifts and differential cross sections, which are expressed in terms of confluent hypergeometric and Bessel functions. We demonstrate that conical curvature, rotation and torsion generate Aharonov-Bohm-like contributions, as well as energy- and momentum-dependent asymmetries in Dirac-Coulomb scattering. This results in topology-renormalised Mott/Rutherford patterns. In the Coulomb-free limit, scattering becomes purely geometric yet still exhibits characteristic forward enhancement, which is governed by defect parameters and the cutoff. We briefly discuss possible realisations in Dirac materials, such as strained or defective graphene, where lattice disclinations and dislocations mimic the cosmic-string geometry.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the $k$-theorem with the ANEC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fundamental theorem in renormalization group flows in two dimensions is the $c$-theorem, which dictates that the number of degrees of freedom must decrease monotonically along the renormalization group flow. The $k$-theorem claims that the number of charged degrees of freedom also decreases monotonically. Here, $k$ is the current central charge defined by the two-point function of the current. A recent derivation of the c-theorem by Hartman and Mathys, which uses the three-point function sum rule and the positivity of the averaged null energy (ANE) operator, motivates us to seek a similar proof of the k-theorem. In the case of the $k$-theorem, the partial contact terms need to be taken into consideration. While ignoring the partial contact terms yields contradictory results, our careful analysis incorporating them leads to the correct sum rule and a complete proof based on the positivity of the ANE operator.</description>

      <title>Entanglement first law for timelike entanglement entropy and linearized Einstein's equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17098v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the entanglement first law of conformal field theory (CFT) to timelike subregions. Focusing on intervals along the time direction of the boundary CFT, we show that the associated timelike entanglement entropy obeys a first-law-like relation, with an effective entanglement temperature inversely proportional to the temporal size of the interval. By implementing a double Wick rotation, we obtain the exact modular Hamiltonian for a suitable hyperbolic subsystem and use it to formulate the timelike entanglement first law precisely. Our central result is a detailed proof that, in asymptotically Anti-de Sitter spacetime, this timelike entanglement first law is equivalent to linearized Einstein's equations in the bulk: the first law follows from the linearized equations and, conversely, implies them. Our result further reveal the dynamical connections between entanglement and gravity.</description>

      <title>Analytic Computation of Dilaton Black Hole Quasinormal Modes via Seiberg-Witten Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the quasinormal modes (QNMs) of dilaton black holes in Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton gravity through a correspondence with the quantum Seiberg-Witten (SW) curve of $\mathcal{N}=2$ SU(2) gauge theory with $N_f=3$ hypermultiplets. By mapping both the black hole perturbation equation and the quantum SW curve to the confluent Heun form, the QNM problem is reformulated in a gauge-theoretic framework, and the spectrum is obtained via the SW quantization condition. The resulting frequencies show excellent agreement with those computed using the WKB and continued fraction methods, with typical deviations below $10^{-3}$. The QNM spectrum exhibits consistent trends: increasing the black hole charge or scalar field mass raises the oscillation frequency, while higher angular momentum reduces the damping rate. These results demonstrate the precision of the quantum SW framework in describing black hole perturbations and reveal new links between supersymmetric gauge theories and gravitational dynamics.</description>

      <title>Large deflection scattering, soft radiation and KMOC formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: KMOC (Kosower, Maybee, and O'Connell) formalism is an approach to analyze classical scattering in gauge theories and gravity using a class of ``inclusive'' observables which can be computed solely from on-shell amplitudes \cite{Kosower:2018adc}. This formalism has led to striking developments in the context of perturbative scattering, which corresponds to large impact parameter scattering. As a result, in its current form, the KMOC formulae can not be directly applied to processes for generic values of the impact parameter. However, there is a domain where the relationship between classical radiation and on-shell amplitudes can be stretched beyond large impact parameter scattering. This regime is defined by the soft expansion of outgoing radiation. It is thus natural to ask if such soft radiative fields can be computed using the basic paradigm set by the KMOC formalism. In this short note, we show that this is indeed the case for electromagnetic memory. That is, we compute an inclusive observable associated with soft flux at ${\cal I}^{+}$ and show that, irrespective of the details of the hard scattering, this observable defines a non-perturbative formula for electromagnetic memory in the classical limit. We argue that the result obtained using the KMOC paradigm is consistent with those in \cite{Laddha:2018rle}, where the classical limit of the quantum soft theorem was taken using saddle point analysis.</description>

      <title>A Unified Causal Framework for Nonlinear Electrodynamics Black Hole from Courant-Hilbert Approach: Thermodynamics and Singularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a unified framework for analyzing black hole thermodynamics and spacetime structure in Einstein gravity coupled to causal nonlinear electrodynamics (NED) in asymptotically anti--de Sitter backgrounds. The electromagnetic sector is governed by a Generalized Nonlinear Electrodynamics (GNED) Lagrangian obtained from a root-$T\bar T$ deformation constructed via the Courant--Hilbert approach, ensuring both duality invariance and causal propagation. This theory contains ModMax, Generalized Born-Infeld (GBI), and self-dual logarithmic electrodynamics as continuous limits. Within this framework we obtain exact charged AdS black hole solutions and perform a detailed study of their thermodynamic properties, including mass, temperature, entropy, and free energy. The resulting phase structure exhibits van der~Waals-type transitions between small and large black holes and features a characteristic swallowtail in the free energy at the critical point.
  We further investigate the internal geometry and show that the nature of the central singularity is determined by the matter fields sourcing the spacetime. Analysis of the Kretschmann scalar demonstrates how gravity and electromagnetism jointly control curvature blow-up in charged and ModMax black holes, with gravity providing the leading divergence. In contrast, (GBI) and logarithmic (NED) models imprint distinct singularity profiles governed by the specific functional form of their Lagrangians. Examining the near-origin behavior of the metric allows us to identify the parameter ranges that support an event horizon and to determine when the solution instead becomes a naked singularity. Overall, the comparison across models reveals that different causal NED theories produce identifiable signatures in both the strength of the singularity and the conditions for horizon formation.</description>

      <title>Subtleties of non-Abelian D-brane actions and their effect on holographic heavy-light meson spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the holographic description of heavy light mesons in the D3-D7 system at zero temperature, analyzing the dynamics of the coupled probe D7 branes through the non-Abelian Dirac-Born-Infeld action. Distinct quark masses are realized by separating the flavor branes, producing holographic flavor hierarchies. We refine the calculation made in previous works: we impose Hermiticity on the induced metric and fix the expansion of the determinant for matrix valued fields. Implementing these improvements yields modified fluctuation equations and quantitatively different meson spectra: the scalar modes become heavier while the vector modes become lighter, removing the degeneracy reported in the literature. At finite 't Hooft coupling, we also observe a qualitatively different dependence of the vector modes on the quark masses. The resulting prescription provides a consistent, broadly applicable framework for incorporating non-Abelian flavor dynamics into holographic models and can be readily extended to situations away from the vacuum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03879v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We identify a general class of spacetime metrics that mimic the properties of black holes without possessing a true event horizon. These metrics are constrained by the requirements of being singularity-free and geodesically complete. Specifically, we study metrics that do not possess $Z_2$ symmetry and may deviate slightly or significantly from the symmetric case. Focusing on scalar perturbations propagating on such backgrounds, we analyze the resulting effective radial potentials and their dependence on different corners of the mimicker landscape. We further investigate the corresponding quasinormal modes and explore their characteristic features. Finally, we survey the landscape for potential observational signatures, including shadow properties and the possible presence or absence of echo effects.</description>

      <title>Learning of Statistical Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recovering microscopic couplings directly from data provides a route to solving the inverse problem in statistical field theories, one that complements the traditional-often computationally intractable-forward approach of predicting observables from an action or Hamiltonian. Here, we propose an approach for the inverse problem that uniformly accommodates systems with discrete, continuous, and hybrid variables. We demonstrate accurate parameter recovery in several benchmark systems-including Wegner's Ising gauge theory, $\phi^4$ theory, Schwinger and Sine-Gordon models, and mixed spin-gauge systems, and show how iterating the procedure under coarse-graining reconstructs full non-perturbative renormalization-group flows. This gives direct access to phase boundaries, fixed points, and emergent interactions without relying on perturbation theory. We also address a realistic setting where full gauge configurations may be unavailable, and reformulate learning algorithms for multiple field theories so that they are recovered directly using observables such as correlations from scattering data or quantum simulators. We anticipate that our methodology will find widespread use in practical learning of field theories in strongly coupled regimes where analytical tools might fail.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we attempt to construct the topological theory of superfluid helium $4$ in the framework of the (rigid) $U(1)$ model in which the initial $U(1)$ group is destroyed with appearance of (topologically nontrivial) domains separated by domain walls treated as step voltages between domains (e.g. with neighboring topological numbers). This can explain the superfluid properties in a helium $4$ specimen as well as the appearance of topologically nontrivial vortices therein.</description>

      <title>Navigating the Quantum Resource Landscape of Entropy Vector Space Using Machine Learning and Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a machine learning framework to study the dynamics of entropy vectors and quantum resources, including entanglement and magic, focusing on violations of entropy inequalities. Using a reinforcement learning agent formulated as a Markov decision process, we identify quantum circuits that optimally navigate the entropy vector space to generate violations of Ingleton's inequality. We complement this approach with a classical optimization algorithm to produce arbitrary numbers of Ingleton-violating states, with tunable degrees of violation, and empirically determine the maximal attainable violation for Ingleton's inequality. Our analysis reveals characteristic patterns of quantum resources that accompany Ingleton violation. A comprehensive statistical analysis shows that Ingleton-violating states occupy sharply-defined, isolated regions of the Hilbert space, and are extremely rare. Together, these results establish a unified computational toolkit for studying entropy vector dynamics, tracking quantum resource evolution, and engineering circuits with controlled information-theoretic features.</description>

      <title>Exploring the gauge flexibility of the linear-in-spin effective-one-body Hamiltonian at the 5.5 post-Newtonian order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the gauge-general expressions of the two gyro-gravitomagnetic functions entering the spin-orbit sector of the effective-one-body (EOB) Hamiltonian up to the fifth-and-half post-Newtonian (5.5PN) order. Our results include both local and nonlocal-in-time contributions, providing the most general analytical formulation of the linear-in-spin conservative dynamics within the EOB framework. These expressions are then employed to compute two gauge-invariant observables for quasi-circular orbits: the binding energy and the fractional periastron advance. We also use them to compare two spin-gauge choices: the well-known Damour-Jaranowski-Sch\"afer ($\rm DJS$) gauge, in which the gyro-gravitomagnetic functions are independent of the orbital angular momentum, and the alternative anti-$\rm DJS$ (or $\overline{\rm DJS}$) gauge, designed to reproduce in the test-mass limit the spin-orbit interaction of a spinning test particle in a Kerr background. For a circular, equal-mass, equal-spin binary, our analysis indicates that the $\overline{\rm DJS}$ gauge provides a slightly improved description of the inspiral dynamics, suggesting potential advantages for its use in future EOB waveform models.</description>

      <title>LISA as a probe of pre-big-bang physics: a nested sampling analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using a nested sampling analysis, we study the gravitational-wave background (GWB) predicted by pre-big-bang cosmology, both in its minimal and non-minimal version. Within the LISA sensitivity range, the GWB signal is a flat or a broken power law, parametrized by four fundamental quantities: the Hubble parameter at the curvature bounce $H_1$, the axion mass $m$, the initial amplitude of the axion field $\sigma_i$ and the exponent $\beta$ governing the high-energy growth of the dilaton and the dynamics of the internal dimensions. We determine the posterior distributions of these parameters based on how LISA would detect such signal. Including the galactic and extra-galactic foregrounds in the analysis, the most stringent constraints on $H_1$, $\sigma_i$ and $\beta$ are obtained when the signal exhibits a left-bend feature, while for $m$ this happens for a right-bend feature. Relative uncertainties reach $\Delta H_1/H_1 ,\,\Delta m/m \sim 18\%$ at $68\%$ confidence level under favourable conditions. LISA will thus be capable of placing significant constraints on the pre-big-bang model, potentially providing empirical hints of string theory in the case of detection.</description>

      <title>Numerical tiling-based simulations of decoherence in multifield models of inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In previous work, we developed a method for computing two-point correlators by decomposing the mode degrees of freedom into fast and slow components. Building on this framework, we present a numerical implementation to study the evolution of primordial scalar perturbations under controlled state deformations induced by the simplest environment corrections from the Lindblad equation. Our approach generalizes to an arbitrary number of degrees of freedom and does not rely on the slow-roll approximation. The computational routine is numerically efficient and allows users to configure arbitrary sequences of decoherence events, with full control over their duration, shape, amplitude and effective wavelength range. The resulting outputs are compatible with nonlinear numerical codes, enabling studies of how decoherence effects propagate during reheating.</description>

      <title>Scatter-Limited Hybrid Monte Carlo, Deterministic Transport with Quasi-Monte Carlo Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a hybrid method for time-dependent particle transport that combines Monte Carlo (MC) estimation with a deterministic discrete ordinates (\(S_N\)) solve, augmented by quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) sampling. For spatial discretizations, the MC component computes a piecewise-constant (cell-averaged) solution, while the \(S_N\) stage employs bilinear discontinuous finite elements. By hybridizing the formulation, the MC subproblem after a prescribed scatter limit becomes scattering-free, yielding a simple and efficient streaming/attenuation procedure. Between time steps, a simple scatter-free MC step is run to relabel the $S_N$ solution as an MC solution.
  A key feature of the approach is a tunable parameter \(N_{s}\) that controls how many material collisions are handled in the (Q)MC leg before handing off to the deterministic \(S_N\) solve; \(N_s=0\) recovers a purely uncollided MC leg, while \(N_s&gt;0\) produces multi-scatter hybrids. QMC replaces pseudorandom draws with low-discrepancy points in the existing MC sampling maps, enabling a plug-in adoption within the standard MC code with modest, localized changes.
  We observe significant accuracy and convergence rate improvements through the use of QMC and practically no additional computational cost, which are generally not seen in comparable non-hybrid solves. We believe the multi-scatter approach provides additional flexibility in terms of parallelization and the choice of deterministic solver.</description>

      <title>Accelerating parameter estimation for parameterized tests of general relativity with gravitational-wave observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tests of general relativity (GR) with gravitational waves (GWs) introduce additional deviation parameters in the waveform model. The enlarged parameter space makes inference computationally costly, which has so far limited systematic, large-scale studies that are essential to quantify degeneracies, check effect of waveform systematics, and assess robustness across non-stationary and non-Gaussian noise effects. The need is even sharper for next-generation (XG) observatories where signals are longer, signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) are higher, and likelihood evaluations increase substantially. We address this by applying relative binning to the TIGER framework for parameterized tests of GR. Relative binning replaces dense frequency evaluations with evaluations on adaptively chosen frequency bins, reducing the cost per likelihood call while preserving posterior accuracy. Using simulated binary black hole signals, we demonstrate unbiased recovery for GR-consistent cases and targeted non-GR deviations, and we map how bin resolution controls accuracy, with fine binning primarily required for the $-1$ post-Newtonian term. A high-SNR simulated signal at next-generation sensitivity further shows accurate recovery with tight posteriors. Applied to GW150914 and GW250114, both single and multi-parameter TIGER analyses finish within a day, yielding deviation bounds consistent with GR at 90\% credibility and in agreement with previous results. Across analyses, the method reduces wall time by factors of $\mathcal{O}(10)$ to $\mathcal{O}(100)$, depending on frequency range and binning, without degrading parameter estimation accuracy.</description>

      <title>The identification of the extended refined open partition function and the Kontsevich-Penner matrix model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The open intersection theory has been initiated by R. Pandharipande, J. P. Solomon and R. J. Tessler. In the scope of matrix model theory, A. Buryak and R. J. Tessler have constructed a matrix model $\mathcal{Z}^o$ for the open partition function based on a Kontsevich type combinatorial formula for the open intersection numbers found by R. J. Tessler. In this paper, using the Harish-Chandra-Itzykson-Zuber formula and operational calculus, we transform $\mathcal{Z}^o$ into another simple form, and define the matrix model $\mathcal{Z}_N^{o,ext,s}$ for the extended refined open partition function from it. The expression of $\mathcal{Z}_N^{o,ext,s}$ will immediately lead us to the Kontsevich-Penner matrix model $Z_N$ under the Miwa parametrization $s_i=2^ii!\operatorname{tr} \Lambda^{-2i-2}$. Hence it confirms the identification between the two models for general $N\geq 1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.17320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a supersymmetric generalisation of topological recursion from two perspectives: algebraic and geometric. The algebraic side concerns a recursive structure encoded in modules of a super Virasoro algebra, and the geometric counterpart is what we call superconformal topological recursion defined on a super Riemann surface. Superconformal topological recursion indicates that odd holomorphic one-forms on a super Riemann surface are related to zero modes of copies of the Clifford algebras, and it also provides a tool to study deformation of non-split super Riemann surfaces, e.g. certain families of super Riemann surfaces carrying odd parameters. On a super Riemann surface over a non-reduced base, the formalism is recursive not only in terms of pants-decomposition but also in terms of odd parameters in a suitable sense.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.17349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop elements of coordinate-space perturbation theory for massive quantum field theories in general $d$-dimensional Euclidean space. Using the expansion in Gegenbauer polynomials, we provide analytic expressions for several three-point correlation functions in theories with one massive and one massless field. To this end, a class of antiderivatives of products of two Bessel functions multiplied by a power of their common argument are studied systematically. We expect these results to be useful in perturbative calculations involving vertices of high degree, at finite temperature and/or in finite volume, as well as in auxiliary perturbative computations for a lattice QCD treatment of hadronic effects in precision observables. As an illustration, we compute the one-loop coordinate-space propagator of a massive particle coupled to a massless one, both in the vacuum and at finite temperature.</description>

      <title>Entanglement and correlations between local observables in de Sitter spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Studies of quantum field entanglement in de Sitter space based on the von Neumann entropy of local patches have concluded that curvature enhances entanglement between regions and their complements. Similar conclusions about entanglement enhancement have been reached in analyses of Fourier modes in the cosmological patch of de Sitter space. We challenge this interpretation by adopting a fully local approach: examining entanglement between pairs of field modes compactly supported within de Sitter's cosmological patch. Our approach is formulated in terms of the properties of a metric tensor and an associated complex structure induced by the Bunch-Davies vacuum on the classical phase space. We find that increasing curvature increases correlations between local modes but, somewhat counterintuitively, decreases their entanglement. Our methods allow us to characterize how entanglement is spatially distributed, revealing that a cosmological constant, even if tiny, qualitatively alters the vacuum's entanglement structure. We show that our results are compatible with previous entropy-based studies when properly interpreted. Our findings have implications for entanglement between observables generated during cosmic inflation.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the prospects for detecting a parity-violating gravitational-wave background (GWB) with third-generation ground-based detector networks. We focus on a network consisting of one Einstein Telescope (ET) and two Cosmic Explorer (CE) detectors. In our analysis we vary the ET design, detector orientations, and arm lengths, in order to assess the impact of geometry and scale on detection capabilities. We demonstrate that networks with an L-shaped ET design have stronger parity violation constraining power than networks with a triangular ET design, particularly seen when studying ET designs on their own.</description>

      <title>How Significant are Cosmological Collider Signals in the Planck Data?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The search for primordial non-Gaussianities (PNG) is theoretically well motivated but remains observationally challenging. Tight constraints with low significance for the standard non-Gaussian shapes suggest that detection may lie beyond the reach of near-future experiments. However, tests of PNG are highly template-dependent. From a theory perspective, a whole new family of bispectrum shapes arise in the cosmological collider program, with distinct signatures of heavy particles during inflation. In this work, we provide a class of simplified collider templates for these particles that encompasses a broader range of masses, sound speeds, and interactions. We propose that, given the current state of observations, the most effective strategy to search for PNG signals is through orthogonalizing the collider templates, such that they are uncorrelated with the tightly constrained single field predictions. Using the Modal pipeline and Planck CMB data, we perform a systematic parameter scan of the collider templates with the most significant result reaching $2.4\sigma$ for spin-0, after taking into account the look-elsewhere effect; indicative results for spin-1 and spin-2 peak near 2$\sigma$. These results indicate that, with refined collider templates and improved data analysis strategies, there are credible prospects with forthcoming observations to detect PNG and also rule out single field inflation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2201.09520v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The critical $O(N)$ CFT in spacetime dimensions $2 &lt; d &lt; 4$ is one of the most important examples of a conformal field theory, with the Ising CFT at $N=1$, $2 \leq d &lt; 4$, as a notable special case. Apart from numerous physical applications, it serves frequently as a concrete testing ground for new approaches and techniques based on conformal symmetry. In the perturbative limits - the $4-\varepsilon$ expansion, the large $N$ expansion and the $2+\tilde\epsilon$ expansion - a lot of conformal data have been computed over the years. In this report, we give an overview of the critical $O(N)$ CFT, including some methods to study it, and present a large collection of conformal data. The data, extracted from the literature and supplemented by many additional computations of order $\varepsilon$ anomalous dimensions, are made available through an ancillary data file.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02127v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The macroscopic energy-momentum and spin densities of relativistic spin hydrodynamics are obtained from the ensemble average of their respective microscopic definitions (quantum operators). These microscopic definitions suffer from ambiguities, meaning that one may obtain different forms of symmetric energy-momentum tensor and spin tensor through pseudogauge transformations (or, in other words, Belinfante improvement procedure). However, this ambiguity may be fixed if we obtain these currents using Noether's second theorem instead of widely used Noether's first theorem. The second theorem fixes the super-potential determined by local symmetry, thereby selecting a unique physically consistent pseudogauge. In this article, we use Noether's second theorem to derive energy-momentum and spin currents without the need of pseudogauge transformations for free Dirac massive particles with spin one-half.</description>

Abstract: Lecture notes prepared for the Les Houches school "Quantum Geometry: Mathematical Methods for Gravity, Gauge Theories and Non-Perturbative Physics" that took place during the summer 2024. We cover the techniques to perform the exact gravitational path integral of two-dimensional dilaton-gravity, and supergravity, over spacetimes with arbitrary topology, with an application to black holes. We discuss the connection with random matrix models and moduli spaces of hyperbolic surfaces briefly, since those concepts were covered in other lectures of the school.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00900v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The gravitational path integral on $S^2 \times S^2$ can be interpreted either as evaluating a contribution to the norm of the Hartle-Hawking wavefunction conditional on spatial $S^1 \times S^2$ topology, or the pair creation rate of black holes in de Sitter. Both interpretations are distinguished at the quantum level. The former requires the path integral to be real and the latter to be imaginary. We develop a formalism to efficiently compute the phase of the gravitational path integral on Einstein spaces. We apply it to a broad class of spacetimes and in particular $S^2\times S^{D-2}$, finding it to be real and positive. We generalize some of the analysis to cases with charge and rotation.</description>

Abstract: The recently released data from the $\textit{Atacama Cosmology Telescope}$ (ACT) confirms that the primordial scalar spectrum is extremely flat. This, together with current upper bounds on the tensor-to-scalar ratio, implies that the simplest models of inflation coming from particle physics (for instance, a minimally-coupled scalar with monomial potentials) need additional ingredients in order to make them compatible with observations. Instead of invoking arbitrary new couplings or new interactions that are not protected symmetries, we argue that dissipation of the inflaton field with the radiation bath should be added as a new physical principle. Accordingly, we show that warm inflation provides the correct paradigm to explain the current observations, given very natural choices of dissipative terms. The model analyzed here has mirror and $Z_4$ symmetries, which explicitly protect the inflaton potential from large quantum and thermal corrections. We use a recent precision numerical code designed for warm inflationary perturbations, improving on the determination of the cosmological observables previously obtained for such models.</description>

      <title>Topological Manipulations On $\mathbb{R}$ Symmetries Of Abelian Gauge Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03700v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Performing topological manipulations is a fruitful way to understand global aspects of Quantum Field Theory (QFT). Such modifications are typically controlled by the notion of Topological QFT (TQFT) coupling across different codimensions. Motivated by the recent developments involving non-compact TQFTs as the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT) for continuous symmetries, we realize topological manipulations on global $\mathbb{R}$ symmetries via TQFT coupling in the simple context of non-compact abelian gauge theory. Namely, by inserting the background fields for $\mathbb{R}$ symmetries into non-compact TQFTs on spacetime, we study the topological gaugings. Furthermore, we explore topological defects in non-compact theories by employing the said manipulations on the half-space, which are analogous to duality defects in compact gauge theories. We examine the action of these defects on the local and extended operators, and discuss their algebra. As opposed to the duality defects, our defects act invertibly on the spectrum. To further understand their role, we discuss the way they mix with other topological defects and the resulting global symmetries. We also comment on possible applications of these ideas to the bosonic String Theory. After studying defects, we provide a detailed inspection of manipulations on $\mathbb{R}^{(-1)}$ and $\mathbb{R}^{(d-1)}$ symmetries in abelian gauge theory. Notably, we develop a novel deformation tailored for flat gauging subgroups of $\mathbb{R}^{(d-1)}$ symmetries, and provide an extension of it for $\mathbb{R}^{(p)}$ symmetries. We show that this new simple deformation captures all the topological boundary conditions of the corresponding non-compact SymTFTs as the deformation parameter is varied, which the ordinary non-compact BF coupling cannot do.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03249v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new coherent state expansion of the exponential representation of the S-matrix for the classical gravitational two-body problem. By combining the Kosower-Maybee-O'Connell (KMOC) formalism with the Dirac bracket structure emerging in the classical limit, we derive compact and gauge-invariant expressions for scattering observables in the presence of radiation. This causal formulation bypasses the calculation of KMOC cuts and provides a direct link between observables and a minimal set of classical matrix elements extracted from amplitudes. We illustrate our method with several examples, including the impulse, spin kick, angular momentum, waveform and the related radiative fluxes. Finally, using our formalism we evaluate for the first time the spin kick and the change in angular momentum of each particle up to $\mathcal{O}(G^2 s_1^{j_1} s_2^{j_2})$ with $j_1+ j_2 \leq 11$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03862v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive a local, crossing symmetric dispersion relation (CSDR) for 2-2 scattering amplitudes with a parametric ambiguity motivated by string theory. Various limits of the parameter lead to the fixed-t, fixed-s, and other known CSDRs. We also present formulae for higher-subtracted cases. Several examples are discussed for illustration. In particular, for the Veneziano and the Virasoro-Shapiro amplitudes, we derive parametric series representations which manifest poles in all channels and converge everywhere. We then discuss applications of our formalism for bootstrapping weakly-coupled gravitational EFTs. We demonstrate that even in the presence of the graviton pole, one can derive bounds on the Wilson coefficients while working in the forward limit, with the parameter acting as the IR regulator instead. Finally, we derive series representations for multi-variable, totally symmetric generalisations of the Veneziano and Virasoro-Shapiro amplitudes that manifest poles in all the variables. This is a first step towards dispersion relations for n-particle scattering amplitudes.</description>

Abstract: We explicitly construct a class of multivariate generalized hypergeometric series which is conjectured in our previous paper [Alkalaev &amp; Mandrygin 2025] to calculate multipoint one-loop parametric conformal integrals in $D$ dimensions. Our approach is based on a simple diagrammatic algorithm which systematically builds both arguments and series coefficients in terms of a convex polygon which is part of the Baxter lattice. The examples of the box, pentagon, and hexagon integrals are considered in detail.</description>

Abstract: We propose a new large $N$ limit which at the extreme limit is dual in the bulk to a back-reacted traversable wormhole, by making use if a novel definition of algebra at infinity, an algebra familiar in the literature from the study of quasi-local algebras. We also compute, from a purely algebraic perspective, the effects registered by a left universe observer due to a unitary fluctuation on the right universe of the traversable wormhole, and reproduce a result from an earlier computation by Maldacena, Stanford and Yang \cite{Maldacena:2017axo}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00593v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-invariants are local-unitary invariants of state replicas introduced as potential probes of multipartite entanglement and correlations in quantum many-body systems. In this paper, we investigate two multi-invariants for tripartite pure states, namely multi-entropy and dihedral invariant. We compute the (genuine) multi-entropy for Lifshitz groundstates, and obtain its analytical continuation to noninteger values of R\'enyi index. We show that the genuine multi-entropy can be expressed in terms of mutual information and logarithmic negativity, a relation that also holds for stabilizer states. For general tripartite pure states, we demonstrate that dihedral invariants are related to R\'enyi reflected entropies. In particular, we show that the dihedral permutations of replicas are equivalent to the reflected construction, or alternatively to the realignment of density matrices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02542v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe tree level soft theorems for Chern-Simons QED and QCD in 4+1 dimensions. Soft theorems have been studied in various context in the past. The universal behavior of the leading and subleading soft theorems is understood as a consequence of the local on-shell invariance of the scattering amplitudes. Chern-Simons terms are gauge invariant only up to a boundary term. Hence, they make for an interesting case to study the relationship between gauge invariance and soft theorems. In this paper, we show that the subleading soft theorems in QED and QCD get corrected when Chern-Simons terms are introduced and also derive those corrections. We start with a discussion on soft theorems as a consequence of gauge invariance. Then we move on to derive the Chern-Simons vertices. Finally, we calculate the correction to soft theorems due to the addition of Chern-Simons terms for both QED and QCD.</description>

      <title>Physics and Geometry of Complex Structure Limits in Type IIB Calabi-Yau Compactifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07056v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a detailed geometric and physical interpretation of infinite distance limits in the complex structure moduli space of Type IIB compactifications on Calabi-Yau threefolds, motivated by the Emergent String Conjecture. In the framework of semi-stable degenerations, such limits are characterised by a simple fibration structure of the fastest vanishing three-cycles. The previously studied Hodge theoretic classification of infinite distance limits of type II, III, and IV is reflected in the number of one-cycles of the shrinking fibres. Complementing our recent work on limits of type II, we focus here on type III and type IV degenerations. Based on effective field theory considerations, these are expected to be decompactification limits to 6d and 5d, respectively. However, establishing the existence of the associated Kaluza-Klein tower(s) of states with both the appropriate mass scaling and the correct degeneracy requires explicit geometric input. We show that the aforementioned vanishing three-cycles are special Lagrangian three-tori, thus giving rise to towers of asymptotically massless BPS particles from multi-wrapped D3-branes with the degeneracy of a Kaluza-Klein tower. We furthermore relate the BPS index of these three-cycles to the Euler characteristic of the threefold. Finally, we systematically analyse infinite distance trajectories in multi-parameter limits described by so-called enhancement chains. We find that the primary singularity type encodes the gravitational duality frame of the limit whereas the secondary singularity type is related to the rank of the gauge group coupled to gravity. The specifics of the asymptotic physics depend crucially on whether or not the trajectory is induced by the backreaction of an EFT string.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09669v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the symbol bootstrap program for the seven-particle MHV and NMHV amplitudes in planar $\mathcal{N}=4$ super-Yang-Mills (SYM) based on the alphabet associated with the $E_6$ cluster algebra. After imposing integrability, cluster adjacency (or extended Steinmann), first- and last-entry conditions, the solution space is already highly restrictive: e.g. for MHV case there are exactly $1,1,2,3,4$ parity-invariant solutions for $L=1,2,\cdots, 5$, which automatically satisfy dihedral symmetry. Remarkably, after further requiring a well-defined collinear limit, we find a unique solution for both MHV and NMHV sectors where all coefficients (e.g. more than $3.1\times 10^{10}$ for MHV at $L=5$) turn out to be integers. Furthermore, we observe recurrent patterns for coefficients of special words in $E_6$ symbols mirroring those found for the $C_2$ symbol of three-point form factors, which lead to numerous predictions in the form of all-loop sequences. As an initial application, we show that these sequences uniquely fix the MHV symbol through five loops without input from collinear limits. Given the simplicity and surprisingly strong constraining power of both physical constraints and the newly observed sequences, we conjecture that there is a unique symbol satisfying these constraints at any loop order.</description>

      <title>BPS Lie algebras for totally negative 2-Calabi-Yau categories and nonabelian Hodge theory for stacks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.07668v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define and study a sheaf-theoretic cohomological Hall algebra for suitably geometric Abelian categories $\mathcal{A}$ of homological dimension at most two, and a sheaf-theoretic BPS algebra under the conditions that $\mathcal{A}$ is 2-Calabi-Yau and has a good moduli space. We show that the BPS algebra for the preprojective algebra $\Pi_Q$ of a totally negative quiver is the free algebra generated by the intersection cohomology of the closure of the locus parameterising simple $\Pi_Q$-modules in the coarse moduli space.
  We define and study the BPS Lie algebra of arbitrary 2-Calabi-Yau categories $\mathcal{A}$ for which the Euler form is negative on all pairs of non-zero objects, which recovers the BPS algebra as its universal enveloping algebra for such "totally negative" 2CY categories. We show that for totally negative 2CY categories the BPS algebra is freely generated by intersection complexes of certain coarse moduli spaces as above, and the Borel-Moore homology of the stack of objects in such $\mathcal{A}$ satisfies a Yangian-type PBW theorem for the BPS Lie algebra. In this way we prove the cohomological integrality theorem for these categories.
  We use our results to prove that for $C$ a smooth projective curve, and for $r$ and $d$ not necessarily coprime, there is a nonabelian Hodge isomorphism between the Borel-Moore homologies of the stack of rank $r$ and degree $d$ Higgs bundles, and the appropriate stack of twisted representations of the fundamental group of $C$. In addition we prove the Bozec-Schiffmann positivity conjecture for totally negative quivers; we prove that their polynomials counting cuspidal functions in the constructible Hall algebra for $Q$ have positive coefficients, strengthening the positivity theorem for the Kac polynomials of such quivers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12351v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we consider the dynamics of the self-induced collapse of the tachyon wave function in inflationary scenarios. We analyze the modifications on the power spectrum by considering the $\beta$-exponential potential, whose parameters have updated constraints by the Planck 2018 baseline data and recent results from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT). Moreover, we show that for this kind of potential, just for a narrow range of $\beta$-parameter, there is agreement between the theoretical predictions and the current observational data. Considering the proposal for a collapse scheme that leads to the modification of Schr\"odinger evolution of the inflation wave function from the employment of a Continuous Spontaneous Localization (CSL) approach, we derive the scalar spectral index and tensor-to-scalar ratio. We then obtained the constraints on both collapse and $\beta$-parameters that, in turn, yield deviations in the $n_{s}$ vs. $r$ plane when compared to the $\beta$-exponential potential standard estimate. The CSL scheme applied to tachyonic inflation driven by a $\beta$-potential offers an adequate description of the recent data.</description>

Abstract: We analyze the quasinormal mode spectrum for Kerr black holes surrounded by an asymptotically uniform magnetic field, modeled with the Ernst-Wild geometry. A perturbative expansion in both the rotation parameter $a$ and the magnetic field $B$ allows the analysis of perturbations with Kerr-like asymptotics well inside the Melvin radius, and we obtain the spectrum for a variety of scalar quasinormal modes over a range of parameters using the continued fraction method. We then interpolate the low-lying mode spectrum to construct an Ernst-Wild template for the ringdown, and use the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA analysis tool pyRing to assess the impact of the magnetosphere on the extraction of ringdown signatures from several observed binary black hole mergers.</description>

      <title>Exploring the universal $\bar{\mathcal{I}}-\mathcal{C}$ relations for relativistic stars in $f(Q)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11296v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of neutron stars within the framework of $f(Q)$ gravity by incorporating rotational effects through a slowly rotating metric. We derive the modified TOV equations and calculate the angular velocity profiles and moments of inertia (MOI) for linear, quadratic, exponential, and logarithmic $f(Q)$ models. Our results show that deviations in the MOI are more pronounced than those in the stellar mass profiles, suggesting that rotational observables are highly sensitive to geometric corrections. We also calculate a quasi-universal relation between the dimensionless MOI and compactness ($\bar{I}$-$C$). The linear and quadratic models are generally consistent with observational data from PSR J0737-3039A, although the deviations are small and difficult to distinguish from General Relativity due to inherent EoS variability. On other hand, the logarithmic and exponential models show larger deviations (over 20 %), exceeding the EoS-induced uncertainty reported by Suleiman &amp; Read (2024), highlighting the relation's sensitivity to the $f(Q)$ gravity model. These results indicate that $f(Q)$ gravity could potentially be tested in the strong-field regime and point to a direction for future studies, such as investigating EoS-insensitive quasi-universal relations, like the $\bar{I}(\Lambda)$ relations, within the $f(Q)$ framework. Such relations may provide a clearer pathway for exploring possible signatures in strong-field gravity when combined with more precise future observations.</description>

Abstract: In high-energy heavy-ion physics experiments, a state of matter is created that existed in the early Universe: the quark-gluon plasma. This strongly interacting matter exists in today's experiments only within a range of a few femtometers and for a duration of a few femtometers per speed of light, making its resolution with optical tools impossible. However, there is a method that allows for a closer look into the structure of the quark-gluon plasma: femtoscopy. Initially used in astronomy, femtoscopy is based on the quantum mechanical indistinguishability of identical particles, which causes them to arrive at detectors in a correlated manner. The measurable correlation is related to the spacetime structure of the particle-emitting source, which in heavy-ion physics is the quark-gluon plasma created in collisions. For free particles, a relatively simple relationship exists between the source and the correlation (essentially a Fourier transform). However, this relationship becomes complex when accurately accounting for the repulsive Coulomb interaction between final-state electrically charged particles. Our paper presents a new method that is more precise than previously used ones, yet less computationally demanding, especially for the exotic source function shapes. Mathematically, the method is interesting because it exactly handles many emerging integrals and limits. Practically, it is ready for use in experimental analyses.</description>

      <title>On the local thermodynamic relations in relativistic spin hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20681v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate, by providing two specific examples, that the local differential thermodynamic relations used as educated guesses in relativistic hydrodynamics with spin, do not hold even at global thermodynamic equilibrium. We show, by using a rigorous quantum statistical method, that for massless free fermions and massive free fermions with rotation and acceleration at global thermodynamic equilibrium, the derivative of the pressure function with respect to the spin potential differs from the spin density and acquires a correction of the same order. Such correction cannot be eliminated by any redefinition of the entropy current, a so-called entropy-gauge transformation. Therefore, for an accurate determination of the constitutive relations in relativistic spin hydrodynamics, the traditional method of assuming differential thermodynamic relations is not appropriate.</description>

      <title>Dynamical dark energy parameterizations in VCDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03784v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the context of a theory of minimally modified gravity called VCDM, one can realize any cosmological behavior at the level of the homogeneous and isotropic background without introducing fatal instabilities for perturbations. Therefore, VCDM provides a theoretically-consistent and observationally-testable framework of dynamical dark energy parameterizations with or without phantom behaviors. In this paper, we propose the VCDM realizations of various phenomenological parameterizations present in the literature: the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL), Barboza-Alcaniz (BA), Jassal-Bagla-Padmanabhan (JBP), Exponential (EXP), and Logarithmic (LOG) models. Using the VCDM equations for cosmological perturbations, we test them against the recent cosmological datasets, Planck 2018 and DESI BAO DR2, and then discuss their implications.</description>

      <title>Observable signature of magnetic tidal coupling in hierarchical triple systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24897v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study hierarchical triple systems formed by a compact binary orbiting a supermassive black hole (SMBH), focusing on the role of relativistic magnetic tidal interactions. Extending previous analyses of precession resonances to 0.5 post-Newtonian order, we incorporate quadrupolar magnetic tidal moments, which have no Newtonian counterpart. We find that magnetic tides introduce new resonances absent at lower order, leading to additional eccentricity excitations and significantly modifying the binary's long-term evolution. Numerical solutions of the Lagrange Planetary Equations confirm these analytical predictions and reveal how resonance strength depends on orbital eccentricity and inclination. The resulting dynamics accelerates the binary merger and imprints distinctive signatures on gravitational waves, potentially observable by LISA. Our findings identify magnetic tidal coupling as a novel strong-gravity effect and establish its importance for the resonant dynamics of compact-object binaries near SMBHs.</description>

      <title>From single-particle to many-body chaos in Yukawa--SYK: theory and a cavity-QED proposal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04762v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding how quantum systems transition from integrable to fully chaotic behavior remains a central open problem in physics. The Sachdev--Ye--Kitaev (SYK) model provides a paradigmatic framework for studying many-body chaos and holography, yet it captures only the strongly correlated limit, leaving intermediate regimes unexplored. Here, we investigate the Yukawa--SYK (YSYK) model, where bosonic fields mediate random fermionic interactions, and demonstrate that it naturally bridges single-particle and many-body chaos. Using spectral and dynamical chaos markers, we perform a comprehensive finite-size characterization of the YSYK model. We show that the interaction strength acts as a tunable control parameter interpolating between the SYK$_2$ and SYK$_4$ limits, and introduce a framework enabling direct and quantitative comparison with these benchmark models. In the intermediate regimes, we uncover distinct dynamical regimes marked by partial ergodicity breaking, prethermalization plateaus, and incomplete scrambling. Finally, we propose a feasible optical-cavity implementation of the YSYK model using ultra-cold atoms. Our results establish the YSYK model as a unifying platform connecting single-particle and many-body chaos, paving the way for experimental observation of these phenomena.</description>
