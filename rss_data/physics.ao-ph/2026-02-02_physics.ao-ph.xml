      <title>AI Decodes Historical Chinese Archives to Reveal Lost Climate History</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Historical archives contain qualitative descriptions of climate events, yet converting these into quantitative records has remained a fundamental challenge. Here we introduce a paradigm shift: a generative AI framework that inverts the logic of historical chroniclers by inferring the quantitative climate patterns associated with documented events. Applied to historical Chinese archives, it produces the sub-annual precipitation reconstruction for southeastern China over the period 1368-1911 AD. Our reconstruction not only quantifies iconic extremes like the Ming Dynasty's Great Drought but also, crucially, maps the full spatial and seasonal structure of El Ni$\~n$o influence on precipitation in this region over five centuries, revealing dynamics inaccessible in shorter modern records. Our methodology and high-resolution climate dataset are directly applicable to climate science and have broader implications for the historical and social sciences.</description>

      <title>Linking Extratropical Forecast Degradation to Tropical Cyclones in Physical and AI Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Global medium-range weather forecasts suffer occasional failures ("busts"), often linked to tropical cyclones (TCs). We systematically investigate the TC influences by clustering historical TC tracks and comparing skill of forecasts from a physics-based model (ECMWF-IFS) and an AI-physics hybrid model (Google-NGCM) initialized near TC genesis. Case analysis shows both models exhibit similar large-scale error growth in the extratropics, suggesting prediction skill bounded by similar limits despite model differences in spatial resolution and parameterized physics. Aggregated statistics reveal that low skill of Week-2 forecasts may occur after TC genesis, regardless of whether they recurve or not. While recurving tracks are established error sources, zonal-track clusters can be associated with similarly profound forecast degradation, acting through Rossby wave dynamics and remote moisture transport mechanisms. Furthermore, the stochastic NGCM generally outperforms its deterministic counterpart and suggests that TC-related forecast degradation is more pronounced for Europe than elsewhere in the Northern Hemisphere.</description>

      <title>Hybrid physics-data-driven modeling for sea ice thermodynamics and transfer learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores a physics-data driven hybrid approach for sea-ice column physics models, in which a machine learning (ML) component acts as a state-dependent parameterization of forecast errors. We examine how perturbations in snow thermodynamics and sea-ice radiative properties affect forecast errors, and train dedicated neural networks (NNs) for each model configuration. The performance of the hybrid models is evaluated for long lead-time forecasts and compared against a benchmark system based on climatological forecast-error estimates. The NN-based hybrids prove to be stable, robust to initial condition and atmospheric forcing errors, and consistently outperform their climatology-based counterpart. To derive guiding principles for efficiently handling possible physical model updates, we perform transfer learning experiments to test whether pretrained NNs optimized for one model configuration can be successfully adapted to another. Results indicate that direct evaluation of pretrained networks on the target task provides useful insights into their adaptability, recommending transfer learning whenever performance exceeds a trivial baseline. Finally, a feature-importance analysis shows that atmospheric forcing inputs have negligible influence on NN predictive skill, while ice-layer enthalpies play a key role in achieving satisfactory performance.</description>

      <title>Learning to Advect: A Neural Semi-Lagrangian Architecture for Weather Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent machine-learning approaches to weather forecasting often employ a monolithic architecture, where distinct physical mechanisms (advection, transport), diffusion-like mixing, thermodynamic processes, and forcing are represented implicitly within a single large network. This representation is particularly problematic for advection, where long-range transport must be treated with expensive global interaction mechanisms or through deep, stacked convolutional layers. To mitigate this, we present PARADIS, a physics-inspired global weather prediction model that imposes inductive biases on network behavior through a functional decomposition into advection, diffusion, and reaction blocks acting on latent variables. We implement advection through a Neural Semi-Lagrangian operator that performs trajectory-based transport via differentiable interpolation on the sphere, enabling end-to-end learning of both the latent modes to be transported and their characteristic trajectories. Diffusion-like processes are modeled through depthwise-separable spatial mixing, while local source terms and vertical interactions are modeled via pointwise channel interactions, enabling operator-level physical structure. PARADIS provides state-of-the-art forecast skill at a fraction of the training cost. On ERA5-based benchmarks, the 1 degree PARADIS model, with a total training cost of less than a GPU month, meets or exceeds the performance of 0.25 degree traditional and machine-learning baselines, including the ECMWF HRES forecast and DeepMind's GraphCast.</description>

      <title>Conformal Prediction for Generative Models via Adaptive Cluster-Based Density Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conditional generative models map input variables to complex, high-dimensional distributions, enabling realistic sample generation in a diverse set of domains. A critical challenge with these models is the absence of calibrated uncertainty, which undermines trust in individual outputs for high-stakes applications. To address this issue, we propose a systematic conformal prediction approach tailored to conditional generative models, leveraging density estimation on model-generated samples. We introduce a novel method called CP4Gen, which utilizes clustering-based density estimation to construct prediction sets that are less sensitive to outliers, more interpretable, and of lower structural complexity than existing methods. Extensive experiments on synthetic datasets and real-world applications, including climate emulation tasks, demonstrate that CP4Gen consistently achieves superior performance in terms of prediction set volume and structural simplicity. Our approach offers practitioners a powerful tool for uncertainty estimation associated with conditional generative models, particularly in scenarios demanding rigorous and interpretable prediction sets.</description>

      <title>Rotational Spectroscopy as a Tool to Study Vibration-Rotation Interaction: Investigations of $^{13}$CH$_3$CN and CH$_3$$^{13}$CN up to $v_8 = 2$ and a Search for $v_8 = 2$ Transitions toward Sagittarius B2(N)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Methyl cyanide, CH$_3$CN, is present in diverse regions in space, in particular in the warm parts of star-forming regions where it is a common molecule. Rotational transitions of $^{13}$CH$_3$CN and CH$_3$$^{13}$CN in their $v_8 = 1$ lowest excited vibrational states ($E_{\rm vib} \approx 520$ K) are quite prominent in Sagittarius B2(N). In order to be able to search for transitions of the next higher vibrational state $v_8 = 2$, we recorded spectra of samples enriched in $^{13}$CH$_3$CN and CH$_3$$^{13}$CN up to $v_8 = 2$ in the 35 to 1091~GHz region and reinvestigated existing spectra of CH$_3$CN in its natural isotopic composition between 1085 and 1200 GHz. Perturbations caused by near-degeneracies in $K = 4$ of $v_8 = 2^0$ and $K = 2$ of $v_8 = 2^{-2}$ yielded accurate information on the energy spacing of 22.93 and 21.79 cm$^{-1}$ between the $l$-components of $^{13}$CH$_3$CN and CH$_3$$^{13}$CN, respectively. Fermi-type interaction between $K = 13$ and 14 of $v_8 = 1^{-1}$ and $v_8 = 2^{+2}$ probe the energy differences between the two states of both isotopomers. In addition, a $\Delta K \pm2$, $\Delta l \mp1$ interaction between the ground vibrational state of $^{13}$CH$_3$CN and $v_8 = 1^{+1}$ provides information on their energy spacing. Furthermore, we obtained improved or extended ground state rotational transition frequencies of $^{13}$CH$_3$$^{13}$CN and extensive data for $^{13}$CH$_3$C$^{15}$N and CH$_3$$^{13}$C$^{15}$N. Finally, we report the results of our search for transitions of $^{13}$CH$_3$CN and CH$_3$$^{13}$CN in their $v_8 = 2$ states toward Sagittarius B2(N).</description>

      <title>Instability of the halocline at the North Pole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21378v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we address the issue of stability for the near-inertial Pollard waves, as a model for the halocline in the region of the Arctic Ocean centered around the North Pole, derived in Puntini (2025a). Adopting the short-wavelength instability approach, the stability of such flows reduces to study the stability of a system of ODEs along fluid trajectories, leading to the result that, when the steepness of the near-inertial Pollard waves exceeds a specific threshold, those waves are linearly unstable. The explicit dispersion relation of the model allows to easily compute such threshold, knowing the physical properties of the water column.</description>
