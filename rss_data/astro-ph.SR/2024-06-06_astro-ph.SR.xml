      <title>Progenitor with small reaction networks should not be used as initial conditions for core collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Core collapse initial conditions are a bottleneck in understanding the explosion mechanism(s) of massive stars. Stellar evolution codes struggle after carbon burning, and either stop or adopt numerical simplifications missing crucial physics. The use of small nuclear reaction networks (NRN) that account for energy production but bypass weak reactions is typical, but insufficient to study the dynamics of the collapse. We advise against the use of progenitors computed with small NRN in expensive multi-dimensional simulations of core collapse, bounce, (jet formation), and explosion.</description>

      <title>Using CSST and ejecta-wind interaction in type II-P supernovae to constrain the wind-mass loss of red supergiant stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The properties of H-rich, type II-plateau supernova (SN II-P) progenitors remain uncertain, and this is primarily due to the complexities associated with red supergiant (RSG) wind-mass loss. Recent studies have suggested that the interaction of the ejecta with a standard RSG wind should produce unambiguous signatures in the optical (e.g., a broad, boxy H${\alpha}$ profile) and in the UV (especially Ly ${\alpha}$ and Mg ii ${\lambda}{\lambda}$ 2795, 2802) a few years following the explosion. Such features are expected to be generic in all SNe II-P and can be utilized to constrain RSG winds. Here, we investigate the possibility of detecting late-time (0.3-10 years since explosion) SNe II-P in the NUV with the China Space Station Telescope (CSST). Convolving the existing model spectra of ejecta-wind interactions in SNe II-P with the transmission functions of the CSST, we calculated the associated multiband light curves, in particular, the NUV (255 nm${\sim}$317 nm) band, as well as the $NUV-r$ color. We find that the CSST will be able to detect the NUV radiation associated with ejecta-wind interaction for hundreds SNe II-P out to a few hundred Mpc over its ten-year main sky survey. The CSST will therefore provide a sizable sample of SNe II-P with the NUV signatures of ejecta-wind interaction. This will be helpful for understanding the mass loss history of SN II-P progenitors and their origins.</description>

      <title>The R-Process Alliance: 2MASS J22132050-5137385, the Star with the Highest-known r-process Enhancement at [Eu/Fe] = +2.45</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present stellar parameters and chemical abundances of 47 elements detected in the bright (V = 11.63) very metal-poor ([Fe/H] = -2.20 +- 0.12) star 2MASS J22132050-5137385. We observed this star using the Magellan Inamori Kyocera Echelle spectrograph as part of ongoing work by the R-Process Alliance. The spectrum of 2MASS J22132050-5137385 exhibits unusually strong lines of elements heavier than the iron group, and our analysis reveals that these elements were produced by rapid neutron-capture (r-process) nucleosynthesis. We derive a europium enhancement, [Eu/Fe] = +2.45 +- 0.08, that is higher than any other r-process-enhanced star known at present. This star is only the eighth r-process-enhanced star where both thorium and uranium are detected, and we calculate the age of the r-process material, 13.6 +- 2.6 Gyr, from the radioactive decay of these isotopes. This star contains relatively large enhancements of elements that may be produced as transuranic fission fragments, and we propose a new method using this characteristic to assess the r-process yields and gas dilution in samples of r-process-enhanced stars. We conclude that 2MASS J22132050-5137385 exhibits a high level of r-process enhancement because it formed in an environment where the r-process material was less diluted than average. Assuming a canonical baryonic minihalo mass of 10^6 M_sun and a 1 percent metal retention rate, this star formed in a cloud of only ~ 600 M_sun.</description>

      <title>Warped Disk Evolution in Grid-Based Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations show evidence that a significant fraction of protoplanetary disks contain warps. A warp in a disk evolves in time affecting the appearance of shadows and greatly influencing kinematic signatures. So far, many theoretical studies of warped disks have been conducted using Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) methods. In our approach, we use a grid-based method in spherical coordinates which has notable advantages: the method allows for accurate modelling of low viscosity values and the resolution does not depend on density or mass of the disk, which allows surface structures to be resolved. We perform 3D simulations using FARGO3D to simulate the evolution of a warped disk and compare the results to one-dimensional models using a ring code. Additionally, we extensively investigate the applicability of grid-based methods to misaligned disks and test their dependency on grid resolution as well as disk viscosity. We find that grid-based simulations are capable of simulating disks not aligned to the grid geometry. Our three-dimensional simulation of a warped disk compares well to one-dimensional models in evolution of inclination. However, we find a twist which is not captured in 1D models. After thorough analysis we suspect this to be a physical effect possibly caused by non-linear effects neglected in the one-dimensional equations. Evaluating the internal dynamics, we find sloshing and breathing motions as predicted in local shearing box analysis. They can become supersonic, which may have consequences on kinematic observations of warped disks. Warped disks can be accurately modelled in 3D grid-based simulations when using reasonably good resolution, especially in the $\theta$-direction. We find good agreement with the linear approximation of the sloshing motion which highlights the reliability of 1D models.</description>

      <title>Spectro-Photometry and Radial Distribution of Multiple Stellar Populations in Globular Clusters from Gaia XP Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the formation of multiple populations in globular clusters (GCs) represents a challenge for stellar population studies. Nevertheless, the outermost GC regions, which may retain information of the initial configuration of the multiple populations, are poorly studied. We use synthetic spectra that account for the chemical compositions of first- and second-population (1P, 2P) stars of 47 Tucanae to identify the spectral regions that are sensitive to its multiple populations. Hence, we defined new photometric bands that are efficient to disentangle 1P and 2P giant stars from Gaia XP spectra. To test these new filters, we constructed the pseudo two-color diagrams dubbed chromosome maps (ChMs) and identified for the first time, 1P and 2P stars in the outermost cluster regions of 47 Tucanae and outside the tidal radius. We constructed similar diagrams for NGC3201, NGC6121, NGC6752, and NGC6397, thus exploring GCs with different metallicities. The ChMs allowed us to clearly disentangle 1P and 2P stars in the external regions of all clusters, with the exception of the metal-poor NGC6397. Our findings, together with literature results from more-internal regions, show that the 2P stars of 47 Tucanae and NGC 3201 are more-centrally concentrated than the 1P, whereas the multiple populations of NGC 6121, and NGC 6752 share the same radial distributions. These radial behaviors are consistent with the GC formation scenarios where 2P stars originate in the central regions. Noticeably, results on NGC 3201 are in tension with the conclusion from recent work that its 1P is more centrally concentrated than the 2P and might form with more central concentration.</description>

      <title>High-resolution Observation of Blowout Jets Regulated by Sunspot Rotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coronal jets are believed to be the miniature version of large-scale solar eruptions. In particular, the eruption of a mini-filament inside the base arch is suggested to be the trigger and even driver of blowout jets. Here we propose an alternative triggering mechanism, based on high-resolution H-alpha observations of a blowout jet associated with a mini-filament and an M1.2-class flare. The mini-filament remains largely stationary during the blowout jet, except that it is straddled by flare loops connecting two flare ribbons, indicating that the magnetic arcade embedding the mini-filament has been torn into two parts, with the upper part escaping with the blowout jet. In the wake of the flare, the southern end of the mini-filament fans out like neighboring fibrils, indicative of mass and field exchanges between the mini-filament and the fibrils. The blowout jet is preceded by a standard jet. With H-alpha fibrils moving toward the single-strand spire in a sweeping fashion, the standard jet transitions to the blowout jet. The similar pattern of standard-to-blowout jet transition occurs in an earlier C-class flare before the mini-filament forms. The spiraling morphology and sweeping direction of these fibrils are suggestive of their footpoints being dragged by the leading sunspot that undergoes clockwise rotation for over two days. Soon after the sunspot rotation reaches a peak angular speed as fast as 10 deg/hr, the dormant active region becomes flare-productive, and the mini-filament forms through the interaction of moving magnetic features from the rotating sunspot with satellite spots/pores. Hence, we suggest that the sunspot rotation plays a key role in building up free energy for flares and jets and in triggering blowout jets by inducing sweeping motions of fibrils.</description>

      <title>An Expanded Set of Los Alamos OPLIB Tables in MESA: Type-1 Rosseland-mean Opacities and Solar Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a set of 1194 Type-1 Rosseland-mean opacity tables for four different metallicity mixtures. These new Los Alamos OPLIB atomic radiative opacity tables are an order of magnitude larger in number than any previous opacity table release, and span regimes where previous opacity tables have not existed. For example, the new set of opacity tables expands the metallicity range to $Z$\,=\,10$^{-6}$ to $Z$\,=\,0.2 which allows improved accuracy of opacities at low and high metallicity, increases the table density in the metallicity range $Z$\,=\,10$^{-4}$ to $Z$\,=\,0.1 to enhance the accuracy of opacities drawn from interpolations across neighboring metallicities, and adds entries for hydrogen mass fractions between $X$\,=\,0 and $X$\,=\,0.1 including $X$\,=\,$10^{-2}, 10^{-3}, 10^{-4}, 10^{-5}, 10^{-6}$ that can improve stellar models of hydrogen deficient stars. We implement these new OPLIB radiative opacity tables in \MESA, and find that calibrated solar models agree broadly with previously published helioseismic and solar neutrino results. We find differences between using the new 1194 OPLIB opacity tables and the 126 OPAL opacity tables range from $\approx$\,20--80\% across individual chemical mixtures, up to $\approx$\,8\% and $\approx$\,15\% at the bottom and top of the solar convection zone respectively, and $\approx$\,7\% in the solar core. We also find differences between standard solar models using different opacity table sources that are on par with altering the initial abundance mixture. We conclude that this new, open-access set of OPLIB opacity tables does not solve the solar modeling problem, and suggest the investigation of physical mechanisms other than the atomic radiative opacity.</description>

      <title>CAMEL. II. A 3D Coronal Mass Ejection Catalog Based on Coronal Mass Ejection Automatic Detection with Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are major drivers of geomagnetic storms, which may cause severe space weather effects. Automating the detection, tracking, and three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of CMEs is important for operational predictions of CME arrivals. The COR1 coronagraphs on board the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory spacecraft have facilitated extensive polarization observations, which are very suitable for the establishment of a 3D CME system. We have developed such a 3D system comprising four modules: classification, segmentation, tracking, and 3D reconstructions. We generalize our previously pretrained classification model to classify COR1 coronagraph images. Subsequently, as there are no publicly available CME segmentation data sets, we manually annotate the structural regions of CMEs using Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph C2 observations. Leveraging transformer-based models, we achieve state-of-the-art results in CME segmentation. Furthermore, we improve the tracking algorithm to solve the difficult separation task of multiple CMEs. In the final module, tracking results, combined with the polarization ratio technique are used to develop the first single-view 3D CME catalog without requiring manual mask annotation. Our method provides higher precision in automatic 2D CME catalog and more reliable physical parameters of CMEs, including 3D propagation direction and speed. The aforementioned 3D CME system can be applied to any coronagraph data with the capability of polarization measurements.</description>

      <title>Prominence and coronal rain formation by steady versus stochastic heating and how we can relate it to observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prominences and coronal rain are two forms of coronal condensations for which we still lack satisfactory details on the formation pathways and conditions under which the two come to exist. We compared prominences that formed via a steady versus stochastic type of heating. We performed 2.5D simulations using the open-source MPI-AMRVAC code. To further extend the work and allow for future direct comparison with observations, we used Lightweaver to form spectra of the filament view of our steady case prominence. With that, we analysed a reconnection event that shares certain characteristics with nanojets. We show how different forms of localised heating that induce thermal instability result in prominences with different properties. The steady form of heating results in prominence with a clear vertical structure stretching across the magnetic field lines. On the other hand, stochastic heating produces many threads that predominantly have a horizontal motion along the field lines. In the steady heating case, the prominence is relatively static; however, there is evidence of reconnection happening almost the entire time the prominence is present. In the case of stochastic heating, the threads are highly dynamic, with them also exhibiting a form of transverse oscillation (strongly resembling the decayless type). The fact that the threads in the stochastic heating case are constantly moving along the field lines suppresses any conditions for reconnection. It, therefore, appears that, to first order, the choice of heating prescription defines whether the prominence-internal dynamics are oriented vertically or horizontally. We closely inspected a sample reconnection event and computed the synthetic optically thick radiation using the open-source Lightweaver radiative transfer framework.</description>

      <title>Carbon Isotope Fractionation of Complex Organic Molecules in Star-Forming Cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent high-resolution and sensitivity ALMA observations have unveiled the carbon isotope ratios ($^{12}$C/$^{13}$C) of Complex Organic Molecules (COMs) in a low-mass protostellar source. To understand the $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratios of COMs, we investigated the carbon isotope fractionation of COMs from prestellar cores to protostellar cores with a gas-grain chemical network model. We confirmed that the $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratios of small molecules are bimodal in the prestellar phase: CO and species formed from CO (e.g., CH$_{3}$OH) are slightly enriched in $^{13}$C compared to the local ISM (by $\sim$ 10 $\%$), while those from C and C$^{+}$ are depleted in $^{13}$C owing to isotope exchange reactions. COMs are mainly formed on the grain surface and in the hot gas ($&gt;$ 100 K) in the protostellar phase. The $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratios of COMs depend on which molecules the COMs are formed from. In our base model, some COMs in the hot gas are depleted in $^{13}$C compared to the observations. Thus, We additionally incorporate reactions between gaseous atomic C and H$_{2}$O ice or CO ice on the grain surface to form H$_2$CO ice or \ce{C2O} ice, as suggested by recent laboratory studies. The direct C-atom addition reactions open pathways to form \ce{^13C}-enriched COMs from atomic C and CO ice. We find that these direct C-atom addition reactions mitigate $^{13}$C-depletion of COMs, and the model with the direct C-atom addition reactions better reproduces the observations than our base model. We also discuss the impact of the cosmic ray ionization rate on the $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratio of COMs.</description>

      <title>Modelling the propagation of slow magneto-acoustic waves in a multi-stranded coronal loop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the propagation properties of slow magneto-acoustic waves in a multi-thermal coronal loop using a 3D MHD model, for the first time. A bundle of 33 vertical cylinders, each of 100{\,}km radius, randomly distributed over a circular region of radius 1{\,}Mm is considered to represent the coronal loop. The slow waves are driven by perturbing the vertical velocity ($v_z$) at the base of the loop. We apply forward modelling to the simulation results to generate synthetic images in the coronal channels of SDO/AIA. Furthermore, we add appropriate data noise to enable direct comparison with the real observations. It is found that the synthetic images at the instrument resolution show non-cospatial features in different temperature channels in agreement with previous observations. Time-distance maps are constructed from the synthetic data to study the propagation properties. The results indicate that the oscillations are only visible in specific channels depending on the temperature range of plasma existing within the loop. Additionally, the propagation speed of slow waves is also found to be sensitive to the available temperature range. Overall, we propose that the cross-field thermal properties of coronal structures can be inferred using a combination of numerical simulations and observations of slow magneto-acoustic waves.</description>

      <title>BEBOP V. Homogeneous Stellar Analysis of Potential Circumbinary Planet Hosts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03094v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planets orbiting binary systems are relatively unexplored compared to those around single stars. Detections of circumbinary planets and planetary systems offer a first detailed view into our understanding of circumbinary planet formation and dynamical evolution. The BEBOP (Binaries Escorted by Orbiting Planets) radial velocity survey plays a special role in this adventure as it focuses on eclipsing single-lined binaries with an FGK dwarf primary and M dwarf secondary allowing for the highest-radial velocity precision using the HARPS and SOPHIE spectrographs. We obtained 4512 high-resolution spectra for the 179 targets in the BEBOP survey which we used to derive the stellar atmospheric parameters using both equivalent widths and spectral synthesis. We furthermore derive stellar masses, radii, and ages for all targets. With this work, we present the first homogeneous catalogue of precise stellar parameters for these eclipsing single-lined binaries.</description>

      <title>Strange Dwarfs: a review on the (in)stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: White dwarfs are the remnants of stars not massive enough to become supernovae. This review explores the concept of strange dwarfs, a unique class of white dwarfs which contain cores of strange quark matter. Strange dwarfs have different sizes, masses, and evolutionary paths with respect to white dwarfs. They might form through the accumulation of normal matter on strange quark stars or by capture of strangelets. The stability of strange dwarfs has been debated, with initial studies suggesting stability, while later analyses indicated potential instability. This review revisits these discussions, focusing on the critical role of boundary conditions between nuclear and quark matter in determining stability. It also offers insights into their formation, structure, and possible detection in the universe.</description>

      <title>Photometric segregation of dwarf and giant FGK stars using the SVO Filter Profile Service and photometric tools</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03310v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is focused on the segregation of FGK dwarf and giant stars through narrow-band photometric data using the Spanish Virtual Observatory (SVO) Filter Profile Service and associated photometric tools. We selected spectra from the MILES, STELIB, and ELODIE stellar libraries, and used SVO photometric tools to derive the synthetic photometry in 15 J-PAS narrow filters, which were especially selected to cover spectral features sensitive to gravity changes. Using machine-learning techniques as the Gaussian mixture model and the support vector machine, we defined several criteria based on J-PAS colours to discriminate between dwarf and giant stars. We selected five colour-colour diagrams that presented the most promising separation between both samples. Our results show an overall accuracy in the studied sample of $\sim$0.97 for FGK stars, although a dependence on the luminosity type and the stellar effective temperature was found. We also defined a colour-temperature relation for dwarf stars with effective temperatures between 4\,000 and 7\,000\,K, which allows one to estimate the stellar effective temperature from four J-PAS filters ($J0450$, $J0510$, $J0550$, and $J0620$). Additionally, we extended the study to M-type giant and dwarf stars, achieving a similar accuracy to that for FGK stars.</description>

      <title>The near-infrared degree of polarization in debris disks. Toward a self-consistent approach to model scattered light observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Debris disks give us the unique opportunity to probe the properties of small $\mu$m-sized particles, allowing us to peer into the constituents of their parent bodies, young analogs of comets and asteroids of our solar system. In the past, studies of the total intensity phase function have proven powerful to constrain the main characteristics of the dust particles in debris disks. Nonetheless, there can remain some degeneracies in the modeling that can be alleviated when considering polarized intensity observations. We obtained new near-IR scattered light observations of four young debris disks which allow us to constrain the degree of linear polarization as a function of the scattering angle. All four debris disks are detected in polarized intensity, and three are also recovered in total intensity. We measured peak degree of polarization of $\lesssim 40$\% for all three disks. We find that the particles must consist of highly refractive and absorbing material. For HD129590, by measuring the polarization fraction beyond the birth ring, we constrain the width of the size distribution to be smaller and smaller, compatible with the effect of radiation pressure. We put these findings to the test and present a self-consistent approach to produce synthetic images, assuming different profiles for the radiation pressure strength, and accounting for the presence of unbound grains. We find the contribution of these grains to be especially critical to reproduce the increasing degree of polarization with stellocentric distances. Some of our results might seem difficult to reconcile with our understanding of cosmic dust but since similar results have been obtained for other disks, we discuss the current limitation of available light scattering models as well as possible avenues to alleviate these unfortunate limitations.</description>

      <title>Red eminence: The intermediate-luminosity red transient AT 2022fnm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present results from a five-month-long observing campaign of the unusual transient AT 2022fnm, which displays properties common to both luminous red novae (LRNe) and intermediate-luminosity red transients (ILRTs). Although its photometric evolution is broadly consistent with that of LRNe, no second peak is apparent in its light curve, and its spectral properties are more reminiscent of ILRTs. It has a fairly rapid rise time of 5.3$\pm$1.5 d, reaching a peak absolute magnitude of $-12.7\pm$0.1 (in the ATLAS $o$ band). We find some evidence for circumstellar interaction, and a near-infrared excess becomes apparent at approximately +100 d after discovery. We attribute this to a dust echo. Finally, from an analytical diffusion toy model, we attempted to reproduce the pseudo-bolometric light curve and find that a mass of $\sim$4 M$_\odot$ is needed. Overall, the characteristics of AT 2022fnm are consistent with a weak stellar eruption or an explosion reminiscent of low-energy type IIP supernovae, which is compatible with expectations for ILRTs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first fluorine measurements in 12 normal giants belonging to the Galactic thin and thick disks using spectra obtained with the Phoenix infrared spectrometer on the 2.1m telescope at Kitt Peak. Abundances are determined from the (1-0) R9 2.3358 micron feature of the molecule HF. Additionally, sodium abundances are derived in 25 giants in the thin disk, thick disk, and halo using the Na I line at 2.3379 microns. We report fluorine abundances for thin and thick disk stars in the metallicity range -0.7 &lt; [Fe/H] &lt; 0. We add two abundance measurements for stars with [Fe/H] &lt; 0.5 dex which are at a critical metallicity range to constrain models. We find a larger dispersion in fluorine abundances than sodium abundances despite both species having similar overall uncertainties due to atmospheric parameters, suggesting this dispersion is real and not observational. The dispersion is slightly larger in the thick disk than the thin. The thin and thick disk average [F/Fe] for our sample of stars combined with the literature differ by 0.03 dex. The observations are compared to available chemical evolution models.</description>

      <title>Kinetic simulations of electron-positron induced streaming instability in the context of gamma-ray halos around pulsars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The possibility of slow diffusion regions as the origin for extended TeV emission halos around some pulsars (such as PSR J0633+1746 and PSR B0656+14) challenges the standard scaling of the electron diffusion coefficient in the interstellar medium. Self-generated turbulence by electron-positron pairs streaming out of the pulsar wind nebula was proposed as a possible mechanism to produce the enhanced turbulence required to explain the morphology and brightness of these TeV halos. We perform fully kinetic 1D3V particle-in-cell simulations of this instability, considering the case where streaming electrons and positrons have the same density. This implies purely resonant instability as the beam does not carry any current. We compare the linear phase of the instability with analytical theory and find very reasonable agreement. The non-linear phase of the instability is also studied, which reveals that the intensity of saturated waves is consistent with a momentum exchange criterion between a decelerating beam and growing magnetic waves. With the adopted parameters, the instability-driven wavemodes cover both the Alfv\'enic (fluid) and kinetic scales. The spectrum of the produced waves is non-symmetric, with left-handed circular polarisation waves being strongly damped when entering the ion-cyclotron branch, while right-handed waves are suppressed at smaller wavelength when entering the Whistler branch. The low-wavenumber part of the spectrum remains symmetric when in the Alfv\'enic branch. As a result, positrons behave dynamically differently compared to electrons. We also observed a second harmonic plasma emission in the wave spectrum. An MHD-PIC approach is warranted to probe hotter beams and investigate the Alfv\'en branch physics. This work confirms that the self-confinement scenario develops essentially according to analytical expectations [...](abridged)</description>

      <title>Exploring the Dark Frontier: White Dwarf-Based Constraints on Light Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the vast expanse of our galaxy, white dwarfs (WDs) are natural sentinels, capturing the enigmatic dark matter (DM) particles that incessantly traverse their interiors. These celestial bodies provide a unique vantage point for probing interactions between DM particles and their constituents-nuclei or electrons-should such interactions exist. The captured DM particles may accumulate, undergo mutual annihilation, or be evaporated by the WD's own nuclei or electrons, thereby perturbing the standard cooling sequence predicted by stellar evolution theory. This letter reports pioneering constraints on DM-electron interactions derived from an in-depth analysis of four pulsating WDs. By leveraging the period variation rates of their pulsation modes, we delineate the following constraints: for a form factor $F(q) = 1$, in the DM mass range $20 \mathrm{MeV}/c^{2} \lesssim m_{\chi} \lesssim 80 \mathrm{MeV}/c^{2}$ with a cross-section limit of $\sigma_{\chi,e} \lesssim 10^{-56} \mathrm{cm}^{2}$; for a form factor $F(q) = (\alpha m_{e})^{2}/q^{2}$, in a the DM mass range $20\mathrm{MeV}/c^{2} \lesssim m_{\chi} \lesssim 70 \mathrm{MeV}/c^{2}$ with a limit of $\sigma_{\chi,e} \lesssim 10^{-52} \mathrm{cm}^{2}$. These newly established constraints surpass current direct detection experiments by over fifteen orders of magnitude, forging a path into the uncharted territories of the DM parameter space. This work not only advances our understanding of light dark matter-electron interactions but also exemplifies the potential of WDs as important astrophysical laboratories for probing the elusive nature of DM.</description>

      <title>Novel Atmospheric Dynamics Shape Inner Edge of Habitable Zone Around White Dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: White dwarfs offer a unique opportunity to search nearby stellar systems for signs of life, but the habitable zone around these stars is still poorly understood. Since white dwarfs are compact stars with low luminosity, any planets in their habitable zone should be tidally locked, like planets around M-dwarfs. Unlike planets around M-dwarfs, however, habitable white dwarf planets have to rotate very rapidly, with orbital periods ranging from hours to several days. Here we use the ExoCAM Global Climate Model (GCM) to investigate the inner edge of the habitable zone (HZ) around white dwarfs. Our simulations show habitable planets with ultrashort orbital periods ($P\lesssim$1 day) enter a ``bat rotation" regime, which differs from typical atmospheric circulation regimes around M dwarfs. Bat rotators feature mean equatorial subrotation and a displacement of the surface's hottest regions from the equator towards the midlatitudes. We qualitatively explain the onset of bat rotation using shallow water theory. The resulting circulation shifts increase dayside cloud cover and decrease stratospheric water vapor, expanding the white dwarf habitable zone by $\sim$50\% compared to estimates based on 1D models. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) should be able to quickly characterize bat rotators around nearby white dwarfs thanks to their distinct thermal phase curves. Our work underlines that tidally locked planets on ultrashort orbits may exhibit unique atmospheric dynamics, and guides future habitability studies of white dwarf systems.</description>

      <title>The Heavier the Faster: A Sub-population of Heavy, Rapidly Spinning and Quickly Evolving Binary Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spins of binary black holes (BBHs) measured from gravitational waves carry notable information of the formation pathways. Here we propose a quantity "dimensionless net spin" ($\chi_{\rm N}$), which is related to the sum of angular momentum of component black holes in the system, to provide a novel perspective to study the origin(s) of BBHs. By performing hierarchical Bayesian inference on $\chi_{\rm N}$, we find strong evidence that the marginal distribution of this quantity can be better fitted by two Gaussian components rather than one: there is a narrow peak at $\chi_{\rm N} \sim 0.15$ and another extended peak at $\chi_{\rm N} \sim 0.47$. We also find that the rapidly spinning systems likely dominate the high-mass end of the population and they evolve with redshift much quicker. These findings bring new challenges to the field binary scenario, and suggest that dynamical process should plays a key role in forming high total mass BBHs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Star clusters are among the first celestial objects catalogued by early astronomers. As simple and coeval populations, their study has been instrumental in charting the properties of the Milky Way and providing insight into stellar evolution through the 20th century. Clusters were traditionally spotted as local stellar overdensities in the plane of the sky. In recent decades, for a limited number of nearby clusters, it became possible to identify cluster members through their clustering in proper motion space. With its astrometric data of unprecedented precision, the Gaia mission has completely revolutionised our ability to discover and characterise Milky Way star clusters, to map their large-scale distribution, and to investigate their internal structure. In this review we focus on the population of open clusters, residing in the Galactic disc. We summarise the current state of the Gaia-updated cluster census and studies of young clusters and associations. We discuss recent developments in techniques for cluster detection and age estimation. We also review results enabled by Gaia data concerning the dynamical evolution of gravitationally bound clusters and their stellar inventory.</description>

      <title>Probing the distinct extinction law of the Pillars of Creation in M16 with JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Investigating the extinction law in regions of high dust extinction, such as the Pillars of Creation within the M16 region, is crucial for understanding the densest parts of the interstellar medium (ISM). In this study, we utilize observations from the Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam) and the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) onboard the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to analyze the color-excess ratios $E(F090W-\lambda)/E(F090W-F200W)$ across a wavelength range of $0.9-7.7\,\mu\mathrm{m}$. Our method involves performing linear regression on color-color diagrams to derive these ratios. The enhanced detection capabilities of JWST data allow us to probe the distinct extinction law to the densest regions in M16 corresponding to an extinction depth up to $A_V \sim 60$\,mag. Remarkably, the resultant color-excess ratio curve exhibits a flatter profile than predicted by typical dust extinction models with $R_V = 5.5$ for dense ISM environments. Moreover, we observe that the mid-infrared (MIR) extinction law diverges from the near-infrared (NIR) power-law, showing a tendency for the slope to flatten as the wavelength increases. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of the dust properties in dense interstellar environments.</description>

Abstract: This review highlights the role of the Gaia space mission in transforming white dwarf research. These stellar remnants constitute 5-7% of the local stellar population in volume, yet before Gaia the lack of trigonometric parallaxes hindered their identification. The mission's Data Release 2 in 2018 provided the first unbiased colour-absolute magnitude diagram of the local stellar population, identifying 260,000 white dwarfs, with the number later increasing to over 355,000 in Data Release 3. Since then, more than 400 white dwarf studies have made critical use of Gaia data, establishing it as a fundamental resource for white dwarf identification, fundamental parameter determination and more recently spectral type characterisation. The review underscores the routine reliance on Gaia parallaxes and extensive use of its photometry in white dwarf surveys. We also discuss recent discoveries firmly grounded in Gaia data, including white dwarf mergers, exotic compact binaries and evolved planetary systems.</description>

Abstract: Time-dependent meridional circulation and differential rotation in radiative zones are central open issues in stellar evolution theory. We streamline this challenging problem using the downward control principle of atmospheric science, under a geostrophic f-plane approximation. We recover the known stellar physics result that the steady-state meridional circulation decays on the length scale proportional to N/f sqrt(Pr), assuming molecular viscosity is the dominant drag mechanism. Prior to steady-state, the meridional circulation and the zonal wind (= differential rotation) spread together via radiative diffusion, under thermal wind balance. The corresponding (4th-order) hyperdiffusion process is reasonably well approximated by regular (2nd-order) diffusion on scales of order a pressure scale-height. We derive an inhomogeneous diffusion (equiv. advection-diffusion) equation for the zonal flow which admits closed-form time-dependent solutions in a finite depth domain, allowing for rapid prototyping of differential rotation profiles. In the weak drag limit, we find that the time to rotational steady-state can be longer than the Eddington-Sweet time and be instead determined by the longer drag time. Unless strong enough drag operates, the internal rotation of main-sequence stars may thus never reach steady-state. Streamlined meridional circulation solutions provide leading-order internal rotation profiles for studying the role of fluid/MHD instabilities (or waves) in redistributing angular momentum in the radiative zones of stars. Despite clear geometrical limitations and simplifying assumptions, one might expect our thin-layer geostrophic approach to offer qualitatively useful results to understand deep meridional circulation in stars.</description>

Abstract: Decameter hectometric (DH; 1-14 MHz) type-IV radio bursts are produced by flare-accelerated electrons trapped in post-flare loops or the moving magnetic structures associated with the CMEs. From a space weather perspective, it is important to systematically compile these bursts, explore their spectro-temporal characteristics, and study the associated CMEs. We present a comprehensive catalog of DH type-IV bursts observed by the Radio and Plasma Wave Investigation (WAVES) instruments onboard Wind and STEREO spacecraft, covering the period of white-light CME observations by the Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) onboard the SOHO mission between November 1996 and May 2023. The catalog has 139 bursts, of which 73% are associated with a fast (&gt;900 km/s) and wide (&gt;60$^o$) CME, with a mean CME speed of 1301 km/s. All DH type-IV bursts are white-light CME-associated, with 78% of the events associated with halo CMEs. The CME source latitudes are within $\pm$45$^o$. 77 events had multi-vantage point observations from different spacecraft, letting us explore the impact of line of sight on the dynamic spectra. For 48 of the 77 events, there was good data from at least two spacecraft. We find that, unless occulted by nearby plasma structures, a type-IV burst is best viewed when observed within $\pm$60$^o$ line of sight. Also, the bursts with a duration above 120 min, have source longitudes within $\pm$60$^o$. Our inferences confirm the inherent directivity in the type-IV emission. Additionally, the catalog forms a sun-as-a-star DH type-IV burst database.</description>

Abstract: The Sun's history is still a subject of interest to modern astrophysics. Observationally constrained CME rates of young solar analogues are still lacking, as those require dedicated monitoring. We present medium resolution optical spectroscopic monitoring of a small sample of bright and prominent solar analogues over a period of three years using the 0.5m telescope at observatory Lustb\"uhel Graz (OLG) of the University of Graz, Austria. The aim is the detection of flares and CMEs from those spectra. In more than 1700 hours of spectroscopic monitoring we found signatures of four flares and one filament eruption on EK Dra which has been reported in previous literature, but we complementarily extended the data to cover the latter phase. The other stars did not reveal detectable signatures of activity. For these non-detections we derive upper limits of occurrence rates of very massive CMEs, which are detectable with our observational setup, ranging from 0.1 to 2.2 per day , but these may be even smaller than the given rates considering observational biases. Furthermore, we investigate the detectability of flares/CMEs in OLG spectra by utilizing solar 2D H{\alpha} spectra from MEES solar observatory. We find that solar-sized events are not detectable within our observations. By scaling up the size of the solar event, we show that with a fractional active region area of 18% in residual spectra and 72% in equivalent width time series derived from the same residuals that solar events are detectable if they had hypothetically occurred on HN Peg.</description>

      <title>Neutron Star Atmosphere-Ocean Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.08186v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the structure and dynamics of the plasma atmospheres and Coulomb-liquid oceans on neutron stars. Salient dynamical parameters are identified and their values estimated for the governing set of magnetohydrodynamics equations. Neutron star atmospheres and oceans are strongly stratified and, depending on the rotation period, contain a multitude of long-lived vortices (spots) and/or narrow zonal jets (free-shear zones) in the large plasma-beta regime - i.e., $\beta_p \gg 1$ (hydrodynamic regime). In contrast, when $\beta_p \lesssim 1$ (magnetohydrodynamic regime), the flow is dominated by a global lattice of effectively fixed magnetic islands (plasmoids) - without any jets. Understanding the spatio-temporal variability of dynamic atmospheres and oceans on neutron stars is crucial for interpreting observations of their X-ray emissions.</description>

      <title>The Sun as a target for axion dark matter detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13984v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The exploration of the parameter space of axion and axion-like particle dark matter is a major aim of the future program of astroparticle physics investigations. In this context, we present a possible strategy that focuses on detecting radio emissions arising from the conversion of dark matter axions in the Sun's magnetic field, including conversion in sunspots. We demonstrate that near-future low-frequency radio telescopes, such as the SKA Low, may access regions of unexplored parameter space for masses $m_a\lesssim 10^{-6}$ eV.</description>
