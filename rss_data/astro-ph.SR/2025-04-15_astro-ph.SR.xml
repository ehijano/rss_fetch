      <title>Exploring the connection between atmosphere models and evolution models of very massive stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Very massive stars (VMS) dominate the light of young stellar populations and are sources of intense stellar feedback. Their evolution is mainly driven by strong wind mass loss, yet current evolution models make simplistic assumptions on their atmospheric physics which are incompatible with the nature of VMS. In this work, we aim to understand VMS atmospheres throughout their evolution by supplementing structure models (computed with GENEC) with detailed atmosphere models (computed with PoWR) capable of capturing the physics of a radially-expanding medium in non-LTE. An important aspect is the computation of atmosphere models reaching into deeper layers of the star, notably including the iron-opacity peak as an important source of radiative driving. In this study, we compute atmosphere models at 16 snapshots along the main sequence of a 150 $M_\odot$ star. For each snapshot, we compute two atmosphere models connected to the underlying structure model at different depths (below and above the hot iron bump). We perform a detailed spectroscopic and structural comparison of the two sequences of model atmospheres, and present a generalized method for the correction of the effective temperature in evolution models with strong winds. The choice of connection point between structure and atmosphere models has a severe influence on the predicted spectral appearance, which constitutes a previously unexplored source of uncertainty in quantitative spectroscopy. The simplified atmosphere treatment of current stellar structure codes likely leads to an overestimation of the spatial extension of very massive stars, caused by opacity-induced sub-surface inflation. This inflation does not occur in our deep atmosphere models, resulting in a discrepancy in predicted effective temperatures of up to 20 kK. Future improvements with turbulence and dynamically-consistent models may resolve these discrepancies.</description>

      <title>Evidence of Extreme Ultraviolet Resonant Excitation in the Middle Corona During A Solar Flare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present observations of an eruptive solar flare on 2016 January 6 that occurred behind the solar limb from the perspective of the Earth, but was well observed by STEREO and the Solar Extreme Ultraviolet Monitor on the Mars Atmosphere and {Volatile} EvolutioN (MAVEN) mission. Light curves showing the evolution of the flare's irradiance as a function of time taken by MAVEN are well correlated with the brightness evolution of fan structures observed in the PROBA2 SWAP 174 {\AA} passband, suggesting that the radiance of structures near the flare site was influenced by emission from the flare. Because SWAP did not directly observe the flare itself, this event represents a rare opportunity to study the evolution of emission near a flare without the risk of instrumental scattered light contaminating the observations. We analyze this evolution and implement a simple model to explore the possibility that resonant excitation (or resonant scattering) plays an important role in driving coronal EUV emission during flaring events. Our modeling shows that for a large flare, resonant excitation could increase emission from nearby structures by about 45%, consistent with our findings that the involved structures observed by SWAP increased in brightness by about 60% during the flare. We conclude that resonant excitation may play an important role in driving coronal EUV emission under certain circumstances and should be accounted for in models and emission-based analysis tools.</description>

      <title>LAMOST medium-resolution observations of the Pleiades</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we present the results of our analysis of medium-resolution LAMOST spectra of late-type candidate members of the Pleiades. We have used the code ROTFIT to determine the atmospheric parameters (Teff, logg, and [Fe/H]), radial velocity (RV), and projected rotation velocity (vsini) for 1581 spectra of 283 stars. Moreover, for late-type stars (Teff&lt;6500 K), we also calculated the H$\alpha$ and LiI-6708 net equivalent width by means of the subtraction of inactive photospheric templates. We have also used rotation periods available in the literature and we have determined them for 89 stars by analyzing TESS photometry. The RV distribution of the members peaks at 5.0 km/s with a dispersion of 1.4 km/s, while the average metallicity is [Fe/H]=-0.03$\pm$0.06, in line with previous determinations. Fitting empirical Lithium isochrones, we obtain a reliable age for the Pleiades of 118$\pm$6 Myr, in agreement with the recent literature. The activity indicators H$\alpha$ line flux (Fha) and luminosity ratio (R'ha) show the hottest stars to be the less active ones. The R'ha values display the typical activity-rotation trend with the Rossby number with a steep decay for $R_{\rm O}\geq$0.2 and a nearly flat (saturated) activity level for smaller values. However, we still see a slight dependence on $R_{\rm O}$ in the saturated regime which is well fitted by a power law with a slope of $-0.18\pm0.02$, in agreement with some previous work. For three sources we have found LAMOST spectra acquired during flares showing strong and broad H$\alpha$ profiles and the presence of the HeI-6678 emission line. We identify 39 possible SB1 and ten SB2 systems. We have also shown the potential of the LAMOST-MRS spectra, which allowed us to refine the orbital solution of some binary and to discover a new double-lined binary.</description>

      <title>Magnetic energies (and some other parameters) in solar active regions of different Hale and McIntosh classes: statistical analysis for 2010-2024</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A statistical analysis of magnetic energies of the nonlinear force-free and potential fields, and their difference (a proxy for the free magnetic energy) in active regions (ARs) on the Sun of different Hale (Mount Wilson) and McIntosh classes for the period from May 1, 2010 to June 12, 2024 is presented. The magnetic fields in ARs are calculated using the GX Simulator based on the information about ARs contained in the daily Solar Region Summary (SRS) files provided by the NOAA SWPC and vector magnetograms by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). Total unsigned and signed magnetic fluxes and vertical electric currents on the photosphere are also calculated. For the parameters considered, distributions have been determined in total for all ARs and separately for each Hale and McIntosh class. Minimum, maximum, mean values of the parameters and standard deviations were calculated for each class. The information about the parameters is presented in the form of graphs and tables. The magnetic energies, unsigned magnetic flux, unsigned vertical current, as well as the integral number of sunspots, number of ARs, and area of sunspots, integrated over ARs visible per day on the solar disk, exhibit similar approximately 11.6-year cyclicity. On average, magnetic energies of ARs increase with increasing Hale and McIntosh class, while the average fraction of the free magnetic energy in ARs of different classes differs weakly. We also found that the Poisson Flare Probabilities (PFPs) correlate with the parameters, and the Pearson correlation coefficient is up to 0.89. The results reveal relationships between various parameters of ARs and may be used in developing prediction of space weather effects.</description>

      <title>Discovery of lambda Boo stars in open clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of lambda Boo stars is currently unknown. After several efforts by many authors, no bona fide lambda Boo stars have been confirmed as members of open clusters. Their detection could provide an important test bed for a detailed study of lambda Boo stars. Results. For the first time, we present the surprising finding of two lambda Boo stars as members of open clusters: HD 28548 belongs to the cluster HSC 1640 and HD 36726 belongs to the cluster Theia 139. This was confirmed using a detailed abundance analysis, while the cluster membership was independently analyzed using Gaia DR3 data and radial velocities. We compared the lambda Boo star HD 36726 with other cluster members and showed that the lambda Boo star was originally born with a near-solar composition. This also implies one of the highest chemical differences detected between two cluster members (0.5 dex). In addition, we suggest that the lambda Boo peculiarity strongly depletes heavier metals, but could also slightly modify lighter abundances such as C and O. We also found that both lambda Boo stars belong to the periphery of their respective clusters. This would suggest that lambda Boo stars avoid the strong photoevaporation by UV radiation from massive stars in the central regions of the cluster. We preliminarily suggest that peripheral location appears to be a necessary, though not sufficient, condition for the development of lambda Boo peculiarity. We also obtained a precise age determination for the lambda Boo stars HD 28548 (26.3 Myr) and HD 36726 (33.1 Myr). Conclusions. We have confirmed, for the first time, that two lambda Boo stars belong to open clusters. This remarkable finding could make open clusters excellent laboratories for studying the origin of lambda Boo stars.</description>

      <title>Physical Parameters of Stars in NGC 6397 Using ANN-Based Interpolation and Full Spectrum Fitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar spectral interpolation is critical technique employed by fitting software to derive the physical parameters of stars. This approach is necessary because on-the-go generation of synthetic stellar spectra is not possible due to the complex and high cost of computation. The goal of this study is to develop a spectral interpolator for a synthetic spectral library using artificial neural networks (ANNs). The study aims to test the accuracy of the trained interpolator through self-inversion and, subsequently, to utilize the interpolator to derive the physical parameters of stars in the globular cluster NGC 6397 using spectra obtained from the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) on the Very Large Telescope (VLT). In this study, ANNs were trained to function as spectral interpolators. The ULySS full-spectrum fitting package, integrated with the trained interpolators, was then used to extract the physical parameters of 1587 spectra of 1063 stars in NGC 6397. The trained ANN interpolator achieved precise determination of stellar parameters with a mean difference of 31 K for $T_{\rm eff}$ and 0.01 dex for [Fe/H] compared to previous studies. This study demonstrates the efficacy of ANN-based spectral interpolation in stellar parameter determination, offering faster and more accurate analysis.</description>

      <title>On the causes of brightness variability of the young star BP Tau</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have constructed and analysed the secular light curve of BP Tau, a classical T Tauri-type star. Wave-like variations in the average brightness were detected, with an amplitude of $\Delta B\approx 0.2$ and characteristic time-scales of several decades. We argue that three deep dimming events $(\Delta B \sim 1.5)$, lasting from 1 hour to several days, are caused by the eclipse of a hot (accretion) spot by dust falling onto the star together with gas. Such eclipses, albeit with smaller amplitudes, may explain the absence of a strictly defined periodicity in the brightness variations of BP Tau associated with axial rotation. We also show that within the distance range of 0.1 to 200 AU, BP Tau does not have a companion with a mass exceeding 0.2M$_\odot.$ The causes of brightness and colour index variations on different time-scales are discussed.</description>

      <title>The Low Mass Ratio Overcontact Binary GV Leonis and Its Circumbinary Companion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photometric and spectroscopic observations of GV Leo were performed from 2017 to 2024. The light curves show a flat bottom at the primary eclipse and the conventional O'Connell effect. The echelle spectra reveal that the effective temperature and rotation velocity of the more massive secondary are $T_{\rm eff,2}$ = 5220$\pm$120 K and $v_2 \sin i$ = 223$\pm$40 km s$^{-1}$, respectively. Our binary modeling indicates that the program target is a W-subclass contact binary with a mass ratio of $q$ = 5.48, an inclination angle of $i$ = 81$^\circ$.68, a temperature difference of ($T_{\rm eff,1}-T_{\rm eff,2}$) = 154 K, and a filling factor of $f$ = 36 \%. The light asymmetries were reasonably modeled by a dark starspot on the secondary's photosphere. Including our 26 minimum epochs, 84 times of minimum light were used to investigate the orbital period of the system. We found that the eclipse times of GV Leo have varied by a sinusoid with a period of 14.9 years and a semi-amplitude of 0.0076 days superimposed on a downward parabola. The periodic modulation is interpreted as a light time effect produced by an unseen outer tertiary with a minimum mass of 0.26 M$_\odot$, while the parabolic component is thought to be a combination of mass transfer (secondary to primary) and angular momentum loss driven by magnetic braking. The circumbinary tertiary would have caused the eclipsing pair of GV Leo to evolve into its current short-period contact state by removing angular momentum from the primordial widish binary.</description>

      <title>A Photometric Comparison of B and Be stars using Gaia DR3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous studies have observed significant photometric differences between non-emission B-type and classical Be stars, however the precise mechanism responsible for these differences is unclear. This study combines the Bright Star Catalogue with Tycho and Gaia photometry to create a homogeneous sample of 1015 of the closest and brightest B and Be-type field stars with 90 per cent of objects at distances &lt; 500pc. Due to their proximity, the extinction towards these objects is very low, ensuring we minimise any obfuscation in the reddening correction and final photometry. We present our findings in both Tycho and Gaia photometry through colour magnitude diagrams and present intrinsic colours and absolute magnitudes for each spectral type. We find Be stars are on average ~0.5 magnitudes brighter in both Gaia $G$ and Tycho V$_T$ compared to non-emission B stars of the same spectral type. Additionally, we find tentative evidence that Be stars are redder in Gaia B$_P$$-$R$_P$, particularly for the earlier types, but have similar Tycho B$_T$$-$V$_T$ colours. We test the effects of gravitational darkening due to rapid rotation and binarity on the photometry of our sample and find both to be insufficient to explain the observed photometric differences between B and Be stars. We conclude that the most likely mechanism responsible for the observed photometric differences is the combined effect of the circumstellar disc and stellar evolution up the Main Sequence, with the disc dominating early-types and evolution dominating late type stars.</description>

      <title>The energy content of Alfven waves in the stratified solar atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alfven waves propagating in a vertically stratified plasma, such as those travelling from the solar photosphere to the corona, are partially reflected due to the gradient in the Alfven speed. Wave reflection naturally results in the superposition of upward- and downward-propagating waves. A simple analytic model demonstrates that this superposition leads to the non-equipartition of kinetic and magnetic energies in the Alfven wave perturbations and slows down the net energy transport. A numerical model of Alfven wave propagation in the lower solar atmosphere reveals significant wave reflection below the transition region, leading to highly variable kinetic and magnetic energy content in the lower chromosphere. At higher altitudes, the kinetic energy eventually dominates, depending on the wave frequency. The velocity at which net energy propagates upward is significantly smaller than the local Alfven speed throughout the chromosphere. Consequently, the commonly used expression for unidirectional Alfven waves in a uniform plasma, which relates the energy flux to the kinetic energy density, is not generally applicable in the stratified lower solar atmosphere and cannot be reliably used to estimate the energy content of observed waves. A generalized expression is given, incorporating correction factors that account for wave reflection and energy non-equipartition. The applicability of the expression is discussed.</description>

      <title>Dissimilar magnetically driven accretion on the components of V4046 Sagittarii</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accretion of pre-main sequence stars (PMS) is a key process in stellar formation, governing mass assembly, influencing angular momentum conservation and stellar internal structure, and shaping disc evolution, which serves as the birthplace of exoplanets. Classical T Tauri stars (cTTSs), low-mass PMS stars actively accreting from a disc, hold a well-described magnetospheric accretion model. Their strong, inclined dipole magnetic fields truncate the disc at a few stellar radii, channelling material along magnetic field lines to fall onto the stellar surface near the dipole pole. However, this paradigm assumes the presence of a single star, and a complete description of the accretion process in multiple systems remains to be achieved. Building on our previous work on DQ Tau and AK Sco, we aim to describe the accretion processes in cTTS binaries, accounting for the influence of stellar magnetic fields. Specifically, we sought to explore how the magnetospheric accretion model of cTTSs can be applied to V4046 Sgr, a spectroscopic binary composed of equal-mass and coeval cTTSs in a circular orbit with synchronous rotation, surrounded by a circumbinary disc. We analysed a time series of ESPaDOnS spectra covering several orbital cycles. A variability analysis was performed on the radial velocities and on the Balmer, He I D3, and Ca II emission lines, which are associated with the accretion process. We identified the secondary as the system's main accretor, operating in an unstable regime. Additionally, we detected an accretion funnel flow connecting the dipole pole of the primary star with a nearby bulk of gas. We concluded that the two components exhibit dissimilar accretion patterns. The primary operates in an "ordered chaotic" regime, where accretion funnel flows and accretion tongues coexist. Conversely, the secondary appears to be in a chaotic regime, with accretion tongues dominating.</description>

      <title>The infrared counterpart and proper motion of magnetar SGR0501+4516</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Soft gamma repeaters (SGRs) are highly magnetised neutron stars (magnetars) notable for their gamma-ray and X-ray outbursts. In this paper, we use near-infrared (NIR) imaging of SGR 0501+4516 in the days, weeks, and years after its 2008 outburst to characterise the multi-wavelength emission, and to obtain a proper motion from our long temporal baseline observations. Unlike most magnetars, the source has only moderate foreground extinction with minimal crowding. Our observations began only 2 hours after the first activation of SGR 0501+4516 in August 2008, and continued for 4 years, including two epochs of Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging. The proper motion constraint is improved by a third HST epoch 10 years later. The near-infrared and X-rays faded slowly during the first week, thereafter following a steeper power-law decay. The behaviour is satisfactorily fit by a broken power-law. Three epochs of HST imaging with a 10-year baseline allow us to determine a quiescent level, and to measure a proper motion of 5.4+/-0.6 mas/yr. This corresponds to a low transverse peculiar velocity of 51+/-14 km/s (at 2 kpc). The magnitude and direction of the proper motion rules out supernova remnant HB9 as the birth-site. We can find no other supernova remnants or groups of massive stars within the region traversed by SGR 0501+4516 during its characteristic lifetime (20 kyr). Our observations of SGR 0501+4516 suggest that some magnetars may be either significantly older than expected, that their progenitors produce low supernova ejecta masses, or alternatively that they can be formed through accretion-induced collapse (AIC) or low-mass neutron star mergers. Although the progenitor of SGR 0501+4516 remains unclear, we propose that SGR 0501+4516 is the best Galactic candidate for a magnetar formed through a mechanism other than massive star core-collapse.</description>

      <title>Precise radial velocities of giant stars -- XVII. Distinguishing planets from intrinsically induced radial velocity signals in evolved stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: From a long-term Doppler monitoring campaign of 373 giant stars, we have identified ten giants with periodic radial velocity variations that are challenging to associate with planets. Similar cases in the literature are attributed to poorly understood intrinsic processes. Our goal is to confirm or refute the presence of planets around these ten evolved stars. Additionally, we evaluate the reliability and sensitivity of planet-confirmation metrics when applied to giant stars and present cases of intrinsically induced radial velocity variations, aiming to enhance the physical understanding of the phenomenon. We combined 25 years of radial velocity data from the Hamilton/Lick, SONG, and CARMENES spectrographs. To assess consistency with Keplerian models, we examined the residuals and tracked changes in statistical significance as new data were incorporated. Additionally, we compared radial velocity amplitudes across optical and infrared wavelengths, searched for periodic variations of activity indicators, and examined their correlations with radial velocities. Seven of the ten giants exhibit intrinsically induced radial velocity variations. The strongest arguments against planets orbiting the giants are guided by long-term radial velocity monitoring that detects changing periodicity on long timescales or detects systematics close to the original period in the radial velocity residuals. While activity indicators offer some support, their signals are generally weak. Comparing optical and infrared radial velocity amplitudes also proves insufficient for confirming or refuting planets. We find HIP 64823 remains a promising candidate for hosting a giant exoplanet with orbital period $P\sim$ 7.75 yr. For two stars, the evidence remains inconclusive. Long-term radial velocity monitoring is essential for distinguishing planetary companions from intrinsic variations in evolved stars.</description>

      <title>Numerical simulations of the interaction between the stellar magnetic field and a planet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kepler and TESS observations led to the discovery of many close-in super Earths, including some with ultra-short orbital periods ($\lesssim 1$ day). During and shortly after their multi-Myr formation epoch, their GKM host stars generally have kilogauss magnetic fields which can exert torques on the orbits of nearby super- Earths. In this work, we examine one aspect of this interaction: the magnetic torque resulting from Alfv\'en-wing drag on non-corotating, non-magnetized planets engulfed by the host stars' stellar wind. We compute the magnitude of this torque for a range of stellar magnetic field strengths, and planetary orbital velocities. We also model the planets' orbital evolution, taking into account for stellar spin down and magnetic field decay, and derive the boundaries within which ultra-short-period super-Earths can survive.</description>

      <title>The Milky Way Project MOBStIRS: Parametrizing Infrared Stellar-Wind Bow Shock Morphologies with Citizen Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mass-loss influences stellar evolution, especially for massive stars with strong winds. Stellar wind bow shock nebulae driven by Galactic OB stars can be used to measure mass-loss rates ($\dot{M}$). The standoff distance ($R_{0}$) between the star and the bow shock is set by momentum flux balance between the stellar wind and the surrounding interstellar medium (ISM). We created the Milky Way Project: MOBStIRS (Mass-loss rates for OB Stars driving IR bow Shocks) using the online Zooniverse citizen science platform. We enlisted several hundred students to measure $R_0$ and two other projected shape parameters for 764 cataloged IR bow shocks. MOBStIRS incorporated 1528 JPEG cutout images produced from Spitzer GLIMPSE and MIPSGAL survey data. Measurements were aggregated to compute shape parameters for each bow shock image deemed high-quality by participants. The average statistical uncertainty on $R_0$ is $12.5\%$ but varies from ${&lt;}5\%$ to ${\sim}40\%$ among individual bow shocks, contributing significantly to the total error budget of $\dot{M}$. The derived nebular morphologies agree well with (magneto)hydrodynamic simulations of bow shocks driven by the winds of OB stars moving at $V_a = 10-40~km~s^{-1}$ with respect to the ambient interstellar medium (ISM). A systematic correction to $R_0$ to account for viewing angle appears unnecessary for computing $\dot{M}$. Slightly more than half of MOBStIRS bow shocks are asymmetric, which could indicate anisotropic stellar winds, ISM clumping on sub-pc scales, time-dependent instabilities, and/or misalignments between the local ISM magnetic field and the star-bow shock axis.</description>

      <title>Luminis Stellarum et Machina: Applications of Machine Learning in Light Curve Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of observational capabilities in astronomy has led to an exponential growth in the volume of light curve (LC) data, presenting both opportunities and challenges for time-domain astronomy. Traditional analytical methods often struggle to fully extract the scientific value of these vast datasets, especially as their complexity increases. Machine learning (ML) algorithms have become indispensable tools for analyzing light curves, offering the ability to classify, predict, discover patterns, and detect anomalies. Despite the growing adoption of ML techniques, challenges remain in LC classification, including class imbalance, noisy data, and interpretability of models. These challenges emphasize the importance of conducting a systematic review of ML algorithms specifically tailored for LC analysis. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of the latest ML techniques, summarizing their principles and applications in key astronomical tasks such as exoplanet detection, variable star classification, and supernova identification. It also discusses strategies to address the existing challenges and advance LC analysis in the near future. As astronomical datasets continue to grow, the integration of ML and deep learning (DL) techniques will be essential for unlocking the full scientific potential of LC data in the era of astronomical big data.</description>

      <title>Modeling the Thermal Structure of a Protoplanetary Disk Using Multiband Flux-Limited Diffusion Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work continues the analysis of the model for calculating the thermal structure of an axisymmetric protoplanetary disk, initiated in the paper by Pavlyuchenkov (2024). The model is based on the well-known Flux-Limited Diffusion (FLD) approximation with separate calculation of heating by direct stellar radiation (hereinafter referred to as the FLD$^{\rm s}$ method). In addition to the previously described FLD$^{\rm s}$ model with wavelength-averaged opacities, we present a multiband model mFLD$^{\rm s}$, where the spectrum of thermal radiation is divided into several frequency bands. The model is based on an implicit finite-difference scheme for the equations of thermal radiation diffusion, which reduces to a system of linear algebraic equations written in hypermatrix form. A modified Gauss method for inverting the sparse hypermatrix of the original system of linear equations is proposed. The simulation results described in the article show that the midplane radial temperature profile obtained with the mFLD$^{\rm s}$ method has a variable slope in accordance with the reference Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations. The mFLD$^{\rm s}$ model also qualitatively reproduces the non-isothermality of the temperature distribution along the angular coordinate near the midplane, which is not provided by the FLD$^{\rm s}$ method. However, quantitative differences remain between the reference temperature values and the results of mFLD$^{\rm s}$. These differences are likely due to the diffusive nature of the FLD approximation. It is also shown that the characteristic times for the disk to reach thermal equilibrium within the mFLD$^{\rm s}$ model can be significantly shorter than in FLD$^{\rm s}$. This property should be taken into account when modeling non-stationary processes in protoplanetary disks within FLD-based models.</description>

      <title>TESS photometry of the nova eruption in V606 Vul: asymmetric photosphere and multiple ejections?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.04903v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lightcurves of many classical novae deviate from the canonical "fast rise - smooth decline" pattern and display complex variability behavior. We present the first TESS-space-photometry-based investigation of this phenomenon. We use Sector 41 full-frame images to extract a lightcurve of the slow Galactic nova V606 Vul that erupted nine days prior to the start of the TESS observations. The lightcurve covers the first of two major peaks of V606 Vul that was reached 19 days after the start of the eruption. The nova reached its brightest visual magnitude V=9.9 in its second peak 64 days after the eruption onset, following the completion of Sector 41 observations. To increase the confidence level of the extracted lightcurve, we performed the analysis using four different codes implementing the aperture photometry (Lightkurve, VaST) and image subtraction (TESSreduce, tequila_shots) and find good agreement between them. We performed ground-based photometric and spectroscopic monitoring to complement the TESS data. The TESS lightcurve reveals two features: periodic variations (0.12771 d, 0.01 mag average peak-to-peak amplitude) that disappeared when the source was within 1 mag of peak optical brightness and a series of isolated mini-flares (with peak-to-peak amplitudes of up to 0.5 mag) appearing at seemingly random times. We interpret the periodic variations as the result of azimuthal asymmetry of the photosphere engulfing the nova-hosting binary that was distorted by and rotating with the binary. Whereas we use spectra to associate the two major peaks in the nova lightcurve with distinct episodes of mass ejection, the origin of mini-flares remains elusive.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopy of AT 2016blu's recurring supernova impostor outbursts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13117v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present spectra of the supernova (SN) impostor AT 2016blu spanning over a decade. This transient exhibits quasiperiodic outbursts with a $\sim$113 d period, likely triggered by periastron encounters in an eccentric binary system where the primary star is a luminous blue variable (LBV). The overall spectrum remains fairly consistent during quiescence and eruptions, with subtle changes in line-profile shapes and other details. Some narrow emission features indicate contamination from a nearby H~{\sc ii} region in the host galaxy, NGC 4559. Broader H$\alpha$ profiles exhibit Lorentzian shapes with full width at half-maximum intensity (FWHM) values that vary significantly, showing no correlation with photometric outbursts or the 113 d phase. At some epochs, H$\alpha$ exhibits asymmetric profiles with a stronger redshifted wing, while broad and sometimes multicomponent P Cygni absorption features occasionally appear, but are again uncorrelated with brightness or phase. These P Cygni absorptions have high velocities compared to the FWHM of the H$\alpha$ emission line, perhaps suggesting that the absorption component is not in the LBV's wind, but is instead associated with a companion. The lack of phase dependence in line-profile changes may point to interaction between a companion and a variable or inhomogeneous primary wind, in an orbit with only mild eccentricity. Recent photometric data indicate that AT 2016blu experienced its \nth{21} outburst around 2023 May/June, as predicted based on its period. This type of quasiperiodic LBV remains poorly understood, but its spectra and erratic light curve resemble some pre-SN outbursts like those of SN 2009ip.</description>

      <title>Correlations between the Neutron Star Mass-Radius Relation and the Equation of State of Dense Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14645v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop an analytic method of inverting the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) relations to high accuracy. In principle, a specified $\mathcal{E}\mbox{-}P$ relation gives a unique $M\mbox{-}R$ relation, and vice-versa. Our method is developed from the strong correlations that are shown to exist between the neutron star mass-radius curve and the equation of state (EOS) or pressure-energy density relation. Selecting points that have masses equal to fixed fractions of the maximum mass, we find a semi-universal power-law relation between the central energy densities, pressures, sound speeds, chemical potentials and number densities of those stars, with the maximum mass and the radii of one or more fractional maximum mass points. Root-mean-square fitting accuracies, for EOSs without large first-order phase transitions, are typically 0.5% for all quantities at all mass points. The method also works well, although less accurately, in reconstructing the EOS of hybrid stars with first-order phase transitions. These results permit, in effect, an analytic method of inverting an arbitrary mass-radius curve to yield its underlying EOS. We discuss applications of this inversion technique to the inference of the dense matter EOS from measurements of neutron star masses and radii as a possible alternative to traditional Bayesian approaches.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a Weak CN Spectral Absorption Feature in Red Supergiant Stars in the Andromeda (M31) and Triangulum (M33) Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04291v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using Keck DEIMOS spectra of stars in the Andromeda (M31) and Triangulum (M33) galaxies, selected from the large multi-band (near ultraviolet, visible light, and near infrared) Hubble Space Telescope surveys PHAT and PHATTER, respectively, we have identified a subset of stars that contain a previously unnoticed weak spectral absorption feature around 8000 Angstrom (0.8 micron). This absorption feature appears to be associated with the cyanogen (CN) molecule. Strong CN spectral absorption is a standard feature of carbon stars, which are thought to be intermediate mass (2-3 ~ M_sun) stars with C/O &gt; 1 in the thermally-pulsating asymptotic giant branch phase of stellar evolution. However, the stars that are the focus of this paper are characterized by a weak version of this CN spectral absorption feature in a spectrum that is otherwise dominated by normal O-rich spectral absorption lines such as TiO and/or the Ca near infrared triplet. We have dubbed these stars "weak CN" stars. We present an automated method for identifying weak CN stars in M31 and M33, and examine their photometric properties in relation to model isochrones and stellar tracks. We find that weak CN stars tend to be fairly localized in color-magnitude space, and appear to be red supergiant stars with masses ranging from 5-10 M_sun, overall lifetimes of about 40-50 Myr, and currently in the core He burning phase of stellar evolution.</description>

      <title>DISPATCH methods: an approximate, entropy-based Riemann solver for ideal magnetohydrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.02438v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the advance of supercomputers we can now afford simulations with very large ranges of scales. In astrophysical applications, e.g. simulating Solar, stellar and planetary atmospheres, interstellar medium, etc; physical quantities, like gas pressure, density, temperature, plasma $\beta$, Mach, Reynolds numbers can vary by orders of magnitude. This requires a robust solver, which can deal with a very wide range of conditions and be able to maintain hydrostatic equilibrium where it is applicable. We reformulate a Godunov-type HLLD Riemann solver that it would be suitable to maintain hydrostatic equilibrium in atmospheric applications in a range of Mach numbers, regimes where kinetic and magnetic energies dominate over thermal energy without any ad-hoc corrections. We change the solver to use entropy instead of total energy as the primary thermodynamic variable in the system of MHD equations. The entropy is not conserved, it increases when kinetic and magnetic energy is converted to heat, as it should. We propose using an approximate entropy - based Riemann solver as an alternative to already widely used Riemann solver formulations where it might be beneficial. We conduct a series of standard tests with varying conditions and show that the new formulation for the Godunov type Riemann solver works and is promising.</description>

      <title>Differentiable Modeling of Planet and Substellar Atmosphere: High-Resolution Emission, Transmission, and Reflection Spectroscopy with ExoJAX2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06900v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modeling based on differentiable programming holds great promise for astronomy, enabling advanced techniques such as gradient-based posterior sampling and optimization. This paradigm motivated us to develop ExoJAX (Kawahara et al. 2022), the first auto-differentiable spectrum model of exoplanets and brown dwarfs. ExoJAX directly calculates cross-sections as functions of temperature and pressure to minimize interpolation errors in high-dispersion spectra, although initial work focused on narrowband emission spectroscopy. Here, we introduce a fast, memory-efficient opacity algorithm and differentiable radiative transfer for emission, transmission, and reflection spectroscopy. In the era of data-rich JWST observations, retrieval analyses are often forced to bin high-resolution spectra due to computational bottlenecks. The new algorithm efficiently handles native-resolution data, preserving the full information content and dynamic range. The advances proposed in this paper enable broader applications, demonstrated by retrievals of GL229 B's high-dispersion emission, WASP-39 b's JWST mid-resolution transmission at original resolution (R $\sim$ 2,700), and Jupiter's reflection spectrum. We derive a C/O ratio for GL229 B consistent with its host star, constrain WASP-39 b's radial velocity from molecular line structures, and infer Jupiter's metallicity in line with previous estimates.</description>

Abstract: There is a candidate electromagnetic counterpart to the binary black hole merger GW190521, identified as ZTF19abanrhr within AGN J124942.3 + 344929. Additionally, GW190514 is proposed as a plausible precursor merger to GW190521 within a hierarchical merger scenario. In this study, we investigate the potential association between GW190514 and GW190521 as a hierarchical triple merger associated with ZTF19abanrhr, taking into account of sky position, distance, and mass of the sources using a Bayesian criterion. Our analysis reveals that the association is favored over a random coincidence, with a log Bayes factor of 16.8, corresponding to an odds ratio of $\sim$$199:1$, assuming an astrophysical prior odds of $10^{-5}$. Notably, when accounting for the primary masses of the two gravitational wave events as potential products of mergers in the AGN formation channel, the Bayes factor increases significantly, further enhancing the preference for this association by a factor of $\sim$$10^2$, corresponding to a log Bayes factor of 21.5 and an odds ratio of $\sim$$2\times10^4:1$. Our results suggest strong evidence for the first hierarchical triple merger associated with an electromagnetic counterpart in the AGN formation channel. This work is crucial for understanding the formation mechanisms of massive black holes, the role of AGNs in hierarchical mergers, and the implications of multi-messenger astronomy.</description>

      <title>Dual-band Unified Exploration of Three CMZ Clouds (DUET). Cloud-wide census of continuum sources showing low spectral indices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23700</link>

Abstract: The Milky Way's Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) is measured to form stars 10 times less efficiently than in the Galactic disk, based on emission from high-mass stars. However, the CMZ's low-mass protostellar population, which accounts for most of the initial stellar mass budget and star formation rate (SFR), is poorly constrained observationally due to limited sensitivity and resolution. We present the Dual-band Unified Exploration of Three CMZ Clouds (DUET) survey, targeting the 20 km/s Cloud, Sgr C, and Dust Ridge cloud e using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) at 1.3 and 3 mm. The mosaicked observations achieve a comparable resolution of 0.2-0.3" (~1600-2500 au) and a sky coverage of 8.3-10.4 square arcmin, respectively. We report 563 continuum sources at 1.3 mm and 330 at 3 mm, respectively, and a dual-band catalog with 450 continuum sources. These sources are marginally resolved at the 2,000 au resolution. We find a cloud-wide deviation (&gt;70%) from commonly-used dust modified blackbody (MBB) models, characterized by either low spectral indices or low brightness temperatures. Three possible explanations for the deviation are discussed. (1) Optically thick Class 0/I Young stellar objects (YSOs) with very small beam filling factors can lead to lower brightness temperatures than what MBB models predict. (2) Large (mm/cm-sized) dust grains have more significant self-scattering, and therefore frequency-dependent albedo could cause lower spectral indices. (3) Free-free emission over 30 uJy can severely contaminate dust emission and cause low spectral indices for mJy sources in our sample, although the needed number of massive protostars (embedded UCHII regions) is infeasibly high for the normal stellar initial mass function. A reliable measurement of the SFR at low protostellar masses will require future work to distinguish between these possible explanations.</description>

      <title>ZTF IC 10 variable catalog</title>

Abstract: To study how massive variable stars effect their environment, we search for variability among Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) sources located within the optical extent of a nearby starburst galaxy IC 10. We present the ZTF IC 10 catalog, which classifies 1516 $r$ band sources and 864 $g$ band sources within a $225''$ radius around IC 10 into three categories: 1388 (767) $r$ ($g$) band non-variables, 150 (85) $r$ ($g$) band non-periodic variables, and 37 (12) $r$ ($g$) band periodic variables. Among them 101 (48) $r$ ($g$) band non-periodic variables, and 22 (4) $r$ ($g$) band periodic variables are inside IC 10. We verify our classification by cross-matching with previous variability catalogs and machine learning powered classifications. Various analysis including population demographics, color-magnitude diagrams, and cross matching with a set of different surveys and database such as Gaia, XMM-Newton, Chandra, and SIMBAD are also presented. Based on source density and parallax, we distinguish sources within IC 10 from non-IC 10 sources. For IC 10 sources, we highlight flaring super giants, a source with long secondary period, periodic super giants including possible S Doradus luminous blue variable and candidate Miras. For non-IC 10 sources, we present super red sources and compact objects such as a possible long period subdwarf and a periodic X-ray source. The catalog can serve as a useful database to study the connection between various type of massive stars and their host galaxies.</description>
