      <title>A fast and strong microactuator powered by internal combustion of hydrogen and oxygen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of fast and strong microactuators that can be integrated in microdevices is an essential challenge due to a lack of appropriate driving principles. In this paper, a membrane actuator powered by internal combustion of hydrogen and oxygen in a chamber with a volume of 3.1 nanoliters is demonstrated. The combustion in such a small volume is possible only for an extremely high surface-to-volume (S/V) ratio on the order of 10^7 1/m. The fuel with this S/V is prepared electrochemically in a special regime that produces only nanobubbles. A cloud of nanobubbles merges, forming a microbubble, which explodes, increasing the volume 500 times in 10us. The actuator generates an instantaneous force up to 0.5N and is able to move a body 11,000 times more massive than itself. The natural response time of about 10ms is defined by the incubation time needed to produce an exploding bubble. The device demonstrates reliable cyclic actuation at a frequency of 1Hz restricted by the effect of electrolyte aging. After 40,000 explosions, no significant wear in the chamber is observed. Due to record-breaking acceleration and standard microfabrication techniques, the actuator can be used as a universal engine for various microdevices including micro-electro-mechanical systems, microfluidics, microrobotics, wearable and implantable devices.</description>

      <title>Tunable Degenerate Optical Parametric Oscillation with Coupled Microresonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microresonator-based degenerate optical parametric oscillation (DOPO) has recently been explored as a compelling platform for all-optical computing and quantum information applications, such as truly random number generation and the production of squeezed states of light. Emerging research has highlighted the potential of coupled microresonators, or photonic molecules, as a novel avenue for spectral engineering, unlocking an extra degree of freedom for the optimization of four-wave mixing interactions. Here, we demonstrate DOPO within the coupled modes of a silicon nitride triple-state photonic molecule. Our design introduces a distinctive mechanism for spectral engineering, using microheaters to individually tune the resonance spectral positions, thus enabling dynamic local dispersion control within the coupled modes. We successfully generate a DOPO signal with active efficiency control and explore the optical mode spacing in the tens of gigahertz range to use native phase-locked optical pumps driven by a radio-frequency source.</description>

      <title>Integrated nanophotonic polarizers in silicon waveguides and ring resonators using graphene oxide 2D films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate waveguide and microring resonator (MRR) polarizers by integrating 2D graphene oxide (GO) films onto silicon (Si) photonic devices. The 2D GO films with highly anisotropic light absorption are on-chip integrated with precise control over their thicknesses and sizes. Detailed measurements are performed for the fabricated devices with different GO film thicknesses, coating lengths, and Si waveguide widths. The results show that a maximum polarization-dependent loss (PDL) of ~17 dB is achieved for the hybrid waveguides, and the hybrid MRRs achieved a maximum polarization extinction ratio (PER) of ~10 dB. We also characterize the wavelength- and power-dependent response for these polarizers. The former demonstrates a broad operation bandwidth of over ~100 nm, and the latter verifies performance improvement enabled by photo-thermal changes in GO films. By fitting the experimental results with theoretical simulations, we find that the anisotropy in the loss of GO films dominates the polarization selectivity of these devices. These results highlight the strong potential of 2D GO films for realizing high-performance polarization selective devices in Si photonic platform.</description>

      <title>Self-calibrating Intelligent OCT-SLO System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02703v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A unique sample independent 3D self calibration methodology is tested on a unique optical coherence tomography and multi-spectral scanning laser ophthalmoscope (OCT-SLO) hybrid system. Operators visual cognition is replaced by computer vision using the proposed novel fully automatic AI-driven system design. Sample specific automatic contrast adjustment of the beam is achieved on the pre-instructed region of interest. The AI model deduces infrared, fluorescence, and visual spectrum optical alignment by estimating pre-instructed features quantitatively. The tested approach, however, is flexible enough to utilize any apt AI model. Relative comparison with classical signal-to-noise-driven automation is shown to be 200 percent inferior and 130 percent slower than the AI-driven approach. The best spatial resolution of the system is found to be (a) 2.41 microns in glass bead eye phantom, 0.76 with STD 0.46 microns in the mouse retina in the axial direction, and (b) better than 228 line pair per millimeter (lp per mm) or 2 microns for all three spectrums, i.e., 488 nm, 840 nm, and 520 to 550 nm emission in coronal, frontal or x-y plane. Intelligent automation reduces the possibility of developing cold cataracts (especially in mouse imaging) and patient-associated discomfort due to delay during manual alignment by facilitating easy handling for swift ocular imaging and better accuracy. The automatic novel tabletop compact system provides true functional 3D images in three different spectrums for dynamic sample profiles. This is especially useful for photodynamic imaging treatment.</description>

      <title>A Generalized Dispersion Equation Combining Coupled Modes, Parity-Time Symmetry, and Leaky Waves Describing Non-Decaying Leaky Surface Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A generalized dispersion equation is derived featuring coupled mode theory, parity-time symmetry, and leaky wave antennas of arbitrary periodic modulation. It can be specialized to each of these cases individually or can describe a structure containing all three electromagnetic phenomena simultaneously in a single antenna. This very general dispersion equation is derived using both mode matching and the transverse resonance method, the latter lacking the ability to provide the field descriptions and wave impedances at the cost of computational simplicity. Using the dispersion equation, a sinusoidally modulated reactive sheet (SMRS) supported by an active impedance sheet backed dielectric spacer is designed. The active impedance sheet is designed to compensate the SMRS radiative leakage loss when coupled in close proximity. Due to the coupling, each spatial harmonic generated by the SMRS modulation is characterized by a purely real propagation constant and hence leaky wave radiation is generated from surface waves which do not decay. Due to the non-decaying nature of the surface waves, an input to output surface wave port-to-port |S21| would be unity despite an open far field channel being generated. The non-decaying leaky surface wave antenna is compared to the traditional PEC backed SMRS. The non-decaying leaky surface waves give rise to perfect aperture efficiency and the associated radiation pattern making it far superior to the traditional PEC backed SMRS case. Full-wave simulations corroborate the results. These types of antennas can make sensors probed from the far field where changes in S21 amplitude directly correlate to local changes in the waveguiding environment.</description>

      <title>Ultrahigh-speed thin-film lithium niobate optical coherent receiver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of the thin-film lithium niobate platform has established it as a premier choice for high-performance photonics integration. High-speed optical coherent receivers are essential for supporting the large communication capacities required by data center interconnects. Although high-speed photodiodes have been demonstrated on the thin-film LiNbO3 platform, the development of an ultrahigh-speed optical coherent receiver on this platform has not yet been realized. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate an ultra-wideband PD and ultrahigh-speed optical coherent receiver on an InP-LiNbO3 wafer-level heterogeneous integration platform. The fabricated single PD exhibits a record-high bandwidth of 140 GHz and successfully receives a high-quality 100-Gbaud pulse amplitude modulation (PAM4) signal. Furthermore, a thin-film LiNbO3 optical coherent receiver, featuring a large balanced detection bandwidth of 60 GHz, a large common mode rejection ratio (CMRR) exceeding 20 dB, and a low energy consumption of 9.6 fJ per bit, enables an ultrahigh-speed coherent reception with advanced modulation formats. The single-polarization I-Q coherent receiver, incorporating a compact 2x4 90 optical hybrid and a balanced photodetector array, achieves a receiving capacity of 600 Gbps per channel with 100-Gbaud 64 quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) signal and 512 Gbps per channel with 128-Gbaud 16 QAM signal. Additionally, we demonstrate a long-distance reception of 100 Gbaud quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK) and 16 QAM signals over transmission distances of 1040 km and 25 km. A seven-channel single-polarization I-Q coherent receiving chip achieves a total receiving capacity of 3.584 Tbps. This heterogeneous-integrated thin-film LiNbO3 optical coherent receiver shows the potential for Pbps-scale applications in future hyperscale data center interconnects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The uncrewed aerial systems industry is rapidly expanding due to advancements in smaller electronics, smarter sensors, advanced flight controllers, and embedded perception modules leveraging artificial intelligence. These technological progress have opened new indoor applications for UAS, including warehouse inventory management, security inspections of public spaces and facilities, and underground exploration. Despite the innovative designs from UAS manufacturers, there are no existing standards to ensure UAS and human safety in these environments. This study explores developing and evaluating micro-lattice structures for impact resistance in lightweight UAS. We examine patch designs using Face-Centered Cubic (FCC), Diamond (D), Kelvin (K), and Gyroid (GY) patterns and detail the processes for creating samples for impact and compression tests, including manufacturing and testing protocols.
  Our evaluation includes compression and impact tests to assess structural behavior, revealing the influence of geometry, compactness, and material properties. Diamond and Kelvin patterns were particularly effective in load distribution and energy absorption over the compression tests. Impact tests demonstrated significant differences in response between flexible and rigid materials, with flexible patches exhibiting superior energy dissipation and structural integrity under dynamic loading.
  The study provides a detailed analysis of specific energy absorption (SEA) and efficiency, offering insights into optimal micro-lattice structure designs for impact resistance in lightweight UAS applications.</description>

      <title>Direct measurement of topological invariants through temporal adiabatic evolution of bulk states in the synthetic Brillouin zone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mathematically, topological invariants arise from the parallel transport of eigenstates on the energy bands, which, in physics, correspond to the adiabatic dynamical evolution of transient states. It determines the presence of boundary states, while lacking direct measurements. Here, we develop time-varying programmable coupling circuits between acoustic cavities to mimic the Hamiltonians in the Brillouin zone, with which excitation and adiabatic evolution of bulk states are realized in a unit cell. By extracting the Berry phases of the bulk band, topological invariants, including the Zak phase for the SSH model and the Chern number for the AAH model, are obtained convincingly. The bulk state evolution also provides insight into the topological charges of our newly developed non-Abelian models, which are also verified by observing the adiabatic eigenframe rotation. Our work not only provides a general recipe for telling various topological invariants but also sheds light on transient acoustic wave manipulations.</description>

      <title>Phase field simulations of thermal annealing for all-small molecule organic solar cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interest in organic solar cells (OSCs) is constantly rising in the field of photovoltaic devices. The device performance relies on the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) nanomorphology, which develops during the drying process and additional post-treatment. This work studies the effect of thermal annealing (TA) on an all-small molecule DRCN5T: PC71 BM blend with phase field simulations. The objective is to determine the physical phenomena driving the evolution of the BHJ morphology for a better understanding of the posttreatment/morphology relationship. Phase-field simulation results are used to investigate the impact on the final BHJ morphology of the DRCN5T crystallization-related mechanisms, including nucleation, growth, crystal stability, impingement, grain coarsening, and Ostwald ripening, of the amorphous-amorphous phase separation (AAPS), and of diffusion limitations. The comparison of simulation results with experimental data shows that the morphological evolution of the BHJ under TA is dominated by dissolution of the smallest, unstable DRCN5T crystals and anisotropic growth of the largest crystals.</description>

      <title>Ultra-thin strain-relieving Si$_{1-x}$Ge$_x$ layers enabling III-V epitaxy on Si</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The explosion of artificial intelligence, possible end of Moore's law, dawn of quantum computing and continued exponential growth of data communications traffic have brought new urgency to the need for laser integration on the diversified Si platform. While diode lasers on III-V platforms have long powered internet data communications and other optoelectronic technologies, direct integration with Si remains problematic. A paradigm-shifting solution requires exploring new and unconventional materials and integration approaches. In this work, we show that a sub-10-nm ultra-thin Si$_{1-x}$Ge$_x$ buffer layer fabricated by an oxidative solid-phase epitaxy process can facilitate extraordinarily efficient strain relaxation. The Si$_{1-x}$Ge$_x$ layer is formed by ion implanting Ge into Si(111) and selectively oxidizing Si atoms in the resulting ion-damaged layer, precipitating a fully strain-relaxed Ge-rich layer between the Si substrate and surface oxide. The efficient strain relaxation results from the high oxidation temperature, producing a periodic network of dislocations at the substrate interface, coinciding with modulations of the Ge content in the Si$_{1-x}$Ge$_x$ layer and indicating the presence of defect-mediated diffusion of Si through the layer. The epitaxial growth of high-quality GaAs is demonstrated on this ultra-thin Si$_{1-x}$Ge$_x$ layer, demonstrating a promising new pathway for integrating III-V lasers directly on the Si platform.</description>

      <title>Sub-100-fs formation of dark excitons in monolayer WS2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08390v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are promising for optoelectronic applications due to their strongly bound excitons. While bright excitons have been thoroughly scrutinized, dark excitons are much less investigated as they are not observable with far-field spectroscopy. However, with their non-zero momenta, dark excitons are significant for applications requiring long-range transport or coupling to external fields. We access such dark excitons in WS2 monolayer using transient photoemission electron microscopy with sub-diffraction limited spatial resolution (75 nm) and exceptionally high temporal resolution (13 fs). Image time series of TMD flakes are recorded at several different fluences. We directly observe the ultrafast formation of dark K-Q excitons in monolayer WS2 occurring within 14-50 fs and follow their subsequent picosecond decay. We distinguish exciton dynamics between the interior and edges of the monolayer TMD and conclude that the long-term evolution of dark excitations is defect-mediated while intervalley scattering is not affected.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15606v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Control over the amplitude, phase, and spatial distribution of visible-spectrum light underlies many technologies, but commercial solutions remain bulky, require high control power, and are often too slow. Active integrated photonics for visible light promises a solution, especially with recent materials and fabrication advances. In this review, we discuss three growing application spaces which rely on control of visible light: control and measurement of atomic quantum technologies, augmented-reality displays, and measurement and control of biological systems. We then review the commercial dynamic surfaces and bulk systems which currently provide visible-light modulation and the current state-of-the-art integrated solutions. Throughout the review we focus on speed, control power, size, optical bandwidth, and technological maturity when comparing technologies.</description>
