      <title>System and sub-system energy resilience during public safety power shutoffs (PSPS) in California -- An evidence-based argument</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines historical relationships between Public Safety Power Shutoffs (PSPS) events enacted by California's investor-owned utilities (IOUs), at the system and sub-system levels, along with other disruptions to macro electricity systems. This study contributes to understanding the balance between system-wide resilience goals, such as wildfire hazard mitigation, and sub-system-level priorities, such as minimizing the frequency and duration of localized disruptions. Focusing on circuit-level data from 2018 to 2023 as a proxy for sub-systems, we evaluate differences in outage frequency, duration, and customer impact across three major IOUs in California. Results highlight a differentiation between 'higher impact' de-energization events, which have occurred less frequently, and circuits impacted frequently but with lower customer or duration impacts. Study outcomes suggest that resilience, from the perspective of PSPS events, may be more temporal, which in this case is driven by infrastructure and planning investments by IOUs. Future work aims to incorporate socio-demographic factors, including urban-rural divide, to identify further opportunities to enhance resilience at the circuit and sub-circuit levels.</description>

      <title>A bibliometric analysis and scoping study to identify English-language perspectives on slums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Slums, informal settlements, and deprived areas are urban regions characterized by poverty. According to the United Nations, over one billion people reside in these areas, and this number is projected to increase. Additionally, these settlements are integral components of urban systems. We conducted a bibliometrical analysis and scoping study using the Web of Science Database to explore various perspectives on urban poverty, searching for scientific publications on the topic and providing details on the countries where the studies were conducted. Based on 3947 publications, we identify the extent to which domestic research organizations participate in studying urban poverty and which categories of science they investigate, including life sciences \&amp; biomedicine, social sciences, technology, physical sciences, and arts &amp; humanities. Thereby, we find that research on slums is often limited to specific countries, e.g. India, South Africa, Kenya, or Brazil. This focus is not necessarily correlated with the number of people living in slums. The scientific discourse is up to now predominantly shaped by medical and social sciences with few studies addressing technological questions. Finally, our analysis identifies several possible future directions for research on slums.</description>

      <title>Peace Dividends: The Economic Effects of Colombia's Peace Agreement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.01843v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The last decades have seen a resurgence of armed conflict globally, renewing the need for durable peace agreements. In this paper, I evaluate the economic effects of the peace agreement between the Colombian government and the largest guerrilla group in the country, the FARC, ending one of the lengthiest and most violent armed conflicts in recent history. Using a difference-in-difference strategy comparing municipalities that historically had FARC presence and those with presence of a similar, smaller guerrilla group, the ELN, before and after the start of a unilateral ceasefire by the FARC, I establish three sets of results. First, violence indicators significantly and sizeably decreased in historically FARC municipalities. Second, despite this substantial reduction in violence, I find precisely-estimated null effects across several economic indicators, suggesting no effect of the peace agreement on economic activity. In addition, I use a sharp discontinuity in eligibility to the government's flagship firm and job creation program for conflict-affected areas to evaluate the policy's impact, also finding precisely-estimated null effects on the same economic indicators. Third, I present evidence that suggests the reason why historically FARC municipalities could not reap the economic benefits from the reduction in violence is a lack of state capacity, caused both by their low initial levels of state capacity and the lack of state entry post-ceasefire. These results indicate that peace agreements require complementary investments in state capacity to yield an economic dividend.</description>

      <title>Beyond Citations: Measuring Novel Scientific Ideas and their Impact in Publication Text</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16437v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: New scientific ideas drive progress, yet measuring scientific novelty remains challenging. We use natural language processing to detect the origin and impact of new ideas in scientific publications. To validate our methods, we analyze Nobel Prize-winning papers, which likely pioneered impactful new ideas, and literature review papers, which typically consolidate existing knowledge. We also show that novel papers have more intellectual neighbors published after them, indicating they are ahead of their intellectual peers. Finally, papers introducing new ideas, particularly those with greater follow-on reuse, attract more citations.</description>

      <title>A Novel {\delta}-SBM-OPA Approach for Policy-Driven Analysis of Carbon Emission Efficiency under Uncertainty in the Chinese Industrial Sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11600v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Regional differences in carbon emission efficiency arise from disparities in resource distribution, industrial structure, and development level, which are often influenced by government policy preferences. However, currently, most studies fail to consider the impact of government policy preferences and data uncertainty on carbon emission efficiency. To address the above limitations, this study proposes a hybrid model based on $\delta$-slack-based model ($\delta$-SBM) and ordinal priority approach (OPA) for measuring carbon emission efficiency driven by government policy preferences under data uncertainty. The proposed $\delta$-SBM-OPA model incorporates constraints on the importance of input and output variables under different policy preference scenarios. It then develops the efficiency optimization model with Farrell frontiers and efficiency tapes to deal with the data uncertainty in input and output variables. This study demonstrates the proposed model by analyzing industrial carbon emission efficiency of Chinese provinces in 2021. It examines the carbon emission efficiency and corresponding clustering results of provinces under three types of policies: economic priority, environmental priority, and technological priority, with varying priority preferences. The results indicate that the carbon emission efficiency of the 30 provinces can mainly be categorized into technology-driven, development-balanced, and transition-potential types, with most provinces achieving optimal efficiency under the technology-dominant preferences across all policy scenarios. Ultimately, this study suggests a tailored roadmap and crucial initiatives for different provinces to progressively and systematically work towards achieving the low carbon goal.</description>

      <title>The economic value of empowering older patients transitioning from hospital to home: Evidence from the 'Your Care Needs You' intervention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04339v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hospital-to-home transitions are a critical component of effective healthcare delivery, especially for patients aged 75 and older. This study evaluates the cost-effectiveness of the 'Your Care Needs You' (YCNY) intervention, a patient-centred approach designed to empower older adults during discharge, compared to standard care. The analysis adopts the perspective of the National Health Service (NHS) and Personal Social Services. Data were drawn from a cluster randomised controlled trial (cRCT) conducted within the UK NHS over a 90-day post-discharge follow-up period. Adjusted differences in costs and Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) were estimated using Multilevel Mixed-Effects Generalised Linear Models (MME-GLM) to account for the hierarchical structure of the trial design. Alternatively, Seemingly Unrelated Regression (SUR) models were employed to address potential correlations between costs and QALYs. Scenario analyses and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the robustness of the results. The YCNY intervention reduced costs by {\pounds}269 and achieved a QALY gain of 0.0057, resulting in a net health benefit (NHB) of 0.0246 at a {\pounds}15,000/QALY threshold. It demonstrated an 89% probability of cost-effectiveness compared to standard care within the trial's time horizon. Findings remained robust across alternative scenarios and sensitivity analyses. These results suggest that YCNY is a promising and potentially cost-effective strategy for improving hospital-to-home transitions for older adults. By enhancing outcomes and reducing costs, the study supports integrating patient-centred interventions like YCNY into routine NHS practice, with the potential to improve both efficiency and quality of healthcare delivery.</description>
