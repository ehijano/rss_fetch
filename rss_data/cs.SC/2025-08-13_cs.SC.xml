      <title>Solving unification in the description logic $\mathcal{FL}_\bot$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00912v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an algorithm for solving the unification problem in the description logic $\mathcal{FL}_\bot$. This logic extends $\mathcal{FL}_0$ with the bottom constructor, and thus supports conjunction, value restrictions, top and bottom constructors. Unification of concepts can be a useful tool for ontology maintenance; however, little is known about unification even in small, restricted description logics. The unification problem has been solved only for $\mathcal{FL}_0$ and $\mathcal{EL}$. This paper contributes to the ongoing effort to extend these results to richer logics. Our algorithm runs in exponential time with respect to the size of the problem.</description>

      <title>Artificial Intelligence Software Structured to Simulate Human Working Memory, Mental Imagery, and Mental Continuity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.05138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.05138v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article presents an artificial intelligence (AI) architecture intended to simulate the iterative updating of the human working memory system. It features several interconnected neural networks designed to emulate the specialized modules of the cerebral cortex. These are structured hierarchically and integrated into a global workspace. They are capable of temporarily maintaining high-level representational patterns akin to the psychological items maintained in working memory. This maintenance is made possible by persistent neural activity in the form of two modalities: sustained neural firing (resulting in a focus of attention) and synaptic potentiation (resulting in a short-term store). Representations held in persistent activity are recursively replaced resulting in incremental changes to the content of the working memory system. As this content gradually evolves, successive processing states overlap and are continuous with one another. The present article will explore how this architecture can lead to iterative shift in the distribution of coactive representations, ultimately leading to mental continuity between processing states, and thus to human-like thought and cognition. Like the human brain, this AI working memory store will be linked to multiple imagery (topographic map) generation systems corresponding to various sensory modalities. As working memory is iteratively updated, the maps created in response will construct sequences of related mental imagery. Thus, neural networks emulating the prefrontal cortex and its reciprocal interactions with early sensory and motor cortex capture the imagery guidance functions of the human brain. This sensory and motor imagery creation, coupled with an iteratively updated working memory store may provide an AI system with the cognitive assets needed to achieve synthetic consciousness or artificial sentience.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Active Goal Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21846v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In multi-agent environments, effective interaction hinges on understanding the beliefs and intentions of other agents. While prior work on goal recognition has largely treated the observer as a passive reasoner, Active Goal Recognition (AGR) focuses on strategically gathering information to reduce uncertainty. We adopt a probabilistic framework for Active Goal Recognition and propose an integrated solution that combines a joint belief update mechanism with a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm, allowing the observer to plan efficiently and infer the actor's hidden goal without requiring domain-specific knowledge. Through comprehensive empirical evaluation in a grid-based domain, we show that our joint belief update significantly outperforms passive goal recognition, and that our domain-independent MCTS performs comparably to our strong domain-specific greedy baseline. These results establish our solution as a practical and robust framework for goal inference, advancing the field toward more interactive and adaptive multi-agent systems.</description>
