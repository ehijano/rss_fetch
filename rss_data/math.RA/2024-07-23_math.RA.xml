      <title>Homologically smooth connected cochain DGAs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathscr{A}$ be a connected cochain DG algebra such that $H(\mathscr{A})$ is a Noetherian graded algebra. We give some criteria for $\mathscr{A}$ to be homologically smooth in terms of the singularity category, the cone length of the canonical module $k$ and the global dimension of $\mathscr{A}$. For any cohomologically finite DG $\mathscr{A}$-module $M$, we show that it is compact when $\mathscr{A}$ is homologically smooth. If $\mathscr{A}$ is in addition Gorenstein, we get $$\mathrm{CMreg}M = \mathrm{depth}_{\mathscr{A}}\mathscr{A} + \mathrm{Ext.reg}\, M&lt;\infty,$$ where $\mathrm{CMreg}M$ is the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of $M$, $\mathrm{depth}_{\mathscr{A}}\mathscr{A}$ is the depth of $\mathscr{A}$ and $ \mathrm{Ext.reg}\, M$ is the Ext-regularity of $M$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathscr{A}$ be a homologically smooth connected cochain DG algebra. We give some criteria for $\mathscr{A}$ to be Gorenstein and Calabi-Yau, respectively. It is proved that $\mathscr{A}$ is Gorenstein if and only if its $\mathrm{Ext}$-algebra $H(R{\rm Hom}_{\mathscr{A}}(\mathbb{k},\mathbb{k}))$ is a graded Frobenius algebra, and $\mathscr{A}$ is furthermore Calabi-Yau if and only if the Frobenius graded $\mathrm{Ext}$-algebra is symmetric. These results generalize respectively the corresponding results in [HW1] and [HM], where the connected cochain DG algebras studied are Koszul.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lie algebras formed via semi-direct sums of the Witt algebra $\text{Der}(\mathbb{C}[t,t^{-1}])$ and its modules have become increasingly prominent in both physics and mathematics in recent years. In this paper, we complete the study of (Leibniz) central extensions, derivations and automorphisms of the Lie algebras formed from the semi-direct sum of the Witt algebra and its indecomposable intermediate series modules (that is, graded modules with one-dimensional graded components). Our techniques exploit the internal grading of the Witt algebra, which can be applied to a wider class of graded Lie algebras.</description>

      <title>Symplectic Leibniz algebras as a non-commutative version of symplectic Lie algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce symplectic left Leibniz algebras and symplectic right Leibniz algebras as generalizations of symplectic Lie algebras. These algebras possess a left symmetric product and are Lie-admissible. We describe completely symmetric Leibniz algebras that are symplectic as both left and right Leibniz algebras. Additionally, we show that symplectic left or right Leibniz algebras can be constructed from a symplectic Lie algebra and a vector space through a method that combines the double extension process and the $T^*$-extension. This approach allows us to generate a broad class of examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the previous paper, we constructed two kinds of edge contractions for the affine super Yangian. In this article, we show that these two edge contractions are commutative with each other. As an application, we give a homomorphism from the affine super Yangian to some centralizer algebras of the universal enveloping algebra of $W$-algebras of type $A$.</description>

      <title>Hopf algebras and associative representations of two-dimensional evolution algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a connection between evolution algebras of dimension two and Hopf algebras, via the algebraic group of automorphisms of an evolution algebra.
  Initially, we describe the Hopf algebra associated with the automorphism group of a 2-dimensional evolution algebra. Subsequently, for a 2-dimensional evolution algebra $A$ over a field $K$, we detail the relation between the algebra associated with the (tight) universal associative and commutative representation of $A$, referred to as the (tight) $p$-algebra, and the corresponding Hopf algebra, $\mathcal{H}$, representing the affine group scheme $\text{Aut}(A)$.
  Our analysis involves the computation of the (tight) $p-$algebra associated with any 2-dimensional evolution algebra, whenever it exists. We find that $\text{Aut}(A)=1$ if and only if there is no faithful associative and commutative representation for $A$. Moreover, there is a faithful associative and commutative representation for $A$ if and only if $\mathcal{H}\not\cong K$ and $\text{char} (K)\neq 2$, or $\mathcal{H}\not\cong K(\epsilon)$ (the dual numbers algebra) and $\mathcal{H}\not\cong K$ in case of $\text{char} (K)= 2$. Furthermore, if $A$ is perfect and has a faithful tight $p$-algebra, then this $p$-algebra is isomorphic to $\mathcal{H}$ (as algebras). Finally, we derive implications for arbitrary finite-dimensional evolution algebras.</description>

      <title>Poisson bundles over unordered configurations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we construct a Poisson algebra bundle whose distributional sections are suitable to represent multilocal observables in classical field theory. To do this, we work with vector bundles over the unordered configuration space of a manifold $M$ and consider the structure of a $2$-monoidal category given by the usual (Hadamard) tensor product of bundles and a new (Cauchy) tensor product which provides a symmetrized version of the usual external tensor product of vector bundles on $M$. We use the symmetric algebras with respect to both products to obtain a Poisson 2-algebra bundle mimicking the construction of Peierls bracket from the causal propagator in field theory. The explicit description of observables from this Poisson algebra bundle will be carried out in a forthcoming paper.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we study prime and maximal ideals in a Hurwitz polynomial ring hR. It is well-known that to study many questions we may assume R is prime and consider just R-disjoint ideals. We give a characterization for an R-disjoint ideal to be prime. We study conditions under which there exists an R-disjoint ideal which is a maximal ideal and when this is the case how to determine all such maximal ideals. maximal ideal to be generated by polynomials of minimal degree.</description>

      <title>Novel non-involutive solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation from (skew) braces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2204.11580v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We produce novel non-involutive solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation coming from (skew) braces. These solutions are generalisations of the known ones coming from braces and skew braces, and surprisingly in the case of braces they are not necessarily involutive. In the case of two-sided (skew) braces one can assign such solutions to every element of the set. Novel bijective maps associated to the inverse solutions are also introduced. Moreover, we show that the recently derived Drinfeld twists of the involutive case are still admissible in the non-involutive frame and we identify the twisted $r$-matrices and twisted coproducts. We observe, as in the involutive case that the underlying quantum algebra is not a quasi-triangular bialgebra, as one would expect, but a quasi-triangular quasi-bialgebra. The same applies to the quantum algebra of the twisted $r$-matrices, contrary to the involutive case.</description>

      <title>From length-preserving pushouts of graphs to one-surjective pullbacks of graph algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.14470v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The unions of directed graphs are the simplest examples of pushouts of directed graphs. The conditions under which they contravariantly induce surjective gauge-equivariant pullbacks of graph C*-algebras have been well studied and vastly instantiated in noncommutative topology (e.g., quantum balls and spheres). Herein, we go beyond the unions of graphs to systematically determine optimal conditions for more general length-preserving pushouts of graphs under which they contravariantly induce graded pullbacks of path algebras, Leavitt path algebras, and graph C*-algebras. Our pullbacks are surjective only on one side, as dictated by natural examples and K-theory. The proposed new approach enlarges the scope of applications from admissible subgraphs (also called quotient graphs) to generalizations of unlabeled foldings of Stallings and collapsing the line graphs of graphs to initial graphs. Moreover, we introduce the concept of locally derived graphs, which substantially extends the paradigm of derived graphs (or skew products of graphs), and use the projection foldings from locally derived graphs to their base (or voltage) graphs to obtain one-surjective pullbacks of graph C*-algebras.</description>

      <title>The rack congruence condition and half congruences in racks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.11852v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Racks and quandles are algebraic structures with a single binary operation that is right self-distributive and right invertible, and additionally idempotent in the case of quandles. The invertibility condition is equivalent to the existence of a second binary operation that acts as a right inverse to the first, so that racks and quandles may also be viewed as algebraic structures with a pair of (dependent) binary operations.
  When forming a quotient rack or quandle it is necessary to take this two-operation view, and define a congruence as an equivalence relation on the rack or quandle that respects both operations. However, in defining a congruence some authors have omitted the condition on the inverse operation, and defined a congruence as an equivalence relation respecting the primary operation only. We show that while respecting the primary operation is sufficient in the case of finite racks and quandles, it is not in general sufficient in the infinite case. We do this by constructing explicit examples of "half congruences": equivalence relations that respect exactly one of the two operations.
  Our work also allows us to completely characterise congruences in connected Alexander quandles.</description>

      <title>Differential graded orders, their class groups and id\`eles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06340v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a Dedekind domain $R$ with field of fractions $K$ a classical $R$-order in a semisimple $K$-algebra $A$ is an $R$-projective $R$-subalgebra $\Lambda$ of $A$ such that $K\Lambda=A$. We study differential graded $K$-algebras which are semisimple as $K$-algebras and define differential graded $R$-orders as a differential graded $R$-subalgebras, which are in addition classical $R$-orders in $A$. We give a series of examples for such differential graded algebras and orders. We show that any differential graded $R$-order is contained in a maximal differential graded order. We develop parts of the classical ring theory in the differential graded setting, in particular the properties of analogues of the Jacobson radical. We further define class groups of differential graded orders as subgroups of the Grothendieck group of locally free differential graded modules. We define id\`eles in this setting showing that these id\`ele groups are isomorphic to the differential graded class group. Finally we give a homomorphism to the class group of the homology of the differential graded order and prove a Mayer-Vietoris like sequence for each central idempotent of $A$, including the analogous one for the kernel groups of these morphisms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1909.02608v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give iterative constructions for irreducible polynomials over F_q of degree nt^r for all nonnegative integers r, starting from irreducible polynomials of degree n. The iterative constructions correspond modulo fractional linear transformations to compositions with power functions x^t. The R-transform introduced by Cohen is recovered as a particular case corresponding to x^2, hence we obtain a generalization of Cohen's R-transform (t=2) to arbitrary degrees t bigger that two. Important properties like self-reciprocity and invariance of roots under certain automorphisms are deduced from invariance under multiplication by appropriate roots of unity. Extending to quadratic extensions of F_q we recover and generalize a recently obtained recursive construction of Panario, Reis and Wang.</description>

      <title>On the Matrix Form of the Quaternion Fourier Transform and Quaternion Convolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.01836v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study matrix forms of quaternionic versions of the Fourier Transform and Convolution operations. Quaternions offer a powerful representation unit, however they are related to difficulties in their use that stem foremost from non-commutativity of quaternion multiplication, and due to that $\mu^2 = -1$ possesses infinite solutions in the quaternion domain. Handling of quaternionic matrices is consequently complicated in several aspects (definition of eigenstructure, determinant, etc.). Our research findings clarify the relation of the Quaternion Fourier Transform matrix to the standard (complex) Discrete Fourier Transform matrix, and the extend on which well-known complex-domain theorems extend to quaternions. We focus especially on the relation of Quaternion Fourier Transform matrices to Quaternion Circulant matrices (representing quaternionic convolution), and the eigenstructure of the latter. A proof-of-concept application that makes direct use of our theoretical results is presented, where we present a method to bound the Lipschitz constant of a Quaternionic Convolutional Neural Network. Code is publicly available at: \url{https://github.com/sfikas/quaternion-fourier-convolution-matrix}.</description>

      <title>Representations of shifted quantum affine algebras and cluster algebras I. The simply-laced case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04616v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a family of cluster algebras of infinite rank associated with root systems of type $A$, $D$, $E$. We show that suitable completions of these cluster algebras are isomorphic to the Grothendieck rings of the categories $\mathcal{O}_\mathbb{Z}$ of the corresponding shifted quantum affine algebras. The cluster variables of a class of distinguished initial seeds are certain formal power series defined by E. Frenkel and the second author, which satisfy a system of functional relations called $QQ$-system. We conjecture that all cluster monomials are classes of simple objects of $\mathcal{O}_\mathbb{Z}$. In the final section, we show that these cluster algebras contain infinitely many cluster subalgebras isomorphic to the coordinate ring of the open double Bruhat cell of the corresponding simple simply-connected algebraic group. This explains the similarity between $QQ$-system relations and certain generalized minor identities discovered by Fomin and Zelevinsky.</description>
