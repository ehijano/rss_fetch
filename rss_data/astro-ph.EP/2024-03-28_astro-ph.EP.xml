      <title>High-resolution Spectroscopic Reconnaissance of a Temperate Sub-Neptune</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of temperate sub-Neptunes is the new frontier in exoplanetary science. A major development in the past year has been the first detection of carbon-bearing molecules in the atmosphere of a temperate sub-Neptune, K2-18 b, a possible Hycean world, with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). The JWST is poised to characterise the atmospheres of several other such planets with important implications for planetary processes in the temperate regime. Meanwhile, ground-based high-resolution spectroscopy has been highly successful in detecting chemical signatures of giant exoplanets, though low-mass planets have remained elusive. In the present work, we report the atmospheric reconnaissance of a temperate sub-Neptune using ground-based high-resolution transmission spectroscopy. The long orbital period and the low systemic velocity results in a low planetary radial velocity during transit, making this system a valuable testbed for high-resolution spectroscopy of temperate sub-Neptunes. We observe high-resolution time-series spectroscopy in the H- and K-bands during the planetary transit with the IGRINS instrument (R$\sim$45,000) on Gemini-South. Using observations from a single transit we find marginal evidence (2.2$\sigma$) for the presence of methane (CH$_4$) in the atmosphere and no evidence for ammonia (NH$_3$) despite its strong detectability for a cloud-free H$_2$-rich atmosphere. We assess our findings using injection tests with different atmospheric scenarios, and find them to be consistent with a high CH$_4$/NH$_3$ ratio and/or the presence of high-altitude clouds. Our results demonstrate the capability of Gemini-S/IGRINS for atmospheric characterization of temperate sub-Neptunes, and the complementarity between space- and ground-based facilities in this planetary regime.</description>

      <title>Feasibility of High-Resolution Transmission Spectroscopy for Low-Velocity Exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, high-resolution transmission spectroscopy in the near-infrared has led to detections of prominent molecules in several giant exoplanets on close-in orbits. This approach has traditionally relied on the large Doppler shifts of the planetary spectral lines induced by the high velocities of the close-in planets, which were considered necessary for separating them from the quasi-static stellar and telluric lines. In this work we demonstrate the feasibility of high-resolution transmission spectroscopy for chemical detections in atmospheres of temperate low-mass exoplanets around M dwarfs with low radial velocity variation during transit. We pursue this goal using model injection and recovery tests with H- and K- band high-resolution spectroscopy of the temperate sub-Neptune TOI-732 c, observed using the IGRINS spectrograph on Gemini-S. We show that planetary signals in transit may be recovered when the change in the planet's radial velocity is very small, down to sub-pixel velocities. This is possible due to the presence of the planetary signal in only a subset of the observed spectra. A sufficient number of out-of-transit spectra can create enough contrast between the planet signal and telluric/stellar contaminants that the planet signal does not constitute a principal component of the time-series spectra and can therefore be isolated using PCA-based detrending without relying on a significant Doppler shift. We additionally explore novel metrics for finding such signals, and investigate trends in their detectability. Our work extends the scope of high-resolution transmission spectroscopy and creates a pathway towards the characterisation of habitable sub-Neptune worlds with ground-based facilities.</description>

      <title>Ages of "singles" versus "multis": Predictions for dynamical sculpting over Gyr in the Kepler Sample</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sample of host stars with multiple transiting planets has illuminated the orbital architectures of exoplanetary systems. These architectures may be shaped mostly by formation conditions, be continually sculpted by ongoing dynamical processes, or both. As more studies place planet occurrence within a galactic context, evidence has emerged for variable planet multiplicity over time. In this manuscript, we investigate the use of transit multiplicity as a tool to constrain longer-timescale (&gt;1 Gyr) dynamical sculpting. First, with a suite of injection-and-recovery tests, we quantify sensitivity to sculpting laws across different regimes. We employ a forward modeling framework in which we generate synthetic planetary systems, according to a prescribed sculpting speed and timescale, around the FGK dwarfs studied by the Kepler Mission. Some sculpting scenarios are hypothetically detectable in the Kepler sample, while others can be disfavored from Kepler transit statistics alone. Secondly, we apply our analysis to reverse-engineer the sculpting laws consistent with the true yield from Kepler. We confirm the present-day fraction of host stars containing dynamically cool "systems with tightly-packed inner planets" (STIPs) is 4-13%. A variety of Gyr-timescale sculpting laws successfully predict the transit multiplicity of the Kepler sample, but none of these laws succeeds in also producing a detectable trend with transit multiplicity and stellar age. An improvement to measured stellar age precision may help uncover such a sculpting law, but nevertheless reflects limitations in transit multiplicity as an observable. Therefore other phenomena, apart from Gyr-timescale dynamical sculpting, may be required to explain the Kepler yield.</description>

      <title>A Data-Driven Search For Mid-Infrared Excesses Among Five Million Main-Sequence FGK Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar infrared excesses can indicate various phenomena of interest, from protoplanetary disks to debris disks, or (more speculatively) techno-signatures along the lines of Dyson spheres. In this paper, we conduct a large search for such excesses, designed as a data-driven contextual anomaly detection pipeline. We focus our search on FGK stars close to the main sequence to favour non-young host stars. We look for excess in the mid-infrared, unlocking a large sample to search in while favouring extreme IR excess akin to the ones produced by Extreme Debris Disks (EDD). We combine observations from ESA Gaia DR3, 2MASS, and the unWISE of NASA WISE, and create a catalogue of 4,898,812 stars with $G &lt; 16$ mag. We consider a star to have an excess if it is substantially brighter in $W1$ and $W2$ bands than what is predicted from an ensemble of machine-learning models trained on the data, taking optical and near-infrared information as input features. We apply a set of additional cuts (derived from the ML models and the objects' astronomical features) to avoid false-positive and identify a set of 53 objects (a rate of $1.1\times 10^{-5}$), including one previously identified EDD candidate. Typical infrared-excess fractional luminosities we find are in the range 0.005 to 0.1, consistent with known EDDs.</description>

      <title>ATMOSPHERIX: III- Estimating the C/O ratio and molecular dynamics at the limbs of WASP-76 b with SPIRou</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measuring the abundances of C- and O-bearing species in exoplanet atmospheres enables us to constrain the C/O ratio, that contains indications about the planet formation history. With a wavelength coverage going from 0.95 to 2.5 microns, the high-resolution (R$\sim$70 000) spectropolarimeter SPIRou can detect spectral lines of major bearers of C and O in exoplanets. Here we present our study of SPIRou transmission spectra of WASP-76 b acquired for the ATMOSPHERIX program. We applied the publicly available data analysis pipeline developed within the ATMOSPHERIX consortium, analysing the data using 1-D models created with the petitRADTRANS code, with and without a grey cloud deck. We report the detection of H$_2$O and CO at a Doppler shift of around -6 km.s$^{-1}$, consistent with previous observations of the planet. Finding a deep cloud deck to be favoured, we measured in mass mixing ratio (MMR) log(H$_2$O)$_{MMR}$ = -4.52 $\pm$ 0.77 and log(CO)$_{MMR}$ = -3.09 $\pm$ 1.05 consistent with a sub-solar metallicity to more than 1$\sigma$. We report 3$\sigma$ upper limits for the abundances of C$_2$H$_2$, HCN and OH. We estimated a C/O ratio of 0.94 $\pm$ 0.39 ($\sim$ 1.7 $\pm$ 0.7 x solar, with errors indicated corresponding to the 2$\sigma$ values) for the limbs of WASP-76 b at the pressures probed by SPIRou. We used 1-D ATMO forward models to verify the validity of our estimation. Comparing them to our abundance estimations of H$_2$O and CO, as well as our upper limits for C$_2$H$_2$, HCN and OH, we found that our results were consistent with a C/O ratio between 1 and 2 x solar, and hence with our C/O estimation. Finally, we found indications of asymmetry for both H$_2$O and CO when investigating the dynamics of their signatures, pointing to a complex scenario involving possibly both a temperature difference between limbs and clouds being behind the asymmetry this planet is best known for.</description>

      <title>The phase curve of the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-167b as seen by TESS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-hot Jupiters (UHJs) orbiting pulsating A/F stars represent an important subset of the exoplanetary demographic, as they are excellent candidates for the study of exoplanetary atmospheres, as well as being astrophysical laboratories for the investigation of planet-to-star interactions. We analyse the \texttt{TESS} (Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite) light curve of the WASP-167 system, consisting of an F1V star and a substellar companion on a $\sim 2.02$ day orbit. We model the combination of the ellipsoidal variability and the Doppler beaming to measure the mass of WASP-167b, and the reflection effect to obtain constraints on the geometric albedo, while placing a special emphasis on noise separation. We implement a basic model to determine the dayside ($T_{\rm Day}$), nightside ($T_{\rm Night}$) and intrinsic ($T_{\rm Internal}$) temperatures of WASP-167b and put a constraint on its Bond albedo. We confirm the transit parameters of the planet seen in the literature. We find that a resonant $\sim 2P^{-1}$ stellar signal (which may originate from planet-to-star interactions) interferes with the phase curve analysis. After considerate treatment of this signal, we find $M_p = 0.34 \pm 0.22$~$M_J$. We measure a dayside temperature of $2790 \pm 100$ K, classifying WASP-167b as an UHJ. We find a $2\sigma$ upper limit of $0.51$ on its Bond albedo, and determine the geometric albedo at $0.34 \pm 0.11$ ($1 \sigma$ uncertainty). With an occultation depth of $106.8 \pm 27.3$ ppm in the \texttt{TESS} passband, the UHJ WASP-167b will be an excellent target for atmospheric studies, especially those at thermal wavelength ranges, where the stellar pulsations are expected to be be less influential.</description>

      <title>NELIOTA: New results and updated statistics after 6.5 years of lunar impact flashes monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present results of the NELIOTA campaign for lunar impact flashes observed with the 1.2 m Kryoneri telescope. From August 2019 to August 2023, we report 113 validated and 70 suspected flashes. For the validated flashes, we calculate the physical parameters of the corresponding projectiles, the temperatures developed during the impacts, and the expected crater sizes. For the multiframe flashes we present light curves and thermal evolution plots. Using the whole sample of NELIOTA that encompasses 192 validated flashes in total from 2017, the statistics of the physical parameters of the meteoroids, the peak temperatures of the impacts and the expected crater sizes has been updated. Using this large sample, empirical relations correlating the luminous energies per photometric band were derived and used to roughly estimate the parameters of 92 suspected flashes of the NELIOTA archive. For a typical value of the luminous efficiency, we found that more than the 75% of the impacting meteoroids have masses between 1-200 g, radii between 0.5-3 cm and produced craters up to 3.5 m. 85% of the peak temperatures of the impacts range between 2000 and 4500 K. Statistics regarding the magnitude decline and the cooling rates of the multiframe flashes are also presented. The recalculation of the appearance frequency of meteoroids, lying within the aforementioned ranges of physical parameters, on the Moon yields that the total lunar surface is bombarded with 7.4 sporadic meteoroids/ hour and up to 12.6 meteoroids/hour when the Earth-Moon system passes through a strong meteoroid stream. By extrapolating these rates on Earth, the respective rates for various distances from its surface are calculated and used to estimate the probability of an impact of a meteoroid with a hypothetical infrastructure on the Moon, or with a satellite orbiting Earth for various impact surfaces and duration times of the missions.</description>

      <title>Increasing the raw contrast of VLT/SPHERE with dark hole techniques III. Broadband reference differential imaging of HR\,4796 using a four-quadrant phase mask</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Imaging exoplanetary systems is essential to characterizing exoplanetary systems and to studying planet-disk interactions to understand planet formation. Such imaging in the visible and near-infrared is challenging because these objects are very faint relative to their star and only fractions of an arcsecond away. Coronagraphic instruments have already allowed the imaging of a few exoplanets, but their performance is limited by wavefront aberrations. Adaptive optics systems partly compensate for the Earth's atmosphere turbulence, but they cannot fully control the wavefront. Some of the starlight leaks through the coronagraph and forms speckles in the image. Focal plane wavefront control, used as a second stage after the adaptive optics system, can minimize the speckle intensity within an area called the dark hole. We demonstrated the on-sky performance of dark hole techniques, pairwise probing coupled with electric field conjugation, using the apodized pupil Lyot coronagraph of the VLT/SPHERE instrument. In this paper, we probe their performance using the SPHERE four-quadrant phase mask coronagraph. We demonstrate the interest of combining dark hole techniques and reference differential imaging (RDI). We create a dark hole on-sky in the narrow band around~$1.7\,\mu$m observing HR\,4796. We then record broadband images of HR\,4796 and a reference star at the H band. The dark hole techniques improve the H-band detection limit by a factor of three. The dark hole is stable from one star to a nearby star enabling RDI. This stability offers two new strategies of observation. First, one can quickly create a dark hole observing a bright star before pointing to a faint target star. Furthermore, one can couple dark hole techniques and RDI. A very interesting point is that the performance of these methods does not depend on the astrophysical signal.</description>
