      <title>Detecting Notational Errors in Digital Music Scores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Music scores are used to precisely store music pieces for transmission and preservation. To represent and manipulate these complex objects, various formats have been tailored for different use cases. While music notation follows specific rules, digital formats usually enforce them leniently. Hence, digital music scores widely vary in quality, due to software and format specificity, conversion issues, and dubious user inputs. Problems range from minor engraving discrepancies to major notation mistakes. Yet, data quality is a major issue when dealing with musical information extraction and retrieval. We present an automated approach to detect notational errors, aiming at precisely localizing defects in scores. We identify two types of errors: i) rhythm/time inconsistencies in the encoding of individual musical elements, and ii) contextual errors, i.e. notation mistakes that break commonly accepted musical rules. We implement the latter using a modular state machine that can be easily extended to include rules representing the usual conventions from the common Western music notation. Finally, we apply this error-detection method to the piano score dataset ASAP. We highlight that around 40% of the scores contain at least one notational error, and manually fix multiple of them to enhance the dataset's quality.</description>

      <title>MaskCD: Mitigating LVLM Hallucinations by Image Head Masked Contrastive Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have shown remarkable performance in visual-language understanding for downstream multimodal tasks. While their capabilities are improving, problems emerge simultaneously. Among those problems, the hallucinations have attracted much attention, which stands for the phenomenon where LVLMs generate contradictory content to their input visual and text contents. Many approaches have been proposed to deal with this issue, such as contrastive decoding and attention manipulation. However, contrastive decoding methods struggle in constructing appropriate contrastive samples, and attention manipulation methods are highly sensitive, lacking stability. In this work, we propose image head Masked Contrastive Decoding (MaskCD). Our approach utilizes the "image heads" in LVLMs, masking them to construct contrastive samples for contrastive decoding. We evaluated MaskCD on LLaVA-1.5-7b and Qwen-VL-7b, using various benchmarks such as CHAIR, POPE, AMBER and MME. The results demonstrate that MaskCD effectively alleviates the phenomenon of hallucinations and retains the general capabilities of LVLMs. Corresponding resources could be found at: https://github.com/Deng-Jingyuan/MaskCD .</description>

      <title>MHier-RAG: Multi-Modal RAG for Visual-Rich Document Question-Answering via Hierarchical and Multi-Granularity Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00579v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The multi-modal long-context document question-answering task aims to locate and integrate multi-modal evidences (such as texts, tables, charts, images, and layouts) distributed across multiple pages, for question understanding and answer generation. The existing methods can be categorized into Large Vision-Language Model (LVLM)-based and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based methods. However, the former were susceptible to hallucinations, while the latter struggled for inter-modal disconnection and cross-page fragmentation. To address these challenges, a novel multi-modal RAG model, named MHier-RAG, was proposed, leveraging both textual and visual information across long-range pages to facilitate accurate question answering for visual-rich documents. A hierarchical indexing method with the integration of flattened in-page chunks and topological cross-page chunks was designed to jointly establish in-page multi-modal associations and long-distance cross-page dependencies. By means of joint similarity evaluation and large language model (LLM)-based re-ranking, a multi-granularity semantic retrieval method, including the page-level parent page retrieval and document-level summary retrieval, was proposed to foster multi-modal evidence connection and long-distance evidence integration and reasoning. Experimental results performed on public datasets, MMLongBench-Doc and LongDocURL, demonstrated the superiority of our MHier-RAG method in understanding and answering modality-rich and multi-page documents.</description>

      <title>AlignDiT: Multimodal Aligned Diffusion Transformer for Synchronized Speech Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20629v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the task of multimodal-to-speech generation, which aims to synthesize high-quality speech from multiple input modalities: text, video, and reference audio. This task has gained increasing attention due to its wide range of applications, such as film production, dubbing, and virtual avatars. Despite recent progress, existing methods still suffer from limitations in speech intelligibility, audio-video synchronization, speech naturalness, and voice similarity to the reference speaker. To address these challenges, we propose AlignDiT, a multimodal Aligned Diffusion Transformer that generates accurate, synchronized, and natural-sounding speech from aligned multimodal inputs. Built upon the in-context learning capability of the DiT architecture, AlignDiT explores three effective strategies to align multimodal representations. Furthermore, we introduce a novel multimodal classifier-free guidance mechanism that allows the model to adaptively balance information from each modality during speech synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AlignDiT significantly outperforms existing methods across multiple benchmarks in terms of quality, synchronization, and speaker similarity. Moreover, AlignDiT exhibits strong generalization capability across various multimodal tasks, such as video-to-speech synthesis and visual forced alignment, consistently achieving state-of-the-art performance.

      <title>HopaDIFF: Holistic-Partial Aware Fourier Conditioned Diffusion for Referring Human Action Segmentation in Multi-Person Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09650v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Action segmentation is a core challenge in high-level video understanding, aiming to partition untrimmed videos into segments and assign each a label from a predefined action set. Existing methods primarily address single-person activities with fixed action sequences, overlooking multi-person scenarios. In this work, we pioneer textual reference-guided human action segmentation in multi-person settings, where a textual description specifies the target person for segmentation. We introduce the first dataset for Referring Human Action Segmentation, i.e., RHAS133, built from 133 movies and annotated with 137 fine-grained actions with 33h video data, together with textual descriptions for this new task. Benchmarking existing action segmentation methods on RHAS133 using VLM-based feature extractors reveals limited performance and poor aggregation of visual cues for the target person. To address this, we propose a holistic-partial aware Fourier-conditioned diffusion framework, i.e., HopaDIFF, leveraging a novel cross-input gate attentional xLSTM to enhance holistic-partial long-range reasoning and a novel Fourier condition to introduce more fine-grained control to improve the action segmentation generation. HopaDIFF achieves state-of-the-art results on RHAS133 in diverse evaluation settings. The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/KPeng9510/HopaDIFF.</description>

      <title>AudioStory: Generating Long-Form Narrative Audio with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20088v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-audio (TTA) generation excel at synthesizing short audio clips but struggle with long-form narrative audio, which requires temporal coherence and compositional reasoning. To address this gap, we propose AudioStory, a unified framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) with TTA systems to generate structured, long-form audio narratives. AudioStory possesses strong instruction-following reasoning generation capabilities. It employs LLMs to decompose complex narrative queries into temporally ordered sub-tasks with contextual cues, enabling coherent scene transitions and emotional tone consistency. AudioStory has two appealing features: (1) Decoupled bridging mechanism: AudioStory disentangles LLM-diffuser collaboration into two specialized components, i.e., a bridging query for intra-event semantic alignment and a residual query for cross-event coherence preservation. (2) End-to-end training: By unifying instruction comprehension and audio generation within a single end-to-end framework, AudioStory eliminates the need for modular training pipelines while enhancing synergy between components. Furthermore, we establish a benchmark AudioStory-10K, encompassing diverse domains such as animated soundscapes and natural sound narratives. Extensive experiments show the superiority of AudioStory on both single-audio generation and narrative audio generation, surpassing prior TTA baselines in both instruction-following ability and audio fidelity.
