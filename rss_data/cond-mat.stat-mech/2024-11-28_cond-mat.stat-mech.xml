      <title>Chiral eigenbases of the XX and XY quantum spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the values of observables in chiral eigenstates of the XX quantum spin chain that were introduced in in our recent work and compare the form of the result with the respective expressions obtained in the more familiar eigenbasis of states with fixed magnetization in $z$-direction. We carry out the diagonalization of the XY spin chain in the chiral basis. We calculate the norm of the chiral XY eigenstates, and the values of the one-point functions and some neighbor two-point correlation functions. We interpret the spectrum and the particle content of the XY chain in terms of scattering states of an even number of kink and anti-kink excitations that are created over a reduced Brillouin zone.</description>

      <title>Gaussian fluctuations of non-reciprocal systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-reciprocal systems can be thought of as disobeying Newtons third law - an action does not cause an equal and opposite reaction. In recent years there has been a dramatic rise in interest towards such systems. On a fundamental level, they can be a basis of describing non-equilibrium and active states of matter, with applications ranging from physics to social sciences. However, often the first step to understanding complex nonlinear models is to linearize about the steady states. It is thus useful to develop a careful understanding of linear non-reciprocal systems, similar to our understanding of Gaussian systems in equilibrium statistical mechanics. In this work we explore simplest linear non-reciprocal models with noise and spatial extent. We describe their regions of stability and show how non-reciprocity can enhance the stability of a system. We demonstrate the appearance of exceptional and critical exceptional points with the respective enhancement of fluctuations for the latter. We show how strong non-reciprocity can lead to a finite-momentum instability. Finally, we comment how non-reciprocity can be a source of colored, $1/f$ type noise.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation-response inequalities for kinetic and entropic perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive fluctuation-response inequalities for Markov jump processes that link the fluctuations of general observables to the response to perturbations in the transition rates within a unified framework. These inequalities are derived using the Cram\'er-Rao bound, enabling broader applicability compared to existing fluctuation-response relations formulated for static responses of current-like observables. The fluctuation-response inequalities are valid for a wider class of observables and are applicable to finite observation times through dynamic responses. Furthermore, we extend these inequalities to open quantum systems governed by the Lindblad quantum master equation and find the quantum fluctuation-response inequality, where dynamical activity plays a central role.</description>

      <title>Critical behavior of the Ising model on square-triangle tilings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate magnetic properties of the ferromagnetic Ising model on square-triangle tilings to explore how the hyperuniformity, which characterizes long-range behavior of the point pattern, influences critical phenomena where long-range correlations play a crucial role. The square-triangle tilings are spatially random structures in two dimensions constructed by densely packing the plane with squares and triangles. The growth rule with a parameter $p$ proposed in our previous paper enables systematic generations of hyperuniform, nonhyperuniform, and antihyperuniform tilings. Classical Monte Carlo simulations of the Ising model on these tilings show that critical behavior always belongs to the two-dimensional Ising universality class. It is clarified that the critical temperature is higher for the tiling with higher regularity in terms of hyperuniformity. Critical phenomena in the Ising models on the periodic and quasiperiodic tilings composed of the square and triangle tiles are also addressed.</description>

      <title>A universal approach to Renyi entropy of multiple disjoint intervals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a general theory for computing the Renyi entropy with general multiple disjoint intervals from the swapping operations. Our theory is proposed based on the fact that we have observed the resemblance between the replica trick in quantum field theory and the swapping operation. Consequently, the Renyi entropy can be obtained by evaluating the expectation values of the swapping operator. As an application, we study the Renyi entropy of a one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model for two, three and four disjoint intervals. As the system is at the critical point, our computations of the Renyi entropy are consistent with the analytical results from the conformal field theory. Moreover, our methods can go beyond the critical regime of the Ising model.</description>

      <title>The joint distribution of first return times and of the number of distinct sites visited by a 1D random walk before returning to the origin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present analytical results for the joint probability distribution $P(T_{FR}=t,S=s)$ of first return (FR) times t and of the number of distinct sites s visited by a random walk (RW) on a one dimensional lattice before returning to the origin. The RW on a one dimensional lattice is recurrent, namely the probability to return to the origin is $P_{R}=1$. However the mean $\langle T_{FR}\rangle$ of the distribution $P(T_{FR}=t)$ of first return times diverges. Similarly, the mean $\langle S\rangle$ of the distribution $P(S=s)$ of the number of distinct sites visited before returning to the origin also diverges. The joint distribution $P(T_{FR}=t,S=s)$ provides a formulation that controls these divergences and accounts for the interplay between the kinetic and geometric properties of first return trajectories. We calculate the conditional distributions $P(T_{FR}=t|S=s)$ and $P(S=s|T_{FR}=t)$. We find that the conditional expectation value of first return times of trajectories that visit s distinct sites is ${\mathbb E}[T_{FR}|S=s]=\frac{2}{3}(s^2+s+1)$, and the variance is $Var(T_{FR}|S=s)=\frac{4}{45}(s-1)(s+2)(s^2+s-1)$. We also find that in the asymptotic limit, the conditional expectation value of the number of distinct sites visited by an RW that first returns to the origin at time $t=2n$ is ${\mathbb E}[S|T_{FR}=2n] \simeq \sqrt{\pi n}$, and the variance is $Var(S|T_{FR}=2n) \simeq \pi\left(\frac{\pi}{3}-1\right)n$. These results go beyond the important recent results of Klinger et al. [{\it Phys. Rev. E} {\bf 105}, 034116 (2022)], who derived a closed form expression for the generating function of the joint distribution, but did not go further to extract an explicit expression for the joint distribution itself. The joint distribution provides useful insight on the efficiency of random search processes, in which the aim is to cover as many sites as possible in a given number of steps.</description>

      <title>Transdimensional Defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This note introduces a novel paradigm for conformal defects with continuously adjustable dimensions. Just as the standard $\varepsilon$ expansion interpolates between integer spacetime dimensions, a new parameter, $\delta$, is used to interpolate between different integer-dimensional defects. The ensuing framework is explored in detail for defects of dimension $p=2+\delta$ in both free and interacting $O(N)$ bulk conformal field theories (CFTs) in $d=4-\varepsilon$. Comprehensive calculations are performed to first and second order in $\varepsilon$ and to high or all orders in $\delta$. Additionally, in the large-$N$ limit, the interpolation between defects of dimensions $p=1$ and $p=2$ is analysed for spacetime dimensions $4\leq d\leq 6$. The new parameter $\delta$ provides a natural enrichment of the space of defect CFTs and allows to find new integer dimension or co-dimension defects.</description>

      <title>From quantum enhanced to quantum inspired Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a comprehensive analysis of the quantum-enhanced Monte Carlo method [Nature, 619, 282-287 (2023)], aimed at identifying the optimal working point of the algorithm. We observe an optimal mixing Hamiltonian strength and analyze the scaling of the total evolution time with the size of the system. We also explore extensions of the circuit, including the use of time-dependent Hamiltonians and reverse digitized annealing. Additionally, we propose that classical, approximate quantum simulators can be used for the proposal step instead of the original real-hardware implementation. We observe that tensor-network simulators, even with unconverged settings, can maintain a scaling advantage over standard classical samplers. This may extend the utility of quantum enhanced Monte Carlo as a quantum-inspired algorithm, even before the deployment of large-scale quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>PyMatterSim: a Python Data Analysis Library for Computer Simulations of Materials Science, Physics, Chemistry, and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computer simulation has become one of the most important tools in scientific research in many disciplines. Benefiting from the dynamical trajectories regulated by versatile interatomic interactions, various material properties can be quantitatively characterized at the atomic scale. This greatly deepens our understanding of Nature and provides incredible insights supplementing experimental observations. Hitherto, a plethora of literature discusses the computational discoveries in studying glasses in which positional disorder is inherent in their configurations. Motivated by active research and knowledge sharing, we developed a data analysis library in Python for computational materials science research. We hope to help promote scientific progress and narrow some technical gaps for the wide communities. The toolkit mainly focuses on physical analyses of glassy properties from the open-source simulator LAMMPS. Nevertheless, the code design renders high flexibility, with functionalities extendable to other computational tools. The library provides data-driven insights for different subjects and can be incorporated into advanced machine-learning workflows. The scope of the data analysis methodologies applies not only to materials science but also to physics, chemistry, and beyond.</description>

Abstract: In this paper I present the state of the art concerning the theoretical detectability (and the open challenges for the experimental detectability) of a special class of paraparticles beyond bosons and fermions. The particles under considerations obey a parastatistics and (unlike anyons which transform under the braid group) are mutually exchanged via the permutation group.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Quantum Mpemba Effect in Markovian Systems and Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum Mpemba effect (QME) describes the counterintuitive phenomenon in which a system farther from equilibrium reaches steady state faster than one closer to equilibrium. However, ambiguity in defining a suitable distance measure between quantum states has led to varied interpretations across different contexts. Here we propose the intrinsic quantum Mpemba effect (IQME), defined using the trajectory length traced by the quantum state as a more appropriate measure of distance--distinct from previous trajectory-independent metrics. By treating quantum states as points in a Riemannian space defined by statistical distance, the trajectory length emerges as a more natural and accurate characterization of the counterintuitive dynamics, drawing an analogy to the classical Brachistochrone problem. We demonstrate the existence of IQME in Markovian systems and extend its definition to quantum circuits, thereby establishing a unified framework applicable to both open and closed systems. Notably, we observe an IQME in a $U(1)$-symmetric circuit, offering new insights into the rates of quantum thermalization for different initial states. This work deepens our understanding of quantum state evolution and lays the foundation for accurately capturing novel quantum dynamical behaviour.</description>

      <title>The large $N$ vector model on $S^1\times S^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a method to evaluate the partition function and energy density of a massive scalar on a 2-sphere of radius $r$ and at finite temperature $\beta$ as power series in $\frac{\beta}{r}$. Each term in the power series can be written in terms of polylogarithms. We use this result to obtain the gap equation for the large $N$, critical $O(N)$ model with a quartic interaction on $S^1\times S^2$ in the large radius expansion. Solving the gap equation perturbatively we obtain the leading finite size corrections to the expectation value of stress tensor for the $O(N)$ vector model on $S^1\times S^2$. Applying the Euclidean inversion formula on the perturbative expansion of the thermal two point function we obtain the finite size corrections to the expectation value of the higher spin currents of the critical $O(N)$ model. Finally we show that these finite size corrections of higher spin currents tend to that of the free theory at large spin as seen earlier for the model on $S^1\times R^2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17242v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We conjecture a relation between the local dimension $d$ of a local nearest-neighbor critical Hamiltonian in one spatial dimension and the maximum central charge, $c_{\text{max}}$, that it can yield. Specifically, we propose that $c_{\text{max}} \leq d-1$, establishing a link between the short-distance lattice realization of a model and its emerging long-distance entanglement properties. This inequality can be viewed as a general form of a $c$-theorem establishing the reduction of effective degrees of freedom between the UV lattice and the IR conformal field theory. We support this conjecture with numerous examples.</description>

      <title>Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition in the XY model on the honeycomb lattice: A comprehensive Monte Carlo analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12076v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we examined the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) phase transition in the two-dimensional XY model on the honeycomb lattice. To address its thermodynamical behavior, we conducted standard numerical Monte Carlo simulations with the Simulated Annealing (SA) protocol and entropic simulations based on the Wang-Landau (WL) algorithm. The inverse transition temperature ($\beta_{BKT}$) was determined using the second ($\Upsilon$) and fourth-order ($\Upsilon_4$) helicity modulus as the order parameter. We also used the fourth-order Binder cumulant of the magnetization as an additional tool to address the critical properties of the model. Our finite-size scaling (FSS) analysis suggests $\beta_{BKT} = 1.696(3)$ from $\Upsilon$ and $\beta_{BKT}=1.67(1)$ from $\Upsilon_4$. From the Binder cumulant crossing we found $\beta_{BKT}=1.724(2)$. These values deviate significantly from the expected theoretical value of $\sqrt{2}$. We believe that this discrepancy suggests that the theoretical assumptions regarding the analytical calculation may need to be revisited. Additionally, we calculated the vortex density and the formation energy of the vortex-antivortex pairs, where the obtained vortex formation energy is $2\mu=4.0(5)$. Upon comparison with the square lattice, our results support the notion of instability of the honeycomb lattice and give additional backing to the critical behavior we found.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium phase coexistence in boundary-driven diffusive systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12353v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Liquid-gas phase coexistence in a boundary-driven diffusive system is studied by analyzing fluctuating hydrodynamics of a density field defined on a one-dimensional lattice with a space interval $\Lambda$. When an interface width $\ell$ is much larger than $\Lambda$, the discrete model becomes the standard fluctuating hydrodynamics, where the phase coexistence condition is given by the local equilibrium thermodynamics. In contrast, when $\ell &lt; \Lambda$, the most probable density profile is determined by a new variational principle, where the chemical potential at the interface is found to deviate from the equilibrium coexistence chemical potential. This means that metastable states at equilibrium stably appear near the interface as the influence of the particle current. The variational function derived in the theoretical analysis is also found to be equivalent to the variational function formulated in an extended framework of thermodynamics called global thermodynamics. Finally, the validity of the theoretical result is confirmed by numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Ballistic conductance with and without disorder in a boundary-driven XXZ spin chain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13816v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by recent experiments on Google's sycamore NISQ platform on the spin transport resulting from a non-unitary periodic boundary drive of an XXZ chain, we study a classical variant thereof by a combination of analytical and numerical means. We find the classical model reproduces the quantum results in remarkable detail, and provides an analytical handle on the nature and shape of the spin transport's three distinct regimes: ballistic (easy-plane), subdiffusive (isotropic) and insulating (easy-axis). Further, we show that this phenomenology is remarkably robust to the inclusion of bond disorder -- albeit that the transient dynamics approaching the steady states differs qualitatively between the clean and disordered cases -- providing an accessible instance of ballistic transport in a disordered setting.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Green-Kubo relation for friction in nanofluidics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07134v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A central aim of statistical mechanics is to establish connections between a system's microscopic fluctuations and its macroscopic response to a perturbation. For non-equilibrium transport properties, this amounts to establishing Green-Kubo (GK) relationships. In hydrodynamics, relating such GK expressions for liquid-solid friction to macroscopic slip boundary conditions has remained a long-standing problem due to two challenges: (i) The GK running integral of the force autocorrelation function decays to zero rather than reaching a well-defined plateau value; and (ii) debates persist on whether such a transport coefficient measures an intrinsic interfacial friction or an effective friction in the system. Inspired by ideas from the coarse-graining community, we derive a GK relation for liquid-solid friction where the force autocorrelation is sampled with a constraint of momentum conservation in the liquid. Our expression does not suffer from the "plateau problem" and unambiguously measures an effective friction coefficient, in an analogous manner to Stokes' law. We further establish a link between the derived friction coefficient and the hydrodynamic slip length, enabling a straightforward assessment of continuum hydrodynamics across length scales. We find that continuum hydrodynamics describes the simulation results quantitatively for confinement length scales all the way down to 1 nm. Our approach amounts to a straightforward modification to the present standard method of quantifying interfacial friction from molecular simulations, making possible a sensible comparison between surfaces of vastly different slippage.</description>

      <title>Stochastic entropy production associated with quantum measurement in a framework of Markovian quantum state diffusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.08197v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The reduced density matrix that characterises the state of an open quantum system is a projection from the full density matrix of the quantum system and its environment, and there are many full density matrices consistent with a given reduced version. Without a specification of relevant details of the environment, the evolution of a reduced density matrix is therefore typically unpredictable, even if the dynamics are deterministic. With this in mind, we investigate a two level open quantum system using a framework of quantum state diffusion. We consider the pseudorandom evolution of its reduced density matrix when subjected to an environment-driven process of continuous quantum measurement of a system observable, using dynamics that asymptotically send the system to an eigenstate. The unpredictability is characterised by a stochastic entropy production, the average of which corresponds to an increase in the subjective uncertainty of the quantum state adopted by the system and environment, given the underspecified dynamics. This differs from a change in von Neumann entropy, and can continue indefinitely as the system is guided towards an eigenstate. As one would expect, the simultaneous measurement of two non-commuting observables within the same framework does not send the system to an eigenstate. Instead, the probability density function describing the reduced density matrix of the system becomes stationary over a continuum of pure states, a situation characterised by zero further stochastic entropy production. Transitions between such stationary states, brought about by changes in the relative strengths of the two measurement processes, give rise to finite positive mean stochastic entropy production. The framework investigated can offer useful perspectives on both the dynamics and irreversible thermodynamics of measurement in quantum systems.</description>

Abstract: Quasi-crystals are aperiodic structures that present crystallographic properties which are not compatible with that of a single unit cell. Their revolutionary discovery in a metallic alloy, less than three decades ago, has required a full reconsideration of what we defined as a crystal structure. Surprisingly, quasi-crystalline structures have been discovered also at much larger length scales in different microscopic systems for which the size of elementary building blocks ranges between the nanometric to the micrometric scale. Here, we report the first experimental observation of spontaneous quasi-crystal self-assembly at the millimetric scale. This result is obtained in a fully athermal system of macroscopic spherical grains vibrated on a substrate. Starting from a liquid-like disordered phase, the grains begin to locally arrange into three types of squared and triangular tiles that eventually align, forming 8-fold symmetric quasi-crystal that has been predicted in simulation but not yet observed experimentally in non-atomic systems. These results are not only the proof of a novel route to spontaneously assemble quasi-crystals but are of fundamental interest for the connection between equilibrium and non-equilibrium statistical physics.</description>

      <title>Enhanced localization in the prethermal regime of continuously measured many-body localized systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.12064v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many-body localized systems exhibit a unique characteristic of avoiding thermalization, primarily attributed to the presence of a local disorder potential in the Hamiltonian. In recent years there has been an interest in simulating these systems on quantum devices. However, actual quantum devices are subject to unavoidable decoherence that can be modeled as coupling to a bath or continuous measurements. The quantum Zeno effect is also known to inhibit thermalization in a quantum system, where repeated measurements suppress transport. In this work we study the interplay of many-body localization and the many-body quantum Zeno effect. In a prethermal regime, we find that signatures of many-body localization are enhanced when the system is coupled to a bath that contains measurements of local fermion population, subject to the appropriate choice of system and bath parameters.</description>

      <title>Problem-tailored Simulation of Energy Transport on Noisy Quantum Computers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.03924v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The transport of conserved quantities like spin and charge is fundamental to characterizing the behavior of quantum many-body systems. Numerically simulating such dynamics is generically challenging, which motivates the consideration of quantum computing strategies. However, the relatively high gate errors and limited coherence times of today's quantum computers pose their own challenge, highlighting the need to be frugal with quantum resources. In this work we report simulations on quantum hardware of infinite-temperature energy transport in the mixed-field Ising chain, a paradigmatic many-body system that can exhibit a range of transport behaviors at intermediate times. We consider a chain with $L=12$ sites and find results broadly consistent with those from ideal circuit simulators over 90 Trotter steps, containing up to 990 entangling gates. To obtain these results, we use two key problem-tailored insights. First, we identify a convenient basis$\unicode{x2013}$the Pauli $Y$ basis$\unicode{x2013}$in which to sample the infinite-temperature trace and provide theoretical and numerical justifications for its efficiency relative to, e.g., the computational basis. Second, in addition to a variety of problem-agnostic error mitigation strategies, we employ a renormalization strategy that compensates for global nonconservation of energy due to device noise. We discuss the applicability of the proposed sampling approach beyond the mixed-field Ising chain and formulate a variational method to search for a sampling basis with small sample-to-sample fluctuations for an arbitrary Hamiltonian. This opens the door to applying these techniques in more general models.</description>

      <title>Poisson structure and Integrability of a Hamiltonian flow for the inhomogeneous six-vertex model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15181v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the action-angle variables for a Hamiltonian flow of the inhomogeneous six-vertex model, from a formulation introduced in a 2022 work due to Keating, Reshetikhin, and Sridhar, hence confirming a conjecture of the authors as to whether the Hamiltonian flow is integrable. To demonstrate that such an integrability property of the Hamiltonian holds from the action-angle variables, we make use of previous methods for studying Hamiltonian systems, implemented by Faddeev and Takhtajan, in which it was shown that integrability of a Hamiltonian system holds for the nonlinear Schrodinger's equation by computing action-angle variables from the Poisson bracket, which is connected to the analysis of entries of the monodromy and transfer matrices. For the inhomogeneous six-vertex model, an approach for computing the action-angle variables is possible through formulating several relations between entries of the quantum monodromy, and transfer, matrices, which can be not only be further examined from the structure of $L$ operators, but also from computing several Poisson brackets parameterized from entries of the monodromy matrix.</description>

Abstract: Living materials adapt their shape to signals from the environment, yet the impact of shape changes on signal processing and associated feedback dynamics remain unclear. We find that droplets with signal-responsive interfacial tensions exhibit shape bistability, excitable dynamics, and oscillations. The underlying critical points reveal novel mechanisms for physical signal processing through shape adaptation in soft active materials. We recover signatures of one such critical point in experimental data from zebrafish embryos, where it supports boundary formation.</description>

Abstract: Information propagation in the one-dimensional infinite temperature Hubbard model with a dissipative particle sink at the end of a semi-infinite chain is studied. In the strongly interacting limit, the two-site mutual information and the operator entanglement entropy exhibit a rich structure with two propagating information fronts and superimposed interference fringes. A classical reversible cellular automaton model quantitatively captures the transport and the slow, classical part of the correlations, but fails to describe the rapidly propagating information jet. The fast quantum jet resembles coherent free particle propagation, with the accompanying long-ranged interference fringes that are exponentially damped by short-ranged spin correlations in the many-body background.</description>

      <title>Multifractality and Hyperuniformity in Quasicrystalline Bose-Hubbard Models with and without Disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05155v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Clarifying similarities and differences in physical properties between crystalline and quasicrystalline systems is one of central issues in studying quasicrystals. To contribute to this, we apply multifractal and hyperuniform analyses to nonuniform spatial patterns in the Bose-Hubbard model on the Penrose and Ammann-Beenker tilings. Based on the mean-field approximation, we obtain real-space distributions of local superfluid amplitude and boson density. In both Mott insulating and superfluid phases, the distributions are hyperuniform. Analyzing the order metric that quantifies the complexity of nonuniform spatial patterns, we find that both quasicrystals show a significant increase of the order metric at a phase boundary between the Mott insulating and superfluid phases, in stark contrast to the case of a periodic square lattice. Our results suggest that hyperuniformity is a useful concept to differentiate between crystalline and quasicrystalline bosonic systems. The order metric clarifies if the distribution of a physical quantity reflects the point distribution or not, and quantifies how complex the distribution is in comparison with the point distribution. Moreover, we introduce on-site random potentials into these quasicrystalline Bose-Hubbard models, leading to a Bose glass phase. Contrary to the Mott insulating and superfluid phases, we find that the Bose glass phase is multifractal. The same multifractality appears on a Bose glass phase in the periodic square lattice. Therefore, multifractality is common in a Bose glass phase irrespective of the periodicity of systems.</description>

      <title>A stochastic field theory for the evolution of quantitative traits in finite populations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10739v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Infinitely many distinct trait values may arise in populations bearing quantitative traits, and modeling their population dynamics is thus a formidable task. While classical models assume fixed or infinite population size, models in which the total population size fluctuates due to demographic noise in births and deaths can behave qualitatively differently from constant or infinite population models due to density-dependent dynamics. In this paper, I present a stochastic field theory for the eco-evolutionary dynamics of finite populations bearing one-dimensional quantitative traits. I derive stochastic field equations that describe the evolution of population densities, trait frequencies, and the mean value of any trait in the population. These equations recover well-known results such as the replicator-mutator equation, Price equation, and gradient dynamics in the infinite population limit. For finite populations, the equations describe the intricate interplay between natural selection, noise-induced selection, eco-evolutionary feedback, and neutral genetic drift in determining evolutionary trajectories. My work uses ideas from statistical physics, calculus of variations, and SPDEs, providing alternative methods that complement the measure-theoretic martingale approach that is more common in the literature.</description>

Abstract: We review recent progress regarding the double scaled Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model and other $p$-local quantum mechanical random Hamiltonians. These models exhibit an expansion using chord diagrams, which can be solved by combinatorial methods. We describe exact results in these models, including their spectrum, correlation functions, and Lyapunov exponent. In a certain limit, these techniques manifest the relation to the Schwarzian quantum mechanics, a theory of quantum gravity in $AdS_2$. More generally, the theory is controlled by a rigid algebraic structure of a quantum group, suggesting a theory of quantum gravity on non-commutative $q$-deformed $AdS_2$. We conclude with discussion of related universality classes, and survey some of the current research directions.</description>

      <title>Finite time path field theory perturbative methods for local quantum spin chain quenches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03832v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss local magnetic field quenches using perturbative methods of finite time path field theory (FTPFT) in the following spin chains: Ising and XY in a transverse magnetic field. Their common characteristics are: (i) they are integrable via mapping to a second quantized noninteracting fermion problem; and (ii) when the ground state is nondegenerate (true for finite chains except in special cases), it can be represented as a vacuum of Bogoliubov fermions. By switching on a local magnetic field perturbation at finite time, the problem becomes nonintegrable and must be approached via numeric or perturbative methods. Using the formalism of FTPFT based on Wigner transforms (WTs) of projected functions, we show how to: (i) calculate the basic ``bubble'' diagram in the Loschmidt echo (LE) of a quenched chain to any order in the perturbation; and (ii) resum the generalized Schwinger--Dyson equation for the fermion two-point retarded functions in the ``bubble'' diagram, hence achieving the resummation of perturbative expansion of LE for a wide range of perturbation strengths under certain analyticity assumptions. Limitations of the assumptions and possible generalizations beyond it and also for other spin chains are further discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15194v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we compute the overlaps of the ground states for the open spin chains after a change of one of the boundary magnetic fields. It can be considered as the first step toward the study of the boundary quench problem: behaviour of an open spin chain after an abrupt change of one boundary magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Entropic magnetic interlayer coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06446v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nanomagnetism concerns the engineering of magnetic interactions in heterostructures that consist of layers of magnetic and non-magnetic materials. Mostly, these interactions are dominated by the minimization of energy. Here, we propose an effective magnetic interlayer coupling that is dominated by the maximization of entropy. As an example, we consider the system that mediates the effective interactions to be square spin ice, in which case we find purely entropic interactions that are long-ranged. We argue that in the thermodynamic limit the entropic interlayer coupling gives rise to entropic torques on the magnetization direction. For small systems, the physical properties are well characterized by the mutual information between the two magnets that are coupled. Because entropic interactions become stronger for higher temperatures, our findings may benefit the development of nanomagnetic devices that require thermal stability.</description>

      <title>Bilayer construction for mixed state phenomena with strong, weak symmetries and symmetry breakings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07174v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the bilayer construction, as a specific purification scheme for a general mixed state, where each mixed state has a one-to-one correspondence with a bilayer pure state with two constraints: non-negativity of the bilayer wavefunction; and the presence of an anti-unitary layer-exchange symmetry T. Different from the Choi-Jamio{\l}kowski isomorphism, any mixed state can be realized as the monolayer reduced density matrix of a bilayer pure state, and its physical properties can be experimentally realized and detected in non-magnetic bilayer 2D materials with a layer-exchange mirror symmetry. We study a variety of mixed state phenomena in the bilayer construction: (1) strong and weak symmetries, their explicit and spontaneous breakings in mixed states can be understood as usual Landau-type symmetry breakings in the bilayer pure state, and their criteria can be derived accordingly; (2) decoherence of a pure state by local errors can be mapped to quantum quench dynamics of the bilayer pure states; (3) mixed symmetry protected topological (SPT) states and mixed state topological orders can be classified, characterized and realized as pure state SPTs and topological orders in the bilayer. We further study examples of strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking (SWSSB) and their critical scalings at the SWSSB transition in the bilayer construction.</description>

      <title>Krylov Complexity in the Schr\"odinger Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16302v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the Krylov complexity in the context of Schr\"odinger field theory in the grand canonic ensemble for the bosonic and fermionic cases. Specifically, we find that the Lanczos coefficients $\{a_{n}\}$ and $\{b_{n}\}$ satisfy the linear relations with respect to $n$. It is found that $\{b_n\}$ is independent of the chemical potentials while $\{a_n\}$ depends on the chemical potentials. The resulting Krylov complexities for both bosonic and fermionic cases behave similarly, which is due to the similar profiles of the square of the absolute values of the auto-correlation functions. In the late time, the Krylov complexity exhibits exponential growth with the asymptotic scaling significantly smaller than the twice of the slope of $\{b_n\}$, which is different from that in the relativistic field theory. We argue that this is because the Lanczos coefficients $\{a_n\}$ also contributes to the Krylov complexity.</description>
