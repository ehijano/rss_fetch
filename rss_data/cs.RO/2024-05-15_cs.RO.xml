      <title>Function based sim-to-real learning for shape control of deformable free-form surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the shape control of deformable free-form surfaces, simulation plays a crucial role in establishing the mapping between the actuation parameters and the deformed shapes. The differentiation of this forward kinematic mapping is usually employed to solve the inverse kinematic problem for determining the actuation parameters that can realize a target shape. However, the free-form surfaces obtained from simulators are always different from the physically deformed shapes due to the errors introduced by hardware and the simplification adopted in physical simulation. To fill the gap, we propose a novel deformation function based sim-to-real learning method that can map the geometric shape of a simulated model into its corresponding shape of the physical model. Unlike the existing sim-to-real learning methods that rely on completely acquired dense markers, our method accommodates sparsely distributed markers and can resiliently use all captured frames -- even for those in the presence of missing markers. To demonstrate its effectiveness, our sim-to-real method has been integrated into a neural network-based computational pipeline designed to tackle the inverse kinematic problem on a pneumatically actuated deformable mannequin.</description>

      <title>Zero-Shot Transfer of Neural ODEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous systems often encounter environments and scenarios beyond the scope of their training data, which underscores a critical challenge: the need to generalize and adapt to unseen scenarios in real time. This challenge necessitates new mathematical and algorithmic tools that enable adaptation and zero-shot transfer. To this end, we leverage the theory of function encoders, which enables zero-shot transfer by combining the flexibility of neural networks with the mathematical principles of Hilbert spaces. Using this theory, we first present a method for learning a space of dynamics spanned by a set of neural ODE basis functions. After training, the proposed approach can rapidly identify dynamics in the learned space using an efficient inner product calculation. Critically, this calculation requires no gradient calculations or retraining during the online phase. This method enables zero-shot transfer for autonomous systems at runtime and opens the door for a new class of adaptable control algorithms. We demonstrate state-of-the-art system modeling accuracy for two MuJoCo robot environments and show that the learned models can be used for more efficient MPC control of a quadrotor.</description>

      <title>BEVRender: Vision-based Cross-view Vehicle Registration in Off-road GNSS-denied Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce BEVRender, a novel learning-based approach for the localization of ground vehicles in Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)-denied off-road scenarios. These environments are typically challenging for conventional vision-based state estimation due to the lack of distinct visual landmarks and the instability of vehicle poses. To address this, BEVRender generates high-quality local bird's eye view (BEV) images of the local terrain. Subsequently, these images are aligned with a geo-referenced aerial map via template-matching to achieve accurate cross-view registration. Our approach overcomes the inherent limitations of visual inertial odometry systems and the substantial storage requirements of image-retrieval localization strategies, which are susceptible to drift and scalability issues, respectively. Extensive experimentation validates BEVRender's advancement over existing GNSS-denied visual localization methods, demonstrating notable enhancements in both localization accuracy and update frequency. The code for BEVRender will be made available soon.</description>

      <title>Explainable AI for Ship Collision Avoidance: Decoding Decision-Making Processes and Behavioral Intentions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study developed an explainable AI for ship collision avoidance. Initially, a critic network composed of sub-task critic networks was proposed to individually evaluate each sub-task in collision avoidance to clarify the AI decision-making processes involved. Additionally, an attempt was made to discern behavioral intentions through a Q-value analysis and an Attention mechanism. The former focused on interpreting intentions by examining the increment of the Q-value resulting from AI actions, while the latter incorporated the significance of other ships in the decision-making process for collision avoidance into the learning objective. AI's behavioral intentions in collision avoidance were visualized by combining the perceived collision danger with the degree of attention to other ships. The proposed method was evaluated through a numerical experiment. The developed AI was confirmed to be able to safely avoid collisions under various congestion levels, and AI's decision-making process was rendered comprehensible to humans. The proposed method not only facilitates the understanding of DRL-based controllers/systems in the ship collision avoidance task but also extends to any task comprising sub-tasks.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Koopman Embedding for Robust Control of Complex Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of linear embedding is the key to the synthesis of linear control techniques for nonlinear systems. In recent years, while Koopman operator theory has become a prominent approach for learning these linear embeddings through data-driven methods, these algorithms often exhibit limitations in generalizability beyond the distribution captured by training data and are not robust to changes in the nominal system dynamics induced by intrinsic or environmental factors. To overcome these limitations, this study presents an adaptive Koopman architecture capable of responding to the changes in system dynamics online. The proposed framework initially employs an autoencoder-based neural network that utilizes input-output information from the nominal system to learn the corresponding Koopman embedding offline. Subsequently, we augment this nominal Koopman architecture with a feed-forward neural network that learns to modify the nominal dynamics in response to any deviation between the predicted and observed lifted states, leading to improved generalization and robustness to a wide range of uncertainties and disturbances compared to contemporary methods. Extensive tracking control simulations, which are undertaken by integrating the proposed scheme within a Model Predictive Control framework, are used to highlight its robustness against measurement noise, disturbances, and parametric variations in system dynamics.</description>

      <title>Motion Prediction with Gaussian Processes for Safe Human-Robot Interaction in Virtual Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Humans use collaborative robots as tools for accomplishing various tasks. The interaction between humans and robots happens in tight shared workspaces. However, these machines must be safe to operate alongside humans to minimize the risk of accidental collisions. Ensuring safety imposes many constraints, such as reduced torque and velocity limits during operation, thus increasing the time to accomplish many tasks. However, for applications such as using collaborative robots as haptic interfaces with intermittent contacts for virtual reality applications, speed limitations result in poor user experiences. This research aims to improve the efficiency of a collaborative robot while improving the safety of the human user. We used Gaussian process models to predict human hand motion and developed strategies for human intention detection based on hand motion and gaze to improve the time for the robot and human security in a virtual environment. We then studied the effect of prediction. Results from comparisons show that the prediction models improved the robot time by 3\% and safety by 17\%. When used alongside gaze, prediction with Gaussian process models resulted in an improvement of the robot time by 2\% and the safety by 13\%.</description>

      <title>CarDreamer: Open-Source Learning Platform for World Model based Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To safely navigate intricate real-world scenarios, autonomous vehicles must be able to adapt to diverse road conditions and anticipate future events. World model (WM) based reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach by learning and predicting the complex dynamics of various environments. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, there does not exist an accessible platform for training and testing such algorithms in sophisticated driving environments. To fill this void, we introduce CarDreamer, the first open-source learning platform designed specifically for developing WM based autonomous driving algorithms. It comprises three key components: 1) World model backbone: CarDreamer has integrated some state-of-the-art WMs, which simplifies the reproduction of RL algorithms. The backbone is decoupled from the rest and communicates using the standard Gym interface, so that users can easily integrate and test their own algorithms. 2) Built-in tasks: CarDreamer offers a comprehensive set of highly configurable driving tasks which are compatible with Gym interfaces and are equipped with empirically optimized reward functions. 3) Task development suite: This suite streamlines the creation of driving tasks, enabling easy definition of traffic flows and vehicle routes, along with automatic collection of multi-modal observation data. A visualization server allows users to trace real-time agent driving videos and performance metrics through a browser. Furthermore, we conduct extensive experiments using built-in tasks to evaluate the performance and potential of WMs in autonomous driving. Thanks to the richness and flexibility of CarDreamer, we also systematically study the impact of observation modality, observability, and sharing of vehicle intentions on AV safety and efficiency. All code and documents are accessible on https://github.com/ucd-dare/CarDreamer.</description>

      <title>BonnBot-I Plus: A Bio-diversity Aware Precise Weed Management Robotic Platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we focus on the critical tasks of plant protection in arable farms, addressing a modern challenge in agriculture: integrating ecological considerations into the operational strategy of precision weeding robots like \bbot. This article presents the recent advancements in weed management algorithms and the real-world performance of \bbot\ at the University of Bonn's Klein-Altendorf campus. We present a novel Rolling-view observation model for the BonnBot-Is weed monitoring section which leads to an average absolute weeding performance enhancement of $3.4\%$. Furthermore, for the first time, we show how precision weeding robots could consider bio-diversity-aware concerns in challenging weeding scenarios. We carried out comprehensive weeding experiments in sugar-beet fields, covering both weed-only and mixed crop-weed situations, and introduced a new dataset compatible with precision weeding. Our real-field experiments revealed that our weeding approach is capable of handling diverse weed distributions, with a minimal loss of only $11.66\%$ attributable to intervention planning and $14.7\%$ to vision system limitations highlighting required improvements of the vision system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: -Recent strides in model predictive control (MPC)underscore a dependence on numerical advancements to efficientlyand accurately solve large-scale problems. Given the substantialnumber of variables characterizing typical whole-body optimalcontrol (OC) problems -often numbering in the thousands-exploiting the sparse structure of the numerical problem becomescrucial to meet computational demands, typically in the range ofa few milliseconds. A fundamental building block for computingNewton or Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) steps indirect optimal control methods involves addressing the linearquadratic regulator (LQR) problem. This paper concentrateson equality-constrained problems featuring implicit systemdynamics and dual regularization, a characteristic found inadvanced interior-point or augmented Lagrangian solvers. Here,we introduce a parallel algorithm designed for solving an LQRproblem with dual regularization. Leveraging a rewriting of theLQR recursion through block elimination, we first enhanced theefficiency of the serial algorithm, then subsequently generalized itto handle parametric problems. This extension enables us to splitdecision variables and solve multiple subproblems concurrently.Our algorithm is implemented in our nonlinear numerical optimalcontrol library ALIGATOR. It showcases improved performanceover previous serial formulations and we validate its efficacy bydeploying it in the model predictive control of a real quadrupedrobot. This paper follows up from our prior work on augmentedLagrangian methods for numerical optimal control with implicitdynamics and constraints.</description>

      <title>SOMTP: Self-Supervised Learning-Based Optimizer for MPC-Based Safe Trajectory Planning Problems in Robotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model Predictive Control (MPC)-based trajectory planning has been widely used in robotics, and incorporating Control Barrier Function (CBF) constraints into MPC can greatly improve its obstacle avoidance efficiency. Unfortunately, traditional optimizers are resource-consuming and slow to solve such non-convex constrained optimization problems (COPs) while learning-based methods struggle to satisfy the non-convex constraints. In this paper, we propose SOMTP algorithm, a self-supervised learning-based optimizer for CBF-MPC trajectory planning. Specifically, first, SOMTP employs problem transcription to satisfy most of the constraints. Then the differentiable SLPG correction is proposed to move the solution closer to the safe set and is then converted as the guide policy in the following training process. After that, inspired by the Augmented Lagrangian Method (ALM), our training algorithm integrated with guide policy constraints is proposed to enable the optimizer network to converge to a feasible solution. Finally, experiments show that the proposed algorithm has better feasibility than other learning-based methods and can provide solutions much faster than traditional optimizers with similar optimality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an innovative technique for the path planning of flying robots in a 3D environment in Rough Mereology terms. The main goal was to construct the algorithm that would generate the mereological potential fields in 3-dimensional space. To avoid falling into the local minimum, we assist with a weighted Euclidean distance. Moreover, a searching path from the start point to the target, with respect to avoiding the obstacles was applied. The environment was created by connecting two cameras working in real-time. To determine the gate and elements of the world inside the map was responsible the Python Library OpenCV [1] which recognized shapes and colors. The main purpose of this paper is to apply the given results to drones.</description>

      <title>GrainGrasp: Dexterous Grasp Generation with Fine-grained Contact Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One goal of dexterous robotic grasping is to allow robots to handle objects with the same level of flexibility and adaptability as humans. However, it remains a challenging task to generate an optimal grasping strategy for dexterous hands, especially when it comes to delicate manipulation and accurate adjustment the desired grasping poses for objects of varying shapes and sizes. In this paper, we propose a novel dexterous grasp generation scheme called \textbf{\textit{GrainGrasp}} that provides fine-grained contact guidance for each fingertip. In particular, we employ a generative model to predict separate contact maps for each fingertip on the object point cloud, effectively capturing the specifics of finger-object interactions. In addition, we develop a new dexterous grasping optimization algorithm that solely relies on the point cloud as input, eliminating the necessity for complete mesh information of the object. By leveraging the contact maps of different fingertips, the proposed optimization algorithm can generate precise and determinable strategies for human-like object grasping. Experimental results confirm the efficiency of the proposed scheme. Our code is available at https://github.com/wmtlab/GrainGrasp</description>

      <title>Visual Attention Based Cognitive Human-Robot Collaboration for Pedicle Screw Placement in Robot-Assisted Orthopedic Surgery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current orthopedic robotic systems largely focus on navigation, aiding surgeons in positioning a guiding tube but still requiring manual drilling and screw placement. The automation of this task not only demands high precision and safety due to the intricate physical interactions between the surgical tool and bone but also poses significant risks when executed without adequate human oversight. As it involves continuous physical interaction, the robot should collaborate with the surgeon, understand the human intent, and always include the surgeon in the loop. To achieve this, this paper proposes a new cognitive human-robot collaboration framework, including the intuitive AR-haptic human-robot interface, the visual-attention-based surgeon model, and the shared interaction control scheme for the robot. User studies on a robotic platform for orthopedic surgery are presented to illustrate the performance of the proposed method. The results demonstrate that the proposed human-robot collaboration framework outperforms full robot and full human control in terms of safety and ergonomics.</description>

      <title>VascularPilot3D: Toward a 3D fully autonomous navigation for endovascular robotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research reports VascularPilot3D, the first 3D fully autonomous endovascular robot navigation system. As an exploration toward autonomous guidewire navigation, VascularPilot3D is developed as a complete navigation system based on intra-operative imaging systems (fluoroscopic X-ray in this study) and typical endovascular robots. VascularPilot3D adopts previously researched fast 3D-2D vessel registration algorithms and guidewire segmentation methods as its perception modules. We additionally propose three modules: a topology-constrained 2D-3D instrument end-point lifting method, a tree-based fast path planning algorithm, and a prior-free endovascular navigation strategy. VascularPilot3D is compatible with most mainstream endovascular robots. Ex-vivo experiments validate that VascularPilot3D achieves 100% success rate among 25 trials. It reduces the human surgeon's overall control loops by 18.38%. VascularPilot3D is promising for general clinical autonomous endovascular navigations.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Neural Network for Multirotor Slung Load Systems Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in aerial robotics have enabled the use of multirotor vehicles for autonomous payload transportation. Resorting only to classical methods to reliably model a quadrotor carrying a cable-slung load poses significant challenges. On the other hand, purely data-driven learning methods do not comply by design with the problem's physical constraints, especially in states that are not densely represented in training data. In this work, we explore the use of physics informed neural networks to learn an end-to-end model of the multirotor-slung-load system and, at a given time, estimate a sequence of the future system states. An LSTM encoder decoder with an attention mechanism is used to capture the dynamics of the system. To guarantee the cohesiveness between the multiple predicted states of the system, we propose the use of a physics-based term in the loss function, which includes a discretized physical model derived from first principles together with slack variables that allow for a small mismatch between expected and predicted values. To train the model, a dataset using a real-world quadrotor carrying a slung load was curated and is made available. Prediction results are presented and corroborate the feasibility of the approach. The proposed method outperforms both the first principles physical model and a comparable neural network model trained without the physics regularization proposed.</description>

Abstract: We perform detailed theoretical analysis of an expectation-maximization-based algorithm recently proposed in for solving a variation of the 3D registration problem, named multi-model 3D registration. Despite having shown superior empirical results, did not theoretically justify the conditions under which the EM approach converges to the ground truth. In this project, we aim to close this gap by establishing such conditions. In particular, the analysis revolves around the usage of probabilistic tail bounds that are developed and applied in various instances throughout the course. The problem studied in this project stands as another example, different from those seen in the course, in which tail-bounds help advance our algorithmic understanding in a probabilistic way. We provide self-contained background materials on 3D Registration</description>

      <title>Perception Without Vision for Trajectory Prediction: Ego Vehicle Dynamics as Scene Representation for Efficient Active Learning in Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the use of trajectory and dynamic state information for efficient data curation in autonomous driving machine learning tasks. We propose methods for clustering trajectory-states and sampling strategies in an active learning framework, aiming to reduce annotation and data costs while maintaining model performance. Our approach leverages trajectory information to guide data selection, promoting diversity in the training data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods on the trajectory prediction task using the nuScenes dataset, showing consistent performance gains over random sampling across different data pool sizes, and even reaching sub-baseline displacement errors at just 50% of the data cost. Our results suggest that sampling typical data initially helps overcome the ''cold start problem,'' while introducing novelty becomes more beneficial as the training pool size increases. By integrating trajectory-state-informed active learning, we demonstrate that more efficient and robust autonomous driving systems are possible and practical using low-cost data curation strategies.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Sensor Network Design for Multiple Coverage</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sensor placement optimization methods have been studied extensively. They can be applied to a wide range of applications, including surveillance of known environments, optimal locations for 5G towers, and placement of missile defense systems. However, few works explore the robustness and efficiency of the resulting sensor network concerning sensor failure or adversarial attacks. This paper addresses this issue by optimizing for the least number of sensors to achieve multiple coverage of non-simply connected domains by a prescribed number of sensors. We introduce a new objective function for the greedy (next-best-view) algorithm to design efficient and robust sensor networks and derive theoretical bounds on the network's optimality. We further introduce a Deep Learning model to accelerate the algorithm for near real-time computations. The Deep Learning model requires the generation of training examples. Correspondingly, we show that understanding the geometric properties of the training data set provides important insights into the performance and training process of deep learning techniques. Finally, we demonstrate that a simple parallel version of the greedy approach using a simpler objective can be highly competitive.</description>

      <title>ForestTrav: Accurate, Efficient and Deployable Forest Traversability Estimation for Autonomous Ground Vehicles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.12705v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Autonomous navigation in unstructured vegetated environments remains an open challenge. To successfully operate in these settings, ground vehicles must assess the traversability of the environment and determine which vegetation is pliable enough to push through. In this work, we propose a novel method that combines a high-fidelity and feature-rich 3D voxel representation while leveraging the structural context and sparseness of SCNN's to assess Traversability Estimation (TE) in densely vegetated environments. The proposed method is thoroughly evaluated on an accurately-labeled real-world data set that we provide to the community. It is shown to outperform state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin (0.59 vs. 0.39 MCC score at 0.1m voxel resolution) in challenging scenes and to generalize to unseen environments. In addition, the method is economical in the amount of training data and training time required: a model is trained in minutes on a desktop computer. We show that by exploiting the context of the environment, our method can use different feature combinations with only limited performance variations. For example, our approach can be used with lidar-only features, whilst still assessing complex vegetated environments accurately, which was not demonstrated previously in the literature in such environments. In addition, we propose an approach to assess a traversability estimator's sensitivity to information quality and show our method's sensitivity is low.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.04670v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Precise reconstruction and manipulation of the crumpled cloths is challenging due to the high dimensionality of cloth models, as well as the limited observation at self-occluded regions. We leverage the recent progress in the field of single-view human reconstruction to template-based reconstruct crumpled cloths from their top-view depth observations only, with our proposed sim-real registration protocols. In contrast to previous implicit cloth representations, our reconstruction mesh explicitly describes the positions and visibilities of the entire cloth mesh vertices, enabling more efficient dual-arm and single-arm target-oriented manipulations. Experiments demonstrate that our TRTM system can be applied to daily cloths that have similar topologies as our template mesh, but with different shapes, sizes, patterns, and physical properties. Videos, datasets, pre-trained models, and code can be downloaded from our project website: https://wenbwa.github.io/TRTM/ .</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.01967v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In autonomous robotics, a critical challenge lies in developing robust solutions for Active Collaborative SLAM, wherein multiple robots collaboratively explore and map an unknown environment while intelligently coordinating their movements and sensor data acquisitions. In this article, we present an efficient centralized frontier sharing approach that maximizes exploration by taking into account information gain in the merged map, distance, and reward computation among frontier candidates and encourages the spread of agents into the environment. Eventually, our method efficiently spreads the robots for maximum exploration while keeping SLAM uncertainty low. Additionally, we also present two coordination approaches, synchronous and asynchronous to prioritize robot goal assignments by the central server. The proposed method is implemented in ROS and evaluated through simulation and experiments on publicly available datasets and similar methods, rendering promising results.</description>

      <title>AirIMU: Learning Uncertainty Propagation for Inertial Odometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04874v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inertial odometry (IO) using strap-down inertial measurement units (IMUs) is critical in many robotic applications where precise orientation and position tracking are essential. Prior kinematic motion model-based IO methods often use a simplified linearized IMU noise model and thus usually encounter difficulties in modeling non-deterministic errors arising from environmental disturbances and mechanical defects. In contrast, data-driven IO methods struggle to accurately model the sensor motions, often leading to generalizability and interoperability issues. To address these challenges, we present AirIMU, a hybrid approach to estimate the uncertainty, especially the non-deterministic errors, by data-driven methods and increase the generalization abilities using model-based methods. We demonstrate the adaptability of AirIMU using a full spectrum of IMUs, from low-cost automotive grades to high-end navigation grades. We also validate its effectiveness on various platforms, including hand-held devices, vehicles, and a helicopter that covers a trajectory of 262 kilometers. In the ablation study, we validate the effectiveness of our learned uncertainty in an IMU-GPS pose graph optimization experiment, achieving a 31.6\% improvement in accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that jointly training the IMU noise correction and uncertainty estimation synergistically benefits both tasks.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Adversarial Attacks on Autonomous Driving Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06701v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces an attacking mechanism to challenge the resilience of autonomous driving systems. Specifically, we manipulate the decision-making processes of an autonomous vehicle by dynamically displaying adversarial patches on a screen mounted on another moving vehicle. These patches are optimized to deceive the object detection models into misclassifying targeted objects, e.g., traffic signs. Such manipulation has significant implications for critical multi-vehicle interactions such as intersection crossing and lane changing, which are vital for safe and efficient autonomous driving systems. Particularly, we make four major contributions. First, we introduce a novel adversarial attack approach where the patch is not co-located with its target, enabling more versatile and stealthy attacks. Moreover, our method utilizes dynamic patches displayed on a screen, allowing for adaptive changes and movement, enhancing the flexibility and performance of the attack. To do so, we design a Screen Image Transformation Network (SIT-Net), which simulates environmental effects on the displayed images, narrowing the gap between simulated and real-world scenarios. Further, we integrate a positional loss term into the adversarial training process to increase the success rate of the dynamic attack. Finally, we shift the focus from merely attacking perceptual systems to influencing the decision-making algorithms of self-driving systems. Our experiments demonstrate the first successful implementation of such dynamic adversarial attacks in real-world autonomous driving scenarios, paving the way for advancements in the field of robust and secure autonomous driving.</description>

      <title>Integrating DeepRL with Robust Low-Level Control in Robotic Manipulators for Non-Repetitive Reaching Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02551v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In robotics, contemporary strategies are learning-based, characterized by a complex black-box nature and a lack of interpretability, which may pose challenges in ensuring stability and safety. To address these issues, we propose integrating a collision-free trajectory planner based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with a novel auto-tuning low-level control strategy, all while actively engaging in the learning phase through interactions with the environment. This approach circumvents the control performance and complexities associated with computations while addressing nonrepetitive reaching tasks in the presence of obstacles. First, a model-free DRL agent is employed to plan velocity-bounded motion for a manipulator with 'n' degrees of freedom (DoF), ensuring collision avoidance for the end-effector through joint-level reasoning. The generated reference motion is then input into a robust subsystem-based adaptive controller, which produces the necessary torques, while the cuckoo search optimization (CSO) algorithm enhances control gains to minimize the stabilization and tracking error in the steady state. This approach guarantees robustness and uniform exponential convergence in an unfamiliar environment, despite the presence of uncertainties and disturbances. Theoretical assertions are validated through the presentation of simulation outcomes.</description>

      <title>3D Diffusion Policy: Generalizable Visuomotor Policy Learning via Simple 3D Representations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03954v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Imitation learning provides an efficient way to teach robots dexterous skills; however, learning complex skills robustly and generalizablely usually consumes large amounts of human demonstrations. To tackle this challenging problem, we present 3D Diffusion Policy (DP3), a novel visual imitation learning approach that incorporates the power of 3D visual representations into diffusion policies, a class of conditional action generative models. The core design of DP3 is the utilization of a compact 3D visual representation, extracted from sparse point clouds with an efficient point encoder. In our experiments involving 72 simulation tasks, DP3 successfully handles most tasks with just 10 demonstrations and surpasses baselines with a 24.2% relative improvement. In 4 real robot tasks, DP3 demonstrates precise control with a high success rate of 85%, given only 40 demonstrations of each task, and shows excellent generalization abilities in diverse aspects, including space, viewpoint, appearance, and instance. Interestingly, in real robot experiments, DP3 rarely violates safety requirements, in contrast to baseline methods which frequently do, necessitating human intervention. Our extensive evaluation highlights the critical importance of 3D representations in real-world robot learning.

      <title>Learning Reward for Robot Skills Using Large Language Models via Self-Alignment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07162v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Learning reward functions remains the bottleneck to equip a robot with a broad repertoire of skills. Large Language Models (LLM) contain valuable task-related knowledge that can potentially aid in the learning of reward functions. However, the proposed reward function can be imprecise, thus ineffective which requires to be further grounded with environment information. We proposed a method to learn rewards more efficiently in the absence of humans. Our approach consists of two components: We first use the LLM to propose features and parameterization of the reward, then update the parameters through an iterative self-alignment process. In particular, the process minimizes the ranking inconsistency between the LLM and the learnt reward functions based on the execution feedback. The method was validated on 9 tasks across 2 simulation environments. It demonstrates a consistent improvement over training efficacy and efficiency, meanwhile consuming significantly fewer GPT tokens compared to the alternative mutation-based method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07536v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To deal with the task assignment problem of multi-AUV systems under kinematic constraints, which means steering capability constraints for underactuated AUVs or other vehicles likely, an improved task assignment algorithm is proposed combining the Dubins Path algorithm with improved SOM neural network algorithm. At first, the aimed tasks are assigned to the AUVs by improved SOM neural network method based on workload balance and neighborhood function. When there exists kinematic constraints or obstacles which may cause failure of trajectory planning, task re-assignment will be implemented by change the weights of SOM neurals, until the AUVs can have paths to reach all the targets. Then, the Dubins paths are generated in several limited cases. AUV's yaw angle is limited, which result in new assignments to the targets. Computation flow is designed so that the algorithm in MATLAB and Python can realizes the path planning to multiple targets. Finally, simulation results prove that the proposed algorithm can effectively accomplish the task assignment task for multi-AUV system.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Reinforcement Learning in Sensor Fusion: A Comparative Analysis of Cubature and Sampling-based Integration Methods for Rover Search Planning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08691v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the computational speed and accuracy of two numerical integration methods, cubature and sampling-based, for integrating an integrand over a 2D polygon. Using a group of rovers searching the Martian surface with a limited sensor footprint as a test bed, the relative error and computational time are compared as the area was subdivided to improve accuracy in the sampling-based approach. The results show that the sampling-based approach exhibits a $14.75\%$ deviation in relative error compared to cubature when it matches the computational performance at $100\%$. Furthermore, achieving a relative error below $1\%$ necessitates a $10000\%$ increase in relative time to calculate due to the $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ complexity of the sampling-based method. It is concluded that for enhancing reinforcement learning capabilities and other high iteration algorithms, the cubature method is preferred over the sampling-based method.</description>

      <title>CoFiI2P: Coarse-to-Fine Correspondences for Image-to-Point Cloud Registration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.14660v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Image-to-point cloud (I2P) registration is a fundamental task for robots and autonomous vehicles to achieve cross-modality data fusion and localization. Existing I2P registration methods estimate correspondences at the point/pixel level, often overlooking global alignment. However, I2P matching can easily converge to a local optimum when performed without high-level guidance from global constraints. To address this issue, this paper introduces CoFiI2P, a novel I2P registration network that extracts correspondences in a coarse-to-fine manner to achieve the globally optimal solution. First, the image and point cloud data are processed through a Siamese encoder-decoder network for hierarchical feature extraction. Second, a coarse-to-fine matching module is designed to leverage these features and establish robust feature correspondences. Specifically, In the coarse matching phase, a novel I2P transformer module is employed to capture both homogeneous and heterogeneous global information from the image and point cloud data. This enables the estimation of coarse super-point/super-pixel matching pairs with discriminative descriptors. In the fine matching module, point/pixel pairs are established with the guidance of super-point/super-pixel correspondences. Finally, based on matching pairs, the transform matrix is estimated with the EPnP-RANSAC algorithm. Extensive experiments conducted on the KITTI dataset demonstrate that CoFiI2P achieves impressive results, with a relative rotation error (RRE) of 1.14 degrees and a relative translation error (RTE) of 0.29 meters. These results represent a significant improvement of 84% in RRE and 89% in RTE compared to the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) method.

      <title>On Solving Close Enough Orienteering Problems with Overlapped Neighborhoods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04257v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Close Enough Traveling Salesman Problem (CETSP) is a well-known variant of TSP whereby the agent may complete its mission at any point within a target neighborhood. Heuristics based on overlapped neighborhoods, known as Steiner Zones (SZ), have gained attention in addressing CETSP. While SZs offer effective approximations to the original graph, their inherent overlap imposes constraints on search space, potentially conflicting with global optimization objectives. Here we show how such limitations can be converted into advantages in a Close Enough Orienteering Problem (CEOP) by aggregating prizes across overlapped neighborhoods. We further extend classic CEOP with Non-uniform Neighborhoods (CEOP-N) by introducing non-uniform costs for prize collection. To tackle CEOP and CEOP-N, we develop a new approach featuring a Randomized Steiner Zone Discretization (RSZD) scheme coupled with a hybrid algorithm based on Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Ant Colony System (ACS), CRaSZe-AntS. The RSZD scheme identifies sub-regions for PSO exploration, and ACS determines the discrete visiting sequence. We evaluate the RSZD's discretization performance on CEOP instances derived from established CETSP instances and compare CRaSZe-AntS against the most relevant state-of-the-art heuristic focused on single-neighborhood optimization for CEOP instances. We also compare the performance of the interior search within SZs and the boundary search on individual neighborhoods in the context of CEOP-N. Our experimental results show that CRaSZe-AntS can yield comparable solution quality with significantly reduced computation time compared to the single neighborhood strategy, where we observe an average 140.44% increase in prize collection and a 55.18% reduction in algorithm execution time. CRaSZe-AntS is thus highly effective in solving emerging CEOP-N, examples of which include truck-and-drone delivery scenarios.</description>
