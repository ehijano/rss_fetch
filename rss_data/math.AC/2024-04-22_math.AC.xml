      <title>Lefschetz properties of squarefree monomial ideals via Rees algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theory of Rees algebras of monomial ideals has been extensively studied, and as a consequence, many (sometimes partial) equivalences between algebraic properties of monomial ideals, and combinatorial properties of simplicial complexes and hypergraphs are known. In this paper we show how this theory can be used to find interesting examples in the theory of Lefschetz properties. We explore the consequences of known results from Lefschetz properties to the Rees algebras of squarefree monomial ideals, for example in the calculation of analytic spread. In particular, we show a connection between symbolic powers and $f$-vectors of simplicial complexes. This perspective leads us to a generalization of Postnikov's "mixed Eulerian numbers". We prove the positivity of such numbers in our setting.</description>

      <title>Families of numerical semigroups and a special case of the Huneke-Wiegand conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Huneke-Wiegand conjecture is a decades-long open question in commutative algebra. Garc\'ia-S\'anchez and Leamer showed that a special case of this conjecture concerning numerical semigroup rings $\Bbbk[\Gamma]$ can be answered in the affirmative by locating certain arithmetic sequences within the numerical semigroup $\Gamma$. In this paper, we use their approach to prove the Huneke-Wiegand conjecture in the case where $\Gamma$ is generated by a generalized arithmetic sequence and showcase how visualizations can be leveraged to find the requisite arithmetic sequences.</description>

      <title>Efficient Algorithms for Finite $\mathbb{Z}$-Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.02610v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a finite $\mathbb{Z}$-algebra $R$, i.e., for a $\mathbb{Z}$-algebra which is a finitely generated $\mathbb{Z}$-module, we assume that $R$ is explicitly given by a system of $\mathbb{Z}$-module generators $G$, its relation module ${\rm Syz}(G)$, and the structure constants of the multiplication in $R$. In this setting we develop and analyze efficient algorithms for computing essential information about $R$. First we provide polynomial time algorithms for solving linear systems of equations over $R$ and for basic ideal-theoretic operations in $R$. Then we develop ZPP (zero-error probabilitic polynomial time) algorithms to compute the nilradical and the maximal ideals of 0-dimensional affine algebras $K[x_1,\dots,x_n]/I$ with $K=\mathbb{Q}$ or $K=\mathbb{F}_p$. The task of finding the associated primes of a finite $\mathbb{Z}$-algebra $R$ is reduced to these cases and solved in ZPPIF (ZPP plus one integer factorization). With the same complexity, we calculate the connected components of the set of minimal associated primes ${\rm minAss}(R)$ and then the primitive idempotents of $R$. Finally, we prove that knowing an explicit representation of $R$ is polynomial time equivalent to knowing a strong Gr\"obner basis of an ideal $I$ such that $R = \mathbb{Z}[x_1,\dots,x_n]/I$.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Auslander-Reiten duality and Morita theorem for singularity categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.14090v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a Morita theorem to construct triangle equivalences between the singularity categories of (commutative and non-commutative) Gorenstein rings and the cluster categories of finite dimensional algebras over fields, and more strongly, quasi-equivalences between their canonical dg enhancements. More precisely, we prove that such an equivalence exists as soon as we find a quasi-equivalence between the graded dg singularity category of a Gorenstein ring and the derived category of a finite dimensional algebra which can be done by finding a single tilting object.
  Our result is based on two key theorems on dg enhancements of cluster categories and of singularity categories, which are of independent interest. First we give a Morita-type theorem which realizes certain $\mathbb{Z}$-graded dg categories as dg orbit categories. Secondly, we show that the canonical dg enhancements of the singularity categories of symmetric orders have the bimodule Calabi-Yau property, which lifts the classical Auslander-Reiten duality on singularity categories.
  We apply our results to such classes of rings as Gorenstein rings of dimension at most $1$, quotient singularities, and Geigle-Lenzing complete intersections, including finite or infinite Grassmannian cluster categories, to realize their singularity categories as cluster categories of finite dimensional algebras.</description>
