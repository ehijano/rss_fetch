      <title>Solving Maxwell's equations with Non-Trainable Graph Neural Network Message Passing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computational electromagnetics (CEM) is employed to numerically solve Maxwell's equations, and it has very important and practical applications across a broad range of disciplines, including biomedical engineering, nanophotonics, wireless communications, and electrodynamics. The main limitation of existing CEM methods is that they are computationally demanding. Our work introduces a leap forward in scientific computing and CEM by proposing an original solution of Maxwell's equations that is grounded on graph neural networks (GNNs) and enables the high-performance numerical resolution of these fundamental mathematical expressions. Specifically, we demonstrate that the update equations derived by discretizing Maxwell's partial differential equations can be innately expressed as a two-layer GNN with static and pre-determined edge weights. Given this intuition, a straightforward way to numerically solve Maxwell's equations entails simple message passing between such a GNN's nodes, yielding a significant computational time gain, while preserving the same accuracy as conventional transient CEM methods. Ultimately, our work supports the efficient and precise emulation of electromagnetic wave propagation with GNNs, and more importantly, we anticipate that applying a similar treatment to systems of partial differential equations arising in other scientific disciplines, e.g., computational fluid dynamics, can benefit computational sciences</description>

      <title>Mortar Thin Shell Approximation for Analysis of Superconducting Accelerator Magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thin layers can lead to unfavorable meshes in a finite element (FE) analysis. Thin shell approximations (TSAs) avoid this issue by removing the need for a mesh of the thin layer while approximating the physics across the layer by an interface condition. Typically, a TSA requires the mesh of both sides of the TSA interface to be conforming. To alleviate this requirement, we propose to combine mortar methods and TSAs for solving the heat equation. The mortar TSA method's formulation is derived and enables an independent discretization of the subdomains on the two sides of the TSA depending on their accuracy requirements. The method is verified by comparison with a reference FE solution of a thermal model problem of a simplified superconducting accelerator magnet.</description>

      <title>Third Medium Finite Element Contact Formulation for Pneumatically Actuated Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mechanical metamaterials are artificially engineered microstructures that exhibit novel mechanical behavior on the macroscopic scale. Active metamaterials can be externally controlled. Pneumatically actuated metamaterials can change their mechanical, acoustic, or other types of effective behavior in response to applied pressure with possible applications ranging from soft robotic actuators to phononic crystals. To facilitate the design of such pneumatically actuated metamaterials and structures by topology optimization, a robust way of their computational modeling, capturing both pneumatic actuation of internal voids and internal contact, is needed. Since voids in topology optimization are often modeled using a soft material model, the third medium contact formulation lends itself as a suitable stepping stone. We propose a single hyperelastic material model capable of maintaining a prescribed hydrostatic Cauchy stress within a void in the pre-contact phase while simultaneously acting as a third medium to enforce frictionless contact, contrasting existing third medium approaches focused solely on contact. We split the overall third-medium energy density into contact, regularization, and pneumatic pressure contributions, all of which can be individually controlled and tuned. To prevent distortions of the compliant third medium, we include curvature penalization in our model. This improves on existing formulations in terms of compliant third medium behavior, leading ultimately to better numerical stability of the solution. Since our formulation is energetically consistent, we are able to employ more advanced finite element solvers, such as the modified Cholesky algorithm to detect instabilities. We demonstrate the behavior of the proposed formulation on several examples of traditional contact benchmarks, including a standard patch test, and validate it with experimental measurement.</description>

      <title>DAM: A Universal Dual Attention Mechanism for Multimodal Timeseries Cryptocurrency Trend Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the distributed systems landscape, Blockchain has catalyzed the rise of cryptocurrencies, merging enhanced security and decentralization with significant investment opportunities. Despite their potential, current research on cryptocurrency trend forecasting often falls short by simplistically merging sentiment data without fully considering the nuanced interplay between financial market dynamics and external sentiment influences. This paper presents a novel Dual Attention Mechanism (DAM) for forecasting cryptocurrency trends using multimodal time-series data. Our approach, which integrates critical cryptocurrency metrics with sentiment data from news and social media analyzed through CryptoBERT, addresses the inherent volatility and prediction challenges in cryptocurrency markets. By combining elements of distributed systems, natural language processing, and financial forecasting, our method outperforms conventional models like LSTM and Transformer by up to 20\% in prediction accuracy. This advancement deepens the understanding of distributed systems and has practical implications in financial markets, benefiting stakeholders in cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies. Moreover, our enhanced forecasting approach can significantly support decentralized science (DeSci) by facilitating strategic planning and the efficient adoption of blockchain technologies, improving operational efficiency and financial risk management in the rapidly evolving digital asset domain, thus ensuring optimal resource allocation.</description>

      <title>ReeSPOT: Reeb Graph Models Semantic Patterns of Normalcy in Human Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces ReeSPOT, a novel Reeb graph-based method to model patterns of life in human trajectories (akin to a fingerprint). Human behavior typically follows a pattern of normalcy in day-to-day activities. This is marked by recurring activities within specific time periods. In this paper, we model this behavior using Reeb graphs where any deviation from usual day-to-day activities is encoded as nodes in the Reeb graph. The complexity of the proposed algorithm is linear with respect to the number of time points in a given trajectory. We demonstrate the usage of ReeSPOT and how it captures the critically significant spatial and temporal deviations using the nodes of the Reeb graph. Our case study presented in this paper includes realistic human movement scenarios: visiting uncommon locations, taking odd routes at infrequent times, uncommon time visits, and uncommon stay durations. We analyze the Reeb graph to interpret the topological structure of the GPS trajectories. Potential applications of ReeSPOT include urban planning, security surveillance, and behavioral research.</description>

      <title>Data Scoping: Effectively Learning the Evolution of Generic Transport PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transport phenomena (e.g., fluid flows) are governed by time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs) describing mass, momentum, and energy conservation, and are ubiquitous in many engineering applications. However, deep learning architectures are fundamentally incompatible with the simulation of these PDEs. This paper clearly articulates and then solves this incompatibility. The local-dependency of generic transport PDEs implies that it only involves local information to predict the physical properties at a location in the next time step. However, the deep learning architecture will inevitably increase the scope of information to make such predictions as the number of layers increases, which can cause sluggish convergence and compromise generalizability. This paper aims to solve this problem by proposing a distributed data scoping method with linear time complexity to strictly limit the scope of information to predict the local properties. The numerical experiments over multiple physics show that our data scoping method significantly accelerates training convergence and improves the generalizability of benchmark models on large-scale engineering simulations. Specifically, over the geometries not included in the training data for heat transferring simulation, it can increase the accuracy of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) by 21.7 \% and that of Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) by 38.5 \% on average.</description>

      <title>GROMACS on AMD GPU-Based HPC Platforms: Using SYCL for Performance and Portability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: GROMACS is a widely-used molecular dynamics software package with a focus on performance, portability, and maintainability across a broad range of platforms. Thanks to its early algorithmic redesign and flexible heterogeneous parallelization, GROMACS has successfully harnessed GPU accelerators for more than a decade. With the diversification of accelerator platforms in HPC and no obvious choice for a multi-vendor programming model, the GROMACS project found itself at a crossroads. The performance and portability requirements, and a strong preference for a standards-based solution, motivated our choice to use SYCL on both new HPC GPU platforms: AMD and Intel. Since the GROMACS 2022 release, the SYCL backend has been the primary means to target AMD GPUs in preparation for exascale HPC architectures like LUMI and Frontier. SYCL is a cross-platform, royalty-free, C++17-based standard for programming hardware accelerators. It allows using the same code to target GPUs from all three major vendors with minimal specialization. While SYCL implementations build on native toolchains, performance of such an approach is not immediately evident. Biomolecular simulations have challenging performance characteristics: latency sensitivity, the need for strong scaling, and typical iteration times as short as hundreds of microseconds. Hence, obtaining good performance across the range of problem sizes and scaling regimes is particularly challenging. Here, we share the results of our work on readying GROMACS for AMD GPU platforms using SYCL, and demonstrate performance on Cray EX235a machines with MI250X accelerators. Our findings illustrate that portability is possible without major performance compromises. We provide a detailed analysis of node-level kernel and runtime performance with the aim of sharing best practices with the HPC community on using SYCL as a performance-portable GPU framework.</description>

      <title>Predicting the Temporal Dynamics of Prosthetic Vision</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14591v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Retinal implants are a promising treatment option for degenerative retinal disease. While numerous models have been developed to simulate the appearance of elicited visual percepts ("phosphenes"), these models often either focus solely on spatial characteristics or inadequately capture the complex temporal dynamics observed in clinical trials, which vary heavily across implant technologies, subjects, and stimulus conditions. Here we introduce two computational models designed to accurately predict phosphene fading and persistence under varying stimulus conditions, cross-validated on behavioral data reported by nine users of the Argus II Retinal Prosthesis System. Both models segment the time course of phosphene perception into discrete intervals, decomposing phosphene fading and persistence into either sinusoidal or exponential components. Our spectral model demonstrates state-of-the-art predictions of phosphene intensity over time (r = 0.7 across all participants). Overall, this study lays the groundwork for enhancing prosthetic vision by improving our understanding of phosphene temporal dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.08793v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fact-checking in financial domain is under explored, and there is a shortage of quality dataset in this domain. In this paper, we propose Fin-Fact, a benchmark dataset for multimodal fact-checking within the financial domain. Notably, it includes professional fact-checker annotations and justifications, providing expertise and credibility. With its multimodal nature encompassing both textual and visual content, Fin-Fact provides complementary information sources to enhance factuality analysis. Its primary objective is combating misinformation in finance, fostering transparency, and building trust in financial reporting and news dissemination. By offering insightful explanations, Fin-Fact empowers users, including domain experts and end-users, to understand the reasoning behind fact-checking decisions, validating claim credibility, and fostering trust in the fact-checking process. The Fin-Fact dataset, along with our experimental codes is available at https://github.com/IIT-DM/Fin-Fact/.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents an overview of scientific modeling and discusses the complementary strengths and weaknesses of ML methods for scientific modeling in comparison to process-based models. It also provides an introduction to the current state of research in the emerging field of scientific knowledge-guided machine learning (KGML) that aims to use both scientific knowledge and data in ML frameworks to achieve better generalizability, scientific consistency, and explainability of results. We discuss different facets of KGML research in terms of the type of scientific knowledge used, the form of knowledge-ML integration explored, and the method for incorporating scientific knowledge in ML. We also discuss some of the common categories of use cases in environmental sciences where KGML methods are being developed, using illustrative examples in each category.</description>
