      <title>Effective Bertini theorems and zeros of $p$-adic forms of degree 7</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish an effective Bertini-type theorem for hypersurfaces $X_f \colon f = 0$ defined over a finite field $k$ for which $f$ has no linear factors over the algebraic closure $\overline{k}$. Given a line $L$ defined over $k$ and a nonreduced $\overline{k}$-point $x$ on $X_f \cap L$, we give an upper bound on the number of planes $P$ containing $L$ for which $X_f \cap P$ contains a line through $x$. Underlying this result is a factorization algorithm for bivariate polynomials originally due to Kaltofen, which we present with slightly relaxed hypotheses. Our primary application is to Artin's conjecture on $p$-adic forms of degree 7: if $K/\mathbb{Q}_p$ is a finite extension with residue field isomorphic to $\mathbb{F}_q$ and $F(x_0, \ldots, x_n) \in K[x_0, \ldots, x_{49}]$ is a homogeneous form of degree 7, then there exists a $K$-solution to $F=0$ whenever $q&gt;679$. This improves on a result of Wooley.</description>

      <title>The Ordered Zeckendorf Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and analyze the ordered Zeckendorf game, a novel combinatorial two-player game inspired by Zeckendorf's Theorem, which guarantees a unique decomposition of every positive integer as a sum of non-consecutive Fibonacci numbers. Building on the original Zeckendorf game\ -- previously studied in the context of unordered multisets\ -- we impose a new constraint: all moves must respect the order of summands. The result is a richer and more nuanced strategic landscape that significantly alters game dynamics.
  Unlike the classical version, where Player 2 has a dominant strategy for all $n &gt; 2$, our ordered variant reveals a more balanced and unpredictable structure. In particular, we find that Player 1 wins for nearly all values $n \leq 25$, with a single exception at $n = 18$. This shift in strategic outcomes is driven by our game's key features: adjacency constraints that limit allowable merges and splits to neighboring terms, and the introduction of a switching move that reorders pairs.
  We prove that the game always terminates in the Zeckendorf decomposition\ -- now in ascending order\ -- by constructing a strictly decreasing monovariant. We further establish bounds on game complexity: the shortest possible game has length exactly $n - Z(n)$, where $Z(n)$ is the number of summands in the Zeckendorf decomposition of $n$, while the longest game exhibits quadratic growth, with $M(n) \sim \frac{n^2}{2}$ as $n \to \infty$.
  Empirical simulations suggest that random game trajectories exhibit log-normal convergence in their move distributions. Overall, the ordered Zeckendorf game enriches the landscape of number-theoretic games, posing new algorithmic challenges and offering fertile ground for future exploration into strategic complexity, probabilistic behavior, and generalizations to other recurrence relations.</description>

      <title>$p$-curvature operators and Satake-type phenomenon for $\frak{sl}_2$ KZ equations with $\kappa=\pm 2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $\frak{sl}_2$ KZ differential equations with values in the tensor power of the fundamental representation with parameter $\kappa=\pm 2$ are considered. A Satake-type correspondence is established over complex numbers and subsequently reduced to finite characteristic. This correspondence enables the study of the KZ equations on the lower weight subspaces of the tensor power in terms of the wedge powers of the weight subspace of the weight just below the highest weight.
  We apply this approach to analyze the $p$-curvature operators associated with our KZ equations, evaluate the dimension of the solution space in characteristic $p$, and determine whether all solutions are generated by the so-called $p$-hypergeometric solutions. In particular, we show that not all solutions of the KZ equations with $\kappa=2$ in characteristic $p$ are generated by $p$-hypergeometric solutions. Previously, no such examples were known.</description>

      <title>A map between arborifications of multiple zeta values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Arborified multiple zeta values are a generalization of multiple zeta values associated with rooted trees. There are two types of decorated rooted trees, corresponding respectively to the series and the integral expressions. Manchon introduces the contracting arborification (resp. the simple arborification), which is maps from the BCK Hopf algebras of the decorated rooted trees corresponding to the series expression (resp. the integral expression) to the non-commutative polynomial algebras of the set $\mathbb{N}$ (resp. the set $\{0,1\}$). There is a natural map between the two non-commutative polynomial algebras. Manchon posed the question of finding a natural map between the two BCK Hopf algebras that would make the diagram commutative. In this paper, we consider planar rooted trees and use a recursive method to construct such a map between the two BCK Hopf algebras, making the diagram commutative.</description>

      <title>Divisibility properties of weighted $k$ regular partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a generalized class of weighted $k$-regular partitions defined by \[ \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} c_{k, r_1, r_2}(n) q^n = \prod_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{(1 - q^{nk})^{r_1}}{(1 - q^n)^{r_2}}, \] which extends the classical $k$-regular partition function $b_k(n)$. We establish new infinite families of Ramanujan-type congruences, divisibility results, and positive-density prime sets for which $c_{k, r_1, r_2}(n)$ vanishes modulo a given prime. These results generalize recent work on $5$-regular partitions and reveal deeper modular and combinatorial structures underlying weighted partition functions.</description>

      <title>Weyl bound for trilinear periods via conformal bootstrap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $f_1,f_2$ be holomorphic modular forms of the same weight for a cocompact lattice $\Gamma &lt; \mathrm{PSL}_2(\mathbf{R})$. We estimate the rate of decay of the coefficients in the expansion of $f_1\overline{f_2}$ in a Laplace eigenbasis. By specializing our main theorem to the case where $\Gamma$ is arithmetic, we obtain new instances of the Weyl bound for triple product $L$-functions in the spectral aspect. Our method builds on the conformal bootstrap in physics.</description>

      <title>The lattice packing problem in dimension 9 by Voronoi's algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1908, Voronoi introduced an algorithm that solves the lattice packing problem in any dimension in finite time. Voronoi showed that any lattice with optimal packing density must be a so-called perfect lattice, and his algorithm enumerates the finitely many perfect lattices up to similarity in a fixed dimension. However, due to the high complexity of the algorithm this enumeration had, until now, only been completed up to dimension 8.
  In this work we compute all 2237251040 perfect lattices in dimension 9 via Voronoi's algorithm. As a corollary, this shows that the laminated lattice $\Lambda_9$ gives the densest lattice packing in dimension 9. Equivalently, we show that the Hermite constant $\gamma_9$ in dimension 9 equals $2$. Furthermore, we extend a result by Watson (1971) and show that the set of possible kissing numbers in dimension 9 is precisely $2 \cdot \{ 1, \ldots, 91, 99, 120, \ldots, 129, 136 \}$.</description>

      <title>An Explicit Tauberian Theorem taking Averaged Inputs with an Application to Counting Abelian Number Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a Dirichlet series $L(s) = \sum a_n n^{-s}$, the asymptotic growth rate of $\sum_{n\le X} a_n$ can be determined by a Tauberian theorem. Bounds on the error term are typically controlled by the size of $|L(\sigma+it)|$ for fixed real part $\sigma$. We modify this approach to prove new Tauberian theorems with error terms depending only on the average size of $L(\sigma+it)$ as $t$ varies, and we take care to track explicit dependence on various parameters. This often leads to stronger error bounds, and introduces strong connections between asymptotic counting problems and moments of $L$-functions.
  We provide self-contained statements of Tauberian theorems in anticipation that these results can be used ``out of the box'' to prove new asymptotic expansions. We demonstrate this by proving square root saving error bounds for the number of $C_n$-extensions of $\mathbb{Q}$ of bounded discriminant when $n=3$, $4$, $8$, $16$, or $2p$ for $p$ an odd prime.</description>

      <title>Bounds for sets of remainders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $s(n)$ be the number of different remainders $n \bmod k$, where $1 \leq k \leq \lfloor n/2 \rfloor$. This rather natural sequence is sequence A283190 in the OEIS and while some basic facts are known, it seems that surprisingly it has barely been studied. First, we prove that $s(n) = c \cdot n + O(n/(\log n \log \log n))$, where $c$ is an explicit constant. Then we focus on differences between consecutive terms $s(n)$ and $s(n+1)$. It turns out that the value can always increase by at most one, but there exist arbitrarily large decreases. We show that the differences are bounded by $O(\log \log n)$. Finally, we consider ''iterated remainder sets''. These are related to a problem arising from Pierce expansions, and we prove bounds for the size of these sets as well.</description>

Abstract: We consider the Neumann problem for the equation with the Vladimirov-Taibleson fractional differentiation operator over a non-Archimedean local field. We study weak solutions following the method by Dipierro, Ros-Oton and Valdinoci (2017).

      <title>Description of the strong approximation locus using Brauer-Manin obstruction for homogeneous spaces with commutative stabilizers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a homogeneous space $X$ over a number field $k$, the Brauer-Manin obstruction has been used to study strong approximation for $X$ away from a finite set $S$ of places, and known results state that $X(k)$ is dense in the omitting-$S$ projection of the Brauer-Manin set $\mathrm{pr}_S(X(\mathbb{A}_k)^{\mathrm{br}})$, under certain assumptions. In order to completely understand the closure of $X(k)$ in the set of $S$-adelic points $X(\mathbb{A}_k^S)$, we ask: (i) whether $\mathrm{pr}_S(X(\mathbb{A}_k)^{\mathrm{br}})$ is closed in $X(\mathbb{A}_k^S)$; (ii) whether $X(k)$ is dense in the closed subset of $X(\mathbb{A}_k^S)$ cut out by elements in $\mathrm{br}X$ which induce zero evaluation maps at all the places in $S$. We also ask these questions considering only the algebraic Brauer group. We give answers to such questions for homogeneous spaces $X$ under semisimple simply connected groups with commutative stabilizers.</description>

      <title>Cohomological nonvanishing for algebraic fundamental groups of ball quotients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Suppose $\Gamma &lt; \mathrm{PU}(n,1)$ is a cocompact arithmetic lattice of simplest type with profinite completion $\widehat{\Gamma}$. This paper proves there is an open subgroup $\widehat{\Gamma}_0 \le \widehat{\Gamma}$ such that $H^j(\widehat{\Delta}, \mathbb{F}_p)$ is nontrivial for every open subgroup ${\widehat{\Delta} \le \widehat{\Gamma}_0}$, $j \le 2n$, and sufficiently large prime $p$. If $n \ge 2$, nonvanishing is new for all $j \ge 2$. Consequently, the virtual cohomological dimension of $\widehat{\Gamma}$ is at least $2n$, improving the previous lower bound of $1$. The proof shows there is a profinite fundamental class for the associated ball quotient and that its canonical class is profinite modulo torsion. For congruence $\Gamma$ and $j &lt; \frac{n+1}{2}$, restriction ${H^j(\widehat{\Gamma}, \mathbb{F}_p) \to H^j(\Gamma, \mathbb{F}_p)}$ is shown to be almost surjective in a precise sense; this is related to whether lattices in $\mathrm{PU}(n,1)$ are good in the sense of Serre, which is only known to hold for $n=1$.</description>

      <title>The Hasse Principle for Geometric Variational Problems: An Illustration via Area-minimizing Submanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Hasse principle in number theory states that information about integral solutions to Diophantine equations can be pieced together from real solutions and solutions modulo prime powers. We show that the Hasse principle holds for area-minimizing submanifolds: information about area-minimizing submanifolds in integral homology can be fully recovered from those in real homology and mod $n$ homology for all $n\in \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 2}.$ As a consequence we derive several surprising conclusions, including: area-minimizing submanifolds in mod $n$ homology are asymptotically much smoother than expected and area-minimizing submanifolds are not generically calibrated. We conjecture that the Hasse principle holds for all geometric variational problems that can be formulated on chain space over different coeffiicients, e.g., Almgren-Pitts min-max, mean curvature flow, Song's spherical Plateau problem, minimizers of elliptic and other general functionals, etc.</description>

      <title>Sparse Equidistribution of Geometric Invariants of Real Quadratic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.05890v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Duke, Imamo\=glu, and T\'oth have recently constructed a new geometric invariant, a hyperbolic orbifold, associated to each narrow ideal class of a real quadratic field. Furthermore, they have shown that the projection of these hyperbolic orbifolds onto the modular surface $\Gamma \backslash \mathbb{H}$ equidistributes on average over a genus of the narrow class group as the fundamental discriminant $D$ of the real quadratic field tends to infinity.
  We extend this construction of hyperbolic orbifolds to allow for a level structure, akin to Heegner points and closed geodesics of level $q$. Additionally, we refine this equidistribution result in several directions. First, we investigate sparse equidistribution in the level aspect, where we prove the equidistribution of level $q$ hyperbolic orbifolds when restricted to a translate of $\Gamma \backslash \mathbb{H}$ in $\Gamma_0(q) \backslash \mathbb{H}$, which presents some new interesting features. Second, we explore sparse equidistribution in the subgroup aspect, namely equidistribution on average over small subgroups of the narrow class group. Third, we prove small scale equidistribution and give upper bounds for the discrepancy.
  Behind these refinements is a new interpretation of the Weyl sums arising in these equidistribution problems in terms of ad\`elic period integrals, which in turn are related to Rankin-Selberg $L$-functions via Waldspurger's formula. The key remaining inputs are hybrid subconvex bounds for these $L$-functions and a certain homological version of the sup-norm problem.</description>

      <title>Explicit estimates for the logarithmic derivative and the reciprocal of the Riemann zeta function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04869v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we give explicit bounds of order $\log t$ for $\sigma$ close to $1$, for two quantities: $|\zeta'(\sigma +it)/\zeta(\sigma +it)|$ and $|1/\zeta(\sigma +it)|$. We correct an error in the literature, and especially in the case of $|1/\zeta(\sigma +it)|$, also provide improvements in the constants. Using an argument involving the trigonometric polynomial, we additionally provide a slight asymptotic improvement within the classical zero-free region: $1/\zeta(\sigma +it) \ll (\log t)^{11/12}$. The same method applied to the Korobov--Vinogradov zero-free region gives a new record: the unconditional bound $1/\zeta(\sigma +it) \ll (\log t)^{2/3}(\log\log t)^{1/4}$.</description>

      <title>Cryptarithmically unique terms in integer sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21427v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A cryptarithm (or alphametic) is a mathematical puzzle in which numbers are represented with words in such a way that identical letters stand for equal digits and distinct letters for unequal digits. An alphametic puzzle is usually given in the form of an equation that needs to be solved, such as SEND + MORE = MONEY. Alternatively, here we will consider cryptarithms constrained not by an equation but by a particular subsequence of natural numbers, for example perfect squares or primes. Such a cryptarithm has a unique solution if there is exactly one term in the sequence that has the corresponding pattern of digits. We will call such terms cryptarithmically unique. Here we estimate the density of such terms in an arbitrary sequence for which the overall density of terms among integers is known. In particular, among all perfect squares below 10^12, slightly less than one half are cryptarithmically unique, their density increasing toward larger numbers. Cryptarithmically unique prime numbers, however, are initially very scarce. Combinatorial estimates suggest that their density should drop below 10^-300 for decimal lengths of approximately 1829 digits, but then it recovers and is asymptotic to unity for very large primes. Finally, we introduce and discuss primonumerophobic digit patterns that no prime number happens to have.</description>

      <title>Chebotarev's theorem for groups of order $pq$ and an uncertainty principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08600v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $p$ be a prime number and $\zeta_p$ a primitive $p$-th root of unity. Chebotarev's theorem states that every square submatrix of the $p \times p$ matrix $(\zeta_p^{ij})_{i,j=0}^{p-1}$ is non-singular. In this paper we prove the same for principal submatrices of $(\zeta_n^{ij})_{i,j=0}^{n-1}$, when $n=pr$ is the product of two distinct primes, and $p$ is a large enough prime that has order $r-1$ in $\mathbf{Z}_r^*$. As an application, an uncertainty principle for cyclic groups of order $n$ is established when $n=pr$ as described above.</description>

      <title>The Multiple Equal-Difference Structure of Cyclotomic Cosets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03516v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce the definition of equal-difference cyclotomic coset, and prove that in general any cyclotomic coset can be decomposed into a disjoint union of equal-difference subsets. Among the equal-difference decompositions of a cyclotomic coset, an important class consists of those in the form of cyclotomic decompositions, called the multiple equal-difference representations of the coset. There is an equivalent correspondence between the multiple equal-difference representations of $q$-cyclotomic cosets modulo $n$ and the irreducible factorizations of $X^{n}-1$ in binomial form over finite extension fields of $\mathbb{F}_{q}$. We give an explicit characterization of the multiple equal-difference representations of any $q$-cyclotomic coset modulo $n$, through which a criterion for $X^{n}-1$ factoring into irreducible binomials is obtained. In addition, we present an algorithm to simplify the computation of the leaders of cyclotomic cosets.</description>

Abstract: We determine the finite group $\mathcal S$ parametrizing a packet in the local Langlands correspondence for a Brylinski-Deligne covering group of an algebraic torus, under some assumption on ramification. Especially, this work generalizes Weissman's result on covering groups of tori that split over an unramified extension of the base field.</description>

      <title>Equidistribution of realizable Steinitz classes for cyclic Kummer extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12999v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\ell$ be prime, and $K$ be a number field containing the $\ell$-th roots of unity. We use classical algebraic number theory and some analytic techniques to prove that the Steinitz classes of $\mathbb Z/\ell\mathbb Z$ extensions of $K$ ordered by relative discriminant are equidistributed among realizable classes in the ideal class group of $K$. For $\ell = 2$, this was proved by Kable and Wright using the deep theory of prehomogeneous vector spaces. Foster proved that Steinitz classes are uniformly distributed between realizable classes for tamely ramified elementary-$m$ extensions using the theory of Galois modules; our approach eliminates this tameness hypothesis.</description>

Abstract: Experimental calculations suggest that the $h$-fold sumset sizes of 4-element sets of integers are concentrated at $h$ numbers that are differences of tetrahedral numbers. In this paper it is proved that these "popular" sumset sizes always exist. Explicit $h$-adically defined sets are constructed for each of these numbers.</description>

Abstract: Recently, we showed that for every irrational number $\alpha$, there exist infinitely many positive integers $n$ represented by any given positive definite binary quadratic form $Q$, satisfying $||\alpha n||&lt;n^{-(1/2-\varepsilon)}$ for any fixed but arbitrarily small $\varepsilon&gt;0$. We also provided a quantitative version with a lower bound when the exponent $1/2-\varepsilon$ is replaced by weaker exponent $\gamma&lt;3/7-\varepsilon$. In this article we recover this quantitative version with the exponent $1/2-\varepsilon$, but now for the particular case of sums of two squares.</description>

      <title>Weight-Shifting Operators of Hypergeometric Type for Maass Forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18310v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explicitly constructs a family of weight-shifting operators mapping from the space of weight-k smooth automorphic functions, A_k(Gamma), to the space of weight-t automorphic functions, A_t(Gamma). These operators are defined as integral transforms whose kernel, K, is the product of the covariant factor P given in Definition 1.2 and a function, F, which is invariant under the diagonal action of SL(2, R). The key assumption in the operator's construction is the spectral condition posited in Hypothesis 1.1, namely that the kernel K is an eigenfunction of the weight-t hyperbolic Laplacian Delta_t with respect to the first variable. This partial differential equation reduces to an ordinary differential equation for the invariant function F, which is shown to be equivalent to the Hypergeometric Differential Equation (HDE). The main result of this paper, presented in Theorem 2.1, is the explicit determination of the HDE parameters (a,b,c) as functions of the initial automorphic data (k, t, q) and the operator's spectral parameter lambda_K. This work presents an analytic methodology for the explicit construction of an intertwining operator that maps a Laplacian eigenspace to its corresponding eigenspace, demonstrating how the kernel is determined from the automorphic data via the Hypergeometric Differential Equation.</description>

      <title>Effective short intervals containing primes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18786v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 95 years ago Hoheisel proved the existence of primes in the sub-linear interval \[ \left[x, x+x^{1-{1\over 33000}}\right] \qquad \hbox{for $x$ sufficiently large}. \] This was improved by Heilbronn, proving existence of primes in the interval \[ \left[x, x+x^{1-{1\over 250}}\right] \qquad \hbox{for $x$ sufficiently large}. \] More recently Baker, Harman, Pintz proved existence of primes in the interval \[ \left[x, x+ x^{1-{19\over 40}}\right] \qquad \hbox{for $x$ sufficiently large}. \] In the present article I will, to the extent possible, make some of these statements effective. Specifically, among other things, I shall show that \[ \forall n \geq 4, \qquad\forall x \geq \exp(\exp(33)), \qquad \hbox{there are primes in the interval} \left[x, x+ x^{1-{1\over n}}\right]; \] \[ \forall n \geq 91, \qquad\forall x \geq [90^{90}]^{n/(n-90)} , \qquad \hbox{there are primes in the interval} \left[x, x+ x^{1-{1\over n}}\right]. \] Furthermore \[ \forall n \geq 106, \qquad\forall x \geq 1, \qquad \hbox{there are primes in the interval} \left[x, x+ x^{1-{1\over n}}\right]. \] In particular this last observation makes both the Hoheisel and Heilbronn results fully explicit and effective. This (relatively) specific observation can be extended and generalized in various manners.</description>

Abstract: We establish the geometric Bogomolov conjecture for semiabelian varieties over function fields. We show a closed subvariety contains Zariski dense sets of small points, if and only if, after modulo its stabilizer, it is a torsion translate of a constant variety. A new phenomenon is that a special subvariety may not have a Zariski dense set of points of height 0.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14244v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by questions on the ranges of commutators of dilated floor functions and one posed in Problem 27327 from Gazeta Matematic\u{a}, we investigate the precise ranges of certain generalized polynomials depending on a real parameter and defined via the floor function. Our analysis requires non-trivial tools, including Kronecker's approximation theorem. The results highlight sharp distinctions between irrational parameters and sub-unitary and supra-unitary rational parameters. We also propose several conjectures for the irrational and supra-unitary rational cases, supported by extensive computations in Wolfram Mathematica.</description>
