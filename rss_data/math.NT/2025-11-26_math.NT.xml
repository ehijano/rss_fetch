      <title>Some Generalizations of Totient Function with Elementary Symmetric Sums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize certain totient functions using elementary symmetric polynomials and derive explicit product forms for the totient functions involving the second elementary symmetric sum. This work follows from the work of Toth [The Ramanujan Journal, 2022] where the totient function was generalized using the first and the kth elementary symmetric polynomial. We also provide some observations on the behavior of the totient function with an arbitrary jth elementary symmetric polynomial. We then outline a method for solving a certain the restricted linear congruence problem with a greatest common divisor constraint on a quadratic form, illustrated by a concrete example. Most importantly, we demonstrate the equivalence between obtaining product forms for generalized totient functions, counting zeros of specific polynomials over finite fields, and resolving a broad class of restricted linear congruence problems .</description>

      <title>On Some Generalisations of Gauss Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce integer sequences satisfying new congruence properties inspired by the Euler and Gauss congruences, which we call Euler-Gauss sequences. Noting that every Gauss sequence is an Euler-Gauss sequence, we compare them with certain generalizations of Gauss sequences and provide several counterexamples. In particular, the important Smallest Prime Factor (SPF) and Greatest Prime Factor (GPF) sequences (suitably defined at 1) are Euler-Gauss sequences but not Gauss sequences. We further extend these congruence-based integer sequences to a q-analog setting and establish characteristic properties that reveal their structure and fill gaps in the literature on q-Gauss sequences. In recent works, q-Gauss sequences have been shown to admit interesting combinatorial interpretations and to exhibit the Cyclic Sieving Phenomenon (CSP). Not only do our q-Euler-Gauss sequences satisfy the standard CSP with some restriction, but we also derive a new CSP condition for the SPF and GPF sequences, not hitherto known in the literature.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct the five-variable $p$-adic $L$-function attached to Hida families on $\mathrm U(2,1)\times\mathrm U(1,1)$, interpolating the square-root of Rankin-Selberg $L$-values in the \emph{shifted piano} range. Our construction relies on a new theta operator and its $p$-adic variation which plays a role analogous to the classical Ramanujan-Serre theta operator in Hida's $p$-adic Rankin-Selberg method. The interpolation formula, including the modified Euler factors at $p$ and at the real place, is consistent with the conjectural shape of $p$-adic $L$-functions predicted by Coates and Perrin-Riou.</description>

      <title>Explicit Uniform Lower Bounds for the Canonical Height on Elliptic Curves over Abelian Extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish an explicit lower bound for the N\'eron-Tate height on elliptic curves with complex multiplication, for nontorsion points defined over the maximal abelian extension of a number field. Building on a strategy developed by Amoroso, David, and Zannier, we provide an alternative proof of a theorem originally due to Baker. The novelty in our approach is that it produces a lower bound that is fully explicit and independent of the discriminant of the base field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Toda prime of an integer $n$ is an odd prime $p$ such that $4n=(p-1)k$ with $k$ coprime to $p$. We conjecture that every positive integer admits at least two Toda primes. We give a partial proof that every positive integer admits at least one Toda prime. We conclude by discussing connections to denominators of Bernoulli numbers and a generalization of Sophie Germain primes.</description>

      <title>A power-saving error term in counting $C_2 \wr H$ extensions of an arbitrary base field parametrized by discriminants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Malle's conjecture for the group $C_2 \wr H$ where $H$ is a permutation group. Malle's conjecture for this case was proved by J\"urgen Kl\"uners in \cite{arXiv:1108.5597} under mild conditions for $H$. In this article, we provide an alternative method to obtain the explicit main term and a power-saving error term for $C_2 \wr H$ extensions of an arbitrary number field. Furthermore, our method allows us to relax the assumptions for $H.$</description>

      <title>Selective Integration on Higher Adeles and the Euler Characteristic of Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The space of two-dimensional geometric adeles of a surface is far from being a locally compact space and there is no translation countably additive invariant nontrivial measure on it. At the same time, certain subquotients of the adeles are direct limits of compact subquotients or inverse limits of discrete subquotients, compatible in a special way. Using this fact, the paper defines a translation invariant measure and integration on certain subquotients of the geometric adeles of surfaces. This theory is considerably different from the theory of integration on analytic adeles of surfaces. After revising aspects of one-dimensional theory, the paper includes a full definition of two-dimensional geometric adeles. A number of their new topological properties are established. The new translation invariant measure and integration on selective subquotients of the geometric adeles is used for integrals of certain functions in a two-dimensional method describing the size of adelic cohomology groups of surfaces, without using standard adelic complexes. A formula for the Euler characteristic of the surface and its divisor in terms of integrals over subquotients of geometric adeles is proved. Using the Euler characteristic, a new two-dimensional adelic intersection number is introduced. For geometric surfaces it is a positive multiple of the standard intersection number. Several results in the previous study of geometric adeles are given new proofs.</description>

      <title>Zeta Zeros on the Critical Line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Montgomery in 1973 introduced the pair correlation method to study the vertical distribution of Riemann zeta-function zeros. This work assumed the Riemann Hypothesis (RH). One striking application was a short proof that at least 2/3 of zeta-zeros are simple zeros, the first result of its type. Over the last 50 years, most work on pair correlation of zeta-zeros has continued to assume RH. Here we show that if RH could be removed from Montgomery's simple zero proof, then this would also give a proof that 2/3 of the zeros are on the critical line. While at present we cannot unconditionally obtain this result, we have proved in joint work that this is true if we assume all the zeros are in a narrow enough region centered on the critical line. In separate joint work we use the same idea with a related pair correlation method to prove that assuming the Pair Correlation Conjecture, also without the assumption of RH, we obtain 100\% of the zeros are simple and on the critical line.</description>

      <title>Solubility of a family of conics with polynomial coefficients in many variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the proportion of conics given by $(\mathcal{C}_{\mathbf{F}, \mathbf{y}}) : F_0(\mathbf{y})x_0^2 + F_1(\mathbf{y})x_1^2 = F_2( \mathbf{y})x_2^2 $ which have a rational point $\mathbf{x} = (x_0 :x_1:x_2) \in \mathbb{P}^2(\mathbb{Q})$, where $\mathbf{y} = (y_0 : \dots : y_n)\in \mathbb{P}^n(\mathbb{Q})$ and $F_0,F_1,F_2 \in \mathbb{Z}[X_0,\ldots, X_n]$ are homogeneous polynomials in many variables of the same degree $d$. We provide an asymptotic formula for the number of $\mathbf{y}$ of bounded height such that the corresponding conic $(\mathcal{C}_{\mathbf{F}, \mathbf{y}})$ has a rational point. In particular, our result agrees with the Loughran--Smeets and the Loughran--Rome--Sofos conjectures. Our strategy is based on a recent result of Destagnol--Lyczak--Sofos relying on the circle method to estimate the average of an arithmetic function over polynomials in many variables. To this end, we study the proportion of conics $t_0x_0^2 + t_1x_1^2 + t_2x_2^2 = 0$ having a rational point, and coefficients $t_0,t_1,t_2$ in arithmetic progressions.</description>

      <title>The Weyl bound for Rankin-Selberg $L$-functions with Joint Ramification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the Weyl bound for the Rankin-Selberg $L$-function in a certain joint ramification setting. To achieve this result, we employ the refined Petersson trace formula and develop a special Vorono\"i summation formula. Additionally, we obtain the sharp bound for the integral of products of Whittaker functions via the $p$-adic stationary phase method.</description>

      <title>Hearing the Serre invariant of a compact $p$-adic analytic manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a previous novel way of defining kernel functions for Laplacian integral operators on a compact $p$-adic analytic manifold $X$, one such operator $\Delta_0^s$ with $s\in\mathds{R}$ is applied to hearing the Serre invariant $i(X)$ by showing that a wavelet eigenvalue is always congruent to $i(X)$ modulo $q-1$, where $q$ is the cardinality of the residue field $k$ attached to a $p$-adic number field $K$. It is shown how the number of $k$-rational points of the special fibre of the N\'eron model of an elliptic curve defined over $K$ relates to the wavelet spectrum of $\Delta^s_0$, and this then leads to the realisation that the Serre invariant $i(E(X))$ in the case of an elliptic curve $E$ with split multiplicative reduction vanishes modulo $q-1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sufficient conditions for a simple graph to be characterized up to isomorphism given its spectrum and the spectrum of its complement graph are known due to Wang and Xu. This note establishes a related sufficient condition in the presence of loops: if the walk matrix has square-free determinant, then the graph is characterized by its generalized spectrum. The proof includes a general result about symmetric integral matrices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The crank-mex theorem states that the number of integer partitions of $n$ with nonnegative crank equals the number with odd minimal excludant (mex). Andrews and M. Newman recently refined that result in terms of the number of parts greater than one. Here, we establish and expand a complementary result connecting the partitions with even mex, having fixed points, with negative crank, and with positive crank, all refined in terms of number of parts greater than one. We provide both analytic and combinatorial proofs.</description>

Abstract: We determine the Hodge endomorphism algebras of non-projective complex K3 surfaces (and more generally, hyperk\"ahler manifolds). We show that they are either totally real fields or number fields generated by Salem numbers. This is unlike the projective case, where the endomorphism fields are either totally real or CM. We also develop precise existence criteria and explore the relations to number theory and dynamics.</description>

      <title>On lattices over Fermat function fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Function field lattices are an interesting example of algebraically constructed lattices. Their minimum distance is bounded below by a function of the gonality of the underlying function field. Known explicit examples--coming mostly from elliptic and Hermitian curves--typically meet this lower bound. In this paper, we construct, for every integer $n \geqslant 4$, a new family of lattices arising from the Fermat function field $F_n$ and the set of its $3n$ total inflection points. These lattices have rank $3n-1$, and we show that their minimum distance equals $\sqrt{2n}$, thereby exceeding the classical bound $\sqrt{2\gamma(F_n)} = \sqrt{2(n-1)}$. We also determine their kissing number, which turns out to be independent of $n$, and analyze the structure of the second shortest vectors. Our results provide the first explicit examples of function field lattices of arbitrarily large rank whose minimum distance surpasses the expected bound, offering new geometric features of potential interest for coding-theoretic and cryptographic applications.</description>

Abstract: Serre's uniformity question asks whether there exists a bound $N&gt;0$ such that, for every non-CM elliptic curve $E$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ and every prime $p&gt;N$, the residual Galois representation $\rho_{E,p}:\operatorname{Gal}(\overline{\mathbb{Q}}/\mathbb{Q}) \to \operatorname{Aut}(E[p])$ is surjective. The work of many authors has shown that, for $p&gt;37$, this representation is either surjective or has image contained in the normaliser of a non-split Cartan subgroup $C_{ns}^+(p)$. Zywina has further proved that, whenever $\rho_{E,p}$ is not surjective for $p&gt;37$, its image is either $C_{ns}^+(p)$ or a certain subgroup $G(p)$ of $C_{ns}^+(p)$ of index $3$. Recently, Le Fourn and Lemos showed that the index-$3$ case cannot arise for $p&gt;1.4 \cdot 10^7$. We strengthen this result by proving that the image of $\rho_{E, p}$ is not conjugate to $G(p)$ for any prime larger than $5$.</description>

      <title>Real convergence and periodicity of $p$-adic continued fractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09215v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Continued fractions have been generalized over the field of $p$-adic numbers, where it is still not known an analogue of the famous Lagrange's Theorem. In general, the periodicity of $p$-adic continued fractions is well studied and addressed as a hard problem. In this paper, we show a strong connection between periodic $p$--adic continued fractions and the convergence to real quadratic irrationals. In particular, in the first part we prove that the convergence in $\mathbb{R}$ is a necessary condition for the periodicity of the continued fractions of a quadratic irrational in $\mathbb{Q}_p$. Moreover, we leave several conjectures on the converse, supported by experimental computations. In the second part of the paper, we exploit these results to develop a probabilistic argument for the non-periodicity of Browkin's $p$-adic continued fractions. The probabilistic results are conditioned under the assumption of uniform distribution of the $p$-adic digits of a quadratic irrational, that holds for almost all $p$-adic numbers.</description>

      <title>The asymptotic distribution of Elkies primes for reductions of abelian varieties is Gaussian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18171v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We generalize the notion of Elkies primes for elliptic curves to the setting of abelian varieties with real multiplication (RM), and prove the following. Let $A$ be an abelian variety with RM over a number field whose attached Galois representation has large image. Then the number of Elkies primes (in a suitable range) for reductions of $A$ modulo primes converges weakly to a Gaussian distribution around its expected value. This refines and generalizes results obtained by Shparlinski and Sutherland in the case of non-CM elliptic curves, and has implications for the complexity of the SEA point counting algorithm for abelian surfaces over finite fields.</description>

      <title>Multiplicative irreducibility of small perturbations of the set of shifted $k$-th powers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16620v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by a conjecture of Erd\H{o}s on the additive irreducibility of small perturbations of the set of squares, recently Hajdu and S\'{a}rk\"{o}zy studied a multiplicative analogue of the conjecture for shifted $k$-th powers. They conjectured that for each $k\geq 2$, if one changes $o(X^{1/k})$ elements of $M_k'=\{x^k+1: x \in \mathbb{N}\}$ up to $X$, then the resulting set cannot be written as a product set $AB$ nontrivially. In this paper, we confirm a more general version of their conjecture for $k\geq 3$.</description>

Abstract: In the context of Berglund-Huebsch mirror symmetry, we compute the eigenvalues of the Frobenius endomorphism acting on a p-adic version of Borisov's complex.

      <title>Arithmetic compactifications of integral models of Shimura varieties of abelian type</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09135v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct good toroidal and minimal compactifications in the sense of Lan-Stroh for integral models of abelian-type Shimura varieties. We start with finding suitable types of cusp labels and cone decompositions which are compatible with those of the associated Hodge-type Shimura varieties. We then study the action of $\mathbb{Q}$-points of the adjoint group on boundary charts and toroidal compactifications of Hodge-type integral models. In particular, we extend the twisting construction of Kisin and Pappas to boundary charts. Finally, up to taking refinements of cone decompositions, we construct an abelian-type toroidal compactification as an open and closed algebraic subspace of a quotient from a disjoint union of Hodge-type toroidal compactifications and construct minimal compactifications with a similar method. Furthermore, we show results on nearby cycles of these compactifications and verify Pink's formula when the level at $p$ is an intersection of $n$ quasi-parahoric subgroups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22382v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe an algorithm to numerically evaluate Riemann theta functions in any dimension in quasi-linear time in terms of the required precision, uniformly on reduced input. This algorithm is implemented in the FLINT number theory library and vastly outperforms existing software. As an application, we evaluate the theta constants attached to certain special abelian varieties of dimension 6 to construct explicit polynomials of degree 65 over $\mathbb{Q}$ with conjectural Galois group $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{F}_{64})$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16138v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a polynomial $f(x) = \sum_{i=0}^n a_i x^i$, we study the double discriminant $DD_{n,k} = \operatorname{disc}_{a_k} \operatorname{disc}_x f(x)$. This object has been well studied in algebraic geometry, but has been brought to recent prominence in number theory by its key role in the proof of the Bhargava--van der Waerden theorem. We bridge the knowledge gap for this object by proving an explicit factorization: $DD_{n,k}$ is the product of a square, a cube, and possibly a linear monomial. Our proof is entirely algebraic. We also investigate other aspects of this factorization.</description>

      <title>Arithmetic Sparsity and Obstructions in Weighted Projective Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02319v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the distribution of rational and algebraic points of bounded weighted height in weighted projective spaces over number fields. For a weighted projective space with weights q over a number field k of degree m, we derive an asymptotic formula for the count of such points, featuring a leading term D times X raised to m e Q, plus an error term, where e is the extension degree and Q is the sum of the weights. The constant D combines geometric aspects of the weights with an arithmetic obstruction given by the reciprocal of the gcd of the least common multiple of the weights and Euler's totient of m e. This obstruction stems from the non-surjectivity of the natural morphism from the weighted space to ordinary projective space on rational points, linked to nontrivial torsors under groups of roots of unity. We provide a cohomological interpretation, analogous to the Brauer-Manin obstruction. These findings refine a weighted version of the Batyrev-Manin conjecture and open avenues for applications in moduli theory and arithmetic geometry.</description>

Abstract: A class number formula is proved for extended ring class fields $L_{\mathcal{O},9}$ over imaginary quadratic fields $K_d = \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-d})$, in which the prime $p = 3$ splits, by determining the fields generated by the periodic points of a well-chosen algebraic function. The number of periodic points of a given period $n \ge 2$ for this algebraic function equals six times the sum of class numbers of imaginary quadratic orders $\textsf{R}_{-d}$, for which the Artin symbol for a prime ideal divisor $\wp_3$ in $K_d$ of $3$ has order $n$ in the Galois group of $F_d/K_d$, where $F_d$ is the inertia field of $\wp_3$ in $L_{\mathcal{O},9}/K_d$.</description>

      <title>Parametric Algorithms for the 5-Modular Analog of ES (Sierpi\'nski): Structure of Solutions, Parameterization, and Constructive Proofs (SERP)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17716v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of representing the fraction $5/P$ as a sum of three distinct unit fractions $1/A+1/B+1/C$ with $A&lt;B&lt;C$ and $A,B,C\in\mathbb{N}$. The case of primes $P\equiv 1 \pmod{5}$ is analyzed, where two constructive types of solutions arise: ED1 (exactly one denominator divisible by $P$, namely $C=cP$) and ED2 (exactly two denominators divisible by $P$, namely $B=bP$ and $C=cP$). Parametric constructions and enumeration algorithms are developed, including explicit transitions between ED1 and ED2.
  A deterministic algorithm is proposed, based on the intersection of a parametric lattice defined by pairs $(\alpha,d')$ with bounded boxes. For each fixed prime $P\equiv 1 \pmod{5}$ the algorithm constructively produces a solution. Using analytic methods such as the Bombieri--Vinogradov theorem and the Chebotarev density theorem, it is shown that the density of admissible parameters is high, which yields polylogarithmic search complexity in the average case. A strict complexity guarantee for all primes remains conditional and depends on the finite covering hypothesis.
  This study extends previous work for coefficient $4$ (the Erd\H{o}s--Straus conjecture) to coefficient $5$, transferring the same structure of parametrization and constructive solutions. Analytic applications provide averaging tools used for density estimates in parametric boxes.</description>
