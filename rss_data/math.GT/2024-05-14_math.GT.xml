      <title>On kernels of homological representations of mapping class groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the kernels of representations of mapping class groups of surfaces on twisted homologies of configuration spaces. We relate them with the kernel of a natural twisted intersection pairing: if the latter kernel is trivial then the representation is faithful. As a main example, we study the representations $\rho_{n}$ of $\mathrm{Mod}(\Sigma_{g,1})$ based on a Heisenberg local system on the $n$ points configuration space of $\Sigma_{g,1}$, introduced by Blanchet--Palmer--Shaukat, and some of their specializations. In the one point configuration case, or when the Heisenberg group is quotiented by an element of its center, we find kernel elements in the twisted intersection form. On the other hand, for $n&gt;2$ configuration points and the full Heisenberg local system, we identify subrepresentations of subgroups of $\mathrm{Mod}(\Sigma_{g,1})$ with Lawrence representations. In particular, we find one of these subgroups, which is isomorphic to a pure braid group on $g$ strands, on which the representations $\rho_n$ are faithful.</description>

      <title>Kirby-Thompson invariants of distant sums of standard surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blair, Campisi, Taylor, and Tomova defined the L-invariant L(F) of a knotted surface F, using pants complexes of trisection surfaces of bridge trisections of F. After that, Aranda, Pongtanapaisan, and Zhang introduced the L*-invariant L*(F) using dual curve complexes instead of pants complexes. In this paper, we determine both of L-invariant and L*-invariant of any finite distant sum of standard surfaces, and this is the first example of knotted surfaces whose bridge numbers and these invariants can be arbitrary large.</description>

      <title>Lie Superalgebra generalizations of the Jaeger-Kauffman-Saleur Invariant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jaeger-Kauffman-Saleur (JKS) identified the Alexander polynomial with the $U_q(\mathfrak{gl}(1|1))$ quantum invariant of classical links and extended this to a 2-variable invariant of links in thickened surfaces. Here we generalize this story for every Lie superalgebra of type $\mathfrak{gl}(m|n)$. Following Reshetikhin and Turaev, we first define a virtual $U_q(\mathfrak{gl}(m|n))$ functor for virtual tangles. When $m=n=1$, this recovers the Alexander polynomial of almost classical knots, as defined by Boden-Gaudreau-Harper-Nicas-White. Next, an extended $U_q(\mathfrak{gl}(m|n))$ functor of virtual tangles is obtained by applying the Bar-Natan $Zh$-construction. This is equivalent to the 2-variable JKS-invariant when $m=n=1$, but otherwise our invariants are new whenever $n&gt;0$. In contrast with the classical case, the virtual and extended $U_q(\mathfrak{gl}(m|n))$ functors are not entirely determined by the difference $m-n$. For example, the invariants from $U_q(\mathfrak{gl}(2|0))$ (i.e. the classical Jones polynomial) and $U_q(\mathfrak{gl}(3|1))$ are distinct, as are the extended invariants from $U_q(\mathfrak{gl}(1|1))$ and $U_q(\mathfrak{gl}(2|2))$.
  The JKS-invariant was previously shown to be a slice obstruction for virtual links. We present computational evidence that each extended $U_q(\mathfrak{gl}(m|m))$ polynomial is also virtual slice obstructions. Assuming this conjecture holds for just $m=2$, it follows that the virtual knots 6.31445 and 6.62002 are not slice. Both these knots have trivial JKS-invariant, trivial graded genus, trivial Rasmussen invariant, and vanishing extended Milnor invariants up to high order, and hence, no other slice obstructions have previously been found.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct an infinite family of non-positive open books with once-punctured torus pages that support Stein-fillable contact structures. Combined with a result of Wendl, this allows us to give a complete answer to a long-standing question about the mapping class group of a compact surface with boundary: namely, we conclude that the monoid of monodromies supporting Stein-fillable contact structures is equal to the monoid of positive monodromies if and only if the surface is planar.</description>

      <title>The Casson-Sullivan invariant for homeomorphisms of 4-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the realisability of the Casson-Sullivan invariant for homeomorphisms of smooth $4$-manifolds, which is the obstruction to a homeomorphism being stably pseudo-isotopic to a diffeomorphism, valued in the third cohomology of the source manifold with $\mathbb{Z}/2$-coefficients. We prove that for all orientable pairs of homeomorphic, smooth $4$-manifolds this invariant can be realised fully after stabilising with a single $S^2\times S^2$. As an application, we obtain that topologically isotopic surfaces in a smooth, simply-connected $4$-manifold become smoothly isotopic after sufficient external stabilisations. We further demonstrate cases where this invariant can be realised fully without stabilisation for self-homeomorphisms, which includes for manifolds with finite cyclic fundamental group. This method allows us to produce many examples of homeomorphisms which are not stably pseudo-isotopic to any diffeomorphism but are homotopic to the identity. Finally, we reinterpret these results in terms of finding examples of smooth structures on $4$-manifolds which are diffeomorphic but not stably pseudo-isotopic.</description>

Abstract: We reconstruct a quantum group associated with any Lie algebra together with its representation theory from twisted homologies of generalized configuration spaces of disks. Along the way it brings new combinatorics to the theory, but our diagrams represent true submanifolds of configuration spaces and combinatorial relations between them translate actual twisted homological relations.</description>

      <title>Why Decussate? Topological Constraints on 3D Wiring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many vertebrate motor and sensory systems decussate, or cross the midline to the opposite side of the body. The successful crossing of millions of axons during development requires a complex of tightly controlled regulatory processes. Because these processes have evolved in many distinct systems and organisms, it seems reasonable to presume that decussation confers a significant functional advantage. Yet if this is so, the nature of this advantage is not understood. In this article, we examine constraints imposed by topology on the ways that a three-dimensional processor and environment can be wired together in a continuous, somatotopic, way. We show that as the number of wiring connections grows, decussated arrangements become overwhelmingly more robust against wiring errors than seemingly simpler same-sided wiring schemes. These results provide a predictive approach for understanding how 3D networks must be wired if they are to be robust, and therefore have implications both for future large-scale computational networks and for complex bio-medical devices</description>

      <title>An Algorithmic Classification of Generalized Pseudo-Anosov Homeomorphisms via Geometric Markov Partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This thesis provides a classification of generalized pseudo-Anosov homeomorphisms up to topological conjugacy using an algorithmic approach. A Markov partition of a generalized pseudo-Anosov homeomorphism is a decomposition of the surface into a finite number of rectangles with disjoint interiors, such that their images intersect with any other rectangle in the Markov partition along a finite number of horizontal sub-rectangles. Every generalized pseudo-Anosov homeomorphism has a Markov partition, and, by using the surface's orientation, we can endow any Markov partition with a geometrization. The geometric type of a geometric Markov partition was defined by Bonatti and Langevin in their book, "Diffeomorphismes de Smale des surfaces", to classify saddle-type basic pieces for structurally stable diffeomorphisms on surfaces. A geometric type is an abstract combinatorial object that generalizes the incidence matrix of a Markov partition. It takes into account not only the number of times the image of a rectangle intersects with any other rectangle in the family but also the order and change of orientation induced by the homeomorphisms. This thesis employs the geometric type of a geometric Markov partition to classify conjugacy classes of pseudo-Anosov homeomorphisms. The classification is provided by the three main results in this manuscript: I) The geometric type is a complete invariant of conjugation. II) A criterion is provided for determining whether an abstract geometric type is realized by a geometric Markov partition of a pseudo-Anosov homeomorphism. III) An algorithm is described for determining whether two geometric types in the pseudo-Anosov class are realized by generalized pseudo-Anosov homeomorphisms that are topologically conjugated or not.</description>

      <title>The smooth Mordell-Weil group and mapping class groups of elliptic surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15960v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This is a paper in smooth $4$-manifold topology, inspired by the Mordell-Weil Theorem in number theory. More precisely, we prove a smooth version of the Mordell-Weil Theorem and apply it to the `unipotent radical' case of a Thurston-type classification of mapping classes of simply-connected $4$-manifolds $M_d$ that admit the structure of an elliptic complex surface of arithmetic genus $d\geq 1$. Applications include Nielsen realization theorems for $M_d$.
  By combining this with known results, we obtain the following remarkable consequence: if the singular fibers of such an elliptic fibration are of the simplest (i.e.\ nodal) type, then the fibered structure is unique up topological isotopy. In particular, any diffeomorphism of $M_d,d\geq 3$ is topologically isotopic to a diffeomorphism taking fibers to fibers.</description>

Abstract: Determining the structure of the Kauffman bracket skein module of all $3$-manifolds over the ring of Laurent polynomials $\mathbb Z[A^{\pm 1}]$ is a big open problem in skein theory. Very little is known about the skein module of non-prime manifolds over this ring. In this paper, we compute the Kauffman bracket skein module of the $3$-manifold $(S^1 \times S^2) \ \# \ (S^1 \times S^2)$ over the ring $\mathbb Z[A^{\pm 1}]$. We do this by analysing the submodule of handle sliding relations, for which we provide a suitable basis. Along the way we also compute the Kauffman bracket skein module of $(S^1 \times S^2) \ \# \ (S^1 \times D^2)$.</description>

      <title>Simplicity of the contactomorphism group of finite regularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18261v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a given coorientable contact manifold $(M^{2n+1},\xi)$, we consider the group $ \operatorname{Cont}_c^{(r,\delta)}(M,\alpha)$ consisting of $C^{r,\delta}$ contactomorphisms with compact support which is equipped with $C^{r,\delta}$-topology of H\"older regularity $(r,\delta)$ for $r \geq 1$ and $0 &lt;\delta \leq 1$. We prove that for all H\"older class exponents with $r &gt; n + 2$ or $r = n+1, \, \frac12 &lt; \delta \leq 1$ (resp. $r &lt; n+1$ or $r = n+1$ and $ 0&lt; \delta &lt;\frac12$), the group is a perfect (and so a simple) group. In particular, $\operatorname{Cont}_c^r(M,\xi)$ is simple for all integer $r \geq 1$. For the case of $\operatorname{Cont}_c^{(r,\delta)}(M,\alpha)$ of general H\"older regularity, we prove the simplicity for all pairs $(r,\delta)$ leaving only the case of $(r,\delta) = (n+1,\frac12)$ open.</description>
