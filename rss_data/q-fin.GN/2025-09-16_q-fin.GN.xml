      <title>Attribution Locus and the Timeliness of Long-lived Asset Write-downs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the relative timeliness with which write-downs of long-lived assets incorporate adverse macroeconomic and industry outcomes versus adverse firm-specific outcomes. We posit that users of financial reports are more likely to attribute adverse firm-specific outcomes to suboptimal managerial actions, which provide managers with more incentive to delay write downs. We provide evidence that, controlling for other incentives to manage earnings, firms record write-downs in the current year that are driven by adverse macroeconomic and industry outcomes during both the current year and the next year, but they record write-downs driven by adverse firm-specific outcomes only in the current year.</description>

      <title>Joint Liability Model with Adaptation to Climate Change</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13818v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper extends the application of ESG score assessment methodologies from large corporations to individual farmers' production, within the context of climate change. Our proposal involves the integration of crucial agricultural sustainability variables into conventional personal credit evaluation frameworks, culminating in the formulation of a holistic sustainable credit rating referred to as the Environmental, Social, Economics (ESE) score. This ESE score is integrated into theoretical joint liability models, to gain valuable insights into optimal group sizes and individual-ESE score relationships. Additionally, we adopt a mean-variance utility function for farmers to effectively capture the risk associated with anticipated profits. Through a set of simulation exercises, the paper investigates the implications of incorporating ESE scores into credit evaluation systems, offering a nuanced comprehension of the repercussions under various climatic conditions.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Large Language Models to Democratize Access to Costly Datasets for Academic Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02065v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unequal access to costly datasets essential for empirical research has long hindered researchers from disadvantaged institutions, limiting their ability to contribute to their fields and advance their careers. Recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) have the potential to democratize data access by automating data collection from unstructured sources. We develop and evaluate a novel methodology using GPT-4o-mini within a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework to collect data from corporate disclosures. Our approach achieves human-level accuracy in collecting CEO pay ratios from approximately 10,000 proxy statements and Critical Audit Matters (CAMs) from more than 12,000 10-K filings, with LLM processing times of 9 and 40 minutes respectively, each at a cost under US $10. This stands in stark contrast to the hundreds of hours needed for manual collection or the thousands of dollars required for commercial database subscriptions. To foster a more inclusive research community by empowering researchers with limited resources to explore new avenues of inquiry, we share our methodology and the resulting datasets.</description>

      <title>Assessing Consistency and Reproducibility in the Outputs of Large Language Models: Evidence Across Diverse Finance and Accounting Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16974v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study provides the first comprehensive assessment of consistency and reproducibility in Large Language Model (LLM) outputs in finance and accounting research. We evaluate how consistently LLMs produce outputs given identical inputs through extensive experimentation with 50 independent runs across five common tasks: classification, sentiment analysis, summarization, text generation, and prediction. Using three OpenAI models (GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4o-mini, and GPT-4o), we generate over 3.4 million outputs from diverse financial source texts and data, covering MD&amp;As, FOMC statements, finance news articles, earnings call transcripts, and financial statements. Our findings reveal substantial but task-dependent consistency, with binary classification and sentiment analysis achieving near-perfect reproducibility, while complex tasks show greater variability. More advanced models do not consistently demonstrate better consistency and reproducibility, with task-specific patterns emerging. LLMs significantly outperform expert human annotators in consistency and maintain high agreement even where human experts significantly disagree. We further find that simple aggregation strategies across 3-5 runs dramatically improve consistency. We also find that aggregation may come with an additional benefit of improved accuracy for sentiment analysis when using newer models. Simulation analysis reveals that despite measurable inconsistency in LLM outputs, downstream statistical inferences remain remarkably robust. These findings address concerns about what we term "G-hacking," the selective reporting of favorable outcomes from multiple generative AI runs, by demonstrating that such risks are relatively low for finance and accounting tasks.</description>
