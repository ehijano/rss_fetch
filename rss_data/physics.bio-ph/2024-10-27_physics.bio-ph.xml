      <title>Self-organized homogenization of flow networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From the vasculature of animals to the porous media making up batteries, transport by fluid flow within complex networks is crucial to service all cells or media with resources. Yet, living flow networks have a key advantage over porous media: they are adaptive and can self-organize their geometry to achieve a homogeneous perfusion throughout the network. Here, we show that, through erosion, artificial flow networks self-organize to a geometry where perfusion is more homogeneous. Flowing a pulse of cleaving enzyme through a network patterned into an erodible hydrogel, with initial channels disparate in width, we observe a homogenization in channel resistances. Experimental observations are matched with numerical simulations of the diffusion-advection-sorption dynamics of an eroding enzyme within a network. Analyzing transport dynamics theoretically, we show that homogenization only occurs if the pulse of eroding enzyme lasts longer than the time it takes any channel to equilibrate to the pulse concentration. The equilibration time scale derived analytically is in agreement with simulations. Lastly, we show both numerically and experimentally that erosion leads to homogenization of complex networks containing loops. Erosion being an omnipresent reaction, our results pave the way for a very versatile self-organized increase in the performance of porous media.</description>

      <title>A potpourri of results on molecular communication with active transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular communication (MC) is a model of information transmission where the signal is transmitted by information-carrying molecules through their physical transport from a transmitter to a receiver through a communication channel. Prior efforts have identified suitable "information molecules" whose efficacy for signal transmission has been studied extensively in diffusive channels (DC). Although easy to implement, DCs are inefficient for distances longer than tens of nanometers. In contrast, molecular motor-driven nonequilibrium or active transport can drastically increase the range of communication and may permit efficient communication up to tens of micrometers. In this paper, we investigate how active transport influences the efficacy of molecular communication, quantified by the mutual information between transmitted and received signals. We consider two specific scenarios: (a) active transport through relays and (b) active transport through a mixture of active and diffusing particles. In each case, we discuss the efficacy of the communication channel and discuss their potential pitfalls.</description>

      <title>Binding memory of liquid molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the binding dynamics of liquid molecules is of fundamental importance in physical and life sciences. However, nanoscale fast dynamics pose great challenges for experimental characterization. Conventionally, the binding dynamics have been assumed to be memoryless. Here, we integrate large scale computer simulation, scaling theory, and real-time single particle tracking microscopy with high spatiotemporal precision to unveil a universal memory effect in the binding dynamics of liquid molecules. This binding memory can be quantified by a binding time autocorrelation function, whose power-law decay depends not only on the binding affinity, but also on the topological and materials properties of the surrounding environment. Context-dependent biomolecular binding memory is likely exploited by biological systems to regulate biochemical reactions and biophysical processes. Deciphering this binding memory offers a novel strategy to probe complex biological systems and advanced soft materials.</description>
