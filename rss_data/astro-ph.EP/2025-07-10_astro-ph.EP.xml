      <title>The Possibility of Hydrogen-Water Demixing in Uranus, Neptune, K2-18b and TOI-270d</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The internal structures of Uranus and Neptune remain unknown. In addition, sub-Neptunes are now thought to be the most common type of exoplanets. Understanding the physical processes that govern the interiors of such planets is therefore essential. Phase separation between hydrogen and water may occur in cold, water-rich intermediate-mass planets. We assess whether it could occur in Uranus, Neptune, K2-18\,b and TOI-270\,d, and investigate its effect on the planetary evolution and inferred internal structure. We couple planetary evolution models with recent \textit{ab initio} calculations of the hydrogen-water phase diagram, allowing for temperature shifts to account for uncertainties in miscibility gaps. We find that demixing may occur and could lead to a complete depletion of water in the outermost regions of Uranus and Neptune. Temperature offsets of up to 1100~K lead to a depleted region comprising as much as 16\% of the planet's mass, and an increase in planetary radius by nearly 20\%. For K2-18\,b, our models suggest that hydrogen-water demixing is ongoing and may explain the absence of water features in its JWST spectrum. A temperature offset of 500~K is required to get a complete depletion of water in the atmosphere of K2-18\,b. TOI-270\,d may also have experienced hydrogen-water demixing. When applying a similar temperature offset on the phase diagram as for K2-18\,b, we find a partial depletion of water in the atmosphere of TOI-270\,d, consistent with JWST's detection of water. Hydrogen-water immiscibility may play a key role in shaping the structure and evolution of both Solar System giant planets like Uranus and Neptune, and cold/temperate exoplanets such as K2-18\,b and TOI-270\,d. Accounting for such internal processes is crucial to accurately interpret atmospheric observations from current (e.g., JWST) and upcoming (e.g., ARIEL) missions.</description>

      <title>Bouncing Grains Keep Protoplanetary Disks Bright</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proto-planetary disks display the so-called size-luminosity relation, where their mm-wavelength fluxes scale linearly with their emitting areas. This suggests that these disks are optically thick in mm-band, an interpretation further supported by their near-black-body spectral indexes. Such characteristics are seen not only among disks in very young star-forming regions like Lupus (1-3 Myrs), but, as we demonstrate here, also among disks in the much older Upper Scorpius region (5-11 Myrs). How can disks shine brightly for so long, when grain growth and subsequent radial drift should have quickly depleted their solid reservoir? Here, we suggest that the "bouncing barrier" provides the answer. Even colliding at very low speeds (below 1cm/s), grains already fail to stick to each other but instead bounce off in-elastically. This barrier stalls grain growth at a near-universal size of $\sim 100 \mu m$. These small grains experience much reduced radial drift, and so are able to keep the disks bright for millions of years. They are also tightly coupled to gas, offering poor prospects for processes like streaming instability or pebble accretion. We speculate briefly on how planetesimals can arise in such a bath of 100-micron grains.</description>

      <title>Confirmation of a non-transiting planet in the habitable zone of the nearby M dwarf L 98-59</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Only 40 exoplanetary systems with five or more planets are currently known. These systems are crucial for our understanding of planet formation and planet-planet interaction. The M dwarf L 98-59 has previously been found to show evidence of five planets, three of which are transiting. Our aim is to confirm the fifth planet in this system and to refine the system characteristics namely minimum masses, radii and the orbital parameters of the planets around L 98-59. We reanalysed RV and activity data from HARPS and ESPRESSO alongside TESS and HST transit data using a joint model. The parameter space was sampled using the dynesty nested sampler. We confirm the previously known fifth planet in the system's habitable zone with an orbital period of $23.07\pm0.08\,d$, a minimum mass of $3.0\pm0.5\,M_{\oplus}$ and an effective temperature of 289 K. We find an additional planet candidate in the RV data with an orbital period of $1.7361^{+0.0007}_{-0.0008}\,d$ and a minimum mass of $0.58\pm0.12\,M_{\oplus}$. This candidate (L 98-59.06) has a statistical significance between $2.9\sigma$ and $4.2\sigma$, details depending on the modelling of stellar variability. Moreover, we present evidence for a stellar rotation period of $76\pm4\,d$.</description>

      <title>Planet-disc interactions around eccentric binaries and misaligned ring formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the evolution of a giant planet that interacts with a circumbinary disc that orbits a misaligned binary by means of analytic models and hydrodynamical simulations. Planet-disc interactions lead to mutual tilt oscillations between the planet and the disc. Even if circumbinary gas discs form with an isotropic mutual misalignment to the binary, planet-disc interactions can cause giant planets to evolve towards coplanar or polar alignment. For a low-mass disc, the binary dominates the dynamical evolution of the planet leading to a wide range of circumbinary planet inclinations. For a high-mass disc, the disc dominates the dynamical evolution of the planet and planet inclinations move towards coplanar or polar alignment to the binary orbit, depending upon the initial disc inclination and the binary eccentricity. In addition, for a high-mass disc ($\sim 50\, M_{\rm p}$) and a high initial disc inclination, the planet can undergo Kozai-Lidov oscillations that can result in the planet being ejected from the system. For initially highly misaligned systems, the non-coplanarity of the planet and the disc can lead to long-lived inner misaligned disc rings that can become highly eccentric.</description>

      <title>TNO colours provide new evidence for a past close flyby of another star to the Solar System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thousands of small bodies, known as trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs), orbit the Sun beyond Neptune. TNOs are remnants of the planets' formation from a disc of gas and dust, so it is puzzling that they move mostly on eccentric orbits inclined to the planetary plane and show a complex red-to-grey colour distribution. A close stellar flyby can account for the TNOs' dynamics, but it is unclear if this can also explain the correlation between their colours and orbital characteristics. Assuming an initial red-to-grey colour gradient in the disc, our numerical study finds that the spiral arms induced by the stellar flyby simultaneously lead to the observed TNOs' colour patterns and orbital dynamics. The combined explanation of these TNO properties strengthens the evidence for a close flyby of another star to the young Solar System. Our study predicts that (1) small TNOs beyond 60 au will mostly be grey, and (2) retrograde TNOs will lack the colour most common to high-inclination TNOs. The anticipated TNO discoveries by the Vera Rubin telescope will be able to test these predictions. A confirmed flyby would allow us to reveal the chemical composition of the Solar System's primordial disc.</description>

      <title>Differentiable Stellar Atmospheres with Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Kurucz-a1, a physics-informed neural network (PINN) that emulates 1D stellar atmosphere models under Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), addressing a critical bottleneck in differentiable stellar spectroscopy. By incorporating hydrostatic equilibrium as a physical constraint during training, Kurucz-a1 creates a differentiable atmospheric structure solver that maintains physical consistency while achieving computational efficiency. Kurucz-a1 can achieve superior hydrostatic equilibrium and more consistent with the solar observed spectra compared to ATLAS-12 itself, demonstrating the advantages of modern optimization techniques. Combined with modern differentiable radiative transfer codes, this approach enables data-driven optimization of universal physical parameters across diverse stellar populations-a capability essential for next-generation stellar astrophysics.</description>

      <title>Linear and Regular Kepler-Manev Dynamics via Projective Transformations: A Geometric Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a geometric formulation for transforming nonconservative mechanical Hamiltonian systems and introduces a new method for regularizing and linearizing central force dynamics -- in particular, Kepler and Manev dynamics -- through a projective transformation. The transformation is formulated as a configuration space diffeomorphism (rather than a submersion) that is lifted to a cotangent bundle (phase space) symplectomorphism and used to pullback the original mechanical Hamiltonian system, Riemannian kinetic energy metric, and other key geometric objects. Full linearization of both Kepler and Manev dynamics (in any finite dimension) is achieved by a subsequent conformal scaling of the projectively-transformed Hamiltonian vector field. Two such conformal scalings are given, both achieving linearization. Arbitrary conservative and nonconservative perturbations are included, with closed-form solutions readily obtained in the unperturbed Kepler or Manev cases.</description>

      <title>A Fast, Second-Order Accurate Poisson Solver in Spherical Polar Coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an efficient and accurate algorithm for solving the Poisson equation in spherical polar coordinates with a logarithmic radial grid and open boundary conditions. The method employs a divide-and-conquer strategy, decomposing the computational domain into hierarchical units with varying cell sizes. James's algorithm is used to compute the zero-boundary potentials of lower-level units, which are systematically integrated to reconstruct the zero-boundary potential over the entire domain. These calculations are performed efficiently via matrix-vector operations using various precomputed kernel matrices. The open-boundary potential is then obtained by applying a discrete Green's function to the effective screening density induced at the domain boundaries. The overall algorithm achieves a computational complexity of $\mathcal{O}(N^3 \log N)$, where $N$ denotes the number of cells in one dimension. We implement the solver in the FARGO3D magnetohydrodynamics code and demonstrate its performance and second-order accuracy through a series of test problems.</description>

      <title>Halting the migration of super-Earths by efficient gap opening in radiative, low viscosity disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18564v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While planet migration has been extensively studied for classical viscous disks, planet-disk interaction in nearly inviscid disks has mostly been explored with greatly simplified thermodynamics. In such environments, motivated by models of wind-driven accretion disks, even Earth-mass planets located interior to 1 au can significantly perturb the disk, carving gaps and exciting vortices on their edges. Both processes are influenced by radiative transfer, which can both drive baroclinic forcing and influence gap opening. We perform a set of high-resolution radiation hydrodynamics simulations of planet-disk interaction in the feedback and gap-opening regimes, aiming to understand the role of radiation transport in the migration of super-Earth-mass planets representative of the observed exoplanet population. We find that radiative cooling drives baroclinic forcing during multiple stages of the planet's migration in the feedback regime (~1.5 M_earth), significantly delaying the onset of vortex formation at the gap edge but ultimately resulting in type-III runaway migration episodes. For super-thermal-mass planets (~6.7 M_earth), radiative cooling is fundamentally linked to the gap opening process, with the planet stalling instead of undergoing vortex-assisted migration as expected from isothermal or adiabatic models. This stalling of migration can only be captured when treating radiative effects, and since it affects super-thermal-mass planets its implications for both the final configuration of planetary systems and population synthesis modeling are potentially huge. Combining our findings with previous related studies, we present a map of migration regimes for radiative, nearly-inviscid disks, with the cooling-mediated gap-opening regime playing a central role in determining the planet's orbital properties.</description>

      <title>ASASSN-24fw: Candidate circumplanetary disk occultation of a main-sequence star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05367v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dusty disks around planets in outer reaches of exo-planetary systems can be detected as long-lasting occultations, provided the observer is close to the planet's orbital plane. Here we report follow-up observations of ASASSN-24fw (Gaia 07:05:18.97+06:12:19.4), a 4-magnitude dimming event of a main-sequence star which lasted 8.5 months. Using optical spectroscopy with KOSMOS (APO), MagE (Magellan) and GHOST (Gemini-S), we find strong Na I D absorption indicating that the occulter is gas rich. We detect multiple low-ionization metal emission lines with velocity dispersion &lt;10 km/s blue-shifted by 27 km/s with respect to the system, which likely originate in the occulter, as well as blue-shifted and broad (200 km/s) Halpha line, which likely originates in the inner circumstellar disk. We confirm the previously reported occultations in 1981 and 1937 seen in historic data, yielding a semi-major axis of the occulter's orbital motion around the star of 14 AU. Assuming that the occulter is a circumplanetary disk filling 30-100% of the Hill radius, we derive the planet's mass of 0.5-19 MJupiter and a circumplanetary disk mass of 1% of the mass of the Moon. Given the age of the star (&gt;2 Gyr), the disk is unlikely to be a survivor of the planet formation stage and is more likely to be a result of a planetary collision. If Na D absorption and metal emission lines originate in the circumplanetary disk, the observations presented here are the first discovery of a planet-driven wind or of circumsecondary disk rotation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05881v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interstellar object 3I/ATLAS shows a weak cometary activity. Its brightness suggests a maximum radius of ~10km (A/0.05)^{-1/2} for an asteroid with an albedo A. I show that interstellar objects with that radius would amount to an interstellar mass density that is well above the expected mass budget of interstellar comets or asteroids. Given this budget, the detection rate of objects like 3I/ATLAS implies that it is a comet with a small core radius &lt;0.6km, or a member of a rare population with a number density &lt;5x10^{-8}au^{-3} for R&gt;10km. The second possibility would suggest that the rare population of 3I/ATLAS objects favors plunging orbits towards the inner solar system to accommodate their inferred detection rate.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the detection of low-energy M dwarf flares: Wavelet-based denoising of CHEOPS data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15297v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stellar flares are powerful bursts of electromagnetic radiation triggered by magnetic reconnection in the chromosphere of stars, occurring frequently and intensely on active M dwarfs. While missions like TESS and Kepler have studied regular and super-flares, their detection of flares with energies below $10^{30}$ erg remains incomplete. Extending flare studies to include these low-energy events could enhance flare formation models and provide insight into their impacts on exoplanetary atmospheres. This study investigates CHEOPS's capacity to detect low-energy flares in M dwarf light curves. Using its high photometric precision and observing cadence, along with a tailored wavelet-based denoising algorithm, we aim to improve detection completeness and refine flare statistics for low-energy events. We conducted a flare injection and recovery to optimise denoising parameters, applied it to CHEOPS light curves to maximise detection rates, and used a flare breakdown algorithm to analyse complex structures. We recovered 291 flares with energies ranging from $3.7\times10^{26}$ to $8.9\times10^{30}$ erg across 62 M dwarfs, with $\sim$42% exhibiting complex, multi-peaked structures. The denoising improved flare recovery by $\sim$35%, although it marginally extended the lower boundary of detectable energies. For the full sample, the power-law index $\alpha$ was $1.99\pm0.10$, but a log-normal distribution fitted better, suggesting multiple possible flare formation scenarios. While CHEOPS's observing mode is not ideal for large-scale surveys, it captures weaker flares than TESS or Kepler, expanding the observed energy range. Wavelet-based denoising enhances low-energy event recovery, enabling exploration of the micro-flaring regime. Expanding low-energy flare observations could refine flare generation models and improve the understanding of their role in star-planet interactions.</description>

Abstract: We present deep $K_s$-band imaging of the extreme T subdwarf CWISE J221706.28$-$145437.6. Using the new photometry, we construct its spectral energy distribution and find this object exhibits exceptionally strong collision-induced absorption in the $H$ and $K$ bands. The comparison with the nearest benchmark extreme T subdwarf WISEA J181006.18$-$101000.5 suggests the object would be cooler and more metal-poor than the benchmark.</description>
