      <title>Symbolic Computations of the Two-Colored Diagrams for Central Configurations of the Planar N-vortex Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply the singular sequence method to investigate the finiteness problem for stationary configurations of the planar N-vortex problem. The initial step of the singular sequence method involves identifying all two-colored diagrams. These diagrams represent potential scenarios where finiteness may fail. We develop a symbolic computation algorithm to determine all two-colored diagrams for central configurations of the planar N-vortex problem.</description>

      <title>Local Shadowing and Entropy for Homeomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the dynamics of homeomorphisms through the lens of the local shadowing theory. We study the influence of positively shadowable points and positively shadowable measures into the local entropy theory of homeomrphisms. Specifically, we use pointwise shadowing to approximate invariant measures by ergodic measures with bigger entropy and supported on semi-horseshoes, giving certain flexibility of entropy to systems with local shadowing. We further apply our findings to show that by merging some pointwise dynamical properties, one can lead to positive entropy, significantly enhancing several related results previously established in the field. Besides, we introduce new examples of dynamical systems with local shadowing phenomena, by providing a way of construct examples, but lacking of several properties present in systems with the global shadowing, showing that the local and global shadowing are, in fact, distinct phenomena.</description>

      <title>Expansive Minimal Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend a Ma\~n\'e's famous result on expansive homeomorphisms, originally presented in [17], to the setting of flows. Specifically, we provide a complete characterization of minimal expansive flows without fixed points on compact metric spaces. We prove that such flows must be defined on one-dimensional sets and are equivalent to the suspension of a minimal subshift. This result significantly improves upon [16] by eliminating the need for their additional hypothesis. Furthermore, we apply our findings to show that any regular expansive flow on a compact metric space of dimension two or higher must contain infinitely many minimal subsets.</description>

      <title>Dimension estimates for nonlinear nonautonomous systems in arbitrary normed spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate explicit estimates for the dimension of trajectories satisfying a certain growth bound. We generalize the classic results of Kurzweil by considering nonlinear nonautonomous and uniformly compact dynamical systems on normed spaces over arbitrary fields. We furthermore refine the results in the case of delay equations, greatly simplifying the relevant growth bounds.</description>

      <title>Moser's twist theorem revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the work of Katznelson and Ornstein, we present a short way to achieve the almost optimal regularity in Moser's twist theorem. Specifically, for an integrable area-preserving twist map, the invariant circle with a given constant type frequency $\alpha$ persists under a small perturbation (dependent on $\alpha$) of class $C^{3+\epsilon}$. This result was initially established independently by Herman and R\"{u}ssmann in 1983. Our method differs essentially from their approaches.</description>

      <title>Global attractivity criteria for a discrete-time Hopfield neural network model with unbounded delays via singular M-matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we establish two global attractivity criteria for a multidimensional discrete-time non-autonomous Hopfield neural network model with infinite delays and delays in the leakage terms. The first criterion, which applies when the activation functions are bounded, is based on M-matrices that are not necessarily invertible. The second criterion, relevant for unbounded activation functions, requires that a related singular M-matrix be irreducible. We contrast our findings with existing results in the literature and present numerical simulations to illustrate the efficacy of the proposed criteria.</description>

      <title>Zip shift Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new extension in symbolic dynamics on two sets of alphabets, called the zip shift space. In finite case, it represents a finite-to-1 local homeomorphism called zip shift map. Such extension, offers a conjugacy between some endomorphisms and some zip shift map over two-sided space with finite sets of alphabets. As an application, the topological conjugacy of an N-to-1 uniformly hyperbolic horseshoe map with a zip shift map and its orbit structure is investigated. Moreover, the pre-image studies over zip shift space and the concepts of stable and unstable sets and homoclinic orbits, with a precise description for N-to-1 horseshoe are illustrated.</description>

      <title>Global dynamics of a two-species competition patch model in a Y-shaped river network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a two-species Lotka-Volterra competition patch model in a Y-shaped river network, where the two species are assumed to be identical except for their random and directed movements. We show that competition exclusion can occur under certain conditions, i.e., one of the semi-trivial equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable. Especially, if the random dispersal rates of the two species are equal, the species with a smaller drift rate will drive the other species to extinction, which suggests that small drift rates are favored.</description>

      <title>Contraction Dynamics in Heterogeneous Spatial Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the asymptotic behavior of reaction-diffusion (RD) systems is crucial for modeling processes ranging from species coexistence in ecology to biochemical interactions within cells. In this work, we analyze RD systems in which diffusion is modeled using the $\theta$-diffusion framework, while the reaction dynamics are spatially varying. We demonstrate that spatial heterogeneity affects the asymptotic behavior of such systems. Using contraction theory, we derive conditions that guarantee the exponential convergence of system trajectories, regardless of initial conditions. These conditions explicitly account for the influence of spatial heterogeneity in both the diffusion and reaction terms. As an application, we study a biochemical system and derive the quasi-steady-state (QSS) approximation, illustrating how spatial heterogeneity modulates the effective binding rates of biomolecular species.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the ergodic closing lemma of Ma\~n\'e, we investigate the $C^\infty$ closing lemma in higher-dimensional Hamiltonian systems, with a focus on the statistical behavior of periodic orbits generated by $C^\infty$-small perturbations. We demonstrate that, under certain Floer-theoretic conditions, invariant or recurrent Lagrangian submanifolds can give rise to periodic orbits whose statistical properties are controllable. For instance, we show that for Hamiltonian systems preserving the zero section in $T^*\mathbb{T}^n$, $C^\infty$ generically, there exist periodic orbits converging to an invariant measure supported on the zero section.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the semilinear wave equation involving the nonlinear damping term $g(u_t) $ and nonlinearity $f(u)$. The well-posedness of the weak solution satisfying some additional regularity is achieved under the wider ranges of the exponents $g$ and $f$. Moreover, the existence of global attractor and exponential attractor are proved.</description>

      <title>Fractal counterparts of density combinatorics theorems in continued fractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We build a bridge from density combinatorics to dimension theory of continued fractions. We establish a fractal transference principle that transfers common properties of subsets of $\mathbb N$ with positive upper density to properties of subsets of irrationals in $(0,1)$ for which the set $\{a_n(x)\colon n\in\mathbb N\}$ of partial quotients induces an injection $n\in\mathbb N\mapsto a_n(x)\in\mathbb N$. Let $(*)$ be a certain property that holds for any subset of $\mathbb N$ with positive upper density. The principle asserts that for any subset $S$ of $\mathbb N$ with positive upper density, there exists a set $E_S$ of Hausdorff dimension $1/2$ such that the set $\bigcup_{n\in\mathbb N}\bigcap_{x\in E_S}\{a_n(x)\}\cap S$ has the same upper density as that of $S$, and thus inherits property $(*)$. Examples of $(*)$ include the existence of arithmetic progressions of arbitrary lengths and the existence of arbitrary polynomial progressions, known as Szemer\'edi's and Bergelson-Leibman's theorems respectively. In the same spirit, we establish a relativized version of the principle applicable to the primes, to the primes of the form $y^2+z^2+1$, to the sets given by the Piatetski-Shapiro sequences.</description>

      <title>Reduced Order Modeling with Shallow Recurrent Decoder Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reduced Order Modeling is of paramount importance for efficiently inferring high-dimensional spatio-temporal fields in parametric contexts, enabling computationally tractable parametric analyses, uncertainty quantification and control. However, conventional dimensionality reduction techniques are typically limited to known and constant parameters, inefficient for nonlinear and chaotic dynamics, and uninformed to the actual system behavior. In this work, we propose sensor-driven SHallow REcurrent Decoder networks for Reduced Order Modeling (SHRED-ROM). Specifically, we consider the composition of a long short-term memory network, which encodes the temporal dynamics of limited sensor data in multiple scenarios, and a shallow decoder, which reconstructs the corresponding high-dimensional states. SHRED-ROM is a robust decoding-only strategy that circumvents the numerically unstable approximation of an inverse which is required by encoding-decoding schemes. To enhance computational efficiency and memory usage, the full-order state snapshots are reduced by, e.g., proper orthogonal decomposition, allowing for compressive training of the networks with minimal hyperparameter tuning. Through applications on chaotic and nonlinear fluid dynamics, we show that SHRED-ROM (i) accurately reconstructs the state dynamics for new parameter values starting from limited fixed or mobile sensors, independently on sensor placement, (ii) can cope with both physical, geometrical and time-dependent parametric dependencies, while being agnostic to their actual values, (iii) can accurately estimate unknown parameters, and (iv) can deal with different data sources, such as high-fidelity simulations, coupled fields and videos.</description>

      <title>Flat Convergence of Pushforwards of Rectifiable Currents Under $C^0-$Diffeomorphism Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the behavior of differential forms and currents on compact Riemannian manifolds when subjected to $C^0$-limits of diffeomorphisms. Employing techniques from geometric analysis, measure theory, and homotopy theory, we establish several key convergence results. We show that pullbacks of differential forms converge uniformly (in $C^0$ norm), and pushforwards of currents exhibit weak$-\ast$ convergence. We prove that pushforwards of rectifiable currents converge in the flat norm, a result particularly relevant for the study of singular geometric objects. Furthermore, through a detailed analysis of conformal transformations, we revisit the invariance of pole singularities of arbitrary order under pushforward by diffeomorphisms. These stability results offer tools for analyzing geometric structures, including applications to the stability of groups of symplectomorphisms, cosymplectomorphisms, and contact transformations under $C^0$ perturbations. We also highlight the applicability of our findings in areas such as measure theory, and dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Single-Impulse Reachable Set in Arbitrary Dynamics Using Polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a method to determine the reachable set (RS) of spacecraft after a single velocity impulse with an arbitrary direction, which is appropriate for the RS in both the state and observation spaces under arbitrary dynamics, extending the applications of current RS methods from two-body to arbitrary dynamics. First, the single-impulse RS model is generalized as a family of two-variable parameterized polynomials in the differential algebra scheme. Then, using the envelope theory, the boundary of RS is identified by solving the envelope equation. A framework is proposed to reduce the complexity of solving the envelope equation by converting it to the problem of searching the root of a one-variable polynomial. Moreover, a high-order local polynomial approximation for the RS envelope is derived to improve computational efficiency. The method successfully determines the RSs of two near-rectilinear halo orbits in the cislunar space. Simulation results show that the RSs in both state and observation spaces can be accurately approximated under the three-body dynamics, with relative errors of less than 0.0658%. In addition, using the local polynomial approximation, the computational time for solving the envelope equation is reduced by more than 84%.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use global Kuranishi charts to construct bulk-deformed orbifold Hamiltonian Floer theory for a global quotient orbifold. We then explain a strategy, based on spectral invariants on symmetric product orbifolds, for proving the smooth closing lemma for Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms of a symplectic manifold when the orbifold quantum cohomologies of its symmetric products possess suitable idempotents. We relate the existence of such idempotents to the manifold containing a sequence of Lagrangian links, whose number of components tends to infinity, satisfying a number of properties. We illustrate this strategy by giving a new proof of the smooth closing lemma for area-preserving diffeomorphisms of the 2-sphere. The construction of suitable Lagrangian links in higher dimensions remains an intriguing open problem.</description>

Abstract: We characterize exactness of a countable group $\Gamma$ in terms of invariant random equivalence relations (IREs) on $\Gamma$. Specifically, we show that $\Gamma$ is exact if and only if every weak limit of finite IREs is an amenable IRE. In particular, for exact groups this implies amenability of the restricted rerooting relation associated to the ideal Bernoulli Voronoi tessellation, the discrete analog of the ideal Poisson Voronoi tesselation.</description>

      <title>Mixing for dynamical systems driven by stationary noises</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper deals with the problem of long-time asymptotic behaviour of solutions for classes of ODEs and PDEs, perturbed by stationary noises. The latter are not assumed to be $\delta$-correlated in time, so that the evolution in question is not necessarily Markovian. We first prove an abstract result which imply the mixing for random dynamical systems satisfying appropriate dissipativity and controllability conditions. It is applicable to a large class of evolution equations, and we illustrate it on the examples of a chain of anharmonic oscillators coupled to heat reservoirs, the 2d Navier-Stokes system, and a complex Ginzburg-Landau equation. Our results also apply to the general theory of random processes on the 1d lattice and allow one to get for them results related to Dobrushin's theorems on reconstructing processes via their conditional distributions. The proof is based on an iterative construction with quadratic convergence. It uses the method of Kantorovich functional, introduced in [KPS02, Kuk02, Kuk06] in the context of randomly forced PDEs, and some ideas suggested in [Shi15, KNS20] to prove mixing with the help of controllability properties of an associated system</description>

      <title>Prime numbers and dynamics of the polynomial $x^2 - 1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $n \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geqslant 2}$. By $P(n)$ we denote the set of all prime divisors of the integers in the sequence $n, n^2-1, (n^2-1)^2-1, \dots$. We ask whether the set $P(n)$ determines $n$ uniquely under the assumption that $n \neq m^2-1$ for $m \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geqslant 2}$. This problem originates in the structure theory of infinite-dimensional Lie algebras. We show that the sets $P(n)$ generate infinitely many equivalence classes of positive integers under the equivalence relation $n_1 \sim n_2 \iff P(n_1) = P(n_2)$. We also prove that the sets $P(n)$ separate all positive integers up to $2^{29}$, and we provide some heuristics on why the answer to our question should be positive.</description>

      <title>Commensurating actions for groups of piecewise continuous transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.08572</link>
      <description>arXiv:1803.08572v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use partial actions, as formalized by Exel, to construct various commensurating actions. We use this in the context of groups piecewise preserving a geometric structure, and we interpret the transfixing property of these commensurating actions as the existence of a model for which the group acts preserving the geometric structure. We apply this to many groups with piecewise properties in dimension 1, notably piecewise of class C^k, piecewise affine, piecewise projective (possibly discontinuous).
  We derive various conjugacy results for subgroups with Property FW, or distorted cyclic subgroups, or more generally in the presence of rigidity properties for commensurating actions. For instance we obtain, under suitable assumptions, the conjugacy of a given piecewise affine action to an affine action on possibly another model. By the same method, we obtain a similar result in the projective case. An illustrating corollary is the fact that the group of piecewise projective self-transformations of the circle has no infinite subgroup with Kazhdan's Property T; this corollary is new even in the piecewise affine case.
  In addition, we use this to provide of the classification of circle subgroups of piecewise projective homeomorphisms of the projective line. The piecewise affine case is a classical result of Minakawa.</description>

Abstract: The R\"ossler System is one of the best known chaotic dynamical systems, exhibiting a plethora of complex phenomena - and yet, only a few studies tackled its complexity analytically. In this paper we find sufficient conditions for the existence of chaotic dynamics for the R\"ossler System at some specific parameter values at which the flow satisfies a certain heteroclinic condition. This will allow us to prove the existence of infinitely many periodic trajectories for the flow, and study their bifurcations in the parameter space of the R\"ossler system.</description>

      <title>Effective density of surfaces near Teichm\"{u}ller curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03560v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of $SL_{2}(\mathbb{R})$ on the stratum of translation surfaces $\mathcal{H}(2)$. Especially, we obtain effective density theorems on $\mathcal{H}(2)$ for orbits of the upper triangular subgroup $P$ of $SL_{2}(\mathbb{R})$ with the based surfaces near a small Teichm\"{u}ller curve.
  The proof is based on the use of McMullen's classification theorem, together with the effective equidistribution theorems in homogeneous dynamics. In particular, we compare the $P$-orbit of a surface, and the $P$-orbit of its absolute periods using the Lindenstrauss-Mohammadi-Wang's effective equidistribution theorem.</description>

      <title>Obstacles to Topological Factoring of Toeplitz shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04422v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For every Toeplitz sequence $x$ with period structure $(q_i)_{i\geq 1}$, one can identify a period structure ${\bf p}=(p_i)_{i\geq 0}$ which leads to a Bratteli-Vershik realization of the associated Toeplitz shift; we refer to this period structure as {\it constructive}. Let $(X,\sigma,x)$ and $(Y,\sigma,y)$ be Toeplitz shifts where $x\in X$ and $y\in Y$ are Toeplitz sequences with constructive period structures $(p^n)_{n\geq 1}$ and $(q^n)_{n\geq 1}$, respectively. Using the Bratteli-Vershik realization of factor maps between Toeplitz shifts, we prove that if there exists a topological factoring $ \pi:(X,\sigma)\rightarrow (Y,\sigma)$ with $\pi(x)=y$, then $q\mid p$. In particular, if $\pi$ is conjugacy, then $p=q$. We also prove that Toeplitz sequences are mapped to Toeplitz sequences through topological factorings.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we establish the quasi-compactness of the transfer operator associated with skew product systems that are semi-conjugate to piecewise convex maps with a countably infinite number of branches. These non-invertible skew products admit discontinuities, with the critical set confined to a countable collection of fibers. Furthermore, we demonstrate that such systems possess an invariant measure whose disintegration along the fibers exhibits bounded variation, a concept introduced and developed in this work.</description>

      <title>Vlasov Equations on Directed Hypergraph Measures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.03806v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we propose a framework to investigate the mean field limit (MFL) of interacting particle systems on directed hypergraphs. We provide a non-trivial measure-theoretic viewpoint and make extensions of directed hypergraphs as directed hypergraph measures (DHGMs), which are measure-valued functions on a compact metric space. These DHGMs can be regarded as hypergraph limits which include limits of a sequence of hypergraphs that are sparse, dense, or of intermediate densities. Our main results show that the Vlasov equation on DHGMs are well-posed and its solution can be approximated by empirical distributions of large networks of higher-order interactions. The results are applied to a Kuramoto network in physics, an epidemic network, and an ecological network, all of which include higher-order interactions. To prove the main results on the approximation and well-posedness of the Vlasov equation on DHGMs, we robustly generalize the method of [Kuehn, Xu. Vlasov equations on digraph measures, JDE, 339 (2022), 261--349] to higher-dimensions.</description>

      <title>High-Performance Distributed Control for Large-Scale Linear Systems: A Partitioned Distributed Observer Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06903v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the distributed-observer-based distributed control law has shown powerful ability to arbitrarily approximate the centralized control performance. However, the traditional distributed observer requires each local observer to reconstruct the state information of the whole system, which is unrealistic for large-scale scenarios. To fill this gap, this paper develops a greedy-idea-based large-scale system partition algorithm, which can significantly reduce the dimension of local observers. Then, the partitioned distributed observer for large-scale systems is proposed to overcome the problem that the system dynamics are difficult to estimate due to the coupling between partitions. Furthermore, the two-layer Lyapunov analysis method is adopted and the dynamic transformation lemma of compact errors is proven, which solves the problem of analyzing stability of the error dynamic of the partitioned distributed observer. Finally, it is proved that the distributed control law based on the partitioned distributed observer can also arbitrarily approximate the control performance of the centralized control law, and the dimension of the local observer is greatly reduced compared with the traditional method. The simulation results show that when the similarity between the physical network and the communication network is about 80%, the local observer dimension is greatly reduced by 90% and the relative error between the performance of the distributed control law and that of the centralized control law is less than 1%.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19159v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we propose a computational approach to proving the Birkhoff conjecture on the restricted three-body problem, which asserts the existence of a disk-like global surface of section. Birkhoff had conjectured this surface of section as a tool to prove existence of a direct periodic orbit. Using techniques from validated numerics we prove the existence of an approximately circular direct orbit for a wide range of mass parameters and Jacobi energies. We also provide methods to rigorously compute the Conley-Zehnder index of periodic Hamiltonian orbits using computational tools, thus giving some initial steps for developing computational Floer homology and providing the means to prove the Birkhoff conjecture via symplectic topology. We apply this method to various symmetric orbits in the restricted three-body problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09282v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study periodic approximations of aperiodic Schr\"odinger operators on lattices in Lie groups with dilation structure. The potentials arise through symbolic substitution systems that have been recently introduced in this setting. We characterize convergence of spectra of associated Schr\"odinger operators in the Hausdorff distance via properties of finite graphs. As a consequence, new examples of periodic approximations are obtained. We further prove that there are substitution systems that do not admit periodic approximations in higher dimensions, in contrast to the one-dimensional case. On the other hand, if the spectra converge, then we show that the rate of convergence is necessarily exponentially fast. These results are new even for substitutions over $\mathbb{Z}^d$.</description>

Abstract: We obtain an inverse of Furstenberg's correspondence principle in the setting of cancellative, amenable semigroups. Besides being of intrinsic interest on its own, this result allows us to answer a variety of questions concerning sets of recurrence and van der Corput (vdC) sets, which were posed by Bergelson and Lesigne \cite{BL}, Bergelson and Ferr\'e Moragues \cite{BF}, and Moreira \cite{Mor}. We also prove a spectral characterization of vdC sets and prove some of their basic properties in the context of countable amenable groups.
  Several results in this article were independently discovered by Sohail Farhangi and Robin Tucker-Drob in \cite{FT}.</description>

      <title>Learning Interpretable Hierarchical Dynamical Systems Models from Time Series Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04814v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In science, we are often interested in obtaining a generative model of the underlying system dynamics from observed time series. While powerful methods for dynamical systems reconstruction (DSR) exist when data come from a single domain, how to best integrate data from multiple dynamical regimes and leverage it for generalization is still an open question. This becomes particularly important when individual time series are short, and group-level information may help to fill in for gaps in single-domain data. Here we introduce a hierarchical framework that enables to harvest group-level (multi-domain) information while retaining all single-domain characteristics, and showcase it on popular DSR benchmarks, as well as on neuroscience and medical data. In addition to faithful reconstruction of all individual dynamical regimes, our unsupervised methodology discovers common low-dimensional feature spaces in which datasets with similar dynamics cluster. The features spanning these spaces were further dynamically highly interpretable, surprisingly in often linear relation to control parameters that govern the dynamics of the underlying system. Finally, we illustrate transfer learning and generalization to new parameter regimes, paving the way toward DSR foundation models.</description>

      <title>Likelihood-Free Inference and Hierarchical Data Assimilation for Geological Carbon Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15302v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data assimilation will be essential for the management and expansion of geological carbon storage operations. In traditional data assimilation approaches a fixed set of geological hyperparameters, such as mean and standard deviation of log-permeability, is often assumed. Such hyperparameters, however, may be highly uncertain in practical CO2 storage applications where measurements are scarce. In this study, we develop a hierarchical data assimilation framework for carbon storage that treats hyperparameters as uncertain variables characterized by hyperprior distributions. To deal with the computationally intractable likelihood function in hyperparameter estimation, we apply a likelihood-free (or simulation-based) inference algorithm, specifically sequential Monte Carlo-based approximate Bayesian computation (SMC-ABC), to draw posterior samples of hyperparameters given dynamic monitoring well data. In the second step we use an ensemble smoother with multiple data assimilation (ESMDA) procedure to provide posterior realizations of grid-block permeability. To reduce computational costs, a 3D recurrent R-U-Net deep learning-based surrogate model is applied for forward function evaluations. A rejection sampling (RS) procedure for data assimilation is applied to provide reference posterior results. Detailed posterior results from SMC-ABC-ESMDA are compared to those from the reference RS method. Close agreement is achieved with 'converged' RS results, for two synthetic true models, in all quantities considered. Importantly, the SMC-ABC-ESMDA procedure provides speedup of 1-2 orders of magnitude relative to RS for the two cases. A modified standalone ESMDA procedure is introduced for comparison purposes. For the same number of function evaluations, the hierarchical approach is shown to provide superior results for posterior hyperparameter distributions and monitoring well pressure predictions.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Tits alternative for circle diffeomorphisms</title>

Abstract: Let $\mu_1, \mu_2$ be probability measures on $\mathrm{Diff}^1_+(S^1)$ satisfying a suitable moment condition and such that their supports genererate discrete groups acting proximally on $S^1$. Let $(f^n_\omega)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}, (f^n_{\omega'})_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ be two independent realizations of the random walk driven by $\mu_1, \mu_2$ respectively. We show that almost surely there is an $N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that for all $n \geq N$ the elements $f^n_\omega, f^n_{\omega'}$ generate a nonabelian free group. The proof is inspired by the strategy by R. Aoun for linear groups and uses work of A. Gorodetski, V. Kleptsyn and G. Monakov, and of P. Barrientos and D. Malicet. A weaker (and easier) statement holds for measures supported on $\mathrm{Homeo}_+(S^1)$ with no moment conditions.</description>

      <title>Stochastic volatility model with long memory for water quantity-quality dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03725v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Water quantity and quality are vital indices for assessing fluvial environments. These indices are highly variable over time and include sub-exponential memory, where the influences of past events persist over long durations. Moreover, water quantity and quality are interdependent, with the former affecting the latter. However, this relationship has not been thoroughly studied from the perspective of long-memory processes, which this paper aims to address. We propose applying a new stochastic volatility model, a system of infinite-dimensional stochastic differential equations, to describe dynamic asset prices in finance and economics. Although the stochastic volatility model was originally developed for phenomena unrelated to the water environment, its mathematical universality allows for an interdisciplinary reinterpretation: river discharge is analogous to volatility, and water quality to asset prices. Moreover, the model's infinite-dimensional nature enables the analytical description of sub-exponential memory. The moments and autocorrelations of the model are then obtained analytically. We mathematically analyze the stochastic volatility model and investigate its applicability to the dynamics of water quantity and quality. Finally, we apply the model to real time-series data from a river in Japan, demonstrating that it effectively captures both the memory and the correlation of water quality indices to river discharge. This approach, grounded in infinite-dimensional stochastic differential equations, represents a novel contribution to the modelling and analysis of environmental systems where long memory processes play a role.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear port-Hamiltonian system identification from input-state-output data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06118v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A framework for identifying nonlinear port-Hamiltonian systems using input-state-output data is introduced. The framework utilizes neural networks' universal approximation capacity to effectively represent complex dynamics in a structured way. We show that using the structure helps to make long-term predictions compared to baselines that do not incorporate physics. We also explore different architectures based on MLPs, KANs, and using prior information. The technique is validated through examples featuring nonlinearities in either the skew-symmetric terms, the dissipative terms, or the Hamiltonian.</description>
