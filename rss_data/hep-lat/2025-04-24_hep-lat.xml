      <title>Inverse problem in the LaMET framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One proposal to compute parton distributions from first principles is the large momentum effective theory (LaMET), which requires the Fourier transform of matrix elements computed non-perturbatively. Lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD) provides calculations of these matrix elements over a finite range of Fourier harmonics that are often noisy or unreliable in the largest computed harmonics. It has been suggested that enforcing an exponential decay of the missing harmonics helps alleviate this issue. Using non-perturbative data, we show that the uncertainty introduced by this inverse problem in a realistic setup remains significant without very restrictive assumptions, and that the importance of the exact asymptotic behavior is minimal for values of $x$ where the framework is currently applicable. We show that the crux of the inverse problem lies in harmonics of the order of $\lambda=zP_z \sim 5-15$, where the signal in the lattice data is often barely existent in current studies, and the asymptotic behavior is not firmly established. We stress the need for more sophisticated techniques to account for this inverse problem, whether in the LaMET or related frameworks like the short-distance factorization. We also address a misconception that, with available lattice methods, the LaMET framework allows a "direct" computation of the $x$-dependence, whereas the alternative short-distance factorization only gives access to moments or fits of the $x$-dependence.</description>

      <title>Fourier Acceleration in a Linear Sigma Model with Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fourier acceleration is a technique used in Hybrid Monte Carlo simulations to decrease the autocorrelation between subsequent field configurations in the generated ensemble. It has been shown, in the perturbative limit, to eliminate the problem of critical slowing down in a $\phi^4$ theory (arXiv:1812.05281 [hep-lat]). As a result, there are several techniques that are being explored to generalize Fourier acceleration to work with non-Abelian gauge theories like QCD (arXiv:2112.04556 [hep-lat], arXiv:2108.05486 [hep-lat]). It is hoped that these methods will prove effective at overcoming the problem of critical slowing down, even in the non-perturbative limit. In our work, we show that Fourier acceleration can be applied effectively to a linear sigma model in the symmetry broken phase, leading to reduced autocorrelation and faster thermalization. We present an algorithm for estimating the optimal Fourier acceleration masses dynamically, based on the lattice data. In the future, we hope to explore the effectiveness of these techniques in the strongly-interacting case. Since our $\phi^4$ theory is a linear chiral effective theory for QCD, this could be interesting for those who are seeking to generalize Fourier acceleration to QCD.</description>

      <title>Baryon Number Violation: From Nuclear Matrix Elements to BSM Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Processes that violate baryon number, most notably proton decay and $n\bar n$ transitions, are promising probes of physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM) needed to understand the lack of antimatter in the Universe. To interpret current and forthcoming experimental limits, theory input from nuclear matrix elements to UV complete models enters. Thus, an interplay of experiment, effective field theory, lattice QCD, and BSM model building is required to develop strategies to accurately extract information from current and future data and maximize the impact and sensitivity of next-generation experiments. Here, we briefly summarize the main results and discussions from the workshop "INT-25-91W: Baryon Number Violation: From Nuclear Matrix Elements to BSM Physics," held at the Institute for Nuclear Theory, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, January 13-17, 2025.</description>

      <title>Bosonic vs. Fermionic Matter in Quantum Simulations of $2+1$D Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum link models extend lattice gauge theories beyond the traditional Wilson formulation and present promising candidates for both digital and analog quantum simulations. Fermionic matter coupled to $U(1)$ quantum link gauge fields has been extensively studied, revealing a phase diagram that includes transitions from the columnar phase in the quantum dimer model to the resonating valence bond phase in the quantum link model, potentially passing through a disordered liquid-like phase. In this study, we investigate the model coupled to hardcore bosons and identify a similar phase structure, though with a more intricate mixture of phases around the transition. Our analysis reveals that near the transition region, a narrow and distinct ordered phase emerges, characterized by gauge fields forming plaquette configurations with alternating orientations, which is then followed by a thinner, liquid-like regime. This complexity primarily stems from the differences in particle statistics, which manifest prominently when the matter degrees of freedom become dynamic. Notably, our findings suggest that bosons can effectively replace fermions in lattice gauge theory simulations, offering solutions to the challenges posed by fermions in both digital and analog quantum simulations.</description>

      <title>Semileptonic decays of doubly charmed (bottom) baryons to single heavy baryons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the semileptonic decays of baryons containing double charm or double bottom quarks, focusing on their transitions to single heavy baryons through three-point QCD sum rule framework. In our calculations, we take into account nonperturbative operators with mass dimensions up to five. We calculate the form factors associated with these decays, emphasizing the vector and axial-vector transition currents in the corresponding amplitude. By applying fitting functions for the form factors based on the squared momentum transfer, we derive predictions for decay widths and branching ratios in their possible lepton channels. These findings offer valuable insights for experimentalists exploring semileptonic decays of doubly charm or bottom baryons. Perhaps they can be validated in upcoming experiments like LHCb. These investigations contribute to a deeper understanding of the decay mechanisms in these baryonic channels.</description>

      <title>QED corrections to meson masses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16702v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present our progress on calculating leading-order QED corrections to meson masses and bare quark masses. As lattice QCD calculations become more precise, these QED corrections are becoming more important. However, one of the challenges in adding QED effects to QCD calculations is avoiding power-law suppressed finite-volume effects. By using the recently introduced infinite-volume reconstruction method for QED, we are able to avoid this problem and perform calculations with exponentially-suppressed finite-volume effects.</description>

      <title>Soft modes in hot QCD matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.19853v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The chiral crossover of QCD at finite temperature and vanishing baryon density turns into a second order phase transition if lighter than physical quark masses are considered. If this transition occurs sufficiently close to the physical point, its universal critical behaviour would largely control the physics of the QCD phase transition. We quantify the size of this region in QCD using functional approaches, both Dyson-Schwinger equations and the functional renormalisation group. The latter allows us to study both critical and non-critical effects on equal footing, facilitating a precise determination of the scaling regime. We find that the physical point is far away from the critical region. Importantly, we show that the physics of the chiral crossover is dominated by soft modes even far beyond the critical region. While scaling functions determine all thermodynamic properties of the system in the critical region, the order parameter potential is the relevant quantity away from it. We compute this potential in QCD using the functional renormalisation group and Dyson-Schwinger equations and provide a simple parametrisation for phenomenological applications.</description>

      <title>Exponential speed up in Monte Carlo sampling through Radial Updates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18218v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, it has been shown that the hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm is guaranteed to converge exponentially to a given target probability distribution $p(x)\propto e^{-V(x)}$ on non-compact spaces if augmented by an appropriate radial update. In this work we present a simple way to derive efficient radial updates meeting the necessary requirements for any potential $V$. We reduce the problem to finding a substitution for the radial direction $||x||=f(z)$ so that the effective potential $V(f(z))$ grows exponentially with $z\rightarrow\pm\infty$. Any additive update of $z$ then leads to the desired convergence. We show that choosing this update from a normal distribution with standard deviation $\sigma\approx 1/\sqrt{d}$ in $d$ dimensions yields very good results. We further generalise the previous results on radial updates to a wide class of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms beyond the HMC and we quantify the convergence behaviour of MCMC algorithms with badly chosen radial update. Finally, we apply the radial update to the sampling of heavy-tailed distributions and achieve a speed up of many orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Fermions and Zeta Function on the Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08803v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel fermionic model on the graphs. The Dirac operator of the model consists of deformed incidence matrices on the graph and the partition function is given by the inverse of the graph zeta function. We find that the coefficients of the inverse of the graph zeta function, which is a polynomial of finite degree in the coupling constant, count the number of fermionic cycles on the graph. We also construct the model on grid graphs by using the concept of the covering graph and the Artin-Ihara $L$-function. In connection with this, we show that the fermion doubling is absent, and the overlap fermions can be constructed on a general graph. Furthermore, we relate our model to statistical models by introducing the winding number around cycles, where the distribution of the poles of the graph zeta function (the zeros of the partition function) plays a crucial role. Finally, we formulate gauge theory including fermions on the graph from the viewpoint of the covering graph derived from the gauge group in a unified way.</description>

      <title>Chiral symmetry restoration in QC_2D from effective model using the functional renormalization group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10134v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The order of the chiral phase transition in two-color and two-flavor QC$_2$D is investigated using the functional renormalization group (FRG) technique in an effective model setting. We calculate the $\beta$ function of all couplings in the dimensionally reduced Ginzburg-Landau free energy functional with Pauli-G\"ursey SU(4) symmetry. We compare results of the perturbative $\epsilon$ expansion approach with those obtained via the FRG, evaluated directly in $d=3$ dimensions. The perturbative results suggest that the fixed-point structure is more intricate than that of three-color QCD, a conclusion further supported by the FRG analysis. Both methods display an infrared stable $O(6)$ fixed point at infinite axial anomaly; however, the FRG approach also reveals the existence of $U_A(1)$ anomaly-free fixed points, which can become infrared stable if the anomaly in the underlying theory vanishes at the critical temperature. These findings imply that the phase transition can be of second order, consistent with earlier findings for three colors.</description>
