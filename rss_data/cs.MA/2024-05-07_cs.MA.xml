      <title>A Single Online Agent Can Efficiently Learn Mean Field Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03718</link>

Abstract: Mean field games (MFGs) are a promising framework for modeling the behavior of large-population systems. However, solving MFGs can be challenging due to the coupling of forward population evolution and backward agent dynamics. Typically, obtaining mean field Nash equilibria (MFNE) involves an iterative approach where the forward and backward processes are solved alternately, known as fixed-point iteration (FPI). This method requires fully observed population propagation and agent dynamics over the entire spatial domain, which could be impractical in some real-world scenarios. To overcome this limitation, this paper introduces a novel online single-agent model-free learning scheme, which enables a single agent to learn MFNE using online samples, without prior knowledge of the state-action space, reward function, or transition dynamics. Specifically, the agent updates its policy through the value function (Q), while simultaneously evaluating the mean field state (M), using the same batch of observations. We develop two variants of this learning scheme: off-policy and on-policy QM iteration. We prove that they efficiently approximate FPI, and a sample complexity guarantee is provided. The efficacy of our methods is confirmed by numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Select to Perfect: Imitating desired behavior from large multi-agent data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI agents are commonly trained with large datasets of demonstrations of human behavior. However, not all behaviors are equally safe or desirable. Desired characteristics for an AI agent can be expressed by assigning desirability scores, which we assume are not assigned to individual behaviors but to collective trajectories. For example, in a dataset of vehicle interactions, these scores might relate to the number of incidents that occurred. We first assess the effect of each individual agent's behavior on the collective desirability score, e.g., assessing how likely an agent is to cause incidents. This allows us to selectively imitate agents with a positive effect, e.g., only imitating agents that are unlikely to cause incidents. To enable this, we propose the concept of an agent's Exchange Value, which quantifies an individual agent's contribution to the collective desirability score. The Exchange Value is the expected change in desirability score when substituting the agent for a randomly selected agent. We propose additional methods for estimating Exchange Values from real-world datasets, enabling us to learn desired imitation policies that outperform relevant baselines.

      <title>Unified End-to-End V2X Cooperative Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: V2X cooperation, through the integration of sensor data from both vehicles and infrastructure, is considered a pivotal approach to advancing autonomous driving technology. Current research primarily focuses on enhancing perception accuracy, often overlooking the systematic improvement of accident prediction accuracy through end-to-end learning, leading to insufficient attention to the safety issues of autonomous driving. To address this challenge, this paper introduces the UniE2EV2X framework, a V2X-integrated end-to-end autonomous driving system that consolidates key driving modules within a unified network. The framework employs a deformable attention-based data fusion strategy, effectively facilitating cooperation between vehicles and infrastructure. The main advantages include: 1) significantly enhancing agents' perception and motion prediction capabilities, thereby improving the accuracy of accident predictions; 2) ensuring high reliability in the data fusion process; 3) superior end-to-end perception compared to modular approaches. Furthermore, We implement the UniE2EV2X framework on the challenging DeepAccident, a simulation dataset designed for V2X cooperative driving.</description>

      <title>Iterative Experience Refinement of Software-Developing Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) show significant potential for achieving high autonomy in various scenarios such as software development. Recent research has shown that LLM agents can leverage past experiences to reduce errors and enhance efficiency. However, the static experience paradigm, reliant on a fixed collection of past experiences acquired heuristically, lacks iterative refinement and thus hampers agents' adaptability. In this paper, we introduce the Iterative Experience Refinement framework, enabling LLM agents to refine experiences iteratively during task execution. We propose two fundamental patterns: the successive pattern, refining based on nearest experiences within a task batch, and the cumulative pattern, acquiring experiences across all previous task batches. Augmented with our heuristic experience elimination, the method prioritizes high-quality and frequently-used experiences, effectively managing the experience space and enhancing efficiency. Extensive experiments show that while the successive pattern may yield superior results, the cumulative pattern provides more stable performance. Moreover, experience elimination facilitates achieving better performance using just 11.54% of a high-quality subset.</description>

      <title>TorchDriveEnv: A Reinforcement Learning Benchmark for Autonomous Driving with Reactive, Realistic, and Diverse Non-Playable Characters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The training, testing, and deployment, of autonomous vehicles requires realistic and efficient simulators. Moreover, because of the high variability between different problems presented in different autonomous systems, these simulators need to be easy to use, and easy to modify. To address these problems we introduce TorchDriveSim and its benchmark extension TorchDriveEnv. TorchDriveEnv is a lightweight reinforcement learning benchmark programmed entirely in Python, which can be modified to test a number of different factors in learned vehicle behavior, including the effect of varying kinematic models, agent types, and traffic control patterns. Most importantly unlike many replay based simulation approaches, TorchDriveEnv is fully integrated with a state of the art behavioral simulation API. This allows users to train and evaluate driving models alongside data driven Non-Playable Characters (NPC) whose initializations and driving behavior are reactive, realistic, and diverse. We illustrate the efficiency and simplicity of TorchDriveEnv by evaluating common reinforcement learning baselines in both training and validation environments. Our experiments show that TorchDriveEnv is easy to use, but difficult to solve.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Collective Open-Ended Exploration from Decentralized Meta-Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00651v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent works have proven that intricate cooperative behaviors can emerge in agents trained using meta reinforcement learning on open ended task distributions using self-play. While the results are impressive, we argue that self-play and other centralized training techniques do not accurately reflect how general collective exploration strategies emerge in the natural world: through decentralized training and over an open-ended distribution of tasks. In this work we therefore investigate the emergence of collective exploration strategies, where several agents meta-learn independent recurrent policies on an open ended distribution of tasks. To this end we introduce a novel environment with an open ended procedurally generated task space which dynamically combines multiple subtasks sampled from five diverse task types to form a vast distribution of task trees. We show that decentralized agents trained in our environment exhibit strong generalization abilities when confronted with novel objects at test time. Additionally, despite never being forced to cooperate during training the agents learn collective exploration strategies which allow them to solve novel tasks never encountered during training. We further find that the agents learned collective exploration strategies extend to an open ended task setting, allowing them to solve task trees of twice the depth compared to the ones seen during training. Our open source code as well as videos of the agents can be found on our companion website.</description>
