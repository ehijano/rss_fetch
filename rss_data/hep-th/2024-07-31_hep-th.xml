      <title>A Distance Conjecture for Branes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use branes to generalize the Distance Conjecture. We conjecture that in any infinite-distance limit in the moduli space of a $d$-dimensional quantum gravity theory, among the set of particle towers and fundamental branes with at most $p_\text{max}\leq d-2$ spacetime dimensions, at least one has mass/tension decreasing exponentially $T\sim \exp(-\alpha\Delta)$ with the moduli space distance $\Delta$ at a rate of at least $\alpha\geq 1/\sqrt{d-p_\text{max}-1}$. Since $p_\text{max}$ can vary, this represents multiple conditions, where the Sharpened Distance Conjecture is the $p_\text{max}=1$ case. This conjecture is a necessary condition imposed on higher-dimensional theories in order for the Sharpened Distance Conjecture to hold in lower-dimensional theories. We test our conjecture in theories with maximal and half-maximal supersymmetry in diverse dimensions, finding that it is satisfied and often saturated. In some cases where it is saturated -- most notably, heterotic string theory in 10 dimensions -- we argue that novel, low-tension non-supersymmetric branes must exist. We also identify patterns relating the rates at which various brane tensions vary in infinite-distance limits and relate these tensions to the species scale.</description>

      <title>Open Strings and Heterotic Instantons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by closed string perturbation theory arguments by S. Shenker, we consider non-perturbative effects of characteristic strength $\mathcal{O}(e^{-1/g_{s}})$, with $g_{s}$ the closed string coupling constant, in supersymmetric critical heterotic string theories. We argue that in 10D such effects arise from heterotic "D-instantons," i.e. heterotic disk diagrams, whose existence relies on a non-trivial interplay between worldsheet and spacetime degrees of freedom. In compactifications of the $\mathrm{SemiSpin}(32)$ heterotic string, we argue that similar effects can arise from wrapped Euclidean non-BPS "D-strings." Two general principles arise: The first is that the consistency of those heterotic branes on which the fundamental string can end relies on an inflow mechanism for spacetime degrees of freedom. The second is that Shenker's argument, taken to its logical conclusion, implies that all closed string theories must exhibit open strings as well.</description>

      <title>Entropy and Spectrum of Near-Extremal Black Holes: semiclassical brane solutions to non-perturbative problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The black hole entropy has been observed to generically turn negative at exponentially low temperatures $T\sim e^{-S_0}$ in the extremal Bekenstein-Hawking entropy $S_0$, a seeming pathology often attributed to missing non-perturbative effects. In fact, we show that this negativity must happen for any effective theory of quantum gravity with an ensemble description. To do so, we identify the usual gravitational entropy as an annealed entropy $S_a$, and prove that this quantity gives $S_0$ at extremality if and only if the ground-state energy is protected by supersymmetry, and diverges negatively otherwise. The actual thermodynamically-behaved quantity is the average or quenched entropy $S_q$, whose calculation is poorly understood in gravity: it involves replica wormholes in a regime where the topological expansion breaks down. Using matrix integrals we find new instanton saddles that dominate gravitational correlators at $T\sim e^{-S_0}$ and are dual to semiclassical wormholes involving dynamical branes. These brane solutions give the leading contribution to any black hole very near extremality, and a duality with matrix ensembles would not make sense without them. In the non-BPS case, they are required to make $S_q$ non-negative and also enhance the negativity of $S_a$, both effects consistent with matrix integrals evaluated exactly. Our instanton results are tested against the on-shell action of D3-branes dual to multiply wrapped Wilson loops in $\mathcal{N}=4$ super-YM, and a precise match is found. Our analysis of low-energy random matrix spectra also explains the origin of spectral gaps in supersymmetric theories, not only when there are BPS states at zero energy, but also for purely non-BPS supermultiplets. In the former, our prediction for the gap in terms of the degeneracy of BPS states agrees with the R-charge scaling in gapped multiplets of $\mathcal{N}=2$ super-JT gravity.</description>

      <title>Integrability of the $\lambda$-deformation of the PCM with spectators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a generalisation of the $\lambda$-deformation of the Principal Chiral Model (PCM) where we deform just a subgroup $F$ of the full symmetry group $G$. We find that demanding Lax integrability imposes a crucial restriction, namely that the coset $F\backslash G$ must be symmetric. Surprisingly, we also find that (when $F$ is non-abelian) integrability requires that the term in the action involving only the spectator fields should have a specific $\lambda$-dependence, which is a curious modification of the procedure expected from the known $F=G$ case. The resulting Lax connection has a novel analytical structure, with four single poles as opposed to the two poles of the cases of the PCM and of the standard $\lambda$-deformation. We also explicitly work out the example of $G=SU(2)$ and $F=U(1)$, discussing its renormalisation group flow to two loops.</description>

      <title>Wormhole Renormalization: The gravitational path integral, holography, and a gauge group for topology change</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Factorization Paradox from the bottom up by adapting methods from perturbative renormalization. Just as quantum field theories are plagued with loop divergences that need to be cancelled systematically by introducing counterterms, gravitational path integrals are plagued by wormhole contributions that spoil the factorization of the holographic dual. These wormholes must be cancelled by some stringy effects in a UV complete, holographic theory of quantum gravity. In a simple model of two-dimensional topological gravity, we outline a gravitational analog of the recursive BPHZ procedure in order to systematically introduce ``counter-wormholes" which parametrize the unknown stringy effects that lead to factorization. Underlying this procedure is a Hopf algebra of symmetries which is analogous to the Connes--Kreimer Hopf algebra underlying perturbative renormalization. The group dual to this Hopf algebra acts to reorganize contributions from spacetimes with distinct topology, and can be seen as a gauge group relating various equivalent ways of constructing a factorizing gravitational path integral.</description>

      <title>Multiscalar Critical Models with Localised Cubic Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interface localised interactions are studied for multiscalar universality classes accessible with the perturbative $\varepsilon$ expansion in $4-\varepsilon$ dimensions. The associated beta functions at one loop and partially at two loops are derived, and a wide variety of interface conformal field theories (CFTs) is found, even in cases where the bulk universality class is as simple as the Wilson--Fisher description of the $O(N)$ model. For up to three scalar fields in the bulk, interface fixed points are classified for all bulk universality classes encountered in this case. Numerical results are obtained for interface CFTs that exist for larger numbers of multiscalar fields. Our analytic and numerical results indicate the existence of a vast space of interface CFTs, much larger than the space of defect CFTs found for line and surface defect deformations of multiscalar models in $4-\varepsilon$ dimensions.</description>

      <title>Spin cobordism and the gauge group of type I/heterotic string theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cobordism offers an unique perspective into the non-perturbative sector of string theory by demanding the absence of higher form global symmetries for quantum gravitational consistency. In this work we compute the spin cobordism groups of the classifying space of $Spin(32)/\mathbb{Z}_2$ relevant to describing type I/heterotic string theory and explore their (shared) non-perturbative sector. To facilitate this we leverage our knowledge of type I D-brane physics behind the related ko-homology. The computation utilizes several established tools from algebraic topology, the focus here is on two spectral sequences. First, the Eilenberg-Moore spectral sequence is used to obtain the cohomology of the classifying space of the $Spin(32)/\mathbb{Z}_2$ with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ coefficients. This will enable us to start the Adams spectral sequence for finally obtaining our result, the spin cobordism groups. We conclude by providing a string theoretic interpretation to the cobordism groups.</description>

      <title>WZW terms without anomalies: generalised symmetries in chiral Lagrangians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a 4d non-linear sigma model on the coset $(\mathrm{SU}(N)_L \times \mathrm{SU}(N)_R \times \mathrm{SU}(2))/(\mathrm{SU}(N)_{L+R}\times \mathrm{U}(1))\cong \mathrm{SU}(N) \times S^2$, that features a topological Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) term whose curvature is $\frac{n}{24\pi^2}\mathrm{Tr}(g^{-1}dg)^3 \wedge \mathrm{Vol}_{S^2}$ where $g$ is the $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ pion field. This WZW term, unlike its familiar cousin in QCD, does not match any chiral anomaly, so its microscopic origin is not obviously QCD-like. We find that generalised symmetries provide a key to unlocking a UV completion. The $S^2$ winding number bestows the theory with a 1-form symmetry, and the WZW term intertwines this with the $\mathrm{SU}(N)^2$ flavour symmetry into a 2-group global symmetry. Like a 't Hooft anomaly, the 2-group symmetry should match between UV and IR, precluding QCD-like completions that otherwise give the right pion manifold. We instead construct a weakly-coupled UV completion that matches the 2-group symmetry, in which an abelian gauge field connects the QCD baryon number current to the winding number current of a $\mathbb{C}P^1$ model, and explicitly show how the mixed WZW term arises upon flowing to the IR. The coefficient is fixed to be the number of QCD colours and, strikingly, this matching must be 'tree-level exact' to satisfy a quantization condition. We discuss generalisations, and elucidate the more intricate generalised symmetry structure that arises upon gauging an anomaly-free subgroup of $\mathrm{SU}(N)_{L+R}$. This WZW term may even play a phenomenological role as a portal to a dark sector, that determines the relic abundance of dark matter.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetric Grassmannian Sigma Models in Gross-Neveu Formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the classical aspects of $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ supersymmetric sigma models with Hermitian symmetric target spaces, using the so-called Gross-Neveu (first-order GLSM) formalism. We reformulate these models for complex Grassmannians in terms of simple supersymmetric Lagrangians with polynomial interactions. For maximal isotropic Grassmannians we propose two types of equivalent Lagrangians, which make either supersymmetry or the geometry of target space manifest. These reformulations can be seen as current-current deformations of curved $\beta \gamma$ systems. The $\mathsf{CP}^{1}$ supersymmetric sigma model is our prototypical example.</description>

      <title>Sparsity dependence of Krylov state complexity in the SYK model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Krylov state complexity of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model for $N \le 26$ Majorana fermions with $q$-body interaction with $q=4,6,8$ for a range of sparse parameter $k$. Using the peak of the Krylov complexity as a probe, we find change in behavior as we vary $k$ for various $q$. We argue that this captures the change from holographic to non-holographic behavior in the sparse SYK-type models such that model is holographic for all $k \ge k_{\text{min}}$. Our results also indicate that the Krylov complexity peak has a holographic interpretation similar to the Lyapunov exponent.</description>

      <title>Inflationary Cosmology as flow of integrable weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify the algebra of gauge invariant observables in de Sitter as the subalgebra of the type $III_1$ factor $A_{dS}$, associated to de Sitter, defined as the centralizer of any integrable weight on $A_{dS}$. These algebras are for any integrable weight type $II_{\infty}$ factors admitting a crossed product representation with respect to modular automorphisms. In this context we define Inflationary Cosmology as the flow of integrable weights and the dual automorphism as the flow generator. Using some basic properties of integrable weights we show that any type $II_1$ dS algebra cannot be represented as the $\epsilon=0$ limit ( for $\epsilon$ the slow roll parameter ) of the gauge invariant algebra defined by any integrable weight. This strongly indicates that the pure dS algebra defined as the $\epsilon=0$ limit is algebraically non existent.</description>

      <title>Thermal and Quantum Phase Transitions of the $\phi^4$ Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The critical behaviour of the classical (thermal) phase transition (CPT) of the Ising model is identical to the quantum phase transition (QPT) of the $\phi^4$ Quantum Field Theory (QFT). Our goal in this work is to map out the QPT-CPT diagram of the $\phi^4$ QFT, and study its relation to the well-known QPT-CPT phase diagram of the Ising model. To do this, we propose a modification of the usual finite-temperature Renormalization Group (RG) approach by relating the temperature parameter to the running RG scale, $T \equiv k_T = \tau k$ where $k_T$ is the running cutoff for thermal, and $k$ is for the quantum fluctuations. In this case, the temperature is related to the dimensionless quantity $\tau$. We apply this new thermal RG approach for the $\phi^4$ model in lower dimensions and construct its QPT-CPT phase diagram. We formulate requirements for the QPT-CPT phase diagram of the $\phi^4$ theory based on known properties of the QPT-CPT phase diagram of the Ising model. Finally, we use these requirements to check the viability of the thermal RG method proposed in this work.</description>

      <title>Massive Spectrum in F-theory and the Distance Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the massive states in F-theory compactification models, including BPS string junctions stretching between parallel 7-branes and KK modes. We obtain analytical results when there are two colliding bunches of 7-branes with a locally constant axiodilaton profile. In particular, in 8D F-theory setups when the 7-branes collide into a codimension-one $(4,6,12)$ singularity, we found an infinite light tower of BPS string junctions, which should match the light KK tower in the dual heterotic description. To exactly match with the results in the distance conjecture, we propose that the definition of 8D Planck mass should receive a large correction. We have also computed parts of KK modes in 8D F-theory in a simplified setup, as well as the BPS string junction spectrum in specific setups of 6D and 4D F-theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is an elementary set of lectures on generalized global symmetries originally given at the Jena TPI School on QFT and Holography, designed to be accessible to the reader with a basic knowledge of quantum field theory. Topics covered include an introduction to higher-form symmetries with selected applications: Abelian and non-Abelian gauge theories in the continuum and on the lattice, statistical mechanical systems, the Adler-Bell-Jackiw anomaly from the point of view of non-invertible symmetry, and magnetohydrodynamics. Mathematical formalism is kept to a minimum and an emphasis is placed on understanding the global symmetry structure present in well-known models.</description>

Abstract: Carrollian amplitude is the natural object that defines the correlator of the boundary Carrollian field theory. In this work, we will elaborate on its proper definition in general dimensions. We use the vielbein field on the unit sphere to define the fundamental field with non-vanishing helicity in the local Cartesian frame which is the building block of the Carrollian amplitude. In general dimensions, the Carrollian amplitude is related to the momentum space scattering matrix by a modified Fourier transform. The Poincar\'e transformation law of the Carrollian amplitude in this definition has been discussed. We also find an isomorphism between the local rotation of the vielbein field and the superduality transformation.</description>

      <title>String Moduli Spaces and Parabolic Factorizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The symmetric spaces that appear as moduli spaces in string theory and supergravity can be decomposed with explicit metrics using parabolic subgroups. The resulting isometry between the original moduli space and this decomposition can be used to find parametrizations of the moduli. One application is to determine the volume parameter in conformal field moduli spaces for K3 surfaces. Other applications involve simple Dynkin diagram manipulations inducing "going up and down" between symmetric spaces by adding parameters and going to limits respectively. For supersymmetries such as N=6, this involves combinatorics of less familiar "restricted" Dynkin diagrams.</description>

      <title>Universal structure of islands in evaporating black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The entanglement entropy of the Hawking radiation contains contributions from a region inside the black hole, which is called islands, implying that the Hawking radiation contains the information of islands. The boundary of the island is given by the quantum extremal surface, whose position is determined so that the entanglement entropy is extremized. In many cases of stationary black holes and a few cases of evaporating black holes, it was already confirmed that the quantum extremal surface is located outside the horizon for stationary black holes and is inside the horizon for evaporating black holes. In this paper, we calculate islands in general black holes and show that the island extends to the outside of the horizon for stationary black holes but is hidden inside the horizon for evaporating black holes independent of details of the black hole.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the differential geometry of the moduli space of instantons on S^3 x S^1. Extending previous results, we show that a sigma-model with this target space can be expected to possess a large N=4 superconformal symmetry, supporting speculations that this sigma-model may be dual to Type IIB superstring theory on AdS_3 x S^3 x S^3 x S^1. The sigma-model is parametrized by three integers -- the rank of the gauge group, the instanton number, and a "level" (the integer coefficient of a topologically nontrivial B-field, analogous to a WZW level). These integers are expected to correspond to two five-brane charges and a one-brane charge. The sigma-model is weakly coupled when the level, conjecturally corresponding to one of the five-brane changes, becomes very large, keeping the other parameters fixed. The central charges of the large N=4 algebra agree, at least semiclassically, with expectations from the duality.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00880v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By considering the one loop background field method for a quark-antiquark interaction, mediated by one (non perturbative) gluon exchange, sixth order quark effective interactions are derived and investigated in the limit of zero momentum transfer for large quark and/or gluon effective masses. They extend fourth order quark interactions worked out in previous works of the author. These interactions break $U_A(1)$ symmetry and may be either momentum independent or dependent. Part of these interactions vanish in the limit of massless quarks, and several other -- involving vector and/or axial quark currents -- survive. In the local limit of the resulting interactions, some phenomenological implications are presented, which correspond to corrections to the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model. By means of the auxiliary field method, the local interactions give rise to three meson interactions whose values are compared to phenomenological values found in the literature. Contributions for meson-mixing parameters are calculated and compared to available results.</description>

      <title>Plasmonic Time Crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study plasmonic time crystals, which constitute an extension of the dielectric-based photonic time crystals to plasmonic media. A salient feature of plasmonic time crystals is their ability to support amplification of both longitudinal and transverse modes. In particular, we show that such systems support collective resonances of longitudinal modes, independently of the wave vector $k$. These resonances originate from the interaction between the positive and negative frequency branches of the plasmonic dispersion relation of the unmodulated system, and from the divergence of the density of states near the plasma frequency $\omega_p$. The strongest resonance occurs at a modulation frequency of $\Omega = 2 \omega_p$, associated with a direct inter-band transition. Higher-order resonances are associated with related mechanisms but at lower modulation frequencies. We demonstrate these resonances for various periodic modulation profiles, and also provide a generic perturbative formula for resonance widths in the limit of weak modulation amplitude, in the absence of losses. Our findings offer insights into using time-modulated plasmonic media to enhance optical gain.</description>

      <title>Can we learn from matter creation to solve the $H_{0}$ tension problem?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $H_{0}$ tension problem is studied in the light of a matter creation mechanism (an effective approach to replacing dark energy), the way to define the matter creation rate being of pure phenomenological nature. Bayesian (probabilistic) Machine Learning is used to learn the constraints on the free parameters of the models, with the learning being based on the generated expansion rate, $H(z)$. Taking advantage of the method, the constraints for three redshift ranges are learned. Namely, for the two redshift ranges: $z\in [0,2]$~(cosmic chronometers) and $z\in [0,2.5]$~(cosmic chronometers + BAO), covering already available $H(z)$ data, to validate the learned results; and for a third redshift interval, $z\in[0,5]$, for forecasting purposes. It is learned that the $3\alpha H_{0}$ term in the creation rate provides options that have the potential to solve the $H_{0}$ tension problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit multi-messenger constraints from neutron star mergers on the speed of propagation of gravitational and electromagnetic waves in Horndeski and beyond Horndeski theories. By considering non-trivial couplings between the dark energy field and the electromagnetic sector, the electromagnetic wave can propagate through the cosmological background at non-unit speed, altering the phenomenological constraints on its gravitational counterpart. In particular, we show that recent models derived from a Kaluza-Klein compactification of higher dimensional Horndeski models fall into a broader class of theories disformally related to those whose gravitational waves propagate with unit speed. This disformal equivalence can, however, be broken by the gravitational couplings to other sectors with interesting phenomenological consequences. We also consider higher order couplings between the scalar and the photon with second order field equations, and show that they are not compatible with constraints coming from multi-messenger speed tests and the decay of the gravitational wave.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider dynamics of a scalar field in compactification scenario of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet cosmology. It is shown that if the field is non-minimally coupled to curvature, its asymptotic value under certain conditions may be shifted from the minimum of its potential. This means that due to influence of extra dimensions a scalar field with $\lambda \phi^4$ potential can stabilise away from $\phi=0$ stable point which means an effective symmetry breaking occurs in such a system.</description>

      <title>On a Matrix Ensemble for Arbitrary Complex Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an exhaustive analytical exploration of a variation of the eigenvector ensemble initially proposed by Deutsch for the foundations of the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH) that drastically (but not fully) increases system-dependent information, and therefore serves as a model for the study of complex quantum systems beyond the universal Random Matrix Theory (RMT) regime. We especially focus on the remnants of system-specific information that modify the late-time behavior of correlation functions like the spectral form factor, or the inclusion of explicit system-dependent Hamiltonian corrections not captured by the RMT regime. The consistency of the predictions in the new ensemble with respect to the universal (Haar) one is made explicit by showing how that for arbitrary systems it defines an unitary 1-design and for strongly chaotic systems it becomes an approximated 2-design. While we are able to provide universal expressions for two- and four-point ensemble-averaged correlation functions and show how system-dependent information is spectrally decoupled, we also show that for small energy windows correlation functions defined by the new ensemble reduce to the predictions of the ETH.</description>

      <title>Mixmaster Universe in a 2D non-commutative GUP framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we examine the dynamical aspects of the cosmological Mixmaster model within the framework of non-commutative generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) theories. The theory is formulated classically by introducing a well-defined symplectic form that differs from the ordinary one, thereby inducing a general deformation of the Poisson brackets describing a precise class of GUP theories. In this general setting, we first investigate the behavior of the Bianchi I and Bianchi II models using Misner variables. Then, we study the Bianchi IX model in the Mixmaster approximation, which is well-known for accurately reproducing the dynamics of the point-particle Universe approaching the cosmological singularity. We derive the corresponding Belinsky-Khalatnikov-Lifshitz (BKL) map and then, by selecting a specific GUP model associated with string theory, we explicitly investigate its resulting features shaped by the non-commutative GUP scheme. Our findings reveal that the chaotic and ergodic behavior typically observed in the standard BKL map, which characterizes the point-Universe's approach to the singularity, is replaced by quasi-periodic orbits in the parameter space of the theory. This corresponds to an oscillatory behavior of the Universe's scale factors, dependent on the initial conditions.</description>

      <title>An analog of topological entanglement entropy for mixed states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose the convex-roof extension of quantum conditional mutual information ("co(QCMI)") as a diagnostic of long-range entanglement in a mixed state. We focus primarily on topological states subjected to local decoherence, and employ the Levin-Wen scheme to define co(QCMI), so that for a pure state, co(QCMI) equals topological entanglement entropy (TEE). By construction, co(QCMI) is zero if and only if a mixed state can be decomposed as a convex sum of pure states with zero TEE. We show that co(QCMI) is non-increasing with increasing decoherence when Kraus operators are proportional to the product of onsite unitaries. This implies that unlike a pure state transition between a topologically trivial and a non-trivial phase, the long-range entanglement at a decoherence-induced topological phase transition as quantified by co(QCMI) is less than or equal to that in the proximate topological phase. For the 2d toric code decohered by onsite bit/phase-flip noise, we show that co(QCMI) is non-zero below the error-recovery threshold and zero above it. Relatedly, the decohered state cannot be written as a convex sum of short-range entangled pure states below the threshold. We conjecture and provide evidence that in this example, co(QCMI) equals TEE of a recently introduced pure state. In particular, we develop a tensor-assisted Monte Carlo (TMC) computation method to efficiently evaluate the R\'enyi TEE for the aforementioned pure state and provide non-trivial consistency checks for our conjecture. We use TMC to also calculate the universal scaling dimension of the anyon-condensation order parameter at this transition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we obtain specific picture of the phase transitions for the 6-dimensional Gauss-Bonnet Anti-de Sitter (AdS) black hole with triple phases, using the generalized free energy we constructed and Kramers escape rate in stochastic motion. There are six possible phase transition processes between the three different stable states (small, medium, and large black hole states). During these phase transitions, there are two key temperatures. One is the temperature at which the medium black hole state emerges, and the other is the temperature at which the small black hole state annihilates. Meanwhile, two dynamic equilibrium processes are formed. One is a dynamic equilibrium of the transition from the medium black hole state to the large black hole state and the transition from the small black hole state to the medium black hole state. The other is a dynamic equilibrium of the transition from the small black hole state to the medium black hole state and the transition from the medium black hole state to the small black hole state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unmagnetized cold plasma modes are investigated in the context of the chiral Maxwell-Carroll-Field-Jackiw (MCJF) electrodynamics, where the axion chiral factor acts retrieving some typical properties of magnetized plasmas. The Maxwell equations are rewritten for a cold, uniform, and collisionless fluid plasma model, allowing us to determine the dispersion relation, new refractive indices and propagating modes. We find four distinct refractive indices modified by the purely timelike CFJ background that plays the magnetic conductivity chiral parameter role, associated with right-circularly polarized [RCP] and left-circularly polarized [LCP] waves. For each refractive index, the propagation and absorption zones are determined and illustrated for some specific parameter values. Modified RCP and LCP helicons are found in the low-frequency regime. The optical behavior is investigated, revealing that the chiral factor induces birefringence, measured in terms of the rotatory power (RP). The dichroism coefficient is carried out for the absorbing zones. The negative refraction zones may enhance the involved rotatory power, yielding RP sign reversion, a feature of rotating plasmas and MCFJ chiral plasmas.</description>

      <title>Four $\mathbb{S}\mathbb{T}\mathbb{U}$ Black Holes Shadows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we examine the optical behaviors and thermodynamic phase structures using shadow analysis for four $\mathbb{S}\mathbb{T}\mathbb{U}$ black holes. The study is conducted for four cases of charge configurations on the parameter space $\mathcal{M}\left(q_1,q_2,q_3,q_4\right)$. As a matter of fact, both the electric charge as a parameter and the parameter space $\mathcal{M}\left(q_1,q_2,q_3,q_4\right)$ affect the geometry of the black hole shadow, particularly the size of the shadow. We also introduce a constraint on the charge of the black hole from the observational results of the M87$^\star$ {\color{black}and Sgr A$^\star$} shadow. Furthermore, we show that the electric charge and the parameter space $\mathcal{M}\left(q_1,q_2,q_3,q_4\right)$ have a non-trivial impact on the variation of the energy emission rate. Interestingly enough, we find novel scenarios in which the evaporation is slower, which causes the lifetime of the black holes to be considerably elongated. On the other side, the phase structure of four $\mathbb{S}\mathbb{T}\mathbb{U}$ black holes is explored for two cases of electric charge configuration. The findings show a perfect correlation between the shadow and event horizon radii. This correlation is, in fact, helpful in discovering the phase transition in terms of the shadow radius. In addition, the microstructure is being analyzed in terms of shadow analysis, providing similar behavior to the ordinary situation of the Ruppeiner formalism.</description>

      <title>Quantum and thermal pressures from light scalar fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Light scalar fields play a variety of roles in modern physics, especially in cosmology and modified theories of gravity. For this reason, there is a zoo of experiments actively trying to find evidence for many scalar field models that have been proposed in theoretical considerations. Among those are setups in which the pressures expected to be induced by light scalar fields between two parallel plates are studied, for example, Casimir force experiments. While it is known that classical and quantum pressures caused by light scalar fields could have significant impacts on such experiments, in this article, we show that this can also be the case for thermal pressure. More specifically, we derive expressions for the quantum and thermal pressures induced by exchanges of light scalar field fluctuations between two thin parallel plates. As particular examples, we then look at screened scalar fields. For chameleon, symmetron and environment-dependent dilaton models, we find large regions in their parameter spaces that allow for thermal pressures to equal or exceed the quantum pressures. By comparing with earlier constraints from quantum pressure calculations, we conclude that thermal pressures induced by chameleons are actually of experimental significance.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian formulation for scalar model of spontaneous spacetime symmetry violation in gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The focus of this article is on a modification of General Relativity (GR) governed by a dynamical scalar field. The latter is able to acquire a nonzero spacetime-dependent vacuum expectation value, which gives rise to a spontaneous violation of spacetime symmetries. Based on the (3+1) decomposition, we demonstrate how to develop the Hamiltonian formulation for this model. Having done so, our primary interest is to understand how spontaneous spacetime symmetry violation manifests itself in such a setting. In particular, we find that the constraint structure of GR is preserved, although the constraints are clearly modified by the scalar background field. These results emphasize the beauty of spontaneous spacetime symmetry violation in gravity from the viewpoint of the Hamiltonian formulation. They may pose the base for further studies of more sophisticated models of vector and higher-rank tensor fields. Moreover, the description developed can bear fruits when applied within phenomenological quests for spacetime symmetry violation in gravity, in particular, at cosmological scales.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes of rapidly rotating Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet-dilaton black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasinormal modes of rapidly rotating black holes are crucial in understanding the ringdown phase after a merger. While for Kerr black holes these modes have been known for a long time, their calculation has remained a challenge in alternative theories of gravity. We obtain the spectrum of quasinormal modes of rapidly rotating black holes in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet-dilaton theory without resorting to perturbation theory in the coupling constant. Our approach is based on a spectral decomposition of the linear perturbations of the metric and the scalar field. The quasinormal modes approach smoothly the slow rotation and weak coupling limits known from perturbative studies.</description>

      <title>Phase Transition Dynamics of Black Holes Influenced by Kaniadakis and Barrow Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the dynamics and frame-by-frame phase transition of the first order in black hole thermodynamics. For our analysis, we will utilize the Kramers escape rate. Our focus is on charged anti-de Sitter (AdS) black holes influenced by Kaniadakis and Barrow statistics. The selection of these black holes aims to examine the effects of entropy variation on the dynamics of phase transition and to demonstrate that the Kramers escape rate, as an efficient tool, can effectively represent the dynamic transition from a small to a large black hole within the domain of first-order phase transitions. It is noteworthy that while the transition from small to large black holes should ostensibly dominate the entire process, our results indicate that the escape rate undergoes changes as it passes through the midpoint of the phase transition, leading to a reverse escape phenomenon. The findings suggest that the dynamic phase transition in charged AdS black holes affected by entropy change bears a significant resemblance to the outcomes of models influenced by Bekenstein-Hawking entropy\cite{23}. This similarity in results could serve as an additional motivation to further explore the potential capabilities of Kaniadakis and Barrow statistics in related cosmological fields. These capabilities could enhance our understanding of other cosmological properties</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ the isomonodromic method to study linear scalar massive perturbations of Kerr black holes for generic scalar masses $M\mu$ and generic black hole spins $a/M$. A degeneracy between the longest-living quasinormal mode and the first overtone is found for $(M\mu)_c \simeq 0.3704981$ and $(a/M)_c\simeq 0.9994660$. We show that the longest-living mode and the first overtone change continuously into each other as we vary the parameters around the point of degeneracy, providing evidence for the existence of a geometric phase around an exceptional point. We interpret our findings through a thermodynamic analogy.</description>

Abstract: We study a class of two-point functions in a conformal field theory near a wedge. This is a set-up with two boundaries intersecting at an angle $\theta$. We compute it as a solution to the Dyson-Schwinger equation of motion for a quartic interaction in the $d=4-\epsilon$ bulk and in the $d=3-\epsilon$ boundary, up to order $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon)$. We have extracted the anomalous dimensions from such correlators and we have complemented them with Feynman diagrams computations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.11787v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Disentangled black hole microstates are atypical states in holographic CFTs whose gravity duals do not have smooth horizons. If there exist sufficiently many disentangled microstates to account for the entire black hole entropy, then any black hole microstate can be written as a superposition of states without smooth horizons. We show that there exist sufficiently many disentangled microstates to account for almost the entire black hole entropy of a large AdS black hole at the semiclassical limit $G_N\rightarrow 0$. In addition, we also argue that in generic quantum many-body systems with short-ranged interactions, there exist sufficiently many area law states in the microcanonical subspace to account for almost the entire thermodynamic entropy in the standard thermodynamic limit. Area law states are atypical since a typical state should contain volume law entanglement. Furthermore, we also present an explicit way to construct such a set of area law states, and argue that the same construction may also be used to construct disentangled states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.12281v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a mechanism that couples matter fields to three-dimensional de Sitter quantum gravity. Our construction is based on the Chern-Simons formulation of three-dimensional Euclidean gravity, and it centers on a collection of Wilson loops winding around Euclidean de Sitter space. We coin this object a Wilson spool. To construct the spool, we build novel representations of $\mathfrak{su}(2)$. To evaluate the spool, we adapt and exploit several known exact results in Chern-Simons theory. Our proposal correctly reproduces the one-loop determinant of a free massive scalar field on $S^3$ as $G_N\to 0$. Moreover, allowing for quantum metric fluctuations, it can be systematically evaluated to any order in perturbation theory.</description>

Abstract: We study correlation functions of the bulk stress tensor and boundary operators in Quantum Field Theories (QFT) in Anti-de Sitter (AdS) space. In particular, we derive new sum rules from the two-point function of the stress tensor and its three-point function with two boundary operators. In AdS2, this leads to a bootstrap setup that involves the central charge of the UV limit of the bulk QFT and may allow us to follow a Renormalization Group (RG) flow non-perturbatively by continuously varying the AdS radius. Along the way, we establish the convergence properties of the newly discovered local block decomposition of the three-point function.</description>

Abstract: I discuss singular loci in the phase spaces of theories which lack globally well-defined numbers of dynamical modes. This is a topic which appears quite often in the recent literature on modified gravity. In particular, there were discussions about $R^2$ gravity around Minkowski space. It is a relatively simple case, and still there were some confusions. It clearly shows that one should be very accurate when trying to understand a potentially problematic theory through perturbations around a simply looking background. At the same time, many modern teleparallel approaches are laden with even more severe issues. Therefore, it is a topic which is certainly worth carefully thinking about.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.11361v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct Carrollian higher spin field theories by reducing the bosonic Fronsdal theories in flat spacetime to future null infinity. We extend the Poincar\'e fluxes to quantum flux operators which generate Carrollian diffeomorphism, namely supertranslation and superrotation. These flux operators form a closed symmetry algebra once including a helicity flux operator which follows from higher spin super-duality transformation. The super-duality transformation is an angle-dependent transformation at future null infinity which generalizes the usual electro-magnetic duality transformation. The results agree with the lower spin cases when restricting to $s=0,1,2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14233v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a solvable class of five-dimensional dilaton gravity models that continuously interpolate between anti-de Sitter (AdS$_5$), linear dilaton (LD$_5$) and positively curved spacetimes as a function of a continuous parameter $\nu$. The dilaton vacuum expectation value is set by a potential localized on a flat brane. We chart the elementary properties of these backgrounds for any admissible $\nu$, and determine stability conditions of the brane-dilaton system. We find that the spectrum of metric fluctuations can be either continuous or discrete. It features a massless graviton mode confined between the brane and the curvature singularity, and a massive radion mode tied to brane-dilaton stability. We show that, in the presence of a bulk black hole, the holographic theory living on the brane features a perfect fluid. The equation of state of the holographic fluid interpolates between radiation, pressureless matter and vacuum energy as a function of $\nu$. This extends earlier findings on holographic fluids. Our results suggest that the thermodynamics of the fluid mirrors precisely the thermodynamics of the bulk black hole.</description>

Abstract: The numerical conformal bootstrap has become in the last 15 years an indispensable tool for studying strongly coupled CFTs in various dimensions. Here we review the main developments in the field in the last 5 years, since the appearance of the previous comprehensive review \cite{Poland:2018epd}. We describe developments in the software ({\tt SDPB 2.0}, {\tt scalar\_blocks}, {\tt blocks\_3d}, {\tt autoboot}, {\tt hyperion}, {\tt simpleboot}), and on the algorithmic side (Delauney triangulation, cutting surface, tiptop, navigator function, skydive). We also describe the main physics applications which were obtained using the new technology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.07667v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider 3d N=2 non-abelian Hanany-Witten brane setups with chiral flavor symmetry. We propose that the associated field theories are quivers with improved bifundamentals, instead of standard bifundamentals. The improved bifundamental is a strongly coupled SCFT that carries one more U(1) global symmetry than the standard bifundamental. As a consequence, our proposal overcomes the long standing challenge of associating to each N=2 brane setup a gauge theory with the full rank global symmetry, allowing the study of all the usual supersymmetric observables, such as superconformal index, sphere partition function, chiral ring and moduli space. The construction passes many non-trivial tests, for instance we algorithmically prove that any two improved quivers associated to S-dual brane setups are infrared dual. The 3d N=2 mirror dualities can be uplifted to 4d dualities with 4d improved bifundamentals connecting USp(2N) nodes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04120v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive the Carrollian amplitude in the framework of bulk reduction. The Carrollian amplitude is shown to relate to the scattering amplitude by a Fourier transform in this method. We propose Feynman rules to calculate the Carrollian amplitude where the Fourier transforms emerge as the integral representation of the external lines in the Carrollian space. Then we study the four-point Carrollian amplitude at loop level in massless $\Phi^4$ theory. As a consequence of Poincar\'e invariance, the four-point Carrollian amplitude can be transformed to the amplitude that only depends on the cross ratio $z$ of the celestial sphere and a variable $\chi$ invariant under translation. The four-point Carrollian amplitude is a polynomial of the two-point Carrollian amplitude whose argument is replaced with $\chi$. The coefficients of the polynomial have branch cuts in the complex $z$ plane. We also show that the renormalized Carrollian amplitude obeys the Callan-Symanzik equation. Moreover, we initiate a generalized $\Phi^4$ theory by designing the Feynman rules for more general Carrollian amplitude.</description>

      <title>RG flows in de Sitter: c-functions and sum rules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03739v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the renormalization group flow of unitary Quantum Field Theories on two-dimensional de Sitter (dS) spacetime. We prove the existence of two functions of the radius of dS that interpolate between the central charges of the UV and IR fixed points of the flow when tuning the radius $R$ while keeping the mass scales fixed. The first is constructed from certain components of the two-point function of the stress tensor evaluated at antipodal separation. The second is the spectral weight of the stress tensor in the $\Delta=2$ discrete series. This last fact implies that the stress tensor of any unitary QFT in dS$_2$ must interpolate between the vacuum and states in the $\Delta=2$ discrete series irrep. We verify that the c-functions are monotonic for intermediate radii in the free massive boson and free massive fermion theories, but we lack a general proof of said monotonicity. We derive a variety of sum rules that relate the central charges and the c-functions to integrals of the two-point function of the trace of the stress tensor and to integrals of its spectral densities. The positivity of these formulas implies $c^{\text{UV}}\geq c^{\text{IR}}$. In the infinite radius limit the sum rules reduce to the well known formulas in flat space. Throughout the paper, we prove some general properties of the spectral decomposition of the stress tensor in dS$_{d+1}$.</description>

Abstract: In this study, we explore the correlation functions of thin-shell operators, represented semiclassically by a homogeneous, thin interface of dust particles. Employing the monodromy method, we successfully compute the contribution from the Virasoro vacuum block and present the monodromy equation in a closed form without assuming the probe limit. Although an analytical solution to the monodromy equation remains difficult, we demonstrate that it is perturbatively solvable within specific limits, including the probe, the heavy-shell, and the early-time limits. Moreover, we compare our results with gravitational calculations and find precise agreement. We strengthen our findings by proving that the thermal correlation functions in gravity, after an inverse Laplace transformation, satisfy the field theory's monodromy equation. Additionally, we identify an infinite series of unphysical solutions to the monodromy equation and discuss their potential geometrical duals.</description>

      <title>Spectral representation in Klein space: simplifying celestial leaf amplitudes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02342v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the spectral representation in Klein space, which is the split $(2,2)$ signature flat spacetime. The Klein space can be foliated into Lorentzian $\mathrm{AdS}_3 /\mathbb{Z}$ slices, and its identity resolution has continuous and discrete parts. We calculate the identity resolution and the Plancherel measure in these slices. Using the foliation of Klein space into the slices, the identity resolution, and the Plancherel measure in each slice, we compute the spectral representation of the massive bulk-to-bulk propagator in Klein space. It can be expressed as the sum of the product of two massive (or tachyonic) conformal primary wavefunctions, with both continuous and discrete parts, and sharing a common boundary coordinate. An interesting point in Klein space is that, since the identity resolution has discrete and continuous parts, a new type of conformal primary wavefunction naturally arises for the massive (or tachyonic) case. For the conformal primary wavefunctions, both the discrete and continuous parts involve integrating over the common boundary coordinate and the real (or imaginary) mass. The conformal dimension is summed in the discrete part, whereas it is integrated in the continuous part. The spectral representation in Klein space is a computational tool to derive conformal block expansions for celestial amplitudes in Klein space and its building blocks, called celestial leaf amplitudes, by integrating the particle interaction vertex over a single slice of foliation.</description>

In our work, we show that under the loosest set of boundary conditions, the asymptotic symmetry algebras consist of two copies of the $\mathfrak{osp}(3|2)_k$ and $\mathfrak{osp}(4|2)_k$ algebras. We subsequently restrict the gauge fields upon the boundary conditions to achieve supersymmetric extensions of the Brown$\,-\,$Henneaux boundary conditions. Based on these results, we finally find that the asymptotic symmetry algebras are two copies of the $\mathcal{N}=3$ and $\mathcal{N}=4$ superconformal algebras for $\mathcal{N}=(3,3)$ and $\mathcal{N}=(4,4)$ extended higher$\,-\,$spin supergravity theory in $AdS_3$.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the average value of the Frobenius trace at p over elliptic curves in a fixed conductor range with given rank. Plotting this average as p varies over the primes yields a striking oscillating pattern, the details of which vary with the rank. Based on this observation, we perform various data-scientific experiments with the goal of classifying elliptic curves according to their ranks.</description>

      <title>Generating new gravitational solutions by matrix multiplication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.01702v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Explicit solutions to the non-linear field equations of some gravitational theories can be obtained, by means of a Riemann-Hilbert approach, from a canonical Wiener-Hopf factorisation of certain matrix functions called monodromy matrices. In this paper we describe other types of factorisation from which solutions can be constructed in a similar way. Our approach is based on an invariance problem, which does not constitute a Riemann-Hilbert problem and allows to construct solutions that could not have been obtained by Wiener-Hopf factorisation of a monodromy matrix. It gives rise to a novel solution generating method based on matrix multiplications. We show, in particular, that new solutions can be obtained by multiplicative deformation of the canonical Wiener-Hopf factorisation, provided the latter exists, and that one can superpose such solutions. Examples of applications include Kasner, Einstein-Rosen wave and gravitational pulse wave solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.00320v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a recent conjecture of Borot et al. that a particular universal closed algebraic formula recovers the correlation differentials of topological recursion after the swap of $x$ and $y$ in the input data. We also show that this universal formula can be drastically simplified (as it was already done by Hock).
  As an application of this general $x-y$ swap result, we prove an explicit closed formula for the topological recursion differentials for the case of any spectral curve with unramified $y$ and arbitrary rational $x$.</description>

      <title>The split majoron model confronts the NANOGrav signal and cosmological tensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.03184v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the light of the evidence of a gravitational wave background from the NANOGrav 15yr data set, we reconsider the split majoron model as a new physics extension of the standard model able to generate a needed contribution to solve the current tension between the data and the standard interpretation in terms of inspiraling supermassive black hole massive binaries. In the split majoron model the seesaw right-handed neutrinos acquire Majorana masses from spontaneous symmetry breaking of global $U(1)_{B-L}$ in a strong first order phase transition of a complex scalar field occurring above the electroweak scale. The final vacuum expectation value couples to a second complex scalar field undergoing a low scale phase transition occurring after neutrino decoupling. Such a coupling enhances the strength of this second low scale first order phase transition and can generate a sizeable primordial gravitational wave background contributing to the NANOGrav 15yr signal. Some amount of extra-radiation is generated after neutron-to-proton ration freeze-out but prior to nucleosynthesis. This can be either made compatible with current upper bound from primordial deuterium measurements or even be used to solve a potential deuterium problem. Moreover, the free streaming length of light neutrinos can be suppressed by their interactions with the resulting majoron background and this mildly ameliorates existing cosmological tensions. Thus cosmological observations nicely provide independent motivations for the model.</description>

      <title>Quantum Algebra of Chern-Simons Matrix Model and Large $N$ Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.14046v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the algebra of quantum observables of the Chern-Simons matrix model which was originally proposed by Susskind and Polychronakos to describe electrons in fractional quantum Hall effects. We establish the commutation relations for its generators and study the large $N$ limit of its representation. We show that the large $N$ limit algebra is isomorphic to the uniform in $N$ algebra studied by Costello, which is isomorphic to the deformed double current algebra studied by Guay. Under appropriate scaling limit, we show that the large $N$ limit algebra degenerates to a Lie algebra which admits a surjective map to the affine Lie algebra of $\mathfrak{u}(p)$. This leads to a complete proof of the large $N$ emergence of the $\mathfrak{u}(p)$ current algebra as proposed by Dorey, Tong and Turner. This also suggests a rigorous derivation of edge excitation of a fractional quantum Hall droplet.</description>

      <title>Efficient Simulation of Low Temperature Physics in One-Dimensional Gapless Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.02519v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the computational efficiency of the finite temperature simulation with the minimally entangled typical thermal states (METTS). To argue that METTS can be efficiently represented as matrix product states, we present an analytic upper bound for the average entanglement Renyi entropy of METTS for Renyi index $0&lt;q\leq 1$. In particular, for 1D gapless systems described by CFTs, the upper bound scales as $\mathcal{O}(c N^0 \log \beta)$ where $c$ is the central charge and $N$ is the system size. Furthermore, we numerically find that the average Renyi entropy exhibits a universal behavior characterized by the central charge and is roughly given by half of the analytic upper bound. Based on these results, we show that METTS provide a significant speedup compared to employing the purification method to analyze thermal equilibrium states at low temperatures in 1D gapless systems.</description>

      <title>Hyperpolyadic structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.01366v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new class of division algebras, the hyperpolyadic algebras, which correspond to the binary division algebras $\mathbb{R}$, $\mathbb{C}$, $\mathbb{H}$, $\mathbb{O}$ without considering new elements. First, we use the matrix polyadization procedure proposed earlier which increases the dimension of the algebra. The algebras obtained in this way obey binary addition and a nonderived n-ary multiplication and their subalgebras are division n-ary algebras. For each invertible element we define a new norm which is polyadically multiplicative, and the corresponding map is a $n$-ary homomorphism. We define a polyadic analog of the Cayley-Dickson construction which corresponds to the consequent embedding of monomial matrices from the polyadization procedure. We then obtain another series of n-ary algebras corresponding to the binary division algebras which have a higher dimension, that is proportional to the intermediate arities. Second, a new polyadic product of vectors in any vector space is defined. Endowed with this product the vector space becomes a polyadic algebra which is a division algebra under some invertibility conditions, and its structure constants are computed. Third, we propose a new iterative process ("imaginary tower"), which leads to nonunital nonderived ternary division algebras of half the dimension, which we call "half-quaternions" and "half-octonions". The latter are not subalgebras of the binary division algebras, but subsets only, since they have different arity. Nevertheless, they are actually ternary division algebras, because they allow division, and their nonzero elements are invertible. From the multiplicativity of the introduced "half-quaternion" norm we obtain the ternary analog of the sum of two squares identity. We show that the ternary division algebra of imaginary "half-octonions" is unitless and totally associative.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17737v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel way to define imaginary root subgroups associated with (timelike) imaginary roots of hyperbolic Kac-Moody algebras. Using in an essential way the theory of unitary irreducible representation of covers of the group SO(2,1), these imaginary root subgroups act on the complex Kac-Moody algebra viewed as a Hilbert space. We illustrate our new view on Kac-Moody groups by considering the example of a rank-two hyperbolic algebra that is related to the Fibonacci numbers. We also point out some open issues and new avenues for further research, and briefly discuss the potential relevance of the present results for physics and current attempts at unification.</description>

      <title>Exploring Self-Gravitating Cylindrical Structures in Modified Gravity: Insights from Scalar-Vector-Tensor Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09852v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate static cylindrical solutions within an extended theory of modified gravity. By incorporating various coupling functions through a straightforward boost symmetry approach, we establish the equations of motion in a self-consistent manner and subsequently determine the linear scalar field profile. Utilizing analytical methods, we solve the system of equations for the metric functions and the $U(1)$ gauge field, revealing their dependence on Bessel's functions. To comprehend gravito-objects exhibiting cylindrical symmetry, we develop a perturbative framework aimed at identifying all nontrivial solutions for the scalar profiles. Introducing first-order truncated perturbation equations for the gauge field, synchronized with metric gauges and electromagnetic field considerations, we demonstrate their integrability and obtain solutions through quadrature. Our findings suggest the feasibility of obtaining self-gravitating cylindrical structures within the scalar-vector-tensor theory.</description>

Abstract: We show that it is not possible to concentrate enough light to precipitate the formation of an event horizon.

      <title>Dimensional reduction gauge and effective dimensional reduction in the four-dimensional Yang-Mills theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03172v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by one-dimensional color-electric flux-tube formation in four-dimensional (4D) QCD, we investigate a possibility of effective dimensional reduction in the 4D Yang-Mills (YM) theory. We propose a new gauge fixing of "dimensional reduction (DR) gauge" defined so as to minimize $R_{\mathrm{DR}}~\equiv~\int d^{4}s ~ \mathrm{Tr} \left[ A_{x}^{2}(s) + A_{y}^{2}(s) \right]$, which has a residual gauge symmetry for the gauge function $\Omega (t,z)$ like 2D QCD on the $t$-$z$ plane. We investigate effective dimensional reduction in the DR gauge using SU(3) quenched lattice QCD at $\beta = 6.0$. The amplitude of $A_{x}(s)$ and $A_{y}(s)$ are found to be strongly suppressed in the DR gauge. We consider "$tz$-projection" of $A_{x,y}(s) \to 0$ for the gauge configuration generated in the DR gauge, in a similar sense to Abelian projection in the maximally Abelian gauge. By the $tz$-projection in the DR gauge, the interquark potential is not changed, and $A_{t}(s)$ and $A_{z}(s)$ play a dominant role in quark confinement. In the DR gauge, we calculate a spatial correlation $\langle \mathrm{Tr} A_{\perp}(s) A_{\perp}(s+ra_{\perp}) \rangle ~ (\perp = x,y)$ and estimate the spatial mass of $A_{\perp}(s) ~ (\perp = x,y)$ as $M \simeq 1.7 ~ \mathrm{GeV}$. It is conjectured that this large mass makes $A_{\perp}(s)$ inactive and realizes the dominance of $A_{t}(s)$ and $A_{z}(s)$ in infrared region in the DR gauge. We also calculate the spatial correlation of two temporal link-variables and find that the correlation decreases as $\exp (-mr)$ with $m \simeq 0.6 ~ \mathrm{GeV}$. Using a crude approximation, the 4D YM theory is reduced into an ensemble of 2D YM systems with the coupling of $g_{\rm 2D} = g m$.</description>

      <title>A Diffused Background from Axion-like Particles in the Microwave Sky</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08879v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The nature of dark matter is an unsolved cosmological problem and axions are one of the weakly interacting cold dark matter candidates. Axions or ALPs (Axion-like particles) are pseudo-scalar bosons predicted by beyond-standard model theories. The weak coupling of ALPs with photons leads to the conversion of CMB photons to ALPs in the presence of a transverse magnetic field. If they have the same mass as the effective mass of a photon in a plasma, the resonant conversion would cause a polarized spectral distortion leading to temperature fluctuations with the distortion spectrum. The probability of resonant conversion depends on the properties of the cluster such as the magnetic field, electron density, and its redshift. We show that this kind of conversion can happen in numerous unresolved galaxy clusters up to high redshifts, which will lead to a diffused polarised anisotropy signal in the microwave sky. The spectrum of the signal and its shape in the angular scale will be different from the lensed CMB polarization signal. This new polarised distortion spectrum will be correlated with the distribution of clusters in the universe and hence, with the large-scale structure. The spectrum can then be probed using its spectral and spatial variation with respect to the CMB and various foregrounds. An SNR of $\sim$ 4.36 and $\sim$ 93.87 are possible in the CMB-S4 145 GHz band and CMB-HD 150 GHz band respectively for a photon-ALPs coupling strength of $\mathrm{g_{a \gamma} = 10^{-12} \, GeV^{-1}}$ using galaxy clusters beyond redshift z $= 1$. The same signal would lead to additional RMS fluctuations of $\sim \mathrm{7.5 \times 10^{-2} \, \mu K}$ at 145 GHz. In the absence of any signal, future CMB experiments such as Simons Observatory (SO), CMB-S4, and CMB-HD can put constraints on coupling strength better than current bounds from particle physics experiment CERN Axion Solar Telescope (CAST).</description>

      <title>Atom falling into a quantum corrected charged black hole and HBAR entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13087v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In an earlier analysis \href{https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.105.085007}{Phys. Rev. D 105 (2022) 085007}, we have explored the event of acceleration radiation for an atom freely falling into the event horizon of a quantum-corrected Schwarzschild black hole. We want to explore the acceleration-radiation when the atom is freely falling into the event horizon of a charged quantum-corrected black hole. We consider the quantum effects of the electromagnetic field along with the gravitational field in an asymptotic safety regime. Introducing the quantum improved Reisner-Nordstr\"{o}m metric, we have calculated the excitation probability of a two-level atom freely falling into the event horizon of quantum improved charged black hole. Recently, in the case of the braneworld black hole (where the tidal charge has the same dimension as the square of the charge of a Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black hole in natural units), we have observed from the form of the transition probability that the temperature will have no contribution in the first order of the tidal charge. We observe that for a quantum corrected Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black hole, there is a second-order contribution in the charge parameter in the temperature that can be read off from the transition probability. Next, we calculate the HBAR entropy in this thought experiment and show that this entropy has a leading order Bekenstein-Hawking entropy term along with some higher order correction terms involving logarithmic as well as fractional terms of the black hole area due to infalling photons. We have finally investigated the validity of Wien's displacement law and compared the critical value of the field wavelength with the general Schwarzschild black hole and its corresponding quantum-corrected case.</description>

Abstract: In the present work, we analyze several strange as well as non-strange relative hadronic yields obtained in the ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions (URHIC) experiments over a wide range of centre-of-mass collision energy ($\sqrt{s_{NN}}$). We invoke the formation of a hot and dense hadronic resonance gas (HRG) in the final stage following the URHIC. We use an earlier proposed thermodynamically consistent approach for obtaining the equation of state (EoS) of a HRG. It takes into account an important aspect of the hadronic interaction, viz., the hadronic hard-core repulsion, by assigning hard-core volumes to the hadrons, leading to an excluded volume (EV) type effect. We have invoked the bag model approach to assign hard-core volumes to baryons (antibaryons) while treating mesons to be point particles. We employ ansatz to obtain the dependence of the temperature and BCP of the HRG system on the centre-of-mass energy in the URHIC. We also find strong evidence of double freeze-out scenario, corresponding to baryons (antibaryons) and mesons, respectively. Strangeness (anti-strangeness) imbalance factor is also seen to play an important role in explaining the ratio of strange hadrons to the non-strange ones. The HRG model can explain the experimental data on various relative hadronic multiplicities quite satisfactorily over a wide range of $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$, ranging from the lowest RHIC energies to the highest LHC energies for the set of the model parameters obtaining the best theoretical fit to the experimental data by minimizing the $\chi^{2}$/dof value.</description>

Abstract: Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs), aimed at detecting gravitational waves (GWs) in the $1\sim 100$ nHz range, have recently made significant strides. Compelling evidence has emerged for a common spectrum signal spatially correlated among pulsars, following a Hellings-Downs (HD) pattern, which is crucial for detecting a gravitational-wave background (GWB). However, the HD curve is expected for discrete and non-interfering sources, which is unlikely to hold in realistic scenarios with potential interference among numerous GW sources, such as the supermassive black-hole binaries. Incorporating interference was previously expected to introduce an irreducible uncertainty (known as "cosmic variance") in discerning the HD correlation; however, our work reveals how this interference generates measurable frequency-dependent spatial correlations distinct from the HD curve. The spatial correlations for interfering sources (referred to as "ISC") still exhibit contributions in the quadrupole and higher orders, resembling the HD correlation and encoding the nature of GW radiations. We apply these novel correlations to search for a GWB in the NANOGrav 15-year data set. In an optimistic estimation, our findings show a Bayes factor of $33.7\pm 3.2$ comparing ISC to the HD correlation, and an improvement in optimal statistic signal-to-noise ratio from $4.9\pm 1.1$ for the HD correlation to $6.6\pm 1.7$ for the ISC, highlighting the significant enhancement in evidence for detecting a GWB through incorporating interference.</description>
