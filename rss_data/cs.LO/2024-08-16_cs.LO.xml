      <title>Physically Aware Synthesis Revisited: Guiding Technology Mapping with Primitive Logic Gate Placement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A typical VLSI design flow is divided into separated front-end logic synthesis and back-end physical design (PD) stages, which often require costly iterations between these stages to achieve design closure. Existing approaches face significant challenges, notably in utilizing feedback from physical metrics to better adapt and refine synthesis operations, and in establishing a unified and comprehensive metric. This paper introduces a new Primitive logic gate placement guided technology MAPping (PigMAP) framework to address these challenges. With approximating technology-independent spatial information, we develop a novel wirelength (WL) driven mapping algorithm to produce PD-friendly netlists. PigMAP is equipped with two schemes: a performance mode that focuses on optimizing the critical path WL to achieve high performance, and a power mode that aims to minimize the total WL, resulting in balanced power and performance outcomes. We evaluate our framework using the EPFL benchmark suites with ASAP7 technology, using the OpenROAD tool for place-and-route. Compared with OpenROAD flow scripts, performance mode reduces delay by 14% while increasing power consumption by only 6%. Meanwhile, power mode achieves a 3% improvement in delay and a 9% reduction in power consumption.</description>

      <title>On the Expressivity of Typed Concurrent Calculi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This thesis embarks on a comprehensive exploration of formal computational models that underlie typed programming languages. We focus on programming calculi, both functional (sequential) and concurrent, as they provide a compelling rigorous framework for evaluating program semantics and for developing analyses and program verification techniques. This is the full version of the thesis containing appendices.</description>

      <title>Efficiently grounding FOL using bit vectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several paradigms for declarative problem solving start from a specification in a high-level language, which is then transformed to a low-level language, such as SAT or SMT. Often, this transformation includes a "grounding" step to remove first-order quantification. To reduce the time and size of the grounding, it can be useful to simplify formulas along the way, e.g., by already taking into account the interpretation of symbols that are already known. In this paper, we investigate the use of bit vectors to efficiently simplify formulas, thereby taking advantage of the fact that, on modern hardware, logical operations on bit vectors can be executed extremely fast. We conduct an experimental analysis, which shows that bit vectors are indeed fast for certain problems, but also have limitations.</description>

      <title>Derivatives on Graphs for the Positive Calculus of Relations with Transitive Closure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the equational theory of the positive calculus of relations with transitive closure (PCoR*) is EXPSPACE-complete. PCoR* terms consist of the following standard operators on binary relations: identity, empty, universality, union, intersection, composition, converse, and reflexive-transitive closure (so, PCoR* terms subsume Kleene algebra terms and allegory terms as fragments). Additionally, we show that the equational theory of PCoR* extended with tests and nominals (in hybrid logic) is still EXPSPACE-complete; moreover, it is PSPACE-complete for its intersection-free fragment.</description>

      <title>DeepSeek-Prover-V1.5: Harnessing Proof Assistant Feedback for Reinforcement Learning and Monte-Carlo Tree Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce DeepSeek-Prover-V1.5, an open-source language model designed for theorem proving in Lean 4, which enhances DeepSeek-Prover-V1 by optimizing both training and inference processes. Pre-trained on DeepSeekMath-Base with specialization in formal mathematical languages, the model undergoes supervised fine-tuning using an enhanced formal theorem proving dataset derived from DeepSeek-Prover-V1. Further refinement is achieved through reinforcement learning from proof assistant feedback (RLPAF). Beyond the single-pass whole-proof generation approach of DeepSeek-Prover-V1, we propose RMaxTS, a variant of Monte-Carlo tree search that employs an intrinsic-reward-driven exploration strategy to generate diverse proof paths. DeepSeek-Prover-V1.5 demonstrates significant improvements over DeepSeek-Prover-V1, achieving new state-of-the-art results on the test set of the high school level miniF2F benchmark ($63.5\%$) and the undergraduate level ProofNet benchmark ($25.3\%$).</description>

      <title>Scaling Up Natural Language Understanding for Multi-Robots Through the Lens of Hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long-horizon planning is hindered by challenges such as uncertainty accumulation, computational complexity, delayed rewards and incomplete information. This work proposes an approach to exploit the task hierarchy from human instructions to facilitate multi-robot planning. Using Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose a two-step approach to translate multi-sentence instructions into a structured language, Hierarchical Linear Temporal Logic (LTL), which serves as a formal representation for planning. Initially, LLMs transform the instructions into a hierarchical representation defined as Hierarchical Task Tree, capturing the logical and temporal relations among tasks. Following this, a domain-specific fine-tuning of LLM translates sub-tasks of each task into flat LTL formulas, aggregating them to form hierarchical LTL specifications. These specifications are then leveraged for planning using off-the-shelf planners. Our framework not only bridges the gap between instructions and algorithmic planning but also showcases the potential of LLMs in harnessing hierarchical reasoning to automate multi-robot task planning. Through evaluations in both simulation and real-world experiments involving human participants, we demonstrate that our method can handle more complex instructions compared to existing methods. The results indicate that our approach achieves higher success rates and lower costs in multi-robot task allocation and plan generation.

      <title>Queries With Exact Truth Values in Paraconsistent Description Logics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07283v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel approach to querying classical inconsistent description logic (DL) knowledge bases by adopting a~paraconsistent semantics with the four Belnapian values: exactly true ($\mathbf{T}$), exactly false ($\mathbf{F}$), both ($\mathbf{B}$), and neither ($\mathbf{N}$). In contrast to prior studies on paraconsistent DLs, we allow truth value operators in the query language, which can be used to differentiate between answers having contradictory evidence and those having only positive evidence. We present a reduction to classical DL query answering that allows us to pinpoint the precise combined and data complexity of answering queries with values in paraconsistent $\mathcal{ALCHI}$ and its sublogics. Notably, we show that tractable data complexity is retained for Horn DLs. We present a comparison with repair-based inconsistency-tolerant semantics, showing that the two approaches are incomparable.</description>

      <title>Trade-offs between classical and quantum space using spooky pebbling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10579v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pebble games are used to study space/time trade-offs. Recently, spooky pebble games were introduced to study classical space / quantum space / time trade-offs for simulation of classical circuits on quantum computers. In this paper, the spooky pebble game framework is applied for the first time to general circuits. Using this framework we prove an upper bound for quantum space in the spooky pebble game. We also prove that solving the spooky pebble game is PSPACE-complete. Moreover, we present a solver for the spooky pebble game based on satisfiability solvers combined with heuristic optimizers. This spooky pebble game solver was empirically evaluated by calculating optimal classical space / quantum space / time trade-offs. Within limited runtime, the solver could find a strategy reducing quantum space when classical space is taken into account, showing that the spooky pebble model is useful to reduce quantum space.</description>

      <title>Projection-algebras and quantum logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07042v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: P-algebras are a non-commutative, non-associative generalization of Boolean algebras that are for quantum logic what Boolean algebras are for classical logic. P-algebras have type &lt;X, 0, ', .&gt; where 0 is a constant, ' is unary and . is binary. Elements of X are called features. A partial order is defined on the set X of features by x &lt;= y iff x.y = x. Features commute, i.e., x.y = y.x iff x.y &lt;= x. Features x and y are said to be orthogonal iff x.y = 0 and orthogonality is a symmetric relation.The operation + is defined as the dual of . and it is commutative on orthogonal features. The closed subspaces of a separable Hilbert space form a P-algebra under orthogonal complementation and projection of a subspace onto another one.P-algebras are complemented orthomodular posets but they are not lattices. Existence of least upper bounds for ascending sequences is equivalent to the existence of least upper bounds for countable sets of pairwise orthogonal elements. Atomic algebras are defined and their main properties are studied. The logic of P-algebras is then completely characterized. The language contains a unary connective corresponding to the operation ' and a binary connective corresponding to the operation ".". It is a substructural logic of sequents where the Exchange rule is extremely limited. It is proved to be sound and complete for P-algebras.</description>

      <title>Conditional Fairness for Generative AIs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16663v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The deployment of generative AI (GenAI) models raises significant fairness concerns, addressed in this paper through novel characterization and enforcement techniques specific to GenAI. Unlike standard AI performing specific tasks, GenAI's broad functionality requires "conditional fairness" tailored to the context being generated, such as demographic fairness in generating images of poor people versus successful business leaders. We define two fairness levels: the first evaluates fairness in generated outputs, independent of prompts and models; the second assesses inherent fairness with neutral prompts. Given the complexity of GenAI and challenges in fairness specifications, we focus on bounding the worst case, considering a GenAI system unfair if the distance between appearances of a specific group exceeds preset thresholds. We also explore combinatorial testing for accessing relative completeness in intersectional fairness. By bounding the worst case, we develop a prompt injection scheme within an agent-based framework to enforce conditional fairness with minimal intervention, validated on state-of-the-art GenAI systems.</description>
