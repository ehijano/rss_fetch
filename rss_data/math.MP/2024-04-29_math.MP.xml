      <title>Finite volume simulation of a semi-linear Neumann problem (Keller-Segel model) on rectangular domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, the finite volume method is implemented for solving the problem of the semilinear equation: $-d \delta u+ u=u^q (d, q&gt;0) $with a homogeneous Neumann boundary condition. This problem is equivalent to the known stationary Keller-Segel model, which arises in chemotaxis.After discretization, a nonlinear algebraic system is obtained and solved on the platform Matlab. As a result, many single peaked and multi-peaked shapes in 3D and contour plots can be drawn depending on the parameters d and q.</description>

      <title>Construction of a new (3 + 1)-dimensional KdV equation and its closed-form solutions with solitary wave behaviour and conserved vectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper discusses the construction of a new $(3+1)$-dimensional Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation. By employing the KdV's recursion operator, we extract two equations, and with elemental computation steps, the obtained result is $ 3u_{xyt}+3u_{xzt}-(u_{t}-6uu_{x}+u_{xxx})_{yz}-2\left(u_{x}\partial_{x}^{-1}u_{y}\right)_{xz}-2\left(u_{x}\partial_{x}^{-1}u_{z}\right)_{xy}=0 $. We then transform the new equation to a simpler one to avoid the appearance of the integral in the equation. Thereafter, we apply the Lie symmetry technique and gain a $7$-dimensional Lie algebra $L_7$ of point symmetries. The one-dimensional optimal system of Lie subalgebras is then computed and used in the reduction process to achieve seven exact solutions. These obtained solutions are graphically illustrated as 3D and 2D plots that show different propagations of solitary wave solutions such as breather, periodic, bell shape, and others. Finally, the conserved vectors are computed by invoking Ibragimov's method.</description>

      <title>On Quasi-Locality and Decay of Correlations for Long-Range Models of Open Quantum Spin Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider models of open quantum spin systems with irreversible dynamics and show that general quasi-locality results for long-range models, e.g. as proven for the Heisenberg dynamics associated to quantum systems in [27], naturally extend to this setting. Given these bounds, we provide two applications. First, we use these results to obtain estimates on a strictly local approximation of these finite-volume, irreversible dynamics. Next, we show how these bounds can be used to estimate correlation decay in various states.</description>

      <title>On smooth infinite dimensional grassmannians, splittings and non-commutative generalized cross-ratio mappings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe basic diffeological structures related to splittings and Grassmannians for infinite dimensional vector spaces. We analyze and expand the notion of non-commutative cross-ratio and prove its smoothness. Then we illustrate this theory by examples, with some of them extracted from the existing literature related to infinite dimensional (Banach) Grassmannians, and others where the diffeological setting is a key primary step for rigorous definitions.</description>

      <title>Non-Particulate Quantum States of the Electromagnetic Field in Expanding Space-Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A quantum field has been coupled to a space-time with accelerating expansion. Dynamical modes are destabilised successively at shorter material wavelengths as they metamorphose from oscillators to repellers. Due to degeneracy of energy levels, the number of unstable modes increases at an accelerating rate, sufficient to account for a significant proportion of cosmic energy. For the subsystem spanned by a finite basis of unstable runaway modes, the quantum Hamiltonian is unbounded below. There is no Bogoliubov transformation by which that subsystem Hamiltonian can be expressed as a linear combination of number operators. For the remaining subsystem spanned by an infinite number of oscillator modes, there is an appropriate vacuum state in a Fock-Cook representation of the field algebra. The massless quantum vector field of electromagnetism is considered when it is minimally or more generally coupled to an expanding space-time. For a significant class of models, including minimal coupling models and the exponential de Sitter universe coupled to the Ricci curvature tensor, the field equations are equivalent to the Proca equation with time-dependent mass.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove existence and uniqueness of solutions for an entropic version of the semi-geostrophic equations. We also establish convergence to a weak solution of the semi-geostrophic equations as the entropic parameter vanishes. Convergence is also proved for discretizations that can be computed numerically in practice as shown recently in [6].</description>

      <title>Spectrum occupies pseudospectrum for random matrices with diagonal deformation and variance profile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider $n\times n$ non-Hermitian random matrices with independent entries and a variance profile, as well as an additive deterministic diagonal deformation. We show that the support of the asymptotic eigenvalue distribution in the complex plane exactly coincides with the $\varepsilon$-pseudospectrum in the consecutive limits $n \to \infty$ and $\varepsilon \to 0$. Furthermore, we provide a description of this support in terms of a single real-valued function on the complex plane. As a level set of this locally real analytic function, the spectral edge is a real analytic variety of dimension at most one.</description>

      <title>The discrete nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with linear gain and nonlinear loss: the infinite lattice with nonzero boundary conditions and its finite dimensional approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03683v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of nonlinear Schr\"odinger-type equations with nonzero boundary conditions define challenging problems both for the continuous (partial differential equation) or the discrete (lattice) counterparts. They are associated with fascinating dynamics emerging by the ubiquitous phenomenon of modulation instability. In this work, we consider the discrete nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with linear gain and nonlinear loss. For the infinite lattice supplemented with nonzero boundary conditions which describe solutions decaying on the top of a finite background, we give a rigorous proof that for the corresponding initial-boundary value problem, solutions exist for any initial condition, if and only if, the amplitude of the background has a precise value $A_*$ defined by the gain-loss parameters. We argue that this essential property of this infinite lattice can't be captured by finite lattice approximations of the problem. Commonly, such approximations are defined by lattices with periodic boundary conditions or as it is shown herein, by a modified problem closed with Dirichlet boundary conditions. For the finite dimensional dynamical system defined by the periodic lattice, the dynamics for all initial conditions are captured by a global attractor. Analytical arguments corroborated by numerical simulations show that the global attractor is trivial, defined by a plane wave of amplitude $A_*$. Thus, any instability effects or localized phenomena simulated by the finite system can be only transient prior the convergence to this trivial attractor. Aiming to simulate the dynamics of the infinite lattice as accurately as possible, we study the dynamics of localized initial conditions on the constant background and investigate the potential impact of the global asymptotic stability of the background with amplitude $A_*$ in the long-time evolution of the system.</description>

      <title>Poisson-Lie analogues of spin Sutherland models revisited</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02990v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Some generalizations of spin Sutherland models descend from `master integrable systems' living on Heisenberg doubles of compact semisimple Lie groups. The master systems represent Poisson--Lie counterparts of the systems of free motion modeled on the respective cotangent bundles and their reduction relies on taking quotient with respect to a suitable conjugation action of the compact Lie group. We present an enhanced exposition of the reductions and prove rigorously for the first time that the reduced systems possess the property of degenerate integrability on the dense open subset of the Poisson quotient space corresponding to the principal orbit type for the pertinent group action. After restriction to a smaller dense open subset, degenerate integrability on the generic symplectic leaves is demonstrated as well. The paper also contains a novel description of the reduced Poisson structure and a careful elaboration of the scaling limit whereby our reduced systems turn into the spin Sutherland models.</description>

      <title>A remark on Gibbs measures with log-correlated Gaussian fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.06729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.06729v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study Gibbs measures with log-correlated base Gaussian fields on the $d$-dimensional torus. In the defocusing case, the construction of such Gibbs measures follows from Nelson's argument. In this paper, we consider the focusing case with a quartic interaction. Using the variational formulation, we prove non-normalizability of the Gibbs measure. When $d = 2$, our argument provides an alternative proof of the non-normalizability result for the focusing $\Phi^4_2$-measure by Brydges and Slade (1996). Furthermore, we provide a precise rate of divergence, where the constant is characterized by the optimal constant for a certain Bernstein's inequality on $\mathbb{R}^d$. We also go over the construction of the focusing Gibbs measure with a cubic interaction. In the appendices, we present (a) non-normalizability of the Gibbs measure for the two-dimensional Zakharov system and (b) the construction of focusing quartic Gibbs measures with smoother base Gaussian measures, showing a critical nature of the log-correlated Gibbs measure with a focusing quartic interaction.</description>

      <title>Stochastic quantization of the $\Phi^3_3$-model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.06777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.06777v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: (Due to the limit on the number of characters for an abstract set by arXiv, the full abstract can not be displayed here. See the abstract in the paper.) We study the construction of the $\Phi^3_3$-measure and complete the program on the (non-)construction of the focusing Gibbs measures, initiated by Lebowitz, Rose, and Speer (1988). This problem turns out to be critical, exhibiting the following phase transition. In the weakly nonlinear regime, we prove normalizability of the $\Phi^3_3$-measure and show that it is singular with respect to the massive Gaussian free field. Moreover, we show that there exists a shifted measure with respect to which the $\Phi^3_3$-measure is absolutely continuous. In the strongly nonlinear regime, by further developing the machinery introduced by the authors (2020), we establish non-normalizability of the $\Phi^3_3$-measure. Due to the singularity of the $\Phi^3_3$-measure with respect to the massive Gaussian free field, this non-normalizability part poses a particular challenge as compared to our previous works. In order to overcome this issue, we first construct a $\sigma$-finite version of the $\Phi^3_3$-measure and show that this measure is not normalizable. Furthermore, we prove that the truncated $\Phi^3_3$-measures have no weak limit in a natural space, even up to a subsequence.
  We also study the dynamical problem. By adapting the paracontrolled approach, in particular from the works by Gubinelli, Koch, and the first author (2018) and by the authors (2020), we prove almost sure global well-posedness of the hyperbolic $\Phi^3_3$-model and invariance of the Gibbs measure in the weakly nonlinear regime. In the globalization part, we introduce a new, conceptually simple and straightforward approach, where we directly work with the (truncated) Gibbs measure, using the variational formula and ideas from theory of optimal transport.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.14056v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a qubit basis composed of transverse spin helices with kinks. Unlike the usual computational basis, this chiral basis is well suited for describing quantum states with nontrivial topology. Choosing appropriate parameters the operators of the transverse spin components, $\sigma_n^x$ and $\sigma_n^y$, become diagonal in the chiral basis, which facilitates the study of problems focused on transverse spin components. As an application, we study the temporal decay of the transverse polarization of a spin helix in the XX model that has been measured in recent cold atom experiments. We obtain an explicit universal function describing the relaxation of helices of arbitrary wavelength.</description>

      <title>Screwon spectral statistics and dispersion relation in the quantum Rajeev-Ranken model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13122v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Rajeev-Ranken (RR) model is a Hamiltonian system describing screw-type nonlinear waves (screwons) of wavenumber $k$ in a scalar field theory pseudodual to the 1+1D SU(2) principal chiral model. Classically, the RR model based on a quadratic Hamiltonian on a nilpotent/Euclidean Poisson algebra is Liouville integrable. Upon adopting canonical variables in a slightly extended phase space, the model was interpreted as a novel 3D cylindrically symmetric quartic oscillator with a rotational energy. Here, we examine the spectral statistics and dispersion relation of quantized screwons via numerical diagonalization validated by variational and perturbative approximations. We also derive a semiclassical estimate for the cumulative level distribution which compares favorably with the one from numerical diagonalization. The spectrum shows level crossings typical of an integrable system. The $i^{\rm th}$ unfolded nearest neighbor spacings are found to follow Poisson statistics for small $i$. Nonoverlapping spacing ratios also indicate that successive spectral gaps are independently distributed. After displaying universal linear behavior over energy windows of short lengths, the spectral rigidity saturates at a length and value that scales with the square-root of energy. For strong coupling $\lambda$ and intermediate $k$, we argue that reduced screwon energies can depend only on the product $\lambda k$. Numerically, we find power law dependences on $\lambda$ and $k$ with an approximately common exponent $2/3$ provided the angular momentum quantum number $l$ is small compared to the number of nodes $n$ in the radial wavefunction. On the other hand, for the ground state $n = l = 0$, the common exponent becomes 1.</description>

      <title>Scaled Brownian motion with random anomalous diffusion exponent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20206v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The scaled Brownian motion (SBM) is regarded as one of the paradigmatic random processes, featuring the anomalous diffusion property characterized by the diffusion exponent. It is a Gaussian, self-similar process with independent increments, which has found applications across various fields, from turbulence and stochastic hydrology to biophysics. In our paper, inspired by recent single particle tracking biological experiments, we introduce a process termed the scaled Brownian motion with random exponent (SBMRE), which preserves SBM characteristics at the level of individual trajectories, albeit with randomly varying anomalous diffusion exponents across the trajectories. We discuss the main probabilistic properties of SBMRE, including its probability density function (pdf), and the q-th absolute moment. Additionally, we present the expected value of the time-averaged mean squared displacement (TAMSD) and the ergodicity breaking parameter. Furthermore, we analyze the pdf of the first hitting time in a semi-infinite domain, the martingale property of SBMRE, and its stochastic exponential. As special cases, we consider two distributions of the anomalous diffusion exponent, namely the two-point and beta distributions, and discuss the asymptotics of the presented characteristics in such cases. Theoretical results for SBMRE are validated through numerical simulations and compared with the corresponding characteristics for SBM.</description>
