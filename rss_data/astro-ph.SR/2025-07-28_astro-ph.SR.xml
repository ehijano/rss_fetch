      <title>First Temperature Profile of a Stellar Flare using Differential Chromatic Refraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first derivation of a stellar flare temperature profile from single-band photometry. Stellar flare DWF030225.574-545707.45129 was detected in 2015 by the Dark Energy Camera as part of the Deeper, Wider, Faster Programme. The brightness ($\Delta m_g = -6.12$) of this flare, combined with the high air mass ($1.45 \lesssim X \lesssim 1.75$) and blue filter (DES $g$, 398-548 nm) in which it was observed, provided ideal conditions to measure the zenith-ward apparent motion of the source due to differential chromatic refraction (DCR) and, from that, infer the effective temperature of the event. We model the flare's spectral energy distribution as a blackbody to produce the constraints on flare temperature and geometric properties derived from single-band photometry. We additionally demonstrate how simplistic assumptions on the flaring spectrum, as well as on the evolution of flare geometry, can result in solutions that overestimate effective temperature. Exploiting DCR enables studying chromatic phenomena with ground-based astrophysical surveys and stellar flares on M-dwarfs are a particularly enticing target for such studies due to their ubiquity across the sky, and the heightened color contrast between their red quiescent photospheres and the blue flare emission. Our novel method will enable similar temperature constraints for large sample of objects in upcoming photometric surveys like the Vera C. Rubin Legacy Survey of Space and Time.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Search for Big Dippers in ASAS-SN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dipper stars are extrinsically variable stars with deep dimming events due to extended, often dusty, structures produced by a wide range of mechanisms such as collisions, protoplanetary evolution or stellar winds. ASAS-SN has discovered 12 dipper-like objects as part of its normal operations. Here we systematically search the $\sim 5.1$ million ASAS-SN targets with $13&lt;g&lt;14$~mag for dippers with $\Delta g\ge0.3$~mag to identify 4 new candidates. We also discover 15 long-period eclipsing binary candidates. We characterized the 19 new and 12 previously discovered objects using the ASAS-SN light curves and archival multi-wavelength data. We divide them into three categories: long-period eclipsing binaries with a single eclipse (13 total), long-period eclipsing binaries with multiple eclipses (7 total) and dipper stars with dust or disk occultations (11 total).</description>

      <title>Revealing Flare Energetics and Dynamics with SDO EVE Solar Extreme Ultraviolet Spectral Irradiance Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) Extreme-ultraviolet Variability Experiment (EVE) has been making solar full-disk extreme ultraviolet (EUV) spectral measurements since 2010 over the spectral range of 6nm to 106nm with 0.1nm spectral resolution and with 10-60sec cadence. A primary motivation for EVE's solar EUV irradiance observations is to provide the important energy input for various studies of Earth's upper atmosphere. For example, the solar EUV creates the ionosphere, heats the thermosphere, and drives photochemistry in Earth's upper atmosphere. In addition, EVE's observations have been a treasure trove for solar EUV flare spectra. While EVE measures the full-disk spectra, the flare spectrum is easily determined as the EVE spectrum minus the pre-flare spectrum, as long as only one flare event is happening at a time. These EVE flare observations provide EUV variability that have been used to study flare phases (including the discovery of the EUV Late Phase flare class), flare energetics (plasma temperature variations), corona heating (plasma abundance changes that support nano-flare heating mechanism), flare dynamics (downwelling and upwelling plasma flows during flares from Doppler shifts), and coronal mass ejections (CME) energetics (CME mass and velocity derived from coronal dimming in some EUV lines). We also introduce a new EVE data product called the EVE Level 4 Lines data product, which provides line profile-fit results for intensity, wavelength shift, and line width for 70 emission features. These emission features are from the chromosphere, transition region, and corona, and so Doppler measurements of those lines can reveal important plasma dynamical behavior during a flare's impulsive phase and gradual phase. With over 10,000 flares detected in the EVE observations, there is still much to study and to learn about solar flare physics using EVE solar EUV spectra.</description>

      <title>JWST Observations of SN 2023ixf II: The Panchromatic Evolution Between 250 and 720 Days After the Explosion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the nebular phase spectroscopic and photometric observations of the nearby hydrogen-rich core-collapse supernova (CC-SN) 2023ixf, obtained through our JWST programs. These observations, combined with ground-based optical and near-infrared spectra, cover +252.67 - 719.96 d, creating a comprehensive, panchromatic time-series dataset spanning 0.32 - 30$\mu$m. In this second paper of the series, we focus on identifying key spectral emission features and tracking their evolution through the nebular phase. The JWST data reveal hydrogen emission from the Balmer to Humphreys series, as well as prominent forbidden lines from Ne, Ar, Fe, Co, and Ni. NIRSpec observations display strong emission from the first overtone and fundamental bands of carbon monoxide, which weaken with time as the ejecta cools and dust emission dominates. The spectral energy distribution shows a clear infrared excess emerging by +252.67 d peaking around 10.0$\mu$m, with a secondary bump at 18.0$\mu$m developing by +719.96 d. We suggest that this evolution could arises from multiple warm dust components. In upcoming papers in this series, we will present detailed modeling of the molecular and dust properties. Overall, this dataset significantly advances our understanding of the mid-infrared properties of CC-SNe, providing an unprecedented view of their late-time line, molecule, and dust emission.</description>

      <title>Phase II of the LAMOST-Kepler/K2 Survey. II. Time Domain of Medium-resolution Spectroscopic Observations from 2018 to 2023</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The LAMOST-Kepler/K2 Medium-Resolution Spectroscopic Survey (LK-MRS) conducted time-domain medium-resolution spectroscopic observations of 20 LAMOST plates in the Kepler and K2 fields from 2018 to 2023, a phase designated as LK-MRS-I. A catalog of stellar parameters for a total of 36,588 stars, derived from the spectra collected during these five years, including the effective temperature, the surface gravity, the metallicity, the {\alpha}-element abundance, the radial velocity, and v sin i of the target stars, is released, together with the weighted averages and uncertainties. At S/N = 10, the measurement uncertainties are 120 K, 0.18 dex, 0.13 dex, 0.08 dex, 1.9 km/s, and 4.0 km/s for the above parameters, respectively. Comparisons with the parameters provided by the APOGEE and GALAH surveys validate the effective temperature and surface gravity measurements, showing minor discrepancies in metallicity and {\alpha}-element abundance values. We identified some peculiar star candidates, including 764 metal-poor stars, 174 very metal-poor stars, and 30 high-velocity stars. Moreover, we found 2,333 stars whose radial velocity seems to be variable. Using Kepler/K2 or TESS photometric data, we confirmed 371 periodic variable stars among the radial velocity variable candidates and classified their variability types. LK-MRS-I provides spectroscopic data being useful for studies of the Kepler and K2 fields. The LK-MRS project will continue collecting time-domain medium-resolution spectra for target stars during the third phase of LAMOST surveys, providing data to support further scientific research.</description>

      <title>Lithium in V505 Per</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine the surface lithium abundance of the eclipsing binary components in V 505 Per (HIP 10961), A(Li)=2.65+/-0.07 and 2.35+/-0.1, which supports the rather unexpected conclusion that their surface Li abundances differ. We find effective temperatures 6600 K + 6550 K (~150 K higher than previously reported), which place the stars at the hot limit of the Lithium Dip, thus aleviating the previously suggested discrepancy with cluster stars of similar ages and temperatures. These temperatures are also more consistent with the system's Gaia spectral energy distribution. Our iron abundances, [Fe/H]=-0.15+\-0.07 and -0.25+\-0.1, agree with predictions of the higher temperatures deduced from our spectra and from evolutionary tracks. The surface rotation rate implied by our line profiles, 12.5+\-1 km/s, is smaller than the synchronous rotation rate, a curious result given the circular orbit and the age of the system.</description>

      <title>Pivot of the Emerging Bipolar Magnetic Region in the Birth of Sigmoidal Solar Active Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an augmentation to longstanding evidence from observations and MHD modeling that (1) every solar emerging bipolar magnetic region (BMR) is made by an emerging omega-loop flux rope, and (2) twist in the flux-rope field makes the emerged field sigmoidal. Using co-temporal full-disk coronal EUV images, magnetograms, and continuum images from Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), we found and tracked the emergence of 42 emerging single-BMR sigmoidal active regions (ARs) that have sunspots in both polarity domains. Throughout each AR's emergence, we quantified the emerging BMR's tilt angle to the east-west direction (the x-direction in SDO images) by measuring in the continuum images the tilt angle of the line through the (visually located) two centroids of the BMR's opposite-polarity sunspot clusters. As each AR emerges, it becomes either S-shaped (shows net right-handed magnetic twist) or Z-shaped (shows net left-handed magnetic twist) in the coronal EUV images. Nineteen of the ARs become S-shaped and 23 become Z-shaped. For all 42 ARs, in agreement with published MHD simulations of the emergence of a single-BMR sigmoidal AR from a subsurface twisted flux rope, if the AR becomes S-shaped, the emerging BMR pivots counterclockwise, and if the AR becomes Z-shaped, the emerging BMR pivots clockwise. For our 42 ARs, the pivot amount roughly ranges from 10{\deg} to 90{\deg} and averages about 35{\deg}. Thus, at the onset of the emergence of our average emerging omega-loop flux rope, the magnetic field's twist pitch angle at the flux rope's top edge is plausibly about 35{\deg}.</description>

      <title>X-Raying a Be star disk: fundamental parameters of the eclipsing binary Be star V658 Car</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With its two stellar eclipses and two disk attenuations per binary orbit, V658 Carinae stands out as the first clear eclipsing Be + sdOB system. This rare alignment offers a unique opportunity to probe the structure and dynamics of a Be star disk with unprecedented detail. In this study, we present the most comprehensive observational dataset and modeling effort for this system to date, including optical, near-infrared, and ultraviolet spectroscopy, space-based photometry, and optical polarization. Using a new ray-tracing code, we apply a three-component model, consisting of an oblate, rapidly rotating Be star, a symmetric circumstellar disk, and a compact stripped companion, to reproduce the system's light curve, polarization, and spectral features. Our analysis yields precise constraints on the stellar and disk parameters, determining its status as the second known late-type Be + stripped star, and also provides strong spectroscopic evidence for a tenuous circumsecondary envelope. Despite the model's overall success, several key observables, such as the $H_{\alpha}$ equivalent width and the secondary attenuation, remain poorly reproduced, pointing to the need for more sophisticated modelling. In particular, future improvements should incorporate the companion's radiative feedback on the disk and account for asymmetric disk structures expected by the gravitational interaction with the companion. Owing to its unique geometry and rich diagnostics, V658 Car establishes itself as a benchmark system for Be stars (and rapid rotators in general), stripped stars, post-RLOF massive binaries, and circumstellar disk structures.</description>

      <title>Multi-line Spectropolarimetric Observation of Flare Ribbon Fine Structures with ViSP/DKIST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analysis of flare ribbon fine structure observed during a GOES C2-class flare using high spatial and spectral resolution multi-line spectropolarimetric observations from the ViSP instrument at the DKIST. The ViSP recorded full Stokes spectra in three lines: Fe I 630.2 nm line pair, Na I D1, and Ca II 854.2 nm. To infer the stratification of temperature and line-of-sight (LOS) velocity across the ribbon, we performed non-LTE multi-line inversions of ViSP spectra. In the red wing of the Ca II 854.2 nm line, we identified multiple compact, roundish, and quasi-equally spaced bright structures, referred to as ribbon blobs, embedded within the flare ribbon. The sizes of these blobs range from 320 to 455 km, and they are spaced roughly ~1100 km apart. These features exhibit complex spectral profiles with pronounced asymmetries and double peaks near the line core of the Ca II 854.2 nm line. The blob regions were found to be significantly hotter (by ~1 kK) at log {\tau} = -4 compared to surrounding ribbon areas (~7 kK). The LOS velocity maps revealed both upflows and downflows at log {\tau} = -4$ and log {\tau} = -3, respectively. We discuss the plausible origins of these fine structures in the chromosphere, which may be related to electron beam heating, plasma draining, or tearing-mode instabilities in the reconnecting current sheet.</description>

      <title>Young Stellar Objects in the Carina nebula: Near-Infrared variability and spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a catalog of 652 young stellar objects (YSOs) in the Carina star-forming region. The catalog was constructed by combining near-infrared Ks-band variability from the VISTA Variables in the Via Lactea eXtended survey and medium-resolution H-band spectroscopy from APOGEE-2, Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV (SDSS-IV). Variability analysis of 6.35 million sources identified 606 variable stars. The classification of the spectral lines by semisupervised K-means clustering of 704 stars, refined through comparison with known catalogs in literature and visual inspection of the spectra, was performed. Combined with Ks variability, the final catalog contains three groups: Emission-line YSOs, Absorption-line YSOs, and Literature/Variable-identified YSOs. Cross validation with the Gaia DR3 proper motion and distance estimates supports Carina membership for 415 sources. The statistical characterization of YSO variability demonstrated that most Carina members (78%) exhibit variability patterns. Of these, 134 stars show emissions in their spectra, which is consistent with some accretion processes. Analysis of fundamental stellar parameters from StarHorse and Gaia DR3 reveals typical distributions of YSOs, dominated by low-mass 1-4 Msun, solar-metallicity stars with temperatures between 4000 and 6000K. Only a small fraction (4%) of the sources are more massive than 4 Msun, suggesting limited ongoing massive star formation in Carina. This well-characterized catalog also offers a robust training dataset for machine learning applications aimed at predicting YSO behavior.</description>

      <title>New symbiotic stars or candidates in LAMOST low resolution spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symbiotic stars are among the most crucial binary systems for studying binary star interactions and Type Ia supernova progenitors. Based on the unique observational characteristics of symbiotic stars, strong H I, He I emission lines, giant spectral features, and the presence of [O III], He II, O VI, and other emission lines with ionization potentials exceeding 35 eV, and the Gaia information, we search for new symbiotic stars using the low-resolution spectroscopic survey data from LAMOST. Thirty-six binary systems have been selected as symbiotic stars or candidates, in which the five known symbiotic stars are included. Among them five systems (ZTF J005917.52+315605.4, ATO J094137.5+075304, LAMOST J200310.90+360822.6, LAMOST J072528.18+342530.4, and V* V758 Cyg) have been found as new symbiotic stars. Notably, LAMOST J072528.18+342530.4 and V* V758 Cyg were also confirmed as new symbiotic stars in a recent study. For the remaining 26 candidates, classification is based solely on the presence of [O III] emission lines (with ionization potentials &gt; 35 eV) and the absence of He II high-excitation emission lines. Further observations are needed to confirm their nature as symbiotic stars.</description>

Abstract: In September 1777 Ru\dj er Bo\v{s}kovi\'{c} observed and measured the sun-spot positions to determine the solar rotation elements. In 1785, among other methods, he described a trigonometric spherical solution for the determination of the position of the axis and rate of the solar rotation using three sunspot positions, but without equations. For the first time, we derive the equations that are applicable to modern computers for calculating the solar rotation elements, as they were described by Bo\v{s}kovi\'{c}. We recalculated Bo\v{s}kovi\'{c}'s original example using his measurements of sunspot positions from 1777 and the equations developed here, confirming his results from 1785. Bo\v{s}kovi\'{c}'s methodology of arithmetic means determines $i$, $\Omega$, and sidereal period $T'$ separately, while the planar trigonometric solution determines $i$ and $\Omega$ together. His spherical trigonometric solution calculates $i$, $\Omega$, and the sidereal period $T'$ in a single procedure.

      <title>Thick Disks around White Dwarfs viewed 'Edge-off': Effects on Transit Properties and Infrared Excess</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A significant fraction of white dwarfs (WDs) host dust/debris disks formed from the tidal disruption of asteroids and planetsimals. Several studies indicate that the disks can attain significant vertical heights through collisional cascade. In this work I model the effects of geometrically thick disks on two primary observables: photometric transits by the disk when viewed at high inclinations and infrared dust emission. Specifically, I consider disks with a Gaussian vertical profile with scale heights comparable to or larger than the WD radius. I primarily focus on inclinations $\gtrsim$$87$ degrees ('edge-off'), which can produce significant transits with moderate disk thickness. Both the transit depth and color become strong functions of inclination, and I explore their dependence on the disk parameters. I show that such a setup can produce the recently discovered reddening in the transit of WD J1013$-$0427. Moving to infrared emission, I show that the contribution from the heated inner rim can be substantial even at high inclinations. It can potentially explain the infrared excess observed in two transiting debris systems, WD 1145$+$017 and WD 1232$+$563, consistently with the transits. The other two important radiation components are the optically thin dust emission from the disk's outer layers and the optically thick emission from the backwarmed disk interior. Extending my analysis to G29-38 shows that the former can adequately produce the silicate emission feature. The inner dense layers, on the other hand, allows the disk to contain a large dust mass. Overall, I show that thick disk effects can be significant and should be taken into account. I motivate detailed studies to quantify the effects accurately.</description>

      <title>BSN-III: The First Multiband Photometric Study on the Eight Total Eclipse Contact Binary Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study continues our in-depth investigation of total-eclipse W Ursae Majoris-type contact binaries by analyzing eight new systems, complementing our previous work. Multiband $BVR_cI_c$ photometric data were acquired through ground-based observations at an observatory in Mexico, from which new times of minima were determined. Our analysis of orbital period variations using the O-C method revealed that one system shows no long-term variation, four systems exhibit a secular decrease in their orbital periods, and two systems exhibit a secular increase, suggesting mass transfer between the components. Notably, one system displays a cyclic variation with an amplitude of 0.00865 days and a period of 10.49 years, which we attribute to the light travel time effect induced by a tertiary companion, possibly a brown dwarf. We modeled the light curves using the PHOEBE Python code. Six of the target systems required the inclusion of a cold starspot on one of the system's stars due to the asymmetry observed in the maxima of their light curves. Absolute parameters were estimated using the Gaia DR3 parallax method. Using the components' effective temperatures and masses, we classified five of the systems as W-subtype and three as A-subtype. The stellar evolution was illustrated through the mass-radius and mass-luminosity diagrams. Furthermore, we investigated the dynamical stability of two systems with extremely low mass ratios.</description>

      <title>Radio Emission from a Nearby M dwarf Binary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the detection of the binary system 2MASS J02132062+3648506 AB using the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) archive data observed at 4-8 GHz. The system is a triple consisting of a tight binary ($\sim0.2"$) of two M dwarfs of spectral class M4.5 and M6.5 and a wide T3 brown dwarf companion ($\sim$16.4"). The binary displays coronal and chromospheric activity as traced by previously measured X-ray flux and H$\alpha$ emission. We detect the unresolved binary at a peak flux density of $\sim356\ \mu \mathrm{Jybeam}^{-1}$ at a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of $\sim36$ and determine a radio luminosity of $\mathrm{log}L_R/\mathrm{log}L_\mathrm{bol}\approx-7.76$. The radio emission is quiescent, polarised at a mean circular polarisation fraction $f_\mathrm{c}=45.20 \pm 1.58$ % and exhibits a spectral index $\alpha=-0.44\pm0.07$ . We probe the binary using the Enhanced Multi-Element Remotely Linked Interferometer Network (e-MERLIN) with an angular resolution of $\sim40$ mas at 5 GHz and detect a component at a peak flux density of $\sim90\ \mu$Jy $\mathrm{beam}^{-1}$ at a SNR $\sim5$ . We propose a gyrosynchrotron origin for the radio emission and estimate a magnetic field strength $B&lt;174.86$ G, an emitting region of size $L&lt;1.54$ times the radius of the M4.5 primary and a plasma number density $n_\mathrm{e}&lt;2.91\times10^5\ \mathrm{cm}^{-3}$. The brown dwarf companion is not detected. Additionally, we have analysed observations of 2MASS J04183483+213127, a chromospherically active L5 brown dwarf which is also not detected. Accordingly, we place $3\sigma$ flux density upper limits at $36.9\ \mu$Jy $\mathrm{beam}^{-1}$ and $42.3\ \mu$Jy $\mathrm{beam}^{-1}$ for Stokes I and V respectively.</description>

      <title>Episodic accretion in high-mass star formation: An analysis of thermal instability for axially symmetric disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-mass young stellar objects exhibit episodic accretion bursts similar to their low-mass counterparts. Understanding these outbursts is crucial for elucidating massive star formation and disk evolution around high-mass protostars. We investigate thermal instability's role in triggering accretion outbursts using a two-dimensional hydrodynamical model that fully resolves the vertical structure of the inner disk. This approach provides a more realistic depiction of axially symmetric disk dynamics and assesses observable burst signatures. We simulate the inner 10 astronomical units of a circumstellar disk around a high-mass protostar, incorporating viscous heating and radiative transport in radial and vertical directions. Unlike previous one-dimensional studies, our two-dimensional model resolves time-dependent vertical disk structure, capturing complex radial-vertical dynamics. Our simulations show thermal instability causes significant structural changes. Steep temperature gradients and vigorous convection develop at outburst onset, with gas flows differing between midplane and upper layers. Energy release produces 15-30 year outbursts with peak accretion rates of $2-3\times10^{-4}~\rm M_{\odot}~\rm{yr}^{-1}$. While observable, these bursts are insufficiently bright with rise times differing from rapid observed events. Our models lack the "reflares" seen in one-dimensional calculations. Resolving full vertical disk structure is essential for accurate thermal instability modeling. While thermal instability significantly influences episodic accretion, it appears insufficient alone to explain observed HMYSO outburst diversity. Additional mechanisms are required for comprehensive understanding.</description>

      <title>Mixing due to internal gravity waves can explain the CNO surface abundances of B-type detached eclipsing binaries and single stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations of double-lined spectroscopic eclipsing binaries are ideal to study stellar evolution. They have tight model-independent constraints on their masses and radii. With the addition of spectroscopically determined effective temperatures and surface abundances, they can be used to calibrate and improve models. Here we determine whether the observed trends of surface nitrogen abundance in single and binary stars can be explained by wave-induced mixing occurring in the stellar envelope. We use MESA to run the simulations. We compare the outcome of the models to observations of the surface nitrogen abundance for samples of detached eclipsing binary systems and of single B-type stars. From this we determine the amount of wave-induced mixing required to bring the model predictions in agreement with the observations. We find nitrogen to be enriched at the surface of theoretical models with wave-induced mixing provided that we use levels above log(Denv)=5-6 at the convective core boundary. A prominent observation is that the B-type components of detached eclipsing binaries do not show any nitrogen surface enhancement, which can be explained by their relatively fast rotation enforced by the tidal forces in the systems. The slowly rotating or evolved stars among the sample of single B stars do reveal a nitrogen enhancement. Our findings on the difference between single B stars and B-type components of detached binary systems can potentially be explained by internal wave-induced mixing profiles based on recent 2-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of rotating B stars. Such wave-induced mixing decreases with increasing rotation and may act in combination with additional rotational mixing. Our findings motivate future asteroseismic studies in samples of single B stars and pulsating eclipsing binaries with B-type components as optimal laboratories to further test our interpretations.</description>

      <title>Technetium-rich M Stars: Prime diagnostics of recent third dredge-up events on the Asymptotic Giant Branch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Technetium (Tc)-rich M-type stars have been known for over 45 years. However, the origin of Tc in these stars, particularly its detection without the concomitant detection of other s-process elements, typically produced during the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) s-process nucleosynthesis, remains poorly understood. Technetium was first identified in the spectra of S-type stars (which exhibit prominent ZrO bands) in 1952. The simultaneous enrichment of both Zr and Tc is well understood within the framework of s-process nucleosynthesis, which occurs during the AGB phase. However, despite being known for 45 years, Tc-rich M stars remain an enigma, as M-type stars are typically not enriched in heavy elements. Aims. This study aims at analyzing high-resolution spectra of a large sample of M-type stars to examine their spectral characteristics, and to compare their spectral properties with those of Tc-rich S-type stars in an attempt to understand the origin of their difference. Methods. We define a robust classification scheme to assign M stars to the Tc-rich or Tc-poor class. We compute nucleosynthesis models to trace the evolution of Zr and Tc abundances across successive thermal pulses during the AGB phase. We further analyze spectral indices measuring the depth of the TiO and ZrO bands as well as the wavelength of the Tc blend on both synthetic and observed spectra. Results. The Tc lines in Tc-rich M stars are similar to those in S stars. However, Tc-rich M stars exhibit stronger TiO bands than S stars while displaying similarly strong ZrO bands. Spectral synthesis, together with location in the HR diagram and spatial properties suggest that Tc-rich M stars may have slightly lower metallicity and lower masses than Tc-rich S stars.</description>

      <title>X-ray Emission from Type Ia Supernova Remnants Interacting With Isotropic Progenitor Outflows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The parameter space for mass loss in Type Ia supernova progenitors is large, with different progenitor scenarios favoring different mass loss regimes. Here we focus on the impact that uniform and isotropic outflows have on the circumstellar environment of Type Ia supernova progenitors. We vary mass loss rate, wind velocity, and outflow duration, and evolve supernova remnant (SNR) models in this grid of circumstellar structures in order to compare the bulk properties of these models (ages, radii, and \feka\ centroids and luminosities) to observations. We find that roughly 50\% of young Type Ia SNRs in the Milky Way and the Large Magellanic Cloud had progenitors that did not substantially modify their surroundings on $\sim$pc scales. This group includes SN Ia with a range of luminosities, and at least some likely products of double detonation explosions in sub-Chandrasekhar white dwarfs. The other half of our sample can be divided in two distinct classes. A small subset of SNRs ($\sim$15\%) have large radii and low \feka\ centroids and are likely expanding into large cavities excavated by fast ($\sim$1000 km/s), sustained progenitor outflows. The majority of the SNRs that are expanding into a modified medium ($\sim35\%$) show evidence for dense material, likely associated with slow ($\sim$10 km/s) progenitor outflows, possibly a byproduct of accretion processes in near-Chandrasekhar white dwarfs spawned by younger stellar populations.</description>

      <title>Rotation of young solar-type stars as seen by Gaia and K2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate surface rotation measurements are crucial to estimate stellar ages and improve our understanding of stellar rotational evolution. Comparisons of datasets obtained from different space missions on common targets represent in this sense a way to explore the respective biases and reliability of the considered instruments, as well as a possibility to perform a more in-depth investigation of the properties of the observed stars. In this perspective, we aim at using observations for the K2 mission to provide an external validation to Gaia rotation measurements, and confront observables available from Gaia, K2, and Kepler. We therefore crossmatch the Gaia rotation catalogue and the K2 mission Ecliptic Plane Input Catalogue (EPIC) in order to find Gaia stars with both measured rotation and periods and available K2 light curves. Using our crossmatch, we analyse 1063 light curves from the K2 mission in order to characterise stellar rotational modulations and compare the recovered periods with Gaia reference values. The K2/Gaia cross-validated sample is used as a random-forest classifier training set to identify a subsample of Gaia stars with similar properties. We validate the Gaia rotation measurements for a large fraction of the sample and we discuss the possible origin of the discrepancies between some K2 and Gaia measurements. We note that the K2 sample does not include members of the low-activity ultra-fast-rotating (UFR) population that was highlighted by Gaia observations, a feature that we explain considering the instrumental capabilities of K2. Placing our sample in perspective with the full Gaia rotation catalogues and Kepler observations, we show that the population for which both Gaia and K2 are able to measure rotation is composed of young late-type stars, a significant fraction of which is not yet converged on the slow-rotator gyrochronological sequence.

      <title>Re-examination of fusion hindrance in astrophysical $^{12}$C+$^{12}$C and $^{12}$C+$^{13}$C reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To determine the energy dependence of fusion cross sections at extremely low energies is crucial for various astrophysical processes. In the previous study by Jiang et al. [Phys. Rev. C75, 015803 (2007)], it was concluded that fusion cross sections for the $^{12}$C+$^{12}$C system rapidly drop off as the energy decreases. We here re-examine this hindrance phenomenon. While the previous study fitted the logarithmic slope $L(E)$ of fusion cross sections with a function of $L(E)=A+B/E^n$ and searched the optimum value of $A$ and $B$ with $n=1.5$, we refit the data with the same function for $L(E)$ but by releasing the restriction on $n$. We find that the optimum values of $n$ significantly deviates from $n=1.5$, resulting in the absence of hindrance of fusion cross sections both in the $^{12}$C+$^{12}$C and the $^{12}$C+$^{13}$C systems.</description>

      <title>Luminous Late-time Radio Emission from Supernovae Interacting with Circumbinary Material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerous core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) exhibit signatures of interaction with circumstellar material (CSM). Bright radio emission years after the SN is one such indication of dense CSM at large distances from the star, which may be generated via binary interactions. In this work, we use forward modeling to study the radio emission produced by interaction between the SN ejecta and CSM formed by non-conservative stable mass transfer from stripped-envelope stars in short-period binaries. The donors are among the likely progenitors of hydrogen-poor CCSNe that significantly expand $10^3$-$10^4$ years before core-collapse. We identify that non-conservative stable mass transfer from lower-mass stripped stars can create a detached shell-like CSM, whereas for our higher-mass stars the CSM is wind-like. In our models, mass transfer rates of $\sim 10^{-4} M_\odot$ $\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ lead to dense CSM extending to $\sim 10^{18}$ $\mathrm{cm}$. The predicted radio emission is luminous at late times, reaching $L_{\nu}\sim10^{26}$-$10^{29}$ $\mathrm{erg}$ $\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ $\mathrm{Hz}^{-1}$ at years to decades after core-collapse, which is as bright as late-time radio emission observed for a sample of hydrogen-poor SNe. However, the light curves of events with early-time data show more complex behavior in the weeks to months after core-collapse. We qualitatively demonstrate that similar early-time emission can manifest for CSM that is accelerated to speeds of $\sim10^3$ $\mathrm{km}$ $\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ upon ejection, as well as for different viewing angles in case of an asymmetric CSM distribution.</description>

      <title>Eccentric von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai effects under mildly hierarchical triple systems: Influence of Brown corrections upon orbit flipping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mildly hierarchical three-body systems are widespread in the Universe, exemplified by planets in stellar binaries and stars in black-hole binaries. In such systems, Brown Hamiltonian corrections play a crucial role in governing the long-term dynamical evolution. In this work, we extend Brown corrections to include octupole-order coupling terms, thereby formulating a more accurate dynamical model for predicting long-term dynamical behaviors. The utilization of the gauge freedom in canonical transformation shows that the quadrupole-octupole coupling term vanishes and the octupole-octupole coupling term is axisymmetric. Under triple systems with different levels of hierarchies, we systematically investigate the impact of Brown corrections on orbital flipping induced by the eccentric von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai (ZLK) mechanism. Our analysis reveals that, as the hierarchy of triple systems becomes lower, the asymmetry in the flipping regions becomes more significant. The asymmetric structures are examined in detail using Poincare sections and perturbative techniques, showing that Brown corrections are the key factor responsible for breaking the symmetry of flipping regions. Finally, we extend the classical pendulum approximation to our refined model and demonstrate that its analytical predictions agree remarkably well with those derived from perturbative methods, particularly in the high-eccentricity regime.</description>

      <title>Magnetic effect on the evolution of an eccentric and inclined orbit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a method to calculate the evolution of an eccentric and inclined orbit under the magnetic effect. Taking the unipolar interaction as an example, we study both coplanar and inclined orbits. We calculate the Lorentz force and then the changes in orbital energy and angular momentum. Combined with the total energy dissipation we write down the evolution equations of semi-major axis, eccentricity, inclination and spin. This set of equations can be used to study the orbital and spin evolution under the magnetic interaction.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Sagittarius Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy Core with Gaia DR3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy provides us with the unique opportunity to study an ongoing Galactic cannibalistic event between our Milky Way Galaxy and a satellite dwarf galaxy. We present the first major membership star catalog of the Sagittarius dwarf core ($\approx$400,000 sources) and Messier 54 ($\approx$2000 sources) with positions, proper motions, and parallaxes from $Gaia$ DR3, supplemented with metallicities from the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment. We isolate the Sagittarius dwarf core (3.7 core radii) and Messier 54 (0.125 core radii) using literature positions. Using evolutionary sub-samples separated within a color-magnitude diagram, we analyze the structures and substructures of the Sagittarius core and infer its positional relationship with Messier 54 within 5D phase space. A sample of Milky Way stars from a similar galactic latitude was used to identify contaminants and separate member stars from the core of the Sgr dSph and Messier 54 using a Gaussian distribution in proper motion space. We present the derived proper motion, parallaxes, and metallicities for these evolutionary sub-samples while demonstrating the precision of our sample using red clump standard candles. We find a distance modulus for the Sagittarius core and Messier 54 of $(m-M)_{0}=17.002^{+0.038}_{-0.042}$ mag and $(m-M)_{0}=17.011^{+0.038}_{-0.039}$ mag, corresponding to a heliocentric distance of $d=25.14^{+0.45}_{-0.48}$ kpc and $d=25.25^{+0.48}_{-0.45}$ kpc respectively. With red clump distance analysis, our results imply there is no separation between the Sagittarius core and Messier 54.</description>

      <title>Finetuning Stellar Spectra Foundation Models with LoRA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Foundation models are beginning to impact stellar spectroscopy, where spectra encode rich physical information in a structured, language-like form. A key challenge is adapting these models across heterogeneous surveys with differing resolution and coverage. We apply Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune SpecCLIP--a contrastively pre-trained model on LAMOST and Gaia XP spectra--for downstream tasks on DESI Early Data Release (EDR) spectra. We show that LoRA enables few-shot learning on DESI, with performance varying by fine-tuned module and benefiting from Gaia XP knowledge embedded in the pre-trained model. Our results demonstrate that LoRA provides a lightweight and effective strategy for extending spectral foundation models to new instruments and survey domains.</description>

      <title>Galactic Super-Accreting X-ray Binaries as Super-PeVatron Accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The extension of the cosmic-ray (CR) spectrum well beyond 1~PeV necessitates the existence of a population of accelerators in the Milky Way, which we refer to as Super PeVatrons. Identifying the nature of these sources remains a challenge to the paradigm of galactic CRs. Galactic super-accreting X-ray binaries, where the compact object accretes at a rate near or above the Eddington limit, can meet the energy requirement to supply the high-energy population of galactic CRs. We demonstrate that the trans-relativistic jets and/or winds of these powerful objects with kinetic energy luminosity exceeding $10^{39} \, \rm erg/s$, can accelerate protons to energies above several PeV. Detection of such super-accreting X-ray binaries through their ultra-high-energy $\gamma$-ray ``halos" and large-scale nebulae is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Thermonuclear explosion criteria for direct and indirect collisions of CO white dwarfs: a study of the impact-parameter threshold for detonation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03300v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The physical collisions of two white dwarfs (WDs) (i.e. not slow mergers) have been shown to produce type-Ia-like supernovae (SNe) explosions. Most studies of WD collisions have focused on zero impact-parameter (direct) collisions, which can also be studied in 2D. However, the vast majority of WD collisions arising from any evolutionary channels suggested to date are expected to be indirect, i.e. have a non-negligible impact parameter upon collision. Here, we use one of the highest resolution 3D simulations to date (making use of the AREPO code) in order to explore both direct and indirect collisions and the conditions in which they give rise to a detonation and the production of a luminous SNe. Using our simulations, we find a detonation criterion that can provide the critical impact parameter for an explosion to occur, depending on the density profile of the colliding WDs, their composition, and their collision velocities. We find that the initial velocity has a significant impact on the amount of 56Ni production from the explosion. Furthermore, the production of the 56Ni also depends on numerical modeling aspects.</description>

      <title>A Unified Phenomenology of Ion Heating in Low-$\beta$ Plasmas: Test-Particle Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07015v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We argue that stochastic and quasi-linear ion heating, often viewed as distinct processes in low-$\beta$ collisionless plasmas, are the far limits of a continuum controlled by nonlinear broadening of turbulent fluctuations, and thus by the normalized cross helicity. We propose a simple empirical formula that captures both regimes, generalizing that commonly used to describe stochastic heating. Simulations of test ions interacting with turbulence confirm our scalings across a wide range of different ion and turbulence properties, including with a steep ion-kinetic transition range as seen in the solar wind. Our results provide a unified framework for understanding ion heating processes across diverse astrophysical environments from black-hole accretion disks to the solar corona, also providing a compact and versatile subgrid model for larger-scale simulations.</description>

      <title>An interferometric study of B star multiplicity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02300v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Massive stars can have extreme effects on their environments from local to galactic scales. While O star multiplicity has been studied over a broad separation range (to the point where absolute masses of these systems have been determined and investigations into multiple system formation and interactions have been performed), studies of B star multiplicity are lacking. Using interferometry, we investigated the multiplicity of a statistically significant sample of B stars over a range of separations (~0.5-35 au, given that the average distance to our sample is 412 pc). We analysed high angular resolution interferometric data taken with VLTI/PIONIER for a sample of 32 B stars. Using parametric modelling of the closure phases and visibilities, we determined best-fitting models to each of the systems and investigated whether each source was best represented by a single star or a higher-order system. The detection limits were calculated for companions to determine whether they were significant. We then combined our findings from the interferometric data with results from a literature search to determine whether other companions were reported at different separation ranges. Within the interferometric range 72+/-8% of the B stars are resolved as multiple systems. The most common type of system is a binary system, followed by triple systems, presumably single stars and then quadruple systems. The interferometric companion fraction derived for the sample is 1.88+/-0.24. When we accounted for spectroscopic companions that have been confirmed in the literature and wide companions inferred from Gaia data in addition to the companions we found with interferometry, we obtain multiplicity and companion fractions of 0.88+/-0.06 and 2.31+/-0.27, respectively, for our sample. The number of triple systems in particular increases significantly when we account for spectroscopic companions.</description>

      <title>XUE. JWST spectroscopy of externally irradiated disks around young intermediate-mass stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06093v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most young stars and therefore planetary systems form in high-mass star forming regions and are exposed to ultraviolet radiation, affecting the protoplanetary disk. These regions are located at large distances and only now with JWST become accessible to study the inner disks surrounding young stars. We present the eXtreme UV Environments (XUE) program, which provides the first detailed characterization of the physical and chemical properties of the inner disks around young intermediate-mass stars exposed to external irradiation from nearby massive stars. We present high signal to noise MIRI-MRS spectroscopy of 12 disks located in three sub-clusters of the high-mass star-forming region NGC 6357. Based on their mid-infrared spectral energy distribution, we classify the XUE sources into Group I and II based on the Meeus scheme. We analyze their molecular emission features, and compare their spectral indices and 10 $\mu$m silicate emission profiles to those of nearby Herbig and intermediate T Tauri disks. Despite being more massive, the XUE stars host disks with molecular richness comparable to isolated T Tauri systems. The 10 $\mu$m silicate features show lower F$_{11.3}$/F$_{9.8}$ ratios at a given F$_{\mathrm{peak}}$, but current uncertainties prevent conclusions about their inner disk properties. Most disks display water emission from the inner disk, suggesting that even in these extreme environments rocky planets can form in the presence of water. The absence of strong line fluxes and other irradiation signatures suggests that the XUE disks have been truncated by external UV photons. However, this truncation does not appear to significantly impact the chemical richness of their inner regions. These findings indicate that even in extreme environments, IMTT disks can retain the ingredients necessary for rocky planet formation.</description>

      <title>Infrared Spectroscopy of V838 Monocerotis in 2015 and 2022</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13151v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report medium-resolution $0.85-2.45\,\mu$m spectroscopy obtained in 2015 and 2022 and high resolution $2.27-2.39\,\mu$m and $4.59-4.77\,\mu$m spectroscopy obtained in 2015 of V838 Monocerotis, along with modeling of the $0.85-2.45\,\mu$ spectrum. V838 Mon underwent a series of eruptions and extreme brightenings in 2002, which are thought to have occured as a result of a stellar merger. The new spectra and modelling of them reveal a disturbed red giant photosphere that is probably continuing to contract and ejecta that are cooling and continuing to disperse at velocities up to 200kms$^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>In Situ Measurements of Dark Photon Dark Matter Using Parker Solar Probe: Going beyond the Radio Window</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12285v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dark photon dark matter (DPDM) emerges as a compelling candidate for ultralight bosonic dark matter, detectable through resonant conversion into photons within a plasma environment. This study employs in-situ measurements from the Parker Solar Probe (PSP), the first spacecraft to venture into the solar corona, to probe for DPDM signatures. The PSP in-situ measurements go beyond the traditional radio window, spanning frequencies between about 10 kHz and 20 MHz, a challenging range inaccessible to Earth-based radio astronomy. Additionally, the proximity of PSP to the resonant conversion location enhances the signal flux, providing a distinct advantage over ground-based observations. As a result, the PSP data establishes the most stringent constraints on the kinetic mixing parameter $\epsilon$ for DPDM frequencies between 70 kHz and 20 MHz, with values of $\epsilon \lesssim 10^{-14}-10^{-13}$. Investigating the data from STEREO satellites resulted in weaker constraints compared to those obtained from PSP. By utilizing state-of-the-art solar observations from space, we have surpassed the cosmic microwave background limits derived from early-universe observations.</description>

      <title>Hyperons and $\Delta$'s in rotating protoneutron stars: Global properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05495v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rotation plays an important role in the evolution of most types of stars, in particular, it can have a strong influence on the evolution of a newly born proto-neutron star. In this study, we investigate the effects of rotation on four snapshots of the evolution of proto-neutron stars with hyperons and $\Delta$-resonances in their cores, from birth as neutrino-rich objects to maturity as cold, catalyzed neutron stars. We focus on the effects of uniform rotation on the macroscopic structure of the star at three rotational frequencies -- 346.53 Hz, 716 Hz, and the Kepler frequency. Our investigation indicates that the impact of rotation at frequencies of $346.53$~Hz and $716$~Hz causes minor changes in the maximum gravitational mass but leads to significant changes in the stellar radius, particularly for stars with masses smaller than $2$~\msun. However, we observe drastic changes in the star's mass and radius when considering the Kepler frequency. In addition, we investigate other relevant characteristics of the rotating proto-neutron stars as they evolve such as the moment of inertia, compactness, central temperature, and Kerr parameter. Our results suggest that the inclusion of new degrees of freedom in the stellar core lead the star to be more sensitive to rotational dynamics, owing to an increase in compactness, a decrease in the central temperature, and a decrease in the moment of inertia.</description>
