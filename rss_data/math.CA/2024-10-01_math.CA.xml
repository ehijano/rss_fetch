      <title>Bilateral discrete and continuous orthogonality relations in the $q^{-1}$-symmetric Askey scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the $q^{-1}$-symmetric Askey scheme, namely the $q^{-1}$-Askey--Wilson, continuous dual $q^{-1}$-Hahn, $q^{-1}$-Al-Salam--Chihara, continuous big $q^{-1}$-Hermite and continuous $q^{-1}$-Hermite polynomials, we compute bilateral discrete and continuous orthogonality relations. We also derive a $q$-beta integral which comes from the continuous orthogonality relation for the $q^{-1}$-Askey--Wilson polynomials. In the $q\to 1^{-}$ limit, this $q$-beta integral corresponds to a beta integral of Ramanujan-type which we present and provide two proofs for.</description>

      <title>PDE-Systems associated with the hypergeometric functions in three variables and their particular solutions near the origin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The great success of the theory of hypergeometric series in one variable has stimulated the development of a corresponding theory in two and more variables. Horn has investigated the convergence of 34 (14 complete and 20 confluent) hypergeometric series of two variables and established the systems of partial differential equations which they satisfy. At present, 600 (of which 205 are complete and 395 are confluent) hypergeometric functions of three second-order variables are known. The present work is devoted to the composition of systems of partial differential equations satisfied by 600 confluent hypergeometric functions of three variables. In addition, a particular solutions (if such solutions exist) of some systems of differential equations have been found near the origin.</description>

      <title>On the Lebesgue measure of one generalised set of subsums of geometric series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present paper, we study a set that can be treated as a generalised set of subsums for a geometric series. This object was discovered independently in various mathematical aspects. For instance, it is closely related to various systems of representation of real numbers. The main object of this paper was particularly studied by R. Kenyon, who brought up a question about the Lebesgue measure of the set and conjectured that it is positive. Further, Z. Nitecki confirmed the hypothesis by using nontrivial topological techniques. However, the aforementioned result is quite limited, as this particular case should satisfy a rigid condition of homogeneity. Despite the limited progress, the problem remained understudied in a general framework.</description>

      <title>The number of real zeros of polynomials with constrained coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09553v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that there is an absolute constant $c &gt; 0$ such that every polynomial $P$ of the form $$P(z) = \sum_{j=0}^{n}{a_jz^j}\,, \quad |a_0| = 1\,, \quad |a_j| \leq M\,, \quad a_j \in \Bbb{C}\,, \quad M \geq 1\,,$$ has at most $cn^{1/2}(1+\log M)^{1/2}$ zeros in the interval $[-1,1]$. This result is sharp up to the multiplicative constant $c &gt; 0$ and extends an earlier result of Borwein, Erd\'elyi, and K\'os from the case $M=1$ to the case $M \geq $1. This has also been proved recently with the factor $(1+\log M)$ rather than $(1+\log M)^{1/2}$ in the Appendix of a recent paper by Jacob and Nazarov by using a different method. We also prove that there is an absolute constant $c &gt; 0$ such that every polynomial $P$ of the above form has at most $(c/a)(1+\log M)$ zeros in the interval $[-1+a,1-a]$ with $a \in (0,1)$. Finally we correct a somewhat incorrect proof of an earlier result of Borwein and Erd\'elyi by proving that there is a constant $\eta &gt; 0$ such that every polynomial $P$ of the above form with $M = 1$ has at most $\eta n^{1/2}$ zeros inside any polygon with vertices on the unit circle, where the multiplicative constant $\eta &gt; 0$ depends only on the polygon.</description>

      <title>A law of large numbers concerning the number of critical points of isotropic Gaussian functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14383v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For any smooth random Gaussian function $\Phi$ on $\mathbb{R}^m$ we denote by $Z_N(\Phi)$ the number of critical points of $\Phi$ inside the cube $[0,N]^m$. We prove that for certain isotropic random functions $\Phi$ the ratio $N^{-m}Z_N(\Phi)$ converges a.s. and $L^2$ to a universal explicit constant $C_m(\Phi)$.</description>
