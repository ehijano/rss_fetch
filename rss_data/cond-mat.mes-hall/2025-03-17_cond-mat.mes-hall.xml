      <title>Quantized Spin-Hall Conductivity in Altermagnet Fe$_2$Te$_2$O with Mirror-Spin Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to spin-orbit coupling (SOC), crucial for the quantum spin Hall (QSH) effect, a quantized spin-Hall conductivity has not yet been reported in QSH insulators and other realistic materials. Here, we tackle this challenge by predicting robust quantized spin-Hall conductivity in monolayer Fe$_2$Te$_2$O. The underlying physics originates from the unrecognized mirror-spin coupling (MSC), which couples spin-up and spin-down states into two orthogonal mirror eigenstates. We show that the MSC can naturally emerge in the two-dimensional altermagnets with out-of-plane N\'eel vector and horizontal mirror. A remarkable consequence of the MSC is that it can dramatically weaken the spin hybridization of the altermagnetic materials when SOC is included. When SOC is neglected, Fe$_2$Te$_2$O is an altermagnetic Weyl semimetal with MSC. With SOC, it evolves into the first material candidate for magnetic mirror Chern insulator. Remarkably, under the protection of MSC, the spin hybridization of both bulk and topological edge states in Fe$_2$Te$_2$O with SOC at low energy is negligible. As a consequence, a quantized spin-Hall conductivity emerges within the bulk band gap of the system. By unveiling a novel effect, our findings represent a significant advancement in spin Hall transport, and broaden the material candidates hosting intriguing altermagnetic phenomena.</description>

      <title>Direction-dependent linear response for gapped nodal-line semimetals in planar-Hall configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the magnetoelectric conductivity for ideal nodal-line semimetals (NLSMs), with a finite but tiny mass-gap, in distinct planar-Hall set-ups. Each differing configuration results from the relative orientation of the nodal-ring's plane with respect to the plane spanned by the electric and magnetic fields. Our results feature the signatures of the inherent topology of a gapped NLSM, revealed through nonzero values of the Berry curvature and the orbital magnetic moment. In particular, we show that both of these vector fields, arising in the momentum space, give rise to terms of comparable magnitudes in the resulting response. Our explicit theoretical expressions will help identify unique signatures of NLSMs in contemporary experiments.</description>

      <title>Single-gate tracking behavior in flat-band multilayer graphene devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A central feature of many van der Waals (vdW) materials is the ability to precisely control their charge doping, $n$, and electric displacement field, $D$, using top and bottom gates. For devices composed of only a few layers, it is commonly assumed that $D$ causes the layer-by-layer potential to drop linearly across the structure. Here, we show that this assumption fails for a broad class of crystalline and moir\'e vdW structures based on Bernal- or rhombohedral-stacked multilayer graphene. We find that the electronic properties at the Fermi level are largely dictated by special layer-polarized states arising at Bernal-stacked crystal faces, which typically coexist in the same band with layer-delocalized states. We uncover a novel mechanism by which the layer-delocalized states completely screen the layer-polarized states from the bias applied to the remote gate. This screening mechanism leads to an unusual scenario where voltages on either gate dope the band as expected, yet the band dispersion and associated electronic properties remain primarily (and sometimes exclusively) governed by the gate closer to the layer-polarized states. Our results reveal a novel electronic mechanism underlying the atypical single-gate-controlled transport characteristics observed across many flat-band graphitic structures, and provide key theoretical insights essential for accurately modeling these systems.</description>

      <title>Symmetry classification correspondence between quadratic Lindbladians and their steady states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetry classification is crucial in understanding universal properties of quantum matter. Recently, the scope of symmetry classification has been extended to open quantum systems governed by the Lindblad master equation. However, the classification of Lindbladians and steady states remains largely separate. Because the former requires the non-Hermitian classification framework, while the latter relies on the classification scheme for Hermitian matrices. In this paper we build connections between symmetry classes of quadratic Lindbladian and its steady state, despite their different classification frameworks. We classify the full matrix representation of generic quadratic Lindbladians with particle conservation, showing they fall into 27 non-Hermitian symmetry classes. Among these, 22 classes lead to an infinite-temperature steady state. The remaining five classes have one-to-one correspondence with five steady-state Hermitian symmetry classes. Numerical simulations of random Lindbladian dynamics confirm the convergence to the correct steady-state symmetry classes at long time.</description>

      <title>Finding Hidden Numbers with Majorana-based Topological Quantum Algorithms: Simulation of the Bernstein-Vazirani Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Executing quantum algorithms using Majorana zero modes - a major milestone for the field of topological quantum computing - requires a platform that can be scaled to large quantum registers, can be controlled in real time and space, and a braiding protocol that uses the unique properties of these exotic particles. Here, we demonstrate the first successful simulation of the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm in two-dimensional magnet-superconductor hybrid structures from initialization to read-out of the final many-body state. Utilizing the Majorana zero modes' topological properties, we introduce an optimized braiding protocol for the algorithm and a scalable architecture for its implementation with an arbitrary number of qubits. We visualize the algorithm protocol in real time and space by computing the non-equilibrium density of states, which is proportional to the time-dependent differential conductance, and the non-equilibrium charge density, which assigns a unique signature to each final state of the algorithm.</description>

      <title>Coherence of a hole spin flopping-mode qubit in a circuit quantum electrodynamics environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The entanglement of microwave photons and spin qubits in silicon represents a pivotal step forward for quantum information processing utilizing semiconductor quantum dots. Such hybrid spin circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) has been achieved by granting a substantial electric dipole moment to a spin by de-localizing it in a double quantum dot under spin-orbit interaction, thereby forming a flopping-mode (FM) spin qubit. Despite its promise, the coherence properties demonstrated to date remain insufficient to envision FM spin qubits as practical single qubits. Here, we present a FM hole spin qubit in a silicon nanowire coupled to a high-impedance niobium nitride microwave resonator for readout. We report Rabi frequencies exceeding 100 MHz and coherence times in the microsecond range, resulting in a high single gate quality factor of 380. This establishes FM spin qubits as fast and reliable qubits. Moreover, using the large frequency tunability of the FM qubit, we reveal for the first time that photonic effects predominantly limit coherence, with radiative decay being the main relaxation channel and photon shot-noise inducing dephasing. These results highlight that optimized microwave engineering can unlock the potential of FM spin qubits in hybrid cQED architectures, offering a scalable and robust platform for fast and coherent spin qubits with strong coupling to microwave photons.</description>

      <title>Solid-State Gravitational Redshift: Transport Signatures of Massless Dirac Fermions in Tilted Dirac Cone Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the propagation of electron waves in a two-dimensional tilted Dirac cone heterostructure where tilt depends on the coordinate $z$ along the junction. The resulting Dirac equation in an emergent curved spacetime for the spinor $\psi(z)$ can be efficiently solved using 4th-order Runge-Kutta numerical method by a transformation to a "suitable" spinor $\varphi$ where the resulting Dirac cone looks locally upright. The spatial texture of the tilt induces oscillatory behaviors in key physical quantities such as the norm $|\varphi(z)|^2$ of the wave function, polar and azimuthal angles $\Theta(z)$ and $\Phi(z)$ of the pseudospin, and the integrated transmission $\tau$ where oscillation wave-lengths get shorter (longer) in stronger (weaker) tilt regions. Such an oscillatory behavior reminiscent of gravitational red-shift is an indicator of an underlying spacetime metric that can be probed in tunneling experiments. We derive analytical approximations for the position-dependent wave numbers $\Delta k_z(z)$ that explain the red-shift patterns and corroborate them with numerical simulations. For a tilt "bump" spread over length scale $\ell$, upon increasing $\ell$, the amplitude of red-shifted oscillations reduces whereas the number of peaks increases. The scale invariance of Dirac equation allows to probe these aspects of $\ell$-dependence by a voltage sweep in transmission experiments. Smooth variations of the tilt reduce impedance mismatch of the electron waves, thereby giving rise to very high transmission rate. This concept can be used in combination with a sigmoid-shaped tilt texture for red-shift or blue-shift engineering of the transmitted waves, depending on whether the sigmoid is downswing or upswing.</description>

      <title>Reflectionless modes as a source of Weyl nodes in multiterminal Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiterminal Josephson junctions are a promising platform to study non-trivial topology in engineered quantum systems. Yet, experimentally meaningful insight into what exactly makes these systems topologically non-trivial remains elusive. In this work, we show that zero energy reflectionless scattering modes (RSMs) of the normal scattering matrix result in topological phase boundaries. By analyzing two different setups, we explain the origin of each topological phase boundary and furthermore provide generalizable insight into these systems. The considerations here can be of help for experimentalists as it connects the properties of the normal scattering region to the Andreev bound state spectrum of superconducting junctions in a multiterminal setup.</description>

      <title>Magnetic moment of electrons in systems with spin-orbit coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic effects originating from spin-orbit coupling (SOC) have been attracting major attention. However, SOC contributions to the electron magnetic moment operator are conventionally disregarded. In this work, we analyze relativistic contributions to the latter operator, including those of the SOC-type: in vacuum, for the semiconductor 8 band Kane model, and for an arbitrary system with two spectral branches. In this endeavor, we introduce a notion of relativistic corrections to the operation $\partial/\partial\boldsymbol B$, where $\boldsymbol B$ is an external magnetic field. We highlight the difference between the magnetic moment and $-\partial H/\partial\boldsymbol B$, where $H$ is the system Hamiltonian. We suggest to call this difference the abnormal magnetic moment. We demonstrate that the conventional splitting of the total magnetic moment into the spin and orbital parts becomes ambiguous when relativistic corrections are taken into account. The latter also jeopardize the ``modern theory of orbital magnetization'' in its standard formulation. We derive a linear response Kubo formula for the kinetic magnetoelectric effect projected to individual branches of a two branch system. This allows us, in particular, to identify a source of this effect that stems from noncommutation of the position and $\partial/\partial\boldsymbol B$ operators' components. This is an analog of the contribution to the Hall conductivity from noncommuting components of the position operator. We also report several additional observations related to the electron magnetic moment operator in systems with SOC and other relativistic corrections.</description>

      <title>Observation of High-Temperature Dissipationless Fractional Chern Insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fractional quantum anomalous Hall effect has recently been experimentally observed in zero-field fractional Chern insulators (FCI). However, an outstanding challenge is the presence of a substantial longitudinal resistance $R_{xx}$ (a few k$\Omega$), even though the anomalous Hall resistance $R_{xy}$ is quantized. This dissipative behavior is likely linked to imperfect sample quality. Here, we report transport measurements of a drastically improved twisted $\text{MoTe}_2$ bilayer device, which exhibits quantized $R_{xy}$ and vanishing $R_{xx}$ for the $-2/3$ state, marking a dissipationless FCI. Contrary to fractional quantum Hall states where the energy gap increases with magnetic field, we find that the thermal activation gap of the observed FCI states decreases rapidly as the magnetic field rises from zero, then plateaus above a few teslas. This observation is attributed to the interplay between spin and charge gaps. Due to the spontaneous ferromagnetism, the spin gap dominates at low field, while the charge gap becomes appreciable once the magnetic field freezes spin fluctuations. For the $-2/3$ state, we estimate the spin and FCI gap of about 55 and 20 K, respectively. Our results provide insights into the energy scale of FCI and offer a pathway for quantum engineering of exotic correlated topological states.</description>

      <title>Hole spin splitting in a Ge quantum dot with finite barriers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the low-energy spectrum of a single hole confined in a planar Ge quantum dot (QD) within the effective-mass formalism. The QD is sandwiched between two GeSi barriers of finite potential height grown along the [001] direction. To treat this finite barrier problem, we adopt an independent-band approach in dealing with boundary conditions. The effects of different system parameters are investigated, including the width of the out-of-plane confining well, the size of the dot, and silicon concentration in the confining layers. The more accurate finite-barrier model results in the non-negligible dependence of the anisotropic $g$-factor on the choice of boundary conditions and on the silicon concentration in the barrier. Furthermore, while the ideal model of a planar dot with a square-well heterostructure already has an intrinsic spin-orbit coupling, realistic effects arising from the experimental setup may give rise to additional contributions. We investigate the impact from the top-gate electric field and the residual tensile strain on the qubit states. The results indicate that these effects are important contributions to the total spin-orbit coupling which enables fast electric control.</description>

      <title>Efficient spin-wave excitation by surface acoustic waves in ultra-low damping YIG/ZnO-heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the efficient excitation of spin waves in the ultra-low magnetic damping material yttrium-iron-garnet (YIG) by surface acoustic waves (SAWs). To this end, we employ interdigital transducers fabricated on a piezoelectric zinc oxide (ZnO) thin film covering the YIG. This enables the excitation of coherent, propagating Rayleigh-type and Sezawa-type SAWs. We find that the ultralow magnetic damping of YIG is retained after the ZnO-deposition and we carry out a comprehensive investigation of the magnetoelastic interaction due to the different SAW modes as a function of the external magnetic field magnitude and orientation. By measuring the SAW attenuation our experiments reveal a highly anisotropic and non-reciprocal SAW-SW-interaction in agreement with our model caluclation, while demonstrating that low-damping magnons can be efficiently excited by SAWs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of electrons in crystalline solids in the presence of inhomogeneous external electric and magnetic fields. We present a manifestly gauge-invariant operator-based approach without relying on a semiclassical wavepacket construction, and derive the field-induced corrections to the equations of motion at the operator level. This includes the Berry curvature induced anomalous velocity and contributions arising from the quantum geometry of the Bloch bands. We show explicitly how these multi-band effects are manifested in an effective single band approximation. We present a formalism that allows for a systematic expansion to an arbitrary order in the inhomogeneity of the applied fields, as well as a way to compute the matrix elements in Bloch basis.</description>

      <title>Coherent suppression of high harmonics in Dirac materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-harmonic generation in solids by intense laser pulses provides a fascinating platform for studying ultra-fast electron dynamics and material properties, where the coherent character of the electron dynamics is a central aspect. Using the semiconductor Bloch equations, we expound a mechanism suppressing the high harmonic spectrum arising from the coherent superposition of intra- vs inter-band contributions to the total signal. We provide evidence for the generality of this phenomenon by extensive numerical simulations exploring the parameter space of this coherent suppression of high harmonics in systems of massive Dirac Fermions. We supplement our numerical observations with analytical results for the one-dimensional case. Moreover, we demonstrate reentrant behavior of suppressed high harmonics upon increasing dephasing.</description>

      <title>Controllable Antiferromagnetic-Ferromagnetic phase transition in monolayer MnPSe3 via atomic adsorption of Li, O, and F</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The engineering of magnetic order and electronic states in two-dimensional (2D) materials is pivotal for advanced spintronic technologies. Despite their potential, the scarcity of intrinsic 2D ferromagnets remains a critical challenge. Here, we employ density functional theory with Hubbard-U corrections to systematically investigate adsorbate-driven magnetic transitions in monolayer MnPSe3. While pristine MnPSe3 exhibits antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering with a semiconducting gap, Li, O, and F adatom adsorption induces an AFM-to-ferromagnetic (AFM-FM) phase transition across large coverage ranges. Our calculations reveal enhanced thermodynamic stability at elevated coverages, with full-coverage configurations (Li0.5MnPSe3, MnPSe3O0.5, MnPSe3F0.5) favored energetically. Hybrid functional (HSE06) calculations show that F adsorption drives a semiconductor-to-half-metal transition, whereas Li and O adsorption preserves semiconductivity. Moreover, Li adsorption induces a valley splitting of 20.3 meV at the K1 and K2 points in the band structure of the monolayer MnPSe3. Magnetic anisotropy analysis reveals adsorbate-dependent easy-axis reorientation: Li (electron doping) switches the easy-axis from in-plane to out-of-plane, while O/F (hole doping) stabilizes in-plane easy-axis, consistent with carrier-density-modulation simulations. Crucially, carrier doping results indicate that once the electron doping concentration reaches critical concentration, the magnetic easy axis of monolayer MnPSe3 transitions from in-plane to out-of-plane. This work establishes atomic adsorption as a robust strategy for tailoring 2D magnetism, resolving discrepancies through rigorous treatment of exchange-correlation effects and configurational diversity.</description>

      <title>Revealing Superconducting Chiral Edge Modes via Resistance Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inducing superconducting correlations in quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) states offers a promising route to realize topological superconductivity with chiral Majorana edge modes. However, the definitive identification of these modes is challenging. Here we propose detecting superconducting chiral edge modes via the probability distribution of the resistance, or equivalently the charge transmission of QAH-superconductor heterojunctions. Remarkably, the distribution for coherent edge exhibits distinct characteristics for different topological superconducting phases in sufficiently long junctions, and this difference remains robust against weak decoherence. These findings provide new insights into transport phenomena beyond the clean limit and highlight the resistance distribution as a compelling signature for distinguishing topological superconducting phases.</description>

      <title>Testing Kubo formula on a nonlinear quantum conductor driven far from equilibrium via power exchanges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an experimental test of Kubo formula performed on a nonlinear quantum conductor, a Superconductor-Insulator-Superconductor tunnel junction, driven far from equilibrium by a DC voltage bias. We implement the proposal of Lesovik and Loosen [1] and demonstrate experimentally that it is possible to extract both the emission and absorption noise of the conductor by measuring the power it exchanges with a linear detection circuit whose occupation is tuned close to vacuum levels. We then compare their difference to the real part of the admittance which is independently measured by coherent reflectometry, finding that Kubo formula holds within experimental accuracy.</description>

      <title>Edge disorder and magnetism in graphene nanoribbons: an inverse modelling approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is difficult to completely eliminate disorder during the fabrication of graphene-based nanodevices. From a simulation perspective, it is straightforward to determine the electronic transport properties of disordered devices if complete information about the disorder and the Hamiltonian describing it is available. However, to do the reverse and determine information about the nature of the disorder purely from transport measurements is a far more difficult task. In this work, we apply a recently developed inversion technique to identify important structural information about edge-disordered zigzag graphene nanoribbons. The inversion tool decodes the electronic transmission spectrum to obtain the overall level of edge vacancies in this type of device. We also consider the role of spin-polarised states at the ribbon edges and demonstrate that, in addition to edge roughness, the inversion procedure can also be used to detect the presence of magnetism in such nanoribbons. We finally show that if the transmission for both spin orientations is available, for example by using ferromagnetic contacts in a transport measurement, then additional structural information about the relative concentration of defects on each edge can be derived.</description>

      <title>Partial Backscattering between Helical Edge States Revealed by Energy-Selective Interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The protection against backscattering of spin-momentum-locked metallic edge states makes quantum spin Hall insulators (QSHIs) highly appealing for spintronic applications, offering exceptional resilience against non-magnetic disorder. This protection arises from the time-reversal symmetry of helical edge modes with opposite spin and momentum, which prohibits single-particle backscattering within a single Kramers pair. However, backscattering remains possible between energy-degenerate helical edge states not linked by time-reversal symmetry, as can occur in strongly non-linear edge dispersions with multiple Kramers pairs. Here, we investigate inter-Kramers pair backscattering in the non-linear edge bands of the QSHI indenene, highlighting a critical aspect of edge-state stability. Using quasiparticle interference in scanning tunneling spectroscopy -- a direct probe of backscattering -- we observe pairwise coupling of energy-degenerate helical edge states, while energy regions with only a single Kramers pair remain strictly protected. Supported by theoretical analysis, our findings extend the conventional understanding of backscattering protection beyond idealized linear dispersions to more realistic, nonlinear edge-mode configurations. This insight has profound implications for numerous QSHI candidates, emphasizing that the mere presence of gap-traversing edge modes does not inherently guarantee their topological protection.</description>

      <title>Real-time edge dynamics of non-Hermitian lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the asymptotic forms of the Green's function at the open edges of general non-Hermitian band systems in all dimensions in the long-time limit, using a modified saddle-point approximation and the analytic continuation of the momentum. The edge dynamics is determined by the "dominant saddle point", a complex momentum, which, contrary to previous conjectures, may lie outside the generalized Brillouin zone. From this result, we obtain the effective edge Hamiltonians that evidently, as demonstrated by extensive numerical simulations, characterize the dynamics on the edges, and can be probed in real-time experiments or spectroscopies.</description>

      <title>Quantum geometry and low-frequency optical conductivity of topological nodal planes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nodal planes, two-dimensional symmetry-enforced band crossings, can carry a topological charge, similar to Weyl points. While the transport properties of Weyl points are well understood, those of nodal planes remain largely unexplored. These properties are influenced not only by the Berry curvature, but also by other quantum geometric quantities. In this work we study the quantum geometry - specifically the Berry curvature and quantum metric - and the linear optical conductivity of topological nodal planes. We introduce a low-energy model and investigate its low-frequency optical responses to determine the unique signatures of topological nodal planes. By comparing these findings to the optical response in a tight-binding model with a topological nodal plane, we observe consistent low-frequency behavior with a cubic power law. This paves the way for the experimental detection of topological nodal planes through optical conductivity measurements.</description>

      <title>Coherent control through phonon anharmonicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anharmonic lattice vibrations play a key role in many physical phenomena. They govern the heat conductivity of solids, strongly affect the phonon spectra, play a prominent role in soft mode phase transitions, allow ultrafast engineering of material properties and more. The most direct evidence for anharmonicity is to measure the oscillation frequency changing as a function of the oscillation amplitude. For lattice vibrations, this is not a trivial task, and anharmonicity is probed indirectly through its effects on thermodynamic properties and spectral features or through coherent decay of one mode to another. However, measurement of the anharmonicity of a single Raman mode is still lacking. We show that ultrafast double pump-probe spectroscopy could be used to directly observe frequency shifts of Raman phonons as a function of the oscillation amplitude and disentangle the coherent contributions from quasi-harmonic sources such as temperature and changes to the carrier density in the thermoelectric materials SnTe and SnSe. Our results have dramatic implications for the material engineering of future thermoelectrics. Moreover, our methodology could be used to isolate the basic mechanisms driving optically induced phase transitions and other nonlinear phenomena based on their unique timestamps.</description>

      <title>Bimeron Crystals by a Linearly Polarized AC Electric Field in Frustrated Magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically propose a method to generate topological spin textures by irradiating a classical spin system with a linearly polarized AC electric field. To this end, we investigate non-equilibrium steady states in a classical Heisenberg model with frustrated exchange interactions on a two-dimensional triangular lattice by numerically solving the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation at zero temperature. Our results reveal that the linearly polarized AC electric-field irradiation induces a topological phase transition from a single-Q spiral state to a bimeron crystal with the skyrmion number of one in the low-frequency regime. Furthermore, we show that the obtained bimeron crystal remains relatively stable against both easy-axis and easy-plane single-ion anisotropies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: DiracBilinears.jl is a Julia package for computing Dirac bilinears, which are fundamental physical quantities of electrons in relativistic quantum theory, using first-principles calculations for solids. In relativistic quantum theory, 16 independent bilinears can be defined using the four-component Dirac field. We take the non-relativistic limit for the bilinears, which corresponds to the $1/m$ expansion, and focus on the low-energy physics typically considered in condensed matter physics. This package can evaluate the spatial distributions and Wannier matrix elements of the Dirac bilinears in solids quantitatively by connecting to the external first-principles calculation packages, including Quantum ESPRESSO, Wannier90, and wan2respack.</description>

      <title>Preparing magnonic non-Gaussian states by adding a single magnon onto Gaussian states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum magnonics based on YIG spheres provides a new arena for observing macroscopic quantum states. Here we propose to prepare two kinds of non-Gaussian magnonic states by adding a single magnon onto two Gaussian states, namely, coherent and thermal states. We adopt an optomagnonic system of a YIG sphere and use fast optical pulses to weakly activate the magnon-induced Stokes scattering. Conditioned on the detection of a polarized single photon, a single magnon can be added onto an initial Gaussian state. We use a microwave cavity to prepare an initial magnon coherent state and finally read out the generated single-magnon added coherent or thermal state. Both the non-Gaussian states of a magnon mode in a large-size YIG sphere are macroscopic quantum states, which exhibit many nonclassical properties, such as sub-Poissonian statistics, quadrature squeezing, and a negative Wigner function. Further, both states show a smooth transition from a quantum state to a classical state by changing the coherent or thermal magnon excitations and thus can be used for the fundamental study of the quantum-to-classical transition.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent observation of the in-plane anomalous Hall effect in magnetic Weyl semimetal EuCd2Sb2 has drawn attention to out-of-plane orbital magnetization induced by an in-plane field component. Here we study EuZn2Sb2, a sister compound of EuCd2Sb2, to demonstrate sensitive changes of the in-plane anomalous Hall effect on the band modulation. The Hall resistivity measured with rotating the magnetic field within the (001) principal plane of EuZn2Sb2 films exhibits a clear three-fold component corresponding to the in-plane anomalous Hall effect, which is distinct from the two-fold component of the planar Hall effect. The in-plane anomalous Hall effect of EuZn2Sb2 is highly contrasting to EuCd2Sb2, especially in terms of its opposite sign and field dependence, which can be explained by model calculations with different band inversion parameters. Our results pave the way for systematically controlling the in-plane anomalous Hall effect and orbital magnetization through elaborate band engineering.</description>

      <title>Tuning Electrode Wettability to Optimize Nanobubble Nucleation and Reaction Rates in Electrochemical Gas-Evolving Reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bubble formation in electrochemical system often hinders reaction efficiency by reducing active surface area and obstructing mass transfer, yet the mechanisms governing their nanoscale nucleation dynamics and impact remains unclear. In this study, we used molecular dynamics simulations to explore nanobubble nucleation and reaction rates during water electrolysis on planar- and nano-electrodes, with systematically tuning electrode wettability through water-electrode and gas-electrode interactions. We identified distinct nucleation regimes: gas layers, surface nanobubbles, bulk nanobubbles, and no nanobubbles, and revealed a volcano-shaped relationship between wettability and reaction rate, where optimal wettability strikes a balance between suppressing bubbles and ensuring sufficient reactant availability to maximize performance. Nanoelectrodes consistently exhibit higher current densities compared to planar electrodes with the same wettability, due to pronounced edge effects. Furthermore, moderate driving forces enhance reaction rates without triggering surface bubble formation, while excessive driving forces induce surface nanobubble nucleation, leading to suppressed reaction rates and complex dynamics driven by bubble growth and detachment. These findings highlight the importance of fine-tuning wettability and reaction driving forces to optimize gas-evolving electrochemical systems at the nanoscale and underscore the need for multiscale simulation frameworks integrating atomic-scale reaction kinetics, nanoscale bubble nucleation, and microscale bubble dynamics to fully understand bubble behavior and its impact on performance.</description>

      <title>Double-helicoid surface states in Dirac semimetals protected by glide-time-reversal symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, some $Z_2$ monopole charges were defined for Dirac semimetals with $\mathcal{GT}$ symmetry ($\mathcal{G}$: glide, $\mathcal{T}$: time-reversal) in previous works, and the charges are believed to lead to double-helicoid surface states. However, no proof of the bulk-surface correspondence is given there. In this paper, we point out one of the $Z_2$ charges in the previous works is gauge-dependent, and newly define another $Z_2$ charge. Using this new $Z_2$ charge, we give a proof of the bulk-surface correspondence. We also compare the new $Z_2$ charge with the $Z_2$ invariant for $\mathcal{G}$-protected topological crystalline insulators, and the second Stiefel-Whitney number for $\mathcal{PT}$-protected nodal line semimetals.</description>

      <title>Electrical Spin-Flip Current Switching in Layered Diluted Magnetic Semiconductors for Ultralow-Power Spintronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient magnetic switching is a cornerstone for advancing spintronics, particularly for energy-efficient data storage and memory devices. Here, we report the electrical switching of spin-flips in V-doped WSe2 multilayers, a van der Waals (vdW)-layered diluted magnetic semiconductor (DMS), demonstrating ultralow-power switching operation at room temperature. Our study reveals unique linear magnetoresistance and parabolic magnetoresistance states, where electrical modulation induces transitions between interlayered ferromagnetic, ferrimagnetic, and antiferromagnetic configurations. We identify an unconventional linear magnetoresistance hysteresis characterized by electrically driven spin flip/flop switching, distinct from conventional random network disorder or linear band-dispersion mechanisms. Applying an electrical voltage across vertical vdW layered V-doped WSe2 multilayers generates the spin currents at room temperature, driving spin-flip transitions from ferromagnetic to antiferromagnetic states due to a strong spin transfer torque effect. Notably, the critical current density reaches an ultralow value of 10-1Acm-2, accompanied by pico-watt power consumption, a record-low spin current density by a six-order-of-magnitude improvement over conventional spintronic devices. These findings establish the V-doped WSe2 multilayer device as a transformative platform for ultralow power spintronics, underscoring the potential of vdW-layered DMS systems for next generation energy-efficient spintronic technologies.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous flexoelectricity in cubic lead-halide perovskite MAPbBr$_3$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lead-halide perovskites exhibit remarkable efficiency in photovoltaics, driven by exceptionally long carrier diffusion lengths and recombination times. Paradoxically, this performance persists even in defect-rich, solution-grown samples. Here, we use a suite of optical and charge transport measurements to reveal that key optoelectronic properties of perovskites arise from localized flexoelectric polarization confined to the interfaces between domains of spontaneous strain, present even in nominally cubic single crystals. This insight provides a microscopic link between structural composition and charge transport in these materials, reconciling conflicting prior observations and offering new design principles for perovskite-based solar cells.</description>

      <title>Noise immunity in quantum optical systems through non-Hermitian topology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimode nonlinear optical systems are highly valued for their ability to withstand large amounts of optical power, transmit data with high bandwidth, perform physical computations, generate quantum correlations, and much more. For many of these applications, both classical and quantum noise place limitations on important performance metrics. Moreover, it is well known that nonlinear systems tend to develop noise due to their sensitivity to initial conditions, thus motivating the development of general principles which can be used to control and mitigate noise in such systems. In this work, we show that non-reciprocity can enable the unidirectional flow of noise from the non-equilibrium steady states of nonlinear driven-dissipative systems. We demonstrate that this unidirectional flow results from the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) for quantum noise. This effect provides a robust mechanism for isolating parts of the system from degradation due to excess injected noise. Our findings may lead to novel design principles for multimode amplifiers or oscillators that support high power handling while mitigating the buildup of noise. Moreover, our approach provides a new means to connect non-Hermitian topology with nonlinear many-body systems, which is expected to lead to topological descriptions of interacting states of light.</description>

      <title>Encoding information onto the charge and spin state of a paramagnetic atom using MgO tunnelling spintronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.16592v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An electrical current that flows across individual atoms can generate exotic quantum transport signatures in model junctions built using atomic tip or lateral techniques. So far, however, a viable industrial pathway for atom-driven devices has been lacking. Here, we demonstrate that a commercialized device platform can fill this nanotechnological gap. According to conducting tip atomic force microscopy, inserting C atoms into the MgO barrier of a magnetic tunnel junction generates nanotransport paths. Within magnetotransport experiments, this results in quantum interferences, and in Pauli spin blockade effects linked to tunneling magnetoresistance peaks that can be electrically controlled. We report an additional persistent memory effect that we attribute to the charging of a single "gating" C atom that is adjacent to a single C atom forming the microscale junction's effective nanotranport path. Local magnetometry experiments confirm the secondary role of magnetic stray fields on the C atoms. Our results show that, to exhibit atom-level properties, a device need not be nanoscaled, and position MgO tunneling spintronics as a promising platform to industrially implement quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Towards electrical domain-wall control in polyacetylene-based electronic nanodevices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15257v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically propose a polymer-based nano-device consisting of a single trans-polyacetylene (tPA) molecule capacitively coupled to external voltage gates. We model the integrated device using a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH)-like Hamiltonian, and we demonstrate the emergence of localized domain walls (DWs) with quantized charges (i.e., soliton excitations) localized at the gates. Interestingly, by increasing the applied voltage, multiple discrete charges can be accumulated, which may be useful for potential technological applications. Exploiting the topological character of the solitonic excitations of tPA, this device can be considered as an organic-based quantum dot with a very large and robust quantized charge.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00098v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum geometry, characterized by the quantum geometric tensor, is pivotal in diverse physical phenomena in quantum materials. In condensed matter systems, quantum geometry refers to the geoemtric properties of Bloch states in the Brillouin zone. This pedagogical review provides an accessible introduction to the concept of quantum geometry, emphasizing its extensive implications across multiple domains. Specifically, we discuss the role of quantum geometry in optical responses, Landau levels, and fractional Chern insulators, as well as its influence on superfluid weight, spin stiffness, exciton condensates, electron-phonon coupling, etc. By integrating these topics, we underscore the pervasive significance of quantum geometry in understanding emergent behaviors in quantum materials. Finally, we present an outlook on open questions and potential future directions, highlighting the need for continued exploration in this rapidly developing field.</description>

      <title>Fractional topological states in rhombohedral multilayer graphene modulated by kagome superlattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17320v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fractional quantum anomalous Hall effects realized in twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ and multilayer-graphene-based moir\'e heterostructures have captured a tremendous growth of interest. In this work, we propose that rhombohedral multilayer graphene coupled with an artificial kagome superlattice potential is a new platform to realize various fractional topological phases. Taking Bernal bilayer graphene as the simplest example, when it is placed on top of a prepatterned SiO$_2$ substrate with periodic arrays of holes arranged into kagome lattice, the system would be subject to a tunable kagome superlattice potential once an electrostatic voltage drop between the top and bottom gates is applied. Then, we theoretically study the electronic band structures, topological properties, and quantum geometric properties of the Bloch states of Bernal bilayer graphene coupled with a realistic kagome superlattice potential, which is well benchmarked by transport measurements in the weak superlattice-potential regime. We find that the system may exhibit nearly ideal topological flat bands in a substantial region of the parameter space spanned by superlattice constant and electrostatic potential strength. When these topological flat bands are fractionally filled, exact diagonalization calculations suggest that the system would exhibit rich fractional topological phases at 1/3, 2/3, 2/5, 3/5 and 1/2 fillings including both fractional Chern insulators and anomalous composite Fermi liquids under zero magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Observation of the nonlinear chiral thermoelectric Hall effect in tellurium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08058v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nonlinear thermoelectric effect is a key factor for realising unconventional thermoelectric phenomena, such as heat rectification and power generation using thermal fluctuations. Recent theoretical advances have indicated that chiral materials can host a variety of exotic nonlinear thermoelectric transport arising from inversion-symmetry breaking. However, experimental demonstration has yet to be achieved. Here, we report the observation of the nonlinear chiral thermoelectric Hall effect in chiral tellurium at room temperature, where a voltage is generated as a cross product of the temperature gradient and electric field. The resulting thermoelectric Hall voltage is on the order of {\mu}V, consistent with the prediction from the ab initio calculation. Furthermore, the sign of the thermoelectric Hall voltage is reversed depending on the crystal chirality, demonstrating a novel functionality of sign control of the thermoelectric effect by the chirality degrees of freedom. Our findings reveal the potential of chiral systems as nonlinear thermoelectric materials for advanced thermal management and energy harvesting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.12756v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose new ideas to directly search for light dark matter, such as the axion or the dark photon, by using magnetometry with nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamonds. If the dark matter couples to the electron spin, it affects the evolution of the Bloch vectors consisting of the spin triplet states, which may be detected through several magnetometry techniques. We give several concrete examples with the use of dc and ac magnetometry and estimate the sensitivity on dark matter couplings.</description>

      <title>Arresting Quantum Chaos Dynamically in Transmon Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14935v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ergodic quantum many-body systems evolving under unitary time dynamics typically lose memory of their initial state via information scrambling. Here we consider a paradigmatic translationally invariant many-body Hamiltonian of interacting bosons -- a Josephson junction array in the transmon regime -- in the presence of a strong Floquet drive. Generically, such a time-dependent drive is expected to heat the system to an effectively infinite temperature, featureless state in the late-time limit. However, using numerical exact-diagonalization we find evidence of special ratios of the drive amplitude and frequency where the system develops {\it emergent} conservation laws, and {\it approximate} integrability. Remarkably, at these same set of points, the Lyapunov exponent associated with the semi-classical dynamics for the coupled many-body equations of motion drops by orders of magnitude, arresting the growth of chaos. We supplement our numerical results with an analytical Floquet-Magnus expansion that includes higher-order corrections, and capture the slow dynamics that controls decay away from exact freezing.</description>

      <title>Verifying the analogy between transversely coupled spin-1/2 systems and inductively-coupled fluxoniums</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15450v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report a detailed characterization of two inductively coupled superconducting fluxonium qubits for implementing high-fidelity cross-resonance gates. Our circuit stands out because it behaves very closely to the case of two transversely coupled spin-1/2 systems. In particular, the generally unwanted static ZZ-term due to the non-computational transitions is nearly absent despite a strong qubit-qubit hybridization. Spectroscopy of the non-computational transitions reveals a spurious LC-mode arising from the combination of the coupling inductance and the capacitive links between the terminals of the two qubit circuits. Such a mode has a minor effect on our specific device, but it must be carefully considered for optimizing future designs.</description>

      <title>Impurity-induced counter skin-effect and linear modes in non-Hermitian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01265v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-reciprocal lattice systems are among the simplest non-Hermitian systems, exhibiting several key features absent in their Hermitian counterparts. In this study, we investigate the Hatano-Nelson model with an impurity and unveil how the impurity influences the intrinsic non-Hermitian skin effect of the system. We present an exact analytical solution to the problem under both open and periodic boundary conditions, irrespective of the impurity's position and strength. This exact solution is thoroughly validated by numerical simulations. Our analysis reveals a distinctive phenomenon where a specific impurity strength, determined by the non-reciprocal hopping parameters, induces a unique skin state at the impurity site. This impurity state exhibits a skin effect that counterbalances the boundary-induced skin effect, a phenomenon we term the impurity-induced counter skin-effect. These findings offer unprecedented insights into the dynamics of non-Hermitian systems with impurities, elucidating the complex interplay between impurities and the system's non-reciprocal nature. Furthermore, our results suggest potential applications in quantum sensing, where the unique characteristics of the impurity-induced counter skin-effect could be harnessed for enhanced sensitivity and precision.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02984v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gate operations composed in quantum circuits form the basis for digital quantum simulation and quantum processing. While two-qubit gates generally operate on nearest neighbours, many circuits require nonlocal connectivity and necessitate some form of quantum information transport. Yet, connecting distant nodes of a quantum processor still remains challenging, particularly for neutral atoms in optical lattices. Here, we create singlet pairs of two magnetic states of fermionic potassium-40 atoms in an optical lattice and use a bi-directional topological Thouless pump to transport, coherently split, and separate the pairs, as well as to demonstrate interaction between them via tuneable $($swap$)^\alpha$-gate operations. We achieve pumping with a single-shift fidelity of 99.78(3)% over 50 lattice sites and split the pairs within a decoherence-free subspace. Gates are implemented by superexchange interaction, allowing us to produce interwoven atomic singlets. For read-out, we apply a magnetic field gradient, resulting in single- and multi-frequency singlet-triplet oscillations. Our work shows avenues to create complex patterns of entanglement and new approaches to quantum processing, sensing, and atom interferometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07665v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There exist metastable domain walls of the flavor-singlet meson $\eta$ for the ${\rm U}(1)$ axial symmetry in two-flavor color superconductivity (2SC) in QCD at large baryon density. We show that, due to the coupling of $\eta$ to confined ${\rm SU}(2)$ gluons in the 2SC phase, the effective theory on the domain wall is described by the ${\rm SU}(2)_{-1}$ Chern-Simons theory, which is dual to the ${\rm U}(1)_{2}$ Chern-Simons theory. This theory has a spin-1 droplet excitation that does not carry a baryon number, which we identify as a vector meson. We also discuss the effective theories and baryonic droplet excitations on the domain walls of the flavor-singlet mesons in the superfluid phases of QCD at large isospin density and two-color QCD at large baryon density.</description>
