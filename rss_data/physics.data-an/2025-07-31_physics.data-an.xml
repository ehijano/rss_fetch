      <title>Quantum generative modeling for financial time series with temporal correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum generative adversarial networks (QGANs) have been investigated as a method for generating synthetic data with the goal of augmenting training data sets for neural networks. This is especially relevant for financial time series, since we only ever observe one realization of the process, namely the historical evolution of the market, which is further limited by data availability and the age of the market. However, for classical generative adversarial networks it has been shown that generated data may (often) not exhibit desired properties (also called stylized facts), such as matching a certain distribution or showing specific temporal correlations. Here, we investigate whether quantum correlations in quantum inspired models of QGANs can help in the generation of financial time series. We train QGANs, composed of a quantum generator and a classical discriminator, and investigate two approaches for simulating the quantum generator: a full simulation of the quantum circuits, and an approximate simulation using tensor network methods. We tested how the choice of hyperparameters, such as the circuit depth and bond dimensions, influenced the quality of the generated time series. The QGAN that we trained generate synthetic financial time series that not only match the target distribution but also exhibit the desired temporal correlations, with the quality of each property depending on the hyperparameters and simulation method.</description>

      <title>Better Together: Cross and Joint Covariances Enhance Signal Detectability in Undersampled Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many data-science applications involve detecting a shared signal between two high-dimensional variables. Using random matrix theory methods, we determine when such signal can be detected and reconstructed from sample correlations, despite the background of sampling noise induced correlations. We consider three different covariance matrices constructed from two high-dimensional variables: their individual self covariance, their cross covariance, and the self covariance of the concatenated (joint) variable, which incorporates the self and the cross correlation blocks. We observe the expected Baik, Ben Arous, and P\'ech\'e detectability phase transition in all these covariance matrices, and we show that joint and cross covariance matrices always reconstruct the shared signal earlier than the self covariances. Whether the joint or the cross approach is better depends on the mismatch of dimensionalities between the variables. We discuss what these observations mean for choosing the right method for detecting linear correlations in data and how these findings may generalize to nonlinear statistical dependencies.</description>

      <title>Human Mobility in Epidemic Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human mobility forms the backbone of contact patterns through which infectious diseases propagate, fundamentally shaping the spatio-temporal dynamics of epidemics and pandemics. While traditional models are often based on the assumption that all individuals have the same probability of infecting every other individual in the population, a so-called random homogeneous mixing, they struggle to capture the complex and heterogeneous nature of real-world human interactions. Recent advancements in data-driven methodologies and computational capabilities have unlocked the potential of integrating high-resolution human mobility data into epidemic modeling, significantly improving the accuracy, timeliness, and applicability of epidemic risk assessment, contact tracing, and intervention strategies. This review provides a comprehensive synthesis of the current landscape in human mobility-informed epidemic modeling. We explore diverse sources and representations of human mobility data, and then examine the behavioral and structural roles of mobility and contact in shaping disease transmission dynamics. Furthermore, the review spans a wide range of epidemic modeling approaches, ranging from classical compartmental models to network-based, agent-based, and machine learning models. And we also discuss how mobility integration enhances risk management and response strategies during epidemics. By synthesizing these insights, the review can serve as a foundational resource for researchers and practitioners, bridging the gap between epidemiological theory and the dynamic complexities of human interaction while charting clear directions for future research.</description>

      <title>The Stochastic-Quantum Correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.10778v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper argues that every quantum system can be understood as a sufficiently general kind of stochastic process unfolding in an old-fashioned configuration space according to ordinary notions of probability. This argument is based on an exact correspondence between the class of `indivisible' stochastic processes and quantum theory. This new stochastic-quantum correspondence demotes the wave function from a primary ontological ingredient to a secondary mathematical tool, and yields a deflationary account of exotic quantum phenomena, such as interference, decoherence, entanglement, noncommutative observables, and wave-function collapse. At a more practical level, the stochastic-quantum correspondence leads to a novel reconstruction of quantum theory, alongside the Hilbert-space, path-integral, and quasiprobability representations, and also provides a framework for using Hilbert-space methods to formulate highly generic, non-Markovian types of stochastic dynamics, with potential applications throughout the sciences.</description>
