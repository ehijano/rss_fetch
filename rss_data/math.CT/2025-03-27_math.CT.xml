      <description>arXiv:2503.20024v1 Announce Type: new

      <title>Coverages and Grothendieck Toposes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: These notes detail the basics of the theory of Grothendieck toposes from the viewpoint of coverages. Typically one defines a site as a (small) category equipped with a Grothendieck topology. However, it is often desirable to generate a Grothendieck topology from a smaller structure, such as a Grothendieck pretopology, but these require some pullbacks to exist in your underlying category. There is an even more light-weight structure one can generate a Grothendieck topology from called a coverage. Coverages don't require any limits or colimits to exist in the underlying category.
  We prove in detail several results about coverages, such as closing coverages under refinement and composition, to be what we call a saturated coverage, which doesn't change its category of sheaves. We show that Grothendieck topologies are in bijection with saturated coverages. We give an explicit description of the saturated coverage and the Grothendieck topology generated from a coverage.
  We furthermore give a readable account of some of the most important parts of Grothendieck topos theory, with an emphasis placed on coverages. These include constructing sheafification using the plus construction and also in ``one go,'' the equivalence between left exact localizations of presheaf toposes and saturated coverages, morphisms of sites using the fully general notion of covering flatness, points of a Grothendieck topos and Giraud's theorem. We show that Giraud's theorem is equivalent to Rezk's notion of weak descent. Also included is a section devoted to many examples of sites and Grothendieck toposes appearing in the literature, and appendices covering set theory and category theory background, localization and locally presentable categories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the list object functor $L : \mathcal{C} \rightarrow \mathcal{C}$ for a general category $\mathcal{C}$ with finite limits and parametrized list objects. We show that $L$ is polynomial as long as $\mathcal{C}$ is extensive.</description>

      <title>Formalizing colimits in Cat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Certain results involving "higher structures" are not currently accessible to computer formalization because the prerequisite $\infty$-category theory has not been formalized. To support future work on formalizing $\infty$-category theory in Lean's mathematics library, we formalize some fundamental constructions involving the 1-category of categories. Specifically, we construct the left adjoint to the nerve embedding of categories into simplicial sets, defining the homotopy category functor. We prove further that this adjunction is reflective, which allows us to conclude that $\mathcal{C}\textsf{at}$ has colimits. To our knowledge this is the first formalized proof that the category of categories is cocomplete.</description>

      <title>Relative field theories via relative dualizability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05051v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate relative versions of dualizability designed for relative versions of topological field theories (TFTs), also called twisted TFTs, or quiche TFTs in the context of symmetries. In even dimensions we show an equivalence between lax and oplax fully extended framed relative topological field theories valued in an $(\infty , N)$-category in terms of adjunctibility. Motivated by this, we systematically investigate higher adjunctibility conditions and their implications for relative TFTs. Summarizing we arrive at the conclusion that oplax relative TFTs is the notion of choice. Finally, for fun we explore a tree version of adjunctibility and compute the number of equivalence classes thereof.</description>

      <title>Dynkin Systems and the One-Point Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14769v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note I demonstrate that the collection of Dynkin systems on finite sets assembles into a Connes-Consani $\mathbb{F}_1$-module, with the collection of partitions of finite sets as a sub-module. The underlying simplicial set of this $\mathbb{F}_1$-module is shown to be isomorphic to the delooping of the Krasner hyperfield $\mathbb{K}$, where $1+1=\{0,1\}$. The face and degeneracy maps of the underlying simplicial set of the $\mathbb{F}_1$-module of partitions correspond to merging partition blocks and introducing singleton blocks, respectively. I also show that the $\mathbb{F}_1$-module of partitions cannot correspond to a set with a binary operation (even partially defined or multivalued) under the ``Eilenberg-MacLane'' embedding. These results imply that the $n$-fold sum of the Dynkin $\mathbb{F}_1$-module with itself is isomorphic to the $\mathbb{F}_1$-module of the discrete projective geometry on $n$ points.</description>

      <title>Iterated magnitude homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.00577v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnitude homology is an invariant of enriched categories which generalizes ordinary categorical homology -- the homology of the classifying space of a small category. The classifying space can also be generalized in a different direction: it extends from categories to bicategories as the geometric realization of the geometric nerve. This paper introduces a hybrid of the two ideas: an iterated magnitude homology theory for categories with a second- or higher-order enrichment. This encompasses, for example, groups equipped with extra structure such as a partial ordering or a bi-invariant metric. In the case of a strict 2-category, iterated magnitude homology recovers the homology of the classifying space; we investigate its content and behaviour when interpreted for partially ordered groups, normed groups, and strict $n$-categories for $n &gt; 2$.</description>

      <title>The reachability homology of a directed graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01378v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The last decade has seen the development of path homology and magnitude homology -- two homology theories of directed graphs, each satisfying classic properties such as Kunneth and Mayer-Vietoris theorems. Recent work of Asao has shown that magnitude homology and path homology are related, appearing in different pages of a certain spectral sequence. Here we study the target of that spectral sequence, which we call reachability homology. We prove that it satisfies appropriate homotopy invariance, Kunneth, excision, and Mayer-Vietoris theorems, these all being stronger than the corresponding properties for either magnitude or path homology.</description>
