      <title>A Time-Dependent Model of Dark Energy Based on Four-Dimensional Continuous Deformation Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.03020</link>
      <description>arXiv:1805.03020v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate the mechanism of cosmological expansion and inflation by modeling dark energy as a four-dimensional continuous medium, with its elastic deformation described by a four-dimensional vector field. We demonstrate that when the bulk modulus of this cosmological medium is $K = 1.64 \times 10^{109} \text{ N}\cdot\text{m}^{-2}$, the dark energy density, corresponding to the stress-energy associated with the deformation of the medium, decreases by a factor of $\sim 10^{122}$ while the scaling factor expands from $\sim 10^{-60}$ to $\sim 10^{-32}$ over approximately $10^{-42}$ seconds during cosmological inflation in the early universe. Our analysis suggests three potential new physical phenomena for future investigation: detecting longitudinal modes of elastic waves, examining discrepancies in the redshift of light from the early universe, and fitting supernova curves using the parameters introduced in our model.</description>

      <title>Theoretical and Observational Implications of Planck's Constant as a Running Fine Structure Constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.06262v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This letter explores how a reinterpretation of the generalized uncertainty principle as an effective variation of Planck's constant provides a physical explanation for a number of fundamental quantities and couplings. In this context, a running fine structure constant is naturally emergent and the cosmological constant problem is solved, yielding a novel connection between gravitation and quantum field theories. The model could potentially clarify the recent experimental observations by the DESI Collaboration that could imply a fading of dark energy over time. When applied to quantum systems and their characteristic length scales, a simple geometric relationship between energy and entropy is disclosed. Lastly, a mass-radius relation for both quantum and classical systems reveals a phase transition-like behaviour similar to thermodynamical systems, which we speculate to be a consequence of topological defects in the universe.</description>

      <title>Addendum to `On the nonreality of the PBR theorem': disproof by generic counterexample</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15742v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The PBR theorem is widely seen as one of the most important no-go theorems in the foundations of quantum mechanics. Recently, in Found. Phys. 53(3): 64 (2023), it has been argued that there is no reality to the PBR theorem using a pair of bolts as a counterexample. In this addendum we expand on the argument: we disprove the PBR theorem by a generic counterexample, and we put the finger on the precise spot where Pusey, Barrett, and Rudolph have made a tacit assumption that is false.</description>

      <title>Quantum number conservation in meson interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07962v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum number descriptions of spin-zero mesons are obtained from their quark/anti-quark structures, extending the application of the already established seven quantum number conservation in fermion interactions to include mesons. This provides a new tool in the design of experiments and the analysis of results, making it particularly useful for those interactions that involve neutral mesons. One quantum number is parity, conflicting with the evidence for parity non-conservation. The source of this disagreement is identified as the poor definition of parity in the Standard Model. It is also shown that mesons can produce inter-generational interactions, providing a viable alternative to the see-saw mechanism of neutrino interactions.</description>
