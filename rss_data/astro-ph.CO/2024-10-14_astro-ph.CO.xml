      <title>Rapid Methods for Modeling Overdensities of Massive Neutrinos and Other Non-Cold Relics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work has highlighted the potentially detectable gravitational-lensing effect of neutrino halos on cosmic-microwave-background (CMB) fluctuations with upcoming instruments like SO, CMB-S4, and CMB-HD. Accurate modeling of neutrino-halo density profiles are essential for making theory predictions of their cosmological effects. Yet, they are computationally intensive, particularly in the nonlinear regime. In this work, we present an efficient numerical framework for computing neutrino profiles based on N-1-body simulations within a flat FRW Universe. Our approach enables highly parallelized, rapid calculations of neutrino trajectories near spherically symmetric dark-matter halos, delivering results within seconds. In addition to neutrinos, we demonstrate an application to model the clustering of other non-cold relics, such as a freeze-in dark-matter component. The framework is flexible in its definitions of cosmological and dark-matter-halo parameters, which can be particularly valuable for rapid-scanning tasks. It can also seamlessly incorporate new physics, as we demonstrate with examples of a time-varying gravitational constant and nonstandard neutrino phase-space distributions.</description>

      <title>On a model of variable curvature that mimics the observed Universe acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new model based on General Relativity in where a subtle change of curvature at late times is able to produce the observed Universe acceleration and an oscillating behavior in the effective equation of state, similar to what has been claimed by recent results from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument and Baryon Acoustic Oscillation observations. This model is reassembled in the gap between traditional FLRW homogeneous and isotropic models and those Stephani models providing inhomogeneity functions in the time derivatives to explore other forms of varying curvature functions. Remarkably, in addition to an accelerated phase close to the usual $\Lambda$CDM equivalent transition from decelerated to accelerated Universe at $z \sim 0.6$, we also predict a slight decelerated behavior at $z=0$ in agreement with diverse Dark Energy parameterizations. To test our model, we considered the corresponding curvature transition to be sufficiently small (i.e., having $\dot{\kappa}\approx0$ preserved) and defined by a smooth step-like function with a slight change between two curvature values. We implemented a MCMC Likelihood analysis using cosmic chronometers and Type Ia supernovae (local Universe observations) data in order to constraint the free parameters of the model and reconstruct $H(z)$, $q(z)$, $w_{eff}(z)$ and its comparison with the $\Lambda$CDM model. As a result, our model provides an alternative to understand the Universe acceleration without the need of a cosmological constant, obtaining the same fraction of matter density as in the traditional standard model. The behavior of the proposed model points towards a new and intriguing way to test slight violations to the cosmological principle, in particular the case of inhomogenities during low phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Estimating Cosmological Parameters and Reconstructing Hubble Constant with Artificial Neural Networks: A Test with Reconstructed $H(z)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a new approach to constrain the cosmological parameters and estimate Hubble constant. We reconstructed a function from observational Hubble data using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The training data we used are covariance matrix and mock $H(z)$. With the reconstructed $H(z)$, we can get the Hubble constant, and thus do the comparison with the CMB-based measurements. Furthermore, in order to constrain the cosmological parameters, we sampled data points from the reconstructed data and estimated the posterior distribution. The constraining result behaved well comparing to the ones from the mock observational Hubble data. We propose that the $H(z)$ reconstructed by our artificial neural network can represent the actual distribution of real observational data, and therefore can be used in further cosmological research.</description>

      <title>The cosmic distance duality relation in light of the time-delayed strong gravitational lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cosmic distance duality relation (DDR), which links the angular diameter distance and the luminosity distance, is a cornerstone in modern cosmology. Any deviation from DDR may indicate new physics beyond the standard cosmological model. In this paper, we use four high-precision time-delayed strong gravitational lensing (SGL) systems provided by the H0LiCOW to test the validity of DDR. To this end, we directly compare the angular diameter distances from these SGL systems and the luminosity distances from the latest Pantheon+ compilation of SNe Ia. In order to reduce the statistical errors arising from redshift matching, the Gaussian process method is applied to reconstruct the distance-redshift relation from the Pantheon+ dataset. We parameterize the possible violation of DDR in three different models. It is found that all results confirm the validity of DDR at 1$\sigma$ confidence level. Additionally, Monte Carlo simulations based on the future LSST survey indicate that the precision of DDR could reach $10^{-2}$ level with 100 SGL systems.</description>

      <title>Filaments in and between galaxy clusters at low and mid-frequency with the SKA telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the magnetised Universe is a major challenge in modern astrophysics, and cosmic magnetism has been acknowledged as one of the science key drivers of the most ambitious radio instrument ever planned, the SKA telescope. With this work, we aim to investigate the potential of the SKA telescope and its precursors and pathfinders in the study of magnetic fields in galaxy clusters and filaments through diffuse synchrotron radio emission. Galaxy clusters and filaments of the cosmic web are indeed unique laboratories to investigate turbulent fluid motions and large-scale magnetic fields in action and much of what is known about magnetic fields in galaxy clusters comes from sensitive radio observations. Based on cosmological MHD simulations, we predict radio properties (total intensity and polarisation) of a pair of galaxy clusters connected by a cosmic-web filament. We use our theoretical expectations to explore the potential of polarimetric observations to study large-scale structure magnetic fields in the frequency ranges 50-350MHz and 950-1760MHz. We also present predictions for galaxy cluster polarimetric observations with the SKA precursors and pathfinders (LOFAR2.0 and MeerKAT+). Our findings point out that polarisation observations are particularly powerful for the study of large-scale magnetic fields, since they are not significantly affected by confusion noise. The unprecedented sensitivity and spatial resolution of the intermediate frequency radio telescopes make them the favourite instruments for the study of these sources through polarimetric data, potentially allowing us to understand if the energy density of relativistic electrons is in equipartition with the magnetic field or coupled with the thermal gas density. Our results show that low frequency instruments represent as well a precious tool to study diffuse synchrotron emission in total intensity and polarisation.</description>

      <title>Changing Redshifts caused by a Changing Expansion Velocity of the Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the next generation of big telescopes such as the ELT and SKA it might become possible to measure changes in the expansion rate of the Universe in real time by measuring the change of the redshifts of a large number of galaxies over a period of the order of 10 years. This phenomenon, known as 'redshift drift,' will provide a crucial direct test of cosmological models. The change in redshift is readily explained using the concept of conformal time which is the comoving distance of a galaxy in lightyears. We emphasize that the redshift drift is directly proportional to the average change in the cosmic expansion rate between the time of a galaxy's light emission and its absorption. This phenomenon is illustrated within the framework of the concordance model, the Lambda-CDM model of the universe.</description>

      <title>Distribution-free uncertainty quantification for inverse problems: application to weak lensing mass mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In inverse problems, distribution-free uncertainty quantification (UQ) aims to obtain error bars with coverage guarantees that are independent of any prior assumptions about the data distribution. In the context of mass mapping, uncertainties could lead to errors that affects our understanding of the underlying mass distribution, or could propagate to cosmological parameter estimation, thereby impacting the precision and reliability of cosmological models. Current surveys, such as Euclid or Rubin, will provide new weak lensing datasets of very high quality. Accurately quantifying uncertainties in mass maps is therefore critical to perform reliable cosmological parameter inference. In this paper, we extend the conformalized quantile regression (CQR) algorithm, initially proposed for scalar regression, to inverse problems. We compare our approach with another distribution-free approach based on risk-controlling prediction sets (RCPS). Both methods are based on a calibration dataset, and offer finite-sample coverage guarantees that are independent of the data distribution. Furthermore, they are applicable to any mass mapping method, including blackbox predictors. In our experiments, we apply UQ on three mass-mapping method: the Kaiser-Squires inversion, iterative Wiener filtering, and the MCALens algorithm. Our experiments reveal that RCPS tends to produce overconservative confidence bounds with small calibration sets, whereas CQR is designed to avoid this issue. Although the expected miscoverage rate is guaranteed to stay below a user-prescribed threshold regardless of the mass mapping method, selecting an appropriate reconstruction algorithm remains crucial for obtaining accurate estimates, especially around peak-like structures, which are particularly important for inferring cosmological parameters. Additionally, the choice of mass mapping method influences the size of the error bars.</description>

      <title>Mitigation of nonlinear galaxy bias with a theoretical-error likelihood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stage-IV galaxy surveys will measure correlations at small cosmological scales with high signal-to-noise ratio. One of the main challenges of extracting information from small scales is devising accurate models, as well as characterizing the theoretical uncertainties associated with any given model. In this work, we explore the mitigation of theoretical uncertainty due to nonlinear galaxy bias in the context of photometric 2x2-point analyses. We consider linear galaxy bias as the fiducial model and derive the contribution to the covariance matrix induced by neglected higher-order bias. We construct a covariance matrix for the theoretical error in galaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing using simulation-based relations that connect higher-order parameters to linear bias. To test this mitigation model, we apply the modified likelihood to 2x2-point analyses based on two sets of mock data vectors: (1) simulated data vectors, constructed from those same relations between bias parameters, and (2) data vectors based on the AbacusSummit simulation suite. We then compare the performance of the theoretical-error approach to the commonly employed scale cuts methodology. We find most theoretical-error configurations yield results equivalent to the scale cuts in terms of precision and accuracy, in some cases producing significantly stronger bounds on cosmological parameters. These results are independent of the maximum scale k_max in the analysis with theoretical error. The scenarios where linear bias supplemented by theoretical error is unable to recover unbiased cosmology are connected to inadequate modeling of the gg-gk covariance of theoretical error. In view of its removing the ambiguity in the choice of k_max, as well as the possibility of attaining higher precision than the usual scale cuts, we consider this method to be promising for analyses of LSS in upcoming photometric galaxy surveys.</description>

      <title>Mapping the galaxy-halo connection to the galaxy bias: implication to the HOD-informed prior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The galaxy bias parameters are crucial for modeling the large-scale structure in cosmology, yet uncertainties in these parameters often degrade the precision of cosmological constraints. In this work, we investigate how different Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) models impact the priors of the galaxy bias parameters, particularly focusing on quadratic bias parameters. We generate galaxy mock catalogs using various HOD models, including a standard model and one incorporating halo concentration dependence to account for assembly bias, and measure the galaxy bias parameters with high precision using the quadratic field method. We show that the inclusion of assembly bias associated to halo concentration could significantly impact the distributions of quadratic galaxy bias parameters, especially $b_2$. Our findings suggest that accounting for assembly bias or other galaxy-halo connection models is important for obtaining accurate priors on the galaxy bias parameters, thereby improving the robustness of cosmological analyses with galaxy clustering.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the non-Gaussian corrections to the energy density and anisotropies of gravitational waves induced after an ultra-slow-roll phase of inflation by using a diagrammatic approach, and present the corresponding Feynman rules. Our two-loop calculation includes both the intrinsic non-Gaussianity of the inflaton perturbation $\delta\phi$ and the non-Gaussianity arising from the nonlinear relation between the latter and the curvature perturbation $\mathcal{R}$. We apply our formalism to an analytical model in which the ultra-slow-roll phase is followed by a constant-roll stage with a nonvanishing second slow-roll parameter $\eta$, and address the renormalization of the one-loop scalar power spectrum in this scenario.</description>

      <title>Galaxy populations in protoclusters at cosmic noon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the physical properties and redshift evolution of simulated galaxies residing in protoclusters at cosmic noon, to understand the influence of the environment on galaxy formation. This work is to build clear expectations for the ongoing ODIN survey, devoted to mapping large-scale structures at z=2.4, 3.1, and 4.5 using Ly$\alpha$-emitting galaxies (LAEs) as tracers. From the IllustrisTNG simulations, we define subregions centered on the most massive clusters ranked by total stellar mass at z=0 and study the properties of galaxies within, including LAEs. To model the LAE population, we take a semi-analytical approach that assigns Ly$\alpha$ luminosity and equivalent width based on the UV luminosities to galaxies in a probabilistic manner. We investigate stellar mass, star formation rate, major mergers, and specific star formation rate of the population of star-forming galaxies and LAEs in the field and protocluster environment and trace their evolution. We find that the overall shape of the UV luminosity function (LF) in simulated protocluster environments is characterized by a shallower faint-end slope and an excess on the bright end, signaling different formation histories for galaxies therein. The difference is milder for the Ly$\alpha$ LF. While protocluster galaxies follow the same SFR-$M_{\odot}$ scaling relation as average field galaxies, a larger fraction appears to have experienced major mergers in the last 200 Myr and as a result shows enhanced star formation at a ~60% level, leading to a flatter distribution in both SFR and $M_{\odot}$ relative to galaxies in the average field. We find that protocluster galaxies, including LAEs, begin to quench much earlier (z~0.8-1.6) than field galaxies (z~0.5-0.9); our result is in agreement with recent observational results and highlights the importance of large-scale environment on the overall formation history of galaxies.</description>

      <title>Inflationary Butterfly Effect: Non-perturbative Dynamics From Small-Scale Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12811v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the first time, we investigate the non-perturbative dynamics of single field inflation with a departure from slow-roll. Using simulations, we find that oscillatory features in the potential can drastically alter the course of inflation, with major phenomenological implications. In certain cases, the entire Universe gets trapped in a forever inflating de Sitter state. In others, only some regions get stuck in a false vacuum, offering an alternative channel for primordial black hole formation. Analogous to the flap of a butterfly, these results show that small-scale phenomena can have profound consequences on the evolution of the entire Universe. This demonstrates the necessity of a non-perturbative approach in the exploration of the small-scale physics of inflation, particularly in the regime relevant for gravitational-wave astronomy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07069v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cosmological collider signals of primordial non-Gaussianity arise at tree level when an extra scalar has Hubble mass during inflation. We critically review the formalism finding that a large class of inflationary theories, based on Planck-scale physics, predict a scalar bi-spectrum around the gravitational floor level. This mild signal arises for example in $R^2$ gravity, in the regime where its gravitational scalar has Hubble-scale mass. Signals much above the gravitational floor arise in theories where scalars undergo multiple turns during inflation, thanks to sub-Planckian physics.</description>

      <title>Accretion mediated spin-eccentricity correlations in LISA massive black hole binaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04411v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine expected effective spin ($\chi_{{\rm eff},1\rm yr}$) and orbital eccentricity ($e_{1\rm yr}$) correlations for a population of observable equal-mass massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) with total redshifted mass $M_z\sim[10^{4.5},10^{7.5}]~{\rm M}_\odot$ embedded in a circumbinary disc (CBD), one-year before merging in the LISA band. We find a strong correlation between measurable eccentricity and negative effective spin for MBHBs that are carried to merger by retrograde accretion. This is due to the well-established eccentricity pumping of retrograde accretion and the formation of retrograde CBD-aligned mini-discs, as observed in hydrodynamical simulations. Conversely, prograde accretion channels result in positive $\chi_{{\rm eff},1\rm yr}$ and non-measurable $e_{1\rm yr}$. This clear contrast between the two CBD orientations - and particularly the unique signature of retrograde configurations - provides a promising way to unlock the mysteries of MBHB formation channels in the LISA era.</description>

      <title>Observable gravitational waves and $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ with global lepton number symmetry and dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04404v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the possibility of testing a dark matter (DM) scenario embedded in a global lepton number symmetry $U(1)_L$ via gravitational waves (GW) and cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations. The spontaneous breaking of $U(1)_L$ symmetry generates the seesaw scale as well as DM mass dynamically. The (pseudo) Nambu-Goldstone boson, known as majoron, acquires non-zero mass due to soft symmetry breaking terms of quadratic type in the scalar potential, which eventually breaks $U(1)_L$ to its $Z_2$ subgroup. The spontaneous symmetry breaking, which effectively breaks $Z_2$, leads to the formation of domain walls (DW), posing a threat to successful cosmology, if allowed to dominate. As gravity does not respect any global symmetries, we consider higher dimensional operators suppressed by the scale of quantum gravity (QG) namely, $\Lambda_{\rm QG}$ which introduces the required bias leading to DW annihilation and emission of stochastic gravitational waves (GW) observable at near future experiments. The same operators also lead to decay of DM bringing interesting indirect detection aspects. While DM is produced non-thermally via scalar portal interactions, light majoron can give rise to additional $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ within reach of future CMB experiments.</description>

      <title>Ultra-high Frequency Gravitational Waves from Scattering, Bremsstrahlung and Decay during Reheating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03256v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate ultra-high frequency gravitational waves (GWs) from gravitons generated during inflationary reheating. Specifically, we study inflaton scattering with its decay product, where the couplings involved in this $2 \to 2$ scattering are the same as those in the $1 \to 3$ graviton Bremsstrahlung process. We compute the graviton production rate via such $2 \to 2$ scattering. Additionally, we compare the resulting GW spectrum with that from Bremsstrahlung as well as that from pure $2 \to 2$ inflaton scatterings. For completeness, the GW spectrum from graviton pair production through one-loop induced $1 \to 2$ inflaton decay is also analyzed. With a systematic comparison among the four sources of GWs, we find that $2 \to 2$ inflaton scattering with its decay product can dominate over Bremsstrahlung if the reheating temperature is larger than the inflaton mass. Pure inflaton $2 \to 2$ scattering is typically subdominant compared to Bremsstrahlung except in the high-frequency tail. The contribution from one-loop induced $1 \to 2$ inflaton decay is shown to be suppressed compared to Bremsstrahlung and pure inflaton $2 \to 2$ scattering.</description>

      <title>Induced Domain Walls of QCD Axion, and Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09478v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that heavy axion domain walls induce domain walls of the QCD axion through a mixing between the heavy axion and the QCD axion, even when the pre-inflationary initial condition is assumed for the QCD axion. The induced domain walls arise because the effective $\theta$ parameter changes across the heavy axion domain walls, shifting the potential minimum of the QCD axion. When the heavy axion domain walls collapse, the induced QCD axion domain walls collapse as well. This novel mechanism for producing the QCD axions can explain dark matter even with the axion decay constant as small as ${\cal O}(10^{9})$ GeV. In particular, this scenario requires domain wall collapse near the QCD crossover, potentially accounting for the stochastic gravitational wave background suggested by recent pulsar timing array observations, including NANOGrav. Using this mechanism, it is also possible to easily create induced domain walls for string axions or axions with a large decay constant, which would otherwise be challenging. We also comment on the implications for cosmic birefringence using induced axion domain walls.</description>

      <title>In-Situ Spheroid Formation in Distant Submillimeter-Bright Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16578v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The majority of stars in today's Universe reside within spheroids, which are bulges of spiral galaxies and elliptical galaxies. Their formation is still an unsolved problem. Infrared/submm-bright galaxies at high redshifts have long been suspected to be related to spheroids formation. Proving this connection has been hampered so far by heavy dust obscuration when focusing on their stellar emission or by methodologies and limited signal-to-noise ratios when looking at submm wavelengths. Here we show that spheroids are directly generated by star formation within the cores of highly luminous starburst galaxies in the distant Universe. This follows from the ALMA submillimeter surface brightness profiles which deviate significantly from those of exponential disks, and from the skewed-high axis-ratio distribution. The majority of these galaxies are fully triaxial rather than flat disks: the ratio of the shortest to the longest of their three axes is half, on average, and increases with spatial compactness. These observations, supported by simulations, reveal a cosmologically relevant pathway for in-situ spheroid formation through starbursts likely preferentially triggered by interactions (and mergers) acting on galaxies fed by non-co-planar gas accretion streams.</description>

      <title>Constraining viscous-fluid models in $f(Q)$ gravity using cosmic measurements and large-scale structure data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02775v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of the effects of bulk viscosity on the accelerating expansion and large-scale structure formation of a universe in which the underlying gravitational interaction is described by $f(Q)$ gravity. Various toy models of the $f(Q)$ gravity theory, including power-law ($f_{1\rm{CDM}}$), exponential ($f_{2\rm{CDM}}$), and logarithmic ($f_{3\rm{CDM}}$) are considered. To test the cosmological viability of these models, we use 57 Hubble parameter data points (OHD), 1048 supernovae distance modulus (SNIa), their combined analysis (OHD+SNIa), 14 growth rate ($f$-data), and 30 redshift-space distortions ($f\sigma_8$) datasets. We compute the best-fit values $\Omega_m, H_0$ and exponents $\{n, p, \gamma\}$ including the bulk viscosity coefficient $\zeta_0$, through a detailed statistical analysis. Moreover, we study linear cosmological perturbations and compute the density contrast \(\delta(z)\), growth factor $D(z)$, growth rate $(f(z)$, and redshift-space distortion $f\sigma_8(z)$. Based on the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian / Schwartz Information Criterion (BIC), a statistical comparison of the $f(Q)$ gravity models with \lcdm is made. From our statistical analysis of cosmic measurements, we found an underestimation of all models on the OHD data; therefore, statistical viability led us to weigh it in favour of SNIa data which resulted in the exponential ($f_{2\rm{CDM}}$) model without bulk viscosity being the most plausible alternative model, while on average the $f_{1\rm{CDM}}$ model performed statistically the weakest. We also found that adding bulk viscosity did not improve the fit of the models to all observational data.</description>
