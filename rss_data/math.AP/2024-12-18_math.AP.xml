      <title>Asymptotic behaviour of solutions and free boundaries of the anisotropic slow diffusion equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we explore the theory of the anisotropic porous medium equation in the slow diffusion range. After revising the basic theory, we prove the existence of self-similar fundamental solutions (SSFS) of the equation posed in the whole Euclidean space. Each of such solutions is uniquely determined by its mass. This solution has compact support w.r.t. the space variables. We also obtain the sharp asymptotic behaviour of all finite mass solutions in terms of the family of self-similar fundamental solutions. Special attention is paid to the convergence of supports and free boundaries in relative size, i.e., measured in the appropriate anisotropic way. The fast diffusion case has been studied in a previous paper by us, there no free boundaries appear.</description>

      <title>On uniqueness of inverse conductive scattering problem with unknown embedded obstacles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerning the inverse conductive scattering of acoustic waves by a bounded inhomogeneous object with possibly embedded obstacles inside. A new uniqueness theorem is proved that the conductive object is uniquely determined by the fixed frequency far-field measurements, ignoring its contents. Meanwhile, the boundary informations of several related physical coefficients are also uniquely determined. The proof is mainly based on a detailed singularity analysis of solutions near the interface associated with a family of point sources or hypersingular point sources, which is deduced by the potential theory. Moreover, the other key ingredient in the proof is the well-posedness of the interior transmission problem with the conductivity boundary condition in the L^2 sense, where several sufficient conditions depending on the domain and physical coefficients are provided.</description>

      <title>Local well-posedness of the Benjamin-Ono equation with spatially quasiperiodic data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Benjamin-Ono equation in the spatially quasiperiodic setting. We establish local well-posedness of the initial value problem with initial data in quasiperiodic Sobolev spaces. This requires developing some of the fundamental properties of Sobolev spaces and the energy method for quasiperiodic functions. We discuss prospects for global existence. We demonstrate that while conservation laws still hold, these quantities no longer control the associated Sobolev norms, thereby preventing the establishment of global results by usual arguments.</description>

      <title>Quantized blow-up dynamics for Calogero--Moser derivative nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Calogero--Moser derivative nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (CM-DNLS), an $L^2$-critical nonlinear Schr\"odinger type equation enjoying a number of numerous structures, such as nonlocal nonlinearity, self-duality, pseudo-conformal symmetry, and complete integrability.
  In this paper, we construct smooth finite-time blow-up solutions to (CM-DNLS) that exhibit a sequence of discrete blow-up rates, so-called \emph{quantized blow-up rates}. Our strategy is a forward construction of the blow-up dynamics based on modulation analysis. Our main novelty is to utilize the \emph{nonlinear adapted derivative} suited to the \textit{Lax pair structure} and to rely on the \emph{hierarchy of conservation laws} inherent in this structure to control higher-order energies. This approach replaces a repulsivity-based energy method in the bootstrap argument, which significantly simplifies the analysis compared to earlier works. Our result highlights that the integrable structure remains a powerful tool, even in the presence of blow-up solutions.
  In (CM-DNLS), one of the distinctive features is \emph{chirality}. However, our constructed solutions are not chiral, since we assume the radial (even) symmetry in the gauge transformed equation. This radial assumption simplifies the modulation analysis.</description>

      <title>On the B\"acklund transform and the stability of the line soliton of the KP-II equation on $\mathbb R^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Miura map of the KP-II equation on $\mathbb R^2$ and the resulting B\"acklund transform, which adds a line soliton to a given solution. This work aims to develop a complementary approach to T. Mizumachi's method for the $L^2$-stability of the line soliton, which the potential for generalization to multisolitons. We construct the B\"acklund transform by classifying solutions of the Miura map equation close to a modulated kink; this translates into studying eternal solutions of the forced viscous Burgers' equation under distinct boundary conditions at $\pm\infty$. We then show that its range, when intersected with a small ball in $|D_x|^{1/2} L^2(\mathbb R^2)\cap L^2(\mathbb R^2)\cap \langle{y}\rangle^{0-}\!L^1(\mathbb R^2)$, forms a codimension-1 manifold. We prove codimension-1 $L^2$-stability of the line soliton in the aforementioned weighted space as a corollary, providing the first stability result at sharp regularity. The codimension-1 condition in the range of the B\"acklund transform is an intrinsic property, and we conjecture that it corresponds to a known long time behavior of perturbed line solitons. The stability is expected to hold without this condition, as in Mizumachi's works. Finally, we show the construction of a multisoliton addition map for $(k,1)$-multisolitons, $k\geq 1$.</description>

      <title>The Keller-Segel model with mass critical exponent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a Keller-Segel model with non-linear porous medium type diffusion and non-local attractive power law interaction, focusing on potentials that are less singular than Newtonian interaction. Here, the nonlinear diffusion is chosen to be $m=2-\frac{2s}{d}$, in which case the steady states are compactly supported. We analyse under what conditions on the initial data the regime that attractive forces are stronger than diffusion occurs and classify the conditions for global existence and finite time blow-up of solutions. It is shown that there exists a threshold value which is characterized by the optimal constant of a variant of the Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev inequality. Specifically, the solution will exist globally if the initial data is below the threshold, while the solution blows up in finite time when the initial data is above the threshold.</description>

      <title>Differential Games for a Mixed ODE-PDE System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by a vaccination coverage problem, we consider here a zero-sum differential game governed by a differential system consisting of a hyperbolic partial differential equation (PDE) and an ordinary differential equation (ODE). Two players act through their respective controls to influence the evolution of the system with the aim of minimizing their objective functionals $\mathcal F_1$ and $\mathcal F_2$, under the assumption that $\mathcal F_1 +\mathcal F_2 = 0$. First we prove a well posedness and a stability result for the differential system, once the control functions are fixed. Then we introduce the concept of non-anticipating strategies for both players and we consider the associated value functions, which solve two infinite-dimensional Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs equations in the viscosity sense.</description>

      <title>On the local character of the extension of traces for Sobolev mappings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that a mapping $u \colon \mathcal{M}'\to \mathcal{N}$, where $\mathcal{M}'$ and $ \mathcal{N}$ are compact Riemannian manifolds, is the trace of a Sobolev mapping $U \colon \mathcal{M}' \times [0, 1) \to \mathcal{N}$ if and only if it is on some open covering of $\mathcal{M}'$. In the global case where $\mathcal{M}$ is a compact Riemannian manifold with boundary, this implies that the analytical obstructions to the extension of a mapping $u \colon \partial \mathcal{M}\to \mathcal{N}$ to some Sobolev mapping $U \colon \mathcal{M} \to \mathcal{N}$ are purely local.</description>

      <title>Dirac operators and local invariants on perturbations of Minkowski space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For small perturbations of Minkowski space, we show that the square of the Lorentzian Dirac operator $P= -D^2$ has real spectrum apart from possible poles in a horizontal strip. Furthermore, for $\varepsilon&gt;0$ we relate the poles of the spectral zeta function density of $P-i\varepsilon$ to local invariants, in particular to the Lorentzian scalar curvature. The proof involves microlocal propagation and radial estimates in a resolved scattering calculus as well as high energy estimates in a further resolved classical-semiclassical calculus.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the study of mean field games master equations involving an additional variable modelling common noise. We address cases in which the dynamics of this variable can depend on the state of the game, which requires in general additional monotonicity assumptions on the coefficients. We explore the link between such a common noise and more traditional ones, as well as the links between different monotone regimes for the master equation.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic waves generated by a hybrid dielectric-plasmonic dimer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We know that the electric field generated by a plasmonic nano-particle (with negative permittivity) is given as a polarization of the incident electric field. Similarly, the electric field produced by a dielectric nano-particle (with positive but high permittivity) is given as a polarization of the incident magnetic field. In this work, we demonstrate that a hybrid dimer composed of two closely coupled nano-particles, one plasmonic and the other dielectric can polarize both the incident electric and magnetic fields. Consequently, such hybrid dimers have the potential to modify both the electric permittivity and magnetic permeability of the surrounding medium. However, this dual modification occurs only when the two nano-particles share common resonant frequencies. We derive the asymptotic expansion of the fields generated by these hybrid dimers in the subwavelength regime for incident frequencies near their shared resonant frequencies.</description>

      <title>The sharp $\sigma_2$-curvature inequality on the sphere in quantitative form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among all metrics on $\mathbb S^d$ with $d&gt;4$ that are conformal to the standard metric and have positive scalar curvature, the total $\sigma_2$-curvature, normalized by the volume, is uniquely (up to M\"obius transformations) minimized by the standard metric. We show that if a metric almost minimizes, then it is almost the standard metric (up to M\"obius transformations). This closeness is measured in terms of Sobolev norms of the conformal factor, and we obtain the optimal stability exponents for two different notions of closeness. This is a stability result for an optimization problem whose Euler-Lagrange equation is fully nonlinear.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we review the construction of periodic fundamental solutions and periodic layer potentials for various differential operators. Specifically, we focus on the Laplace equation, the Helmholtz equation, the Lam\'e system, and the heat equation. We then describe how these layer potentials can be applied to analyze domain perturbation problems. In particular, we present applications to the asymptotic behavior of quasi-periodic solutions for a Dirichlet problem for the Helmholtz equation in an unbounded domain with small periodic perforations. Additionally, we investigate the dependence of spatially periodic solutions of an initial value Dirichlet problem for the heat equation on regular perturbations of the base of a parabolic cylinder.</description>

      <title>Optimal convergence speed in the classical limits of relativistic Cucker-Smale models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study quantitative estimates for the flocking and uniform-time classical limit to the relativistic Cucker-Smale (in short RCS) model introduced in \cite{Ha-Kim-Ruggeri-ARMA-2020}. Different from previous works, we do not neglect the relativistic effect on the presence of the pressure in momentum equation. For the RCS model, we provide a quantitative estimate on the uniform-time classical limit with an optimal convergence rate which is the same as in finite-time classical limit under a relaxed initial condition. We also allow corresponding initial data for the RCS and Cucker-Smale (CS) model to be different in the classical limit. This removes earlier constraints employed in the previous classical limit. As a direct application of this optimal convergence rate in the classical limit of the RCS model, we derive an optimal convergence rate for the corresponding uniform-time classical limit for the kinetic RCS model.</description>

      <title>Subdifferentials and penalty approximations of the obstacle problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a framework for approximating the obstacle problem through a penalty approach by nonlinear PDEs. By using tools from capacity theory, we show that derivatives of the solution maps of the penalised problems converge in the weak operator topology to an element of the strong-weak Bouligand subdifferential. We are able to treat smooth penalty terms as well as nonsmooth ones involving for example the positive part function $\max(0,\cdot)$. Our abstract framework applies to several specific choices of penalty functions which are omnipresent in the literature. We conclude with consequences to the theory of optimal control of the obstacle problem.</description>

      <title>Parameter-free higher-order Schrodinger systems with weak dissipation and forcing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The higher-order nonlinear Schrodinger equation (Dysthe's equation in the context of water-waves) models the time evolution of the slowly modulated amplitude of a wave-packet in dispersive partial differential equations (PDE). These systems, of which water-waves are a canonical example, require the presence of a small-valued ordering parameter so that a multi-scale expansion can be performed. However, often the resulting system itself contains the small-ordering parameter. Thus, these models are difficult to interpret from a formal asymptotics perspective. This paper derives a parameter-free, higher-order evolution equation for a generic infinite-dimensional dispersive PDE with weak linear damping and/or forcing. Instead of focusing on the water-wave problem or another specific problem, our procedure avoids the complicated algebra by placing the PDE in an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space and Taylor expanding with Frechet derivatives. An attractive feature of this procedure is that it can be used in many different physical settings, including water-waves, nonlinear optics and any dispersive system with weak dissipation or forcing. The paper concludes by discussing two specific examples.</description>

      <title>On the integrability properties of Leray-Hopf solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations on $\mathbb{R}^3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $r,s \in [2,\infty]$ and consider the Navier-Stokes equations on $\mathbb{R}^3$. We study the following two questions for suitable $s$-homogeneous Banach spaces $X \subset \mathcal{S}'$: does every $u_0 \in L^2_\sigma$ have a weak solution that belongs to $L^r(0,\infty;X)$, and are the $L^r(0,\infty;X)$ norms of the solutions bounded uniformly in viscosity? We show that if $\frac{2}{r} + \frac{3}{s} &lt; \frac{3}{2}-\frac{1}{2r}$, then for a Baire generic datum $u_0 \in L^2_\sigma$, no weak solution $u^\nu$ belongs to $L^r(0,\infty;X)$. If $\frac{3}{2}-\frac{1}{2r} \leq \frac{2}{r} + \frac{3}{s} &lt; \frac{3}{2}$ instead, global solvability in $L^r(0,\infty;X)$ is equivalent to the a priori estimate $\|u^\nu\|_{L^r(0,\infty;X)} \leq C \nu^{3-5/r-6/s} \|u_0\|_{L^2}^{4/r+6/s-2}$. Furthermore, we can only have $\limsup_{\nu \to 0} \|u^\nu\|_{L^r(0,\infty;Z)} &lt; \infty$ for all $u_0 \in L^2_\sigma$ if $\frac{2}{r} + \frac{3}{s}= \frac{3}{2}-\frac{1}{2r}$.
  The above results and their variants rule out, for a Baire generic $L^2_\sigma$ datum, $L^4(0,T;L^4)$ integrability and various other known sufficient conditions for the energy equality. As another application, for suitable 2-homogeneous Banach spaces $Z \hookrightarrow L^2_\sigma$, each $u_0 \in Z$ has a Leray-Hopf solution $u \in L^3(0,\infty;\dot{B}_{3,\infty}^{1/3})$ if and only if a uniform-in-viscosity bound $\|u\|_{L^3(0,\infty;\dot{B}_{3,\infty}^{1/3})} \leq C \|u_0\|_Z^{2/3}$ holds.
  As a by-product we show that if global regularity holds for the Navier-Stokes equations, then for a Baire generic $L^2_\sigma$ datum, the Leray-Hopf solution is unique and satisfies the energy equality. We also show that if global regularity holds in the Euler equations, then anomalous energy dissipation must fail for a Baire generic $L^2_\sigma$ datum. These two results also hold on the torus $\mathbb{T}^3$.</description>

      <title>Regularity lost: the fundamental limitations and constraint qualifications in the problems of elastoplasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the existence and non-existence of a function-valued strain solution in various models of elastoplasticity from the perspective of the constraint-based ``dual'' formulations. We describe abstract frameworks for linear elasticity, elasticity-perfect plasticity and elasticity-hardening plasticity in terms of adjoint linear operators and convert them to equivalent formulations in terms of differential inclusions (the sweeping process in particular). Within such frameworks we consider several manually solvable examples of discrete and continuous models. Despite their simplicity, the examples show how for discrete models with perfect plasticity it is possible to find the evolution of stress and strain (elongation), yet continuum models within the same framework may not possess a function-valued strain. Although some examples with such phenomenon are already known, we demonstrate that it may appear due to displacement loading. The central idea of the paper is to explain the loss of strain regularity in the dual formulation by the lack of additivity of the normal cones and the failure of Slater's constraint qualification.
  In contrast to perfect plasticity, models with hardening are known to be well-solvable for strains. We show that more advanced constraint qualifications can help to distinguish between those cases and, in the case of hardening, ensure the additivity of the normal cones, which means the existence of a function-valued strain rate.</description>

Abstract: We study the class of functions on Lipschitz-graph domains satisfying a differential-oscillation condition and show that such functions are $\epsilon$-approximable. As a consequence we obtain the quantitative Fatou theorem in the spirit of works e.g. by Garnett and Bortz-Hofmann. Such a class contains harmonic functions, as well as non-harmonic ones, for example nonnegative subharmonic functions, as illustrated by our discussion.</description>

      <title>Entanglement principle for the fractional Laplacian with applications to inverse problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove an entanglement principle for fractional Laplace operators on $\mathbb R^n$ for $n\geq 2$ as follows; if different fractional powers of the Laplace operator acting on several distinct functions on $\mathbb R^n$, which vanish on some nonempty open set $O$, are known to be linearly dependent on $O$, then all the functions must be globally zero. This remarkable principle was recently discovered to be true for smooth functions on compact Riemannian manifolds without boundary \cite{FKU24}. Our main result extends the principle to the noncompact Euclidean space stated for tempered distributions under suitable decay conditions at infinity. We also present applications of this principle to solve new inverse problems for recovering anisotropic principal terms as well as zeroth order coefficients in fractional polyharmonic equations. Our proof of the entanglement principle uses the heat semigroup formulation of fractional Laplacian to establish connections between the principle and the study of several topics including interpolation properties for holomorphic functions under certain growth conditions at infinity, meromorphic extensions of holomorphic functions from a subdomain, as well as support theorems for spherical mean transforms on $\mathbb R^n$ that are defined as averages of functions over spheres.</description>

Abstract: We consider the stochastic incompressible magnetohydrodynamic equations driven by additive jump noises on either the whole space $\mathbb{R}^d$, $d=2,3$ or a smooth bounded domain $D$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$. We establish the local existence and uniqueness of a mild solution in the space $L^q(0,T;\mathbb{L}^{p\otimes}_{\sigma}(D))$ allowing for initial data with less regularity, including the marginal case $u_0\in \mathbb{L}^{d\otimes}_{\sigma}(D)$. In the two-dimensional case, we also prove the global existence of mild solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we prove general criticality criteria for operators $\Delta + V$ on manifolds $M$ with two ends, where $V$ bounds the Ricci curvature of $M$, and a related spectral splitting theorem. We apply them to get new rigidity results for stable and $\delta$-stable minimal hypersurfaces in manifolds with non-negative bi-Ricci or sectional curvature, in ambient dimension up to $5$ and $6$, respectively. In the special case where the ambient space is $\mathbb{R}^4$, we prove that a $1/3$-stable minimal hypersurface must either have one end or be a catenoid, and consequently that a proper, $\delta$-stable minimal hypersurface with $\delta &gt; 1/3$ must be a hyperplane.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The concept of concrete regularity structure gives the algebraic backbone of the operations involved in the local expansions used in the regularity structure approach to singular stochastic partial differential equations. The spaces and the details of the structures depend on each equation. We introduce here a parameter-dependent universal algebraic regularity structure that can host all the regularity structures used in the study of singular stochastic partial differential equations. This is done by using the correspondence between the notions of model on a regularity structure and the notion of paracontrolled system. We prove that the iterated paraproducts that form the fundamental bricks of paracontrolled systems have some local expansion properties that are governed by this universal structure.</description>

      <title>The Hartogs-Bochner extension for monogenic functions of several vector variables and the Dirac complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Holomorphic functions in several complex variables are generalized to regular functions in several quaternionic variables, and further to monogenic functions of several vector variables, which are annihilated by several Dirac operators on $k$ copies of the Euclidean space $\mathbb R^n$. As the Dolbeault complex in complex analysis, the Dirac complex resolving several Dirac operators plays the fundamental role to investigate monogenic functions. Although the spaces in the Dirac complex are complicated irreducible modules of ${\rm GL}(k),$ we give a simple characterization of the first four spaces, which allows us to write down first three operators in the Dirac complex explicitly and to show this part to be an elliptic complex. Then the PDE method can be applied to obtain solutions to the non-homogeneous several Dirac equations under the compatibility condition, which implies the Hartogs' phenomenon for monogenic functions. Moreover, we find the boundary version of several Dirac operators and introduce the notion of a tangentially monogenic function, corresponding to tangential Cauchy-Riemann operator and CR functions in several complex variables, and establish the Hartogs-Bochner extension for tangentially monogenic functions on the boundary of a domain.</description>

  \]
  for some $\gamma&lt;\frac{4}{n-1}$, then $M$ splits isometrically as $\mathbb R\times N$ for some compact manifold $N$ with nonnegative Ricci curvature. We show that the constant $\frac{4}{n-1}$ is sharp, and the multiple-end assumption is necessary for any $\gamma&gt;0$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For any integer $ p \geq 2 $, we construct a compact Riemannian manifold $ \mathcal{N} $, such that if $ \dim \mathcal{M} &gt; p $, there is a map in the Sobolev space of mappings $ W^{1,p} (\mathcal{M}, \mathcal{N})$ which is not a weak limit of smooth maps into $ \mathcal{N} $ due to a mechanism of analytical obstruction. For $ p = 4n - 1 $, the target manifold can be taken to be the sphere $ \mathbb{S}^{2n} $ thanks to the construction by Whitehead product of maps with nontrivial Hopf invariant, generalizing the result by Bethuel for $ p = 4n -1 = 3$. The results extend to higher order Sobolev spaces $ W^{s,p} $, with $ s \in \mathbb{R} $, $s \geq 1 $, $ sp \in \mathbb{N}$, and $ sp \ge 2 $.</description>

      <title>Long-time asymptotics for a complex cubic Camassa-Holm equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.16814v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the Cauchy problem of the following complex cubic Camassa-Holm (ccCH) equation $$m_{t}=b u_{x}+\frac{1}{2}\left[m\left(|u|^{2}-\left|u_{x}\right|^{2}\right)\right]_{x}-\frac{1}{2} m\left(u \bar{u}_{x}-u_{x} \bar{u}\right), \quad m=u-u_{x x},$$ where $b&gt;0$ is an arbitrary positive real constant. Long-time asymptotics of the equation is obtained through the $\bar{\partial}$-steepest descent method. Firstly, based on the spectral analysis of the Lax pair and scattering matrix, the solution of the equation is able to be constructed via solving the corresponding Riemann-Hilbert (RH) problem. Then, we present different long time asymptotic expansions of the solution $u(y,t)$ in different space-time solitonic regions of $\xi=y/t$. The half-plane ${(y,t):-\infty &lt;y&lt; \infty, t &gt; 0}$ is divided into four asymptotic regions: $\xi \in(-\infty,-1)$, $\xi \in (-1,0)$, $\xi \in (0,\frac{1}{8})$ and $\xi \in (\frac{1}{8},+\infty)$. When $\xi$ falls in $(-\infty,-1)\cup (\frac{1}{8},+\infty)$, no stationary phase point of the phase function $\theta(z)$ exists on the jump profile in the space-time region. In this case, corresponding asymptotic approximations can be characterized with an $N(\Lambda)$-solitons with diverse residual error order $O(t^{-1+2\varepsilon})$. There are four stationary phase points and eight stationary phase points on the jump curve as $\xi \in (-1,0)$ and $\xi \in (0,\frac{1}{8})$, respectively. The corresponding asymptotic form is accompanied by a residual error order $O(t^{-\frac{3}{4}})$.</description>

      <title>Injective ellipticity, cancelling operators, and endpoint Gagliardo-Nirenberg-Sobolev inequalities for vector fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.01201v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although Ornstein's nonestimate entails the impossibility to control in general all the $L^1$-norm of derivatives of a function by the $L^1$-norm of a constant coefficient homogeneous vector differential operator, the corresponding endpoint Sobolev inequality has been known to hold in many cases: the gradient of scalar functions (Gagliardo and Nirenberg), the deformation operator (Korn-Sobolev inequality by M.J. Strauss), and the Hodge complex (Bourgain and Brezis). The class of differential operators for which estimates holds can be characterized by a cancelling condition. The proof of the estimates rely on a duality estimate for $L^1$-vector fields lying in the kernel of a cocancelling differential operator, combined with classical linear algebra and harmonic analysis techniques. This characterization unifies classes of known Sobolev inequalities and extends to fractional Sobolev and Hardy inequalities. A similar weaker condition introduced by Rai\c{t}\u{a} characterizes the operators for which there is an $L^\infty$-estimate on lower-order derivatives.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we succeed in integrating Strichartz estimates (encoding the dispersive effects of the equations) in Birkhoff normal form techniques. As a consequence, we deduce a result on the long time behavior of quintic NLS solutions on the circle for small but very irregular initial data (in $H^s$ for $s &gt; 2/5$). Note that since $2/5 &lt; 1$, we cannot claim conservation of energy and, more importantly, since $2/5 &lt; 1/2$, we must dispense with the algebra property of $H^s$. This is the first dynamical result where we use the dispersive properties of NLS in a context of Birkhoff normal form.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.19934v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the absence of a Lavrentiev gap for vectorial integral functionals of the form
  $$
  F: g+W_0^{1,1}(\Omega)^m\to\mathbb{R}\cup\{+\infty\},\qquad F(u)=\int_\Omega W(x,\mathrm{D} u)\,\mathrm{d}x,
  $$
  where the boundary datum $g:\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^d\to\mathbb{R}^m$ is sufficiently regular, $\xi\mapsto W(x,\xi)$ is convex and lower semicontinuous, satisfies $p$-growth from below and suitable growth conditions from above. More precisely, if $p\leq d-1$, we assume $q$-growth from above with $q\leq \frac{(d-1)p}{d-1-p}$, while for $p&gt;d-1$ we require essentially no growth conditions from above and allow for unbounded integrands. Concerning the $x$-dependence, we impose a well-known local stability estimate that is redundant in the autonomous setting, but in the general non-autonomous case can further restrict the growth assumptions.</description>

      <title>Existence, uniqueness, and universality of global dynamics for the fractional hyperbolic $\Phi^4_3$-model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00543v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the fractional $\Phi^4_3$-measure (with order $\alpha &gt; 1$) and the dynamical problem of its canonical stochastic quantization: the three-dimensional stochastic damped fractional nonlinear wave equation with a cubic nonlinearity, also called the fractional hyperbolic $\Phi^4_3$-model. We first construct the fractional $\Phi^4_3$-measure via the variational approach by Barashkov-Gubinelli (2020). When $\alpha \leq \frac{9}{8}$, this fractional $\Phi^4_3$-measure turns out to be singular with respect to the base Gaussian measure. We then prove almost sure global well-posedness of the fractional hyperbolic $\Phi^4_3$-model and invariance of the fractional $\Phi^4_3$-measure for all $\alpha &gt; 1$ by further developing the globalization framework due to Oh-Okamoto-Tolomeo (2024) on the hyperbolic $\Phi^3_3$-model. Furthermore, when $\alpha &gt; \frac{9}{8}$ , we prove weak universality of the fractional hyperbolic $\Phi^4_3$-model by utilizing the convergence of Gibbs measures.</description>

      <title>An application-oriented framework for continuum modeling of opinion dynamics on a network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18076v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we propose a modeling framework to develop a continuum description of opinion dynamics on networks. Our primary objective is to present a continuum approach that is practical for applications, particularly for numerical simulations. While existing methods, such as graphons, offer continuum descriptions in the large-node limit, their abstract mathematical nature limits their applicability to real-world scenarios, such as modeling opinion dynamics. To illustrate our framework, we focus on a simple model of consensus dynamics on a network and derive a continuum description using techniques inspired by mean-field limits. We also discuss the limitations of this approach and suggest extensions to account for dynamic networks with evolving connections, stochastic effects, and directional interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02568v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove existence of smooth solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations with divergence free Schwartz initial data. We demonstrate the latter by considering an iterative procedure involving solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations approximated via the retarded mollification. In particular, we use $L^\infty#to L^\infty$ and a new $L^\infty \to L^1\cap L^infty$ estimate of the Leray projektor.</description>

      <title>Minimization of the first eigenvalue for the Lam\'e system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06437v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we address the problem of determining a domain in $\mathbb{R}^N$ that minimizes the first eigenvalue of the Lam\'e system under a volume constraint. We begin by establishing the existence of such an optimal domain within the class of quasi-open sets, showing that in the physically relevant dimensions $N = 2$ and $3$, the optimal domain is indeed an open set. Additionally, we derive both first and second-order optimality conditions. Leveraging these conditions, we demonstrate that in two dimensions, the disk cannot be the optimal shape when the Poisson ratio is below a specific threshold, whereas above this value, it serves as a local minimizer. We also extend our analysis to show that the disk is nonoptimal for Poisson ratios $\nu$ satisfying $\nu \leq 0.4$.</description>

Abstract: In this work we obtain weighted boundedness results for singular integral operators with kernels exhibiting exponential decay. We also show that the classes of weights are characterized by a suitable maximal operator. Additionally, we study the boundedness of various operators associated with the generalized Schr\"odinger operator $-\Delta + \mu$, where $\mu$ is a nonnegative Radon measure in $\mathbb{R}^d$, for $d\geq 3$.</description>

      <title>Volume-surface systems with sub-quadratic intermediate sum on the surface: Global existence and boundedness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11322v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The global existence and boundedness of solutions to volume-surface reaction diffusion systems with a mass control condition are investigated. Such systems arise typically in e.g. cell biology, ecology or fluid mechanics, when some concentrations or densities are inside a domain and some others are on its boundary. Comparing to previous works, the difficulty of systems under consideration here is that the nonlinearities on the surface can have a sub-quadratic growth rates in all dimensions. To overcome this, we first use the Moser iteration to get some uniform bounds of the time integration of the solutions. Then by combining these bounds with an $L^p$-energy method and a duality argument, we obtain the global existence of solutions. Moreover, under mass dissipation conditions, the solution is shown to be bounded uniformly in time.</description>

      <title>A Note on Hyperbolic Relaxation of the Navier-Stokes-Cahn-Hilliard system for incompressible two-phase flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11904v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the two-phase dynamics of two incompressible and immiscible fluids. As a mathematical model we rely on the Navier-Stokes-Cahn-Hilliard system that belongs to the class of diffuse-interface models. Solutions of the Navier-Stokes-Cahn-Hilliard system exhibit strong non-local effects due to the velocity divergence constraint and the fourth-order Cahn-Hilliard operator. We suggest a new first-order approximative system for the inviscid sub-system. It relies on the artificial-compressibility ansatz for the Navier-Stokes equations, a friction-type approximation for the Cahn-Hilliard equation and a relaxation of a third-order capillarity term. We show under reasonable assumptions that the first-order operator within the approximative system is hyperbolic; precisely we prove for the spatially one-dimensional case that it is equipped with an entropy-entropy flux pair with convex (mathematical) entropy. For specific states we present a numerical characteristic analysis. Thanks to the hyperbolicity of the system, we can employ all standard numerical methods from the field of hyperbolic conservation laws. We conclude the paper with preliminary numerical results in one spatial dimension.</description>

      <title>New analytical solution for time fractional Burgers-Huxley equation describing the interaction between reaction mechanisms and diffusion transport</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.07375v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This manuscript studies the numerical solution of the time-fractional Burgers-Huxley equation in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. The analytical solution of the equation is obtained in terms of a convergent series with easily computable components. It is observed that the approximate solution uniformly converges to the exact solution for the aforementioned equation. Also, the convergence of the proposed method is investigated. Numerical examples are given to demonstrate the validity and applicability of the presented method. The numerical results indicate that the proposed method is powerful and effective with a small computational overhead.</description>

      <title>Tiny fluctuations of the averaging process around its degenerate steady state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02032v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze nonequilibrium fluctuations of the averaging process on $\mathbb T_\varepsilon^d$, a continuous degenerate Gibbs sampler running over the edges of the discrete $d$-dimensional torus. We show that, if we start from a smooth deterministic non-flat interface, recenter, blow-up by a non-standard CLT-scaling factor $\theta_\varepsilon=\varepsilon^{-(d/2+1)}$, and rescale diffusively, Gaussian fluctuations emerge in the limit $\varepsilon\to 0$. These fluctuations are purely dynamical, zero at times $t=0$ and $t=\infty$, and non-trivial for $t\in (0,\infty)$. We fully determine the correlation matrix of the limiting noise, non-diagonal as soon as $d\ge 2$. The main technical challenge in this stochastic homogenization procedure lies in a LLN for a weighted space-time average of squared discrete gradients. We accomplish this through a Poincar\'e inequality with respect to the underlying randomness of the edge updates, a tool from Malliavin calculus in Poisson space. This inequality, combined with sharp gradients' second moment estimates, yields quantitative variance bounds without prior knowledge of the limiting mean. Our method avoids higher (e.g., fourth) moment bounds, which seem inaccessible with the present techniques.</description>

      <title>Analytically weak and mild solutions to stochastic heat equation with irregular drift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06599v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider the stochastic heat equation \begin{equation*} \partial_t u_t(x)=\frac12 \partial^2_{xx}u_t(x) +b(u_t(x))+\dot{W}_{t}(x),\quad t\in(0,T],\, x\in D, \end{equation*} where $b$ is a generalized function, $D$ is either $[0,1]$ or $\mathbb{R}$, and $\dot W$ is space-time white noise on $\mathbb{R}_+\times D$. If the drift $b$ is a sufficiently regular function, then it is well-known that any analytically weak solution to this equation is also analytically mild, and vice versa. We extend this result to drifts that are generalized functions, with an appropriate adaptation of the notions of mild and weak solutions. As a corollary of our results, we show that for $b\in L_p(\mathbb{R})$, $p\ge1$, this equation has a unique analytically weak and mild solution, thus extending the classical results of Gy\"ongy and Pardoux (1993).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04929v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Increasing the complexity of solving budgetary allocation (NP-hardness problem) has led a wide range of methods to minimize the costs. Metaheuristics and Linear Programming (LP) are the most optimization in this fields. Therefore, this study provides insights and a deep understanding of the applicability of LP models in industry and how to formulate SM and affine IPM for solving real world linear problems. Moreover, it will present a better way to deal with decision making problems through the development and comparison of the SM and affine IPM to solve LP optimization problem to maximize profit. Finally, to other researchers particularly of similar interests who are undertaking further investigation on this topic, this study can be vital as a secondary source of information and guidance.</description>
