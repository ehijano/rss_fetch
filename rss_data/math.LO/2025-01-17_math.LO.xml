      <title>Justification logics with counterfactual and relevant conditionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to introduce justification logics based on conditional logics. We introduce a new family of logics, called conditional justification logics, which incorporates a counterfactual conditional in its language. For the semantics, we offer relational models that merge the selection-function semantics of conditional logics with the relational semantics of justification logics. As an application, we formalize Nozick's counterfactual conditions in his analysis of knowledge and investigate their connection to Aumann's concepts of knowledge. Additionally, we explore Gettier's counterexamples to the justified true belief analysis, as well as McGinn's counterexamples to Nozick's analysis of knowledge. Furthermore, we introduce a justification logic that includes a relevant counterfactual conditional and we demonstrate the variable-sharing property for this conditional. We also develop a tableau system for this logic and establish its completeness with respect to Routley relational models. Finally, we formalize Nozick's counterfactual conditions using this relevant counterfactual conditional and represent the sheep in the field example of Chisholm within this logic.</description>

      <title>Variants of the chain-antichain principle in reverse mathematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Restricting the chain-antichain principle CAC to partially ordered sets which respect the natural ordering of the integers is a trivial distinction in the sense of classical reverse mathematics. We utilize computability-theoretic reductions to formally establish distinguishing characteristics of CAC and the aforementioned restriction to elaborate on the apparent differences obfuscated over RCA0. Stable versions of both principles are also analyzed in this way.</description>

      <title>Rates of (T-)asymptotic regularity of the generalized Krasnoselskii-Mann-type iteration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we use proof mining methods to compute rates of ($T$-)asymptotic regularity of the generalized Krasnoselskii-Mann-type iteration associated to a nonexpansive mapping $T:X\to X$ in a uniformly convex normed space $X$. For special choices of the parameter sequences, we obtain quadratic rates.</description>

      <title>Measurable Brooks's Theorem for Directed Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00991v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a descriptive version of Brooks's theorem for directed graphs. In particular, we show that, if $D$ is a Borel directed graph on a standard Borel space $X$ such that the maximum degree of each vertex is at most $d \geq 3$, then unless $D$ contains the complete symmetric directed graph on $d + 1$ vertices, $D$ admits a $\mu$-measurable $d$-dicoloring with respect to any Borel probability measure $\mu$ on $X$, and $D$ admits a $\tau$-Baire-measurable $d$-dicoloring with respect to any Polish topology $\tau$ compatible with the Borel structure on $X$. We also prove a definable version of Gallai's theorem on list dicolorings for directed graphs by showing that any Borel directed graph of bounded degree whose connected components are not Gallai trees is Borel degree-list-dicolorable.</description>

      <title>Very basic set theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.13473v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ernst Zermelo's axiomatization of set theory (1908) did not exclude `a set that is a member of itself'. We call a set that is a member of itself `an individual'. In this article we prove the elimination of Russell's paradox is equivalent to "For every set S, an individual is a member of S or a set (but not an individual) is not a member of S". This shows there is place is set theory for individuals. We give individuals the place they deserve according to formal logic.</description>

      <title>Bounding the degree of generic sharp transitivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09636v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that a generically sharply $t$-transitive permutation group of finite Morley rank on a set of rank $r$ satisfies $t\le r+2$ provided the pointwise stabilizer of a generic $(t-1)$-tuple is an $L$-group, which holds, for example, when this stabilizer is solvable or when $r\le 5$. This makes progress on the Borovik-Cherlin conjecture that every generically $(r+2)$-transitive permutation group of finite Morley rank on a set of rank $r$ is of the form $\operatorname{PGL}_{r+1}(F)$ acting naturally on $\mathbb{P}^r(F)$.
  Our proof is assembled from three key ingredients that are independent of the main theorem - these address actions of $\operatorname{Alt}(n)$ on $L$-groups of finite Morley rank, generically $2$-transitive actions with abelian point stabilizers, and simple groups of rank $6$.</description>

      <title>First-order definitions of rings of integral functions over algebraic extensions of function fields and undecidability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14960v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study questions of definability and decidability for infinite algebraic extensions ${\bf K}$ of $\mathbb{F}_p(t)$ and their subrings of $\mathcal{S}$-integral functions. We focus on fields ${\bf K}$ satisfying a local property which we call $q$-boundedness. This can be considered a function field analogue of prior work of the first author which considered algebraic extensions of $\mathbb{Q}$. One simple consequence of our work states that if ${\bf K}$ is a $q$-bounded Galois extension of $\mathbb{F}_p(t)$, then for infinitely many non-constant $u$ the integral closure $\mathcal{O}_{\bf K}$ of $\mathbb{F}_p[u]$ inside ${\bf K}$ is first-order definable in ${\bf K}$. Under the additional assumption that the constant subfield of ${\bf K}$ is infinite, it follows that both $\mathcal{O}_{\bf K}$ and ${\bf K}$ have undecidable first-order theories, and that $\mathbb{F}_p[w]$ is definable in ${\bf K}$ for every non-constant $w$ in ${\bf K}$. Our primary tools are norm equations and the Hasse Norm Principle, in the spirit of Rumely. Our paper has an intersection with a recent arXiv preprint by Mart\'inez-Ranero, Salcedo, and Utreras, although our definability results are more extensive and undecidability results are much stronger.</description>
