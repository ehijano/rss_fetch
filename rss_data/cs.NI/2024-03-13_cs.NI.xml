      <title>Dynamic Frequency Assignment for Mobile Users in Multibeam Satellite Constellations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mobile users such as airplanes or ships will constitute an important segment of the future satellite communications market. Operators are now able to leverage digital payloads that allow flexible resource allocation policies that are robust against dynamic user bases. One of the key problems is managing the frequency spectrum efficiently, which has not been sufficiently explored for mobile users.
  To address this gap, we propose a dynamic frequency management algorithm based on linear programming that assigns resources in scenarios with both fixed and mobile users by combining long-term planning with real-time operation. We propose different strategies divided into proactive strategies, which stem from robust optimization practices, and reactive strategies, which exploit a high degree of real-time control. This represents a tradeoff between how conservative long-time planning should be and how much real-time reconfiguration is needed.
  To assess the performance of our method and to determine which proactive and reactive strategies work better under which context, we simulate operational use cases of non-geostationary constellations with different levels of dimensionality and uncertainty, showing that our method is able to serve over 99.97\% of the fixed and mobile users in scenarios with more than 900 beams. Finally, we discuss the trade-offs between the studied strategies in terms of the number of served users, power consumption, and number of changes that need to happen during operations.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Federated Learning in Intelligent Transportation Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) has brought about comprehensive urban traffic information that not only provides convenience to urban residents in their daily lives but also enhances the efficiency of urban road usage, leading to a more harmonious and sustainable urban life. Typical scenarios in ITS mainly include traffic flow prediction, traffic target recognition, and vehicular edge computing. However, most current ITS applications rely on a centralized training approach where users upload source data to a cloud server with high computing power for management and centralized training. This approach has limitations such as poor real-time performance, data silos, and difficulty in guaranteeing data privacy. To address these limitations, federated learning (FL) has been proposed as a promising solution. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of the application of FL in ITS, with a particular focus on three key scenarios: traffic flow prediction, traffic target recognition, and vehicular edge computing. For each scenario, we provide an in-depth analysis of its key characteristics, current challenges, and specific manners in which FL is leveraged. Moreover, we discuss the benefits that FL can offer as a potential solution to the limitations of the centralized training approach currently used in ITS applications.</description>

      <title>Towards a Dynamic Future with Adaptable Computing and Network Convergence (ACNC)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of advancing 6G, a substantial paradigm shift is anticipated, highlighting comprehensive everything-to-everything interactions characterized by numerous connections and stringent adherence to Quality of Service/Experience (QoS/E) prerequisites. The imminent challenge stems from resource scarcity, prompting a deliberate transition to Computing-Network Convergence (CNC) as an auspicious approach for joint resource orchestration. While CNC-based mechanisms have garnered attention, their effectiveness in realizing future services, particularly in use cases like the Metaverse, may encounter limitations due to the continually changing nature of users, services, and resources. Hence, this paper presents the concept of Adaptable CNC (ACNC) as an autonomous Machine Learning (ML)-aided mechanism crafted for the joint orchestration of computing and network resources, catering to dynamic and voluminous user requests with stringent requirements. ACNC encompasses two primary functionalities: state recognition and context detection. Given the intricate nature of the user-service-computing-network space, the paper employs dimension reduction to generate live, holistic, abstract system states in a hierarchical structure. To address the challenges posed by dynamic changes, Continual Learning (CL) is employed, classifying the system state into contexts controlled by dedicated ML agents, enabling them to operate efficiently. These two functionalities are intricately linked within a closed loop overseen by the End-to-End (E2E) orchestrator to allocate resources. The paper introduces the components of ACNC, proposes a Metaverse scenario to exemplify ACNC's role in resource provisioning with Segment Routing v6 (SRv6), outlines ACNC's workflow, details a numerical analysis for efficiency assessment, and concludes with discussions on relevant challenges and potential avenues for future research.</description>

      <title>Adapting LoRaWAN to the Open-RAN Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article proposes O-LoRaWAN, an adaptation of the LoRaWAN architecture into a modular network architecture based on the Open RAN (O-RAN) principles. In our vision, standardization of the network components and interfaces will enable the reuse of network functions, and thus, foster an accelerated tailoring of the network functions to the changing application demands. LoRaWAN shares similarities to cellular networks and becomes an interesting candidate for a transformation to the O-RAN standard. In the article we draw several transition strategies, these include the reorganization of the LoRa gateway functions into Radio and Distributed Units; enhancing network performance with RAN Intelligent Controllers exploiting the network data; and the standardization of the management and orchestration of network components. Key for that adaptation are the O-RAN interfaces. Along the article, we analyze them and suggest protocol extensions or adjustments for compatibility and interoperability between network components, advocating for the design of extensible protocols</description>

      <title>Emerging Technologies for 6G Non-Terrestrial-Networks: From Academia to Industrial Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Terrestrial networks form the fundamental infrastructure of modern communication systems, serving more than 4 billion users globally. However, terrestrial networks are facing a wide range of challenges, from coverage and reliability to interference and congestion. As the demands of the 6G era are expected to be much higher, it is crucial to address these challenges to ensure a robust and efficient communication infrastructure for the future. To address these problems, Non-terrestrial Network (NTN) has emerged to be a promising solution. NTNs are communication networks that leverage airborne (e.g., unmanned aerial vehicles) and spaceborne vehicles (e.g., satellites) to facilitate ultra-reliable communications and connectivity with high data rates and low latency over expansive regions. This article aims to provide a comprehensive survey on the utilization of network slicing, Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML), and Open Radio Access Network (ORAN) to address diverse challenges of NTNs from the perspectives of both academia and industry. Particularly, we first provide an in-depth tutorial on NTN and the key enabling technologies including network slicing, AI/ML, and ORAN. Then, we provide a comprehensive survey on how network slicing and AI/ML have been leveraged to overcome the challenges that NTNs are facing. Moreover, we present how ORAN can be utilized for NTNs. Finally, we highlight important challenges, open issues, and future research directions of NTN in the 6G era.</description>

      <title>From Files to Streams: Revisiting Web History and Exploring Potentials for Future Prospects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the last 30 years, the World Wide Web has changed significantly. In this paper, we argue that common practices to prepare web pages for delivery conflict with many efforts to present content with minimal latency, one fundamental goal that pushed changes in the WWW. To bolster our arguments, we revisit reasons that led to changes of HTTP and compare them systematically with techniques to prepare web pages. We found that the structure of many web pages leverages features of HTTP/1.1 but hinders the use of recent HTTP features to present content quickly. To improve the situation in the future, we propose fine-grained content segmentation. This would allow to exploit streaming capabilities of recent HTTP versions and to render content as quickly as possible without changing underlying protocols or web browsers.</description>

      <title>Online Digital Twin-Empowered Content Resale Mechanism in Age of Information-Aware Edge Caching Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For users requesting popular contents from content providers, edge caching can alleviate backhaul pressure and enhance the quality of experience of users. Recently there is also a growing concern about content freshness that is quantified by age of information (AoI). Therefore, AoI-aware online caching algorithms are required, which is challenging because the content popularity is usually unknown in advance and may vary over time. In this paper, we propose an online digital twin (DT) empowered content resale mechanism in AoI-aware edge caching networks. We aim to design an optimal two-timescale caching strategy to maximize the utility of an edge network service provider (ENSP). The formulated optimization problem is non-convex and NP-hard. To tackle this intractable problem, we propose a DT-assisted Online Caching Algorithm (DT-OCA). In specific, we first decompose our formulated problem into a series of subproblems, each handling a cache period. For each cache period, we use a DT-based prediction method to effectively capture future content popularity, and develop online caching strategy. Competitive ratio analysis and extensive experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm has promising performance, and outperforms other benchmark algorithms. Insightful observations are also found and discussed.</description>

      <title>Evacuation Management Framework towards Smart City-wide Intelligent Emergency Interactive Response System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A smart city solution toward future 6G network deployment allows small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs), industry, and government entities to connect with the infrastructures and play a crucial role in enhancing emergency preparedness with advanced sensors. The objective of this work is to propose a set of coordinated technological solutions to transform an existing emergency response system into an intelligent interactive system, thereby improving the public services and the quality of life for residents at home, on road, in hospitals, transport hubs, etc. In this context, we consider a city wide view from three different application scenes that are closely related to peoples daily life, to optimize the actions taken at relevant departments. Therefore, using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques to enable the next generation connected vehicle experiences, we specifically focus on accidents happening in indoor households, urban roads, and at large public facilities. This smart interactive response system will benefit from advanced sensor fusion and AI by formulating a real time dynamic model.</description>

      <title>Discrete-Time Modeling and Handover Analysis of Intelligent Reflecting Surface-Assisted Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Owning to the reflection gain and double path loss featured by intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) channels, handover (HO) locations become irregular and the signal strength fluctuates sharply with variations in IRS connections during HO, the risk of HO failures (HOFs) is exacerbated and thus HO parameters require reconfiguration. However, existing HO models only assume monotonic negative exponential path loss and cannot obtain sound HO parameters. This paper proposes a discrete-time model to explicitly track the HO process with variations in IRS connections, where IRS connections and HO process are discretized as finite states by measurement intervals, and transitions between states are modeled as stochastic processes. Specifically, to capture signal fluctuations during HO, IRS connection state-dependent distributions of the user-IRS distance are modified by the correlation between measurement intervals. In addition, states of the HO process are formed with Time-to-Trigger and HO margin whose transition probabilities are integrated concerning all IRS connection states. Trigger location distributions and probabilities of HO, HOF, and ping-pong (PP) are obtained by tracing user HO states. Results show IRSs mitigate PPs by 48% but exacerbate HOFs by 90% under regular parameters. Optimal parameters are mined ensuring probabilities of HOF and PP are both less than 0.1%.</description>

      <title>Jasper: Scalable and Fair Multicast for Financial Exchanges in the Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09527v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Financial exchanges have recently shown an interest in migrating to the public cloud for scalability, elasticity, and cost savings. However, financial exchanges often have strict network requirements that can be difficult to meet on the cloud. Notably, market participants (MPs) trade based on market data about different activities in the market. Exchanges often use switch multicast to disseminate market data to MPs. However, if one MP receives market data earlier than another, that MP would have an unfair advantage. To prevent this, financial exchanges often equalize exchange-to-MP cable lengths to provide near-simultaneous reception of market data at MPs.
  As a cloud tenant, however, building a fair multicast service is challenging because of the lack of switch support for multicast, high latency variance, and the lack of native mechanisms for simultaneous data delivery in the cloud. Jasper introduces a solution that creates an overlay multicast tree within a cloud region that minimizes latency and latency variations through hedging, leverages recent advancements in clock synchronization to achieve simultaneous delivery, and addresses various sources of latency through an optimized DPDK/eBPF implementation -- while scaling to a thousand receivers. Jasper outperforms a prior system, CloudEx, and a commercial multicast solution provided by Amazon Web Services.</description>
