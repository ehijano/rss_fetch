      <title>Machine Learning for Correlations of Electromagnetic Properties in Ab Initio Calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In ab initio nuclear structure theory, accurately predicting electromagnetic observables, such as moments and transition rates, is essential for a comprehensive understanding of nuclear properties. However, computational limitations and conceptual difficulties often hinder the precise calculation of these observables. In this work, we extend machine learning methods for model-space extrapolations to electric quadrupole moments. We further present a new machine learning approach that leverages the correlations between energies, radii, and electromagnetic observables. By learning these correlations from no-core shell model calculations in accessible model spaces, this new model enables the prediction of converged electromagnetic observables from predictions of converged energies and radii, which can be obtained with established machine learning extrapolation tools. An essential property of our approach is the capability for uncertainty quantification, allowing for reliable predictions with combined statistical error estimates for many-body and interaction uncertainties. Being solely built upon the physical correlations of different observables, it can be generalized across different ab initio methods. We demonstrate the power of this new extrapolation scheme through a precision study of electric quadrupole moments across a wide range of p-shell nuclei.</description>

      <title>Quark flavor equilibration of the quark-gluon plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The early stage of a heavy-ion collision is marked by rapid entropy production and the transition from a gluon saturated initial condition to a plasma of quarks and gluons that evolves hydrodynamically. However, during the early times of the hydrodynamic evolution, the chemical composition of the QCD medium is still largely unknown. We present a study of quark chemical equilibration in the (Q)GP using a novel model of viscous hydrodynamic evolution in partial chemical equilibrium. Motivated by the success of gluon saturated initial condition models, we initialize the QCD medium as a completely gluon dominated state. Local quark production during the hydrodynamic phase is then simulated through the evolution of time-dependent fugacities for each independent quark flavor, with the timescales set as free parameters to compare different rates of equilibration. We present the results of complete heavy-ion collision simulations using this partial chemical equilibrium model, and show the effects on hadronic and electromagnetic observables. In particular, we show that the development of flow is sensitive to the equilibration timescale, providing an empirical way to probe the chemical equilibration of the QCD medium.</description>

      <title>A lattice QCD calculation of the Compton amplitude subtraction function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Compton amplitude subtraction function is an essential component in work concerning both the proton radius puzzle and the proton-neutron mass difference. However, owing to the difficulty in determining the subtraction function, it remains a key source of uncertainty in these two contexts. Here, we use the Feynman-Hellmann method to determine this subtraction function directly from lattice QCD. Furthermore, we demonstrate how to control dominant discretisation artefacts for this calculation, eliminating a major source of systematic error. This calculation is performed for a range of hard momentum scales, and three different sets of gauge configurations for pion masses about 400 MeV. Our results show good agreement with continuum OPE expectations. As such, this work paves the way for model-independent and precise determinations of the subtraction function over a wide range of kinematics.</description>

      <title>Relativistic corrections to the vector meson light front wave function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.02830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2006.02830v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute a light front wave function for heavy vector mesons based on long distance matrix elements constrained by decay width analyses in the Non Relativistic QCD framework. Our approach provides a systematic expansion of the wave function in quark velocity. The first relativistic correction included in our calculation is found to be significant, and crucial for a good description of the HERA exclusive $\mathrm{J}/\psi$ production data. When looking at cross section ratios between nuclear and proton targets, the wave function dependence does not cancel out exactly. In particular the fully non-relativistic limit is found not to be a reliable approximation even in this ratio. The important role of the Melosh rotation to express the rest frame wave function on the light front is illustrated.</description>

      <title>T-odd Parton Distribution Functions and Azimuthal Anisotropy at High Transverse Momentum in $p$-$p$ and $p$-$A$ Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05287v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Various azimuthal anisotropies ($v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4$), at high transverse momentum (high-$p_T$), are shown to arise from the asymmetric scattering of transverse polarized quarks and gluons, arising from unpolarized nucleons (the Boer-Mulders' effect) and resulting in unpolarized hadrons (the Collins effect). Combined with the asymmetric scattering of partons from polarization independent but transverse momentum dependent (TMD) distributions, we obtain a possible mechanism to understand the azimuthal anisotropy of hadrons at large transverse momentum observed in $p$-$p$ collisions. Constraining the ratio of polarization dependent TMD distributions to polarization independent distributions by comparing with the data from $p$-$p$ collisions, we find that scaling the acquired transverse momentum of the initial state partons from the proton, due to prescattering before the hard interaction, with the length of the nucleus ($k_\perp^2 \propto A^{1/3}$), straightforwardly yields the azimuthal anisotropy at high $p_T$ in $p$-$A$ collisions.</description>

      <title>Neural Ordinary Differential Equations for Mapping the Magnetic QCD Phase Diagram via Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12772v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The QCD phase diagram is crucial for understanding strongly interacting matter under extreme conditions, with major implications for cosmology, neutron stars, and heavy-ion collisions. We present a novel holographic QCD model utilizing neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to map the QCD phase diagram under magnetic field $B$, baryon chemical potential $\mu_B$, and temperature $T$. By solving the inverse problem of constructing the gravitational theory from Lattice QCD data, we reveal an unprecedentedly rich phase structure at finite $B$, including discovering multiple critical endpoints (CEPs) under strong magnetic fields. Specifically, for {$B = 1.618 \, \mathrm{GeV}^2=2.592 \times 10^{19}$ Gauss}, we identify two distinct CEPs at $(T_C = 87.3 \, \mathrm{MeV}, \, \mu_C = 115.9 \, \mathrm{MeV})$ and $(T_C = 78.9 \, \mathrm{MeV}, \, \mu_C = 244.0 \, \mathrm{MeV})$. Notably, the critical exponents vary depending on the CEP's location. These findings significantly advance our understanding of the QCD phase structure and provide concrete predictions for experimental validation at upcoming facilities such as FAIR, JPARC-HI, and NICA.</description>

      <title>Investigating the role of nuclear parameters on oscillation modes in hot Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00739v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have revealed that certain nuclear parameters are more dominant than others in governing global neutron star properties, such as its structure or oscillation mode characteristics. Although neutron stars can in general assumed to be cold, in astrophysical scenarios such as newly born neutron stars or remnants of binary neutron star mergers, finite temperature effects play a non-negligible role. In this work, we perform a consistent and systematic investigation of the role of nuclear parameters and thermal effects on neutron star properties and fluid oscillation modes within a full general relativistic scheme. We impose constraints on the parameter space of the relativistic mean field model using state-of-the-art information from terrestrial experiments and multi-messenger astrophysical data. We find effective nucleon mass to be the most important nuclear parameter controlling astrophysical observables of hot neutron stars, similar to the cold beta equilibrated matter. However, we conclude that the interplay among saturation properties and astrophysical observables depends not only on the thermal configurations considered but also on the constraints imposed. We also investigated the role of nuclear saturation parameters on some universal relations for hot NSs which are important in gravitational wave asteroseismology. Our investigation confirmed that these relations are mostly insensitive to nuclear saturation properties and mainly affected by variation of charge fraction in the star.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically conformal CFL quark matter within a nonlocal chiral quark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05859v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a three-flavor nonlocal NJL model of quark matter with the scalar attractive, vector repulsive and diquark pairing interaction channels. The model is treated within the separable approximation to obtain the EoS of cold quark matter. The analysis of the high density asymptotics of the model allows us to conclude about its qualitative agreement with the perturbative QCD. Particularly, a color superconducting CFL state is found to be the ground one at high densities. The conformal limit of speed of sound and dimensionless interaction measure are also shown to be reached from below and above, respectively. The model is applied to modelling NSs within the scenario of early quark deconfinement triggered by the gravitational instability of the NS matter due to the BEC of a spin-color-flavor singlet three-diquark bound state, the light sexaquark, stable against the weak and strong decays. A conservative estimate of the sexaquark mass based on the most up-to-date results from QCD sum rules and a constituent quark model assumes an early quark deconfinement with the onset mass below $1~\rm M_\odot$. The scenario is shown to be consistent with the present observational constraints on the mass-radius relation and tidal deformability of NSs. Given the fact that the proposed model by construction exhibits an asymptotically conformal behavior, we consider the question about approximately conformal quark matter in NSs. We report a non-perturbative energy density range, which is inaccessible in NSs and where the speed of sound and dimensionless interaction measure of the CFL quark matter simultaneously attain the conformal values.</description>

      <title>Quarks to Cosmos: Particles and Plasma in Cosmological evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19031v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe in the context of the particle physics (PP) standard model (SM) `PP-SM' the understanding of the primordial properties and composition of the Universe in the temperature range $130\GeV&gt;T&gt;20\keV$. The Universe evolution is described using FLRW cosmology. We present a global view on particle content across time and describe the different evolution eras using deceleration parameter $q$. We follow the arrow of time in the expanding and cooling Universe: After the PP-SM heavies $(t, h, W, Z)$ diminish in abundance below $T\simeq 50\GeV$, the PP-SM plasma in the Universe is governed by the strongly interacting Quark-Gluon content. Once the temperature drops below $T\simeq 150\MeV$, quarks and gluons hadronize into strongly interacting matter particles. Rapid disappearance of baryonic antimatter completes at $T_\mathrm{B}=38.2\MeV$. We study the ensuing disappearance of strangeness and mesons in general. We show that the different eras defined by particle populations are barely separated from each other with abundance of muons fading out just prior to $T=\mathcal{O}(2.5)\MeV$, the era of emergence of the free-streaming neutrinos. We discuss the two relevant fundamental constants controlling the decoupling of neutrinos. We subsequently follow the primordial Universe as it passes through the hot dense electron-positron plasma epoch. The high density of positron antimatter disappears near $T=20.3\keV$: Nuclear reactions occur in the presence of a highly mobile and relatively strongly interacting electron-positron plasma phase. We apply plasma theory methods to describe the strong screening effects between heavy dust particle (nucleons). We analyze the paramagnetic characteristics of the electron-positron plasma when exposed to an external primordial magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Rapidity asymmetry of jet-hadron correlation as a robust signal of diffusion wake induced by di-jets in high-energy heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03419v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The diffusion wake accompanying a Mach cone is a unique feature of the medium response to jet-medium interaction inside the quark-gluon plasma in high-energy heavy-ion collisions. It leads to a depletion of soft hadrons in the opposite direction of the propagating jet as recently observed in $Z$-jet events of Pb+Pb collisions at LHC. In di-jet events, however, the diffusion wake of one jet usually overlaps with the medium-induced hadron enhancement of other jet with no clear signal of the diffusion wake except a reduction of the hadron enhancement, unless there is a large rapidity gap between the two jets. We propose to use the rapidity asymmetry of jet-hadron correlations in di-jets with a finite rapidity gap relative to that without, as a robust signal of the diffusion wake. The asymmetry emerges because the diffusion wake of one jet is shifted to a finite rapidity relative to the other jet. This shift leads to a depletion of soft hadrons in the rapidity region of the diffusion wake and an enhancement in the rapidity region of the other jet whose soft hadron enhancement is no longer or less reduced by the diffusion wake as in di-jets without a rapidity gap. We predict the rapidity asymmetry using both theoretical and mixed-event background subtraction for different values of the rapidity gap within the CoLBT-hydro model. Experimental measurements of this rapidity asymmetry with high statistics data on di-jets should provide more precise insights into the jet-induced diffusion wake and properties of the quark-gluon plasma.</description>
