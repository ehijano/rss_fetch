      <title>Quantitative acoustic monitoring of ensembles of weakly nonlinear microbubble oscillations in optically inaccessible environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A growing class of ultrasound-mediated diagnostic and therapeutic technologies, including sonoporation and blood-brain barrier modulation, relies on microbubble contrast agents, where precise control of microbubble dynamics governs biological responses, efficiency, and safety. However, quantitative monitoring of microbubble oscillations in the stable, weakly nonlinear regime remains challenging, particularly in optically opaque and deep-tissue environments. Here, we introduce a linear acoustic wave propagation and superposition (LAWPS) framework that reconstructs microbubble radius-time dynamics directly from passively recorded acoustic emissions. By coupling Fourier-series representations of weakly nonlinear oscillations with linear monopole radiation theory, LAWPS extends classical monopole models to establish a reversible relationship between multi-frequency acoustic emissions and underlying radial bubble dynamics. Extending this framework to monodisperse microbubble ensembles, we derive optimal excitation and receive configurations and population-level correction factors that enable quantitative reconstruction of the ensemble-averaged microbubble dynamics. Using simultaneous optical and acoustic measurements, we demonstrate recovery of microbubble oscillations with ~5% relative error for oscillation amplitudes up to ~15% of equilibrium radius. Finally, we show that oscillations within the framework's operating regime (20% oscillation) generate sonoporation-relevant mechanical stress in vesicles as small as 10 micrometers (capillary number &gt; 0.01), under physiologically relevant conditions. Together, this work establishes a quantitative framework for acoustic emission-based monitoring of weakly nonlinear microbubble oscillations in clinically relevant, optically inaccessible environments to enable improved control of emerging ultrasound diagnostic and therapeutic technologies.</description>

      <title>High-resolution 3D-printed plastic scintillators with tertiary dye</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Additive manufacturing offers efficient production of plastic scintillators with nontrivial geometries using vat polymerization, allowing fabrication of geometries which would be difficult or even impossible to produce using conventional subtractive manufacturing. This work presents a novel photocurable scintillator formula that includes coumarin 450 as a tertiary dye to enable high-resolution 3D printing via the manipulation of the 405 nm cure light. Bulk photocured and 3D printed (with and without tertiary dye) samples were compared through observational assessment and spectral response. All samples showed pulse shape discrimination between neutron and gamma events. Inclusion of the tertiary dye has minimal impact on emission spectrum and light output, but significant impact on print resolution as shown by comparison of printed high-complexity geometries and feature resolution test objects. With the use of a cure-limiting dye, unsupported features, such as freestanding pillars, were resolvable down to 0.7 mm. Even finer resolution at or below 0.1 mm was achieved in fully supported, integrated structures printed with off-the-shelf 405 nm desktop 3D printer. Scintillators demonstrated a light output up to 50% of EJ-200 with a PSD figure of merit up to 1.35 at 0.9-1.1 MeVee.</description>

      <title>Stringent constraints on non-standard neutrino interactions using high-purity $\nu_{\mu}$ CC events in IceCube DeepCore</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The neutral-current (NC) non-standard interactions (NSI) of neutrinos with fermions can modify the flavor oscillations of atmospheric neutrinos as they propagate through the Earth. We present constraints on the NC-NSI parameters $\varepsilon_{\mu\tau}$ and $\varepsilon_{\tau\tau}-\varepsilon_{\mu\mu}$ (one at a time) using a high-purity sample of $\nu_{\mu}$ charged-current (CC) atmospheric neutrino events collected by IceCube DeepCore over 7.5 years of livetime. These two parameters significantly affect the $\nu_\mu$ disappearance channel for which this golden event sample is optimized by the IceCube Collaboration. The best fit to this dataset is consistent with no NSI hypothesis, and we place the most stringent constraints to date: $-\,0.0094 &lt; \varepsilon_{\mu\tau} &lt; 0.0079$ and $-\,0.030 &lt; \varepsilon_{\tau\tau}-\varepsilon_{\mu\mu} &lt; 0.029$ at 90% confidence level.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous measurement of surface topography and subsurface velocity field in free-surface turbulent flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a novel combination of two well-established techniques: particle image velocimetry (PIV) and fringe projection profilometry (FPP). Despite seemingly conflicting requirements -- PIV requires a transparent fluid, while FPP requires an opaque surface to project onto -- both requirements are met by adding fluorescein disodium salt, a fluorescent dye, to the water. This dye strongly absorbs the blue light projected onto the surface for FPP while interacting weakly with the green laser light used for PIV, achieving simultaneous opacity and transparency depending on colour. However, this approach presents several challenges, which we are able to solve with a combination of optical filters on the projector and cameras. A series of validation experiments were performed to assess the accuracy of surface elevation measurements at various dye concentrations. The technique was then demonstrated for the case of a vortex street generated by a cylinder interacting with surface waves. Our results show that a dye concentration of 12\,mg/L, although insufficient to make the water opaque to the projected light, yields a mean absolute error in surface elevation of only 20 micrometres.</description>

      <title>Plastic inorganic Sn2BiS2I3 semiconductor enabled deformable and flexible electronic tongue for heavy metal detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deformable and flexible electronics have garnered significant attention due to their distinctive properties; however, their current applications are primarily limited to the thermoelectric domain. Expanding the range of these electronics and their application scope represents a pivotal trend in their development. In this work, a plastic inorganic semiconductor material, Sn2BiS2I3, with a band gap of 1.2 eV was synthesized and fabricated into a three-electrode flexible and portable electronic tongue capable of detecting heavy metal elements. The electronic tongue device exhibits exceptional linearity and demonstrates resistance against interference from impurity ions. The linear regression equation is expressed as Y=0.24+19.06X, yielding a linear coefficient of approximately 0.96, and the detectable limit stands at around 1.1 ppb, surpassing the 2.0 ppb limit of the ICP-AES instrument. Furthermore, mechanical testing reveals the favorable plasticity of Sn2BiS2I3, as evidenced by the absence of cracks during nanoindentation. The indentation hardness of Sn2BiS2I3 is approximately 1.67 GPa, slightly exceeding the hardness of Cu, which is 1.25 GPa. This study expands the repertoire of deformable and flexible electronics, offering a new and exceptional choice for biomimetic tongue sensor materials.</description>

      <title>An integrated quantitative single-objective light-sheet microscope for subcellular dynamics in embryos and cultured multicellular systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantitative imaging of subcellular processes in living embryos, stem-cell systems, and organoid models requires microscopy platforms that combine high spatial resolution, fast volumetric acquisition, long-term stability, and minimal phototoxicity. Single-objective light-sheet approaches based on oblique plane microscopy (OPM) are well suited for live imaging in standard sample geometries, but most existing implementations lack the optical calibration, timing precision, and end-to-end integration required for reproducible quantitative measurements. Here we present a fully integrated and quantitatively characterized OPM platform engineered for dynamic studies of transcription and nuclear organization in embryos, embryonic stem cells, and three-dimensional culture systems. The system combines high numerical aperture remote refocusing with tilt-invariant light-sheet scanning and hardware-timed synchronization of laser excitation, galvo scanning, and camera readout. We provide a comprehensive characterization of the optical performance, including point spread function, sampling geometry, usable field of view, and system stability, establishing a well-defined framework for quantitative volumetric imaging. To support high-throughput operation, we developed a unified acquisition and reconstruction pipeline that enables real time volumetric imaging at hardware-limited rates while preserving deterministic timing and reproducible geometry. Using this platform, we demonstrate quantitative three-dimensional imaging of MS2-labeled transcription sites in living Drosophila embryos, cultured mouse embryonic stem cells, and mESC-derived gastruloids, enabling extraction of transcriptional intensity traces across diverse biological contexts. This work establishes OPM as a robust and quantitatively calibrated single-objective light-sheet platform for transcription imaging in complex living systems.</description>

      <title>The new generation lunar gravitational wave detectors: sky map resolution and joint analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lunar-based gravitational-wave interferometry is a fascinating endeavor, and was proposed as a promising approach to bridge the observational gap between space-borne and ground-based detectors. In this work, we adopt the Fisher-matrix method to examine the angular-resolution performance of the newly proposed Crater Interferometry Gravitational-wave Observatory (CIGO) on the lunar crater rim near the north pole, together with TianQin and LISA, for monochromatic sources in the 0.1-10 Hz band. We find that above 0.1 Hz, CIGO achieves better localization accuracy than the other two space-based missions and dominates the combined detector network's performance, provided that lunar noise mitigation is achieved in the 0.1-2.87 Hz frequency range. We further explore an upgraded Tetrahedron configuration, TCIGO, with a fourth station at the bottom of a crater, which forms a regular tetrahedral constellation on the lunar surface. The result shows that TCIGO yields a five-fold improvement in angular-resolution capability over CIGO and gets better sky coverage across the target frequency band.</description>

      <title>Fast Jet Tagging with MLP-Mixers on FPGAs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03103v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the innovative use of MLP-Mixer models for real-time jet tagging and establish their feasibility on resource-constrained hardware like FPGAs. MLP-Mixers excel in processing sequences of jet constituents, achieving state-of-the-art performance on datasets mimicking Large Hadron Collider conditions. By using advanced optimization techniques such as High-Granularity Quantization and Distributed Arithmetic, we achieve unprecedented efficiency. These models match or surpass the accuracy of previous architectures, reduce hardware resource usage by up to 97%, double the throughput, and half the latency. Additionally, non-permutation-invariant architectures enable smart feature prioritization and efficient FPGA deployment, setting a new benchmark for machine learning in real-time data processing at particle colliders.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Machine-Learning Particle Identification for the ePIC Proximity-Focusing RICH</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14598v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a machine-learning-based particle-identification study for the proximity-focusing Ring Imaging Cherenkov (pfRICH) detector of the ePIC experiment at the Electron-Ion Collider. Operating in the backward region ($-3.5 \lesssim \eta \lesssim -1.5$), the pfRICH is designed to achieve at least $3\sigma$ separation among pions, kaons, and protons up to $7,\mathrm{GeV}/c$ for Semi-Inclusive Deep Inelastic Scattering measurements. Using a standalone Geant4 simulation of the pfRICH, we develop a hybrid machine-learning approach that combines convolutional neural-network-based feature extraction with gradient-boosted decision-tree classifiers. This method significantly enhances Cherenkov-ring pattern recognition and improves particle-separation performance, demonstrating the effectiveness of hybrid machine-learning techniques for next-generation Cherenkov detectors at the EIC.</description>

      <title>Explanation of the seasonal variation of cosmic multiple muon events observed with the NOvA Near Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04434v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The flux of cosmic ray muons at the Earth's surface exhibits seasonal variations due to changes in the temperature of the atmosphere affecting the production and decay of mesons in the upper atmosphere. Using 1473 live days of data collected by the NuMI Off-axis $\nu_e$ Appearance (NOvA) Near Detector during 2018--2022, we studied the seasonal pattern in the multiple-muon event rate. The data confirm an anticorrelation between the multiple-muon event rate and effective atmospheric temperature, consistent across all the years of data. Previous analyses from MINOS and NOvA saw a similar anticorrelation but did not include an explanation. We find that this anticorrelation is driven by altitude--geometry effects as the average muon production height changes with the season. This has been studied with a CORSIKA cosmic ray simulation package by varying atmospheric parameters, and provides an explanation to a longstanding discrepancy between the seasonal phases of single and multiple-muon events.</description>

      <title>A Bidirectional Diode-Clamp Circuit Paradigm for Time-Resolved Measurement of Electrical Short-Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00959v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conventional electrical fault models, which rely on static thresholds and instantaneous trip mechanisms, fail to capture the time-evolving dynamics of real faults, creating vulnerabilities in modern power systems. This paper introduces a diode-clamp circuit architecture that reconceives short-circuits as governed, sustained processes and establishes a physics-consistent, measurement system. An Arduino-based data acquisition system recorded continuous fault evolution across multiple input voltages and durations. Multi-resolution sampling at 10ms, 50ms, and 100ms enabled high-fidelity capture of both transients and sustained-state dynamics. The clamped mechanism constrained the circuit to a bounded regime, enabling repeatable observation. Experiments yielded definitive, measurable minima and maxima for voltage, current, and resistance, empirically refuting the classical assumption of instantaneous, unbounded current. Newly introduced metrics quantify this performance: the Sustained-to-Capacitive Energy Ratio (SCER ~1.53x10^12) proves fault energy originates from sustained dynamics, not transient discharge. The Sustained Fault Efficiency (SFE&gt;1) demonstrates that governed fault power can exceed nominal operating power. This work provides the first fully validated short-circuit quantification system, yielding empirical data for next-generation battery management, adaptive grid protection, and fault-tolerant electronics.</description>

      <title>Robust and scalable simulation-based inference for gravitational wave signals with gaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18290v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) data stream will inevitably contain gaps due to maintenance and environmental disturbances, introducing nonstationarities and spectral leakage that compromise standard frequency-domain likelihood evaluations. We present a scalable Simulation-Based Inference (SBI) framework capable of robust parameter estimation directly from gapped time-series data. We employ Flow Matching Posterior Estimation (FMPE) conditioned on a learned summary of the data, optimized through an end-to-end training strategy. To address the computational challenges of long-duration signals, we propose a dual-pathway summarizer architecture: a 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) operating on the time domain for high precision, and a novel wavelet-based 2D CNN utilizing asymmetric, dilated kernels to achieve scalability for datasets spanning months. We demonstrate the efficacy of this framework on simulated Galactic Binary-like signals, showing that our joint training approach yields tighter, unbiased posteriors compared to two-stage reconstruction pipelines. Furthermore, we provide the first systematic comparison showing that FMPE offers superior stability and coverage calibration over conventional Normalizing Flows in the presence of severe data artifacts.</description>
