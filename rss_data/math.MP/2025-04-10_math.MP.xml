      <title>On Stochastic Variational Principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of stochastic variational principles involves the problem of constructing fixed-endpoint and adapted variations of semimartingales. We provide a detailed construction of variations of semimartingales that are not only fixed at deterministic endpoints, but also fixed at first entry times and first exit times for charts in a manifold. We prove a stochastic version of the fundamental lemma of calculus of variations in the context of these variations. Using this framework, we provide a generalization of the stochastic Hamilton-Pontryagin principle in local coordinates to arbitrary noise semimartingales. For the corresponding global form of the stochastic Hamilton-Pontryagin principle, we introduce a novel approach to global variational principles by restricting to semimartingales obtained as solutions of Stratonovich equations.</description>

      <title>Rational interpolants and solutions of dispersionless Hirota system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to construct a class of explicit nontrivial rational solutions of the dispersionless Hirota system of PDEs. All the solutions in this class are of homogeneity degree 1 and are quotients of homogeneous polynomials. It is well-known that the solutions of the Hirota dispersionless systems describe Veronese webs. By nontriviality of the solutions it is meant that the corresponding Veronese webs are nonflat at generic points.</description>

      <title>Convergence to the equilibrium for the kinetic transport equation in the two-dimensional periodic Lorentz Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Boltzmann-Grad limit of the two-dimensional periodic Lorentz Gas. It has been proved in [6,14,4] that the time evolution of a probability density on $\mathbb{R}^2\times\mathbb{T}^1\ni(x,v)$ is obtained by extending the phase space $\mathbb{R}^2\times\mathbb{T}^1$ to $\mathbb{R}^2\times\mathbb{T}^1\times[0,+\infty)\times[-1,1]$, where $s\in[0,+\infty)$ represents the time to the next collision and $h\in[-1,1]$ the corresponding impact parameter. Here we prove that under suitable conditions the time evolution of an initial datum in $L^p(\mathbb{T}^2\times\mathbb{T}^1\times[0,+\infty)\times[-1,1])$ converges to the equilibrium state with respect to the $L^p$ norm ($^*$-weakly if $p=\infty$). If $p=2$, or if the initial datum does not depend on $x$, we also get more precise estimates about the rate of the approach to the equilibrium. Our proof is based on the analysis of the long time behavior of the Fourier coefficients of the solution.</description>

      <title>On the moduli space of multi-fractional instantons on the twisted $\mathbb T^4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The moduli space of self-dual $SU(N)$ Yang-Mills instantons on $\mathbb T^4$ of topological charge $Q = r/N$, $1 \leq r \leq N-1$, is of current interest, yet is not fully understood. In this paper, starting from 't Hooft's constant field strength ($F$) instantons, the only known exact solutions on $\mathbb T^4$, we explore the moduli space via analytical and lattice tools. These solutions are characterized by two positive integers $k, \ell$, $k+\ell=N$, and are self-dual for $\mathbb T^4$ sides $L_\mu$ tuned to $k L_1 L_2 = r \ell L_3 L_4$. For gcd$(k,r) = r$, we show, analytically and numerically (for $N = 3$) that the constant-$F$ solutions are the only self-dual solutions on the tuned $\mathbb T^4$, with $4r$ holonomy moduli. In contrast, when gcd$(k,r) \ne r$, we argue that the self-dual constant-$F$ solutions acquire, in addition to the $4\text{gcd}(k,r)$ holonomies, $4r - 4\text{gcd}(k,r)$ extra moduli, whose turning on makes the field strength nonabelian and non-constant. Thus, for gcd($k,r) \ne r$, 't Hooft's constant-$F$ solutions are a measure-zero subset of the moduli space on the tuned $\mathbb T^4$, a fact explaining a puzzle encountered in arXiv:2307.04795. We also show that, for $r = k = 2$, $N = 3$, the agreement between the approximate analytic solutions on the slightly detuned $\mathbb T^4$ and the $Q=2/3$ self-dual configurations obtained by minimizing the lattice action is remarkable.</description>

      <title>Tight bounds on depth-2 QAC-circuits computing parity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the parity of more than three non-target input bits cannot be computed by QAC-circuits of depth-2, not even uncleanly, regardless of the number of ancilla qubits. This result is incomparable with other recent lower bounds on constant-depth QAC-circuits by Rosenthal [ICTS~2021,arXiv:2008.07470] and uses different techniques which may be of independent interest:
  1. We show that all members of a certain class of multivariate polynomials are irreducible. The proof applies a technique of Shpilka &amp; Volkovich [STOC 2008]. 2. We give a tight-in-some-sense characterization of when a multiqubit CZ gate creates or removes entanglement from the state it is applied to.
  The current paper strengthens an earlier version of the paper [arXiv:2005.12169].</description>

      <title>Some Remarks on the Product Formula for Defect Numbers of Closed Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This largely pedagogical paper recalls some facts on defect numbers of products of closed operators employing results from the theory of semi-Fredholm operators and then applies these facts to positive integer powers of symmetric operators and subsequently to certain minimal Sturm--Liouville and minimal higher even-order ordinary and partial differential operators. We also point out some unexpected missed opportunities when comparing the work of different groups on this subject.</description>

      <title>One-Dimensional Relativistic Self-Gravitating Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the oldest problems in physics is that of calculating the motion of $N$ particles under a specified mutual force: the $N$-body problem. Much is known about this problem if the specified force is non-relativistic gravity, and considerable progress has been made by considering the problem in one spatial dimension. Here, I review what is known about the relativistic gravitational $N$-body problem. Reduction to one spatial dimension has the feature of the absence of gravitational radiation, thereby allowing for a clear comparison between the physics of one-dimensional relativistic and non-relativistic self-gravitating systems. After describing how to obtain a relativistic theory of gravity coupled to $N$ point particles, I discuss in turn the two-body, three-body, four-body, and $N$-body problems. Quite general exact solutions can be obtained for the two-body problem, unlike the situation in general relativity in three spatial dimensions for which only highly specified solutions exist. The three-body problem exhibits mild forms of chaos, and provides one of the first theoretical settings in which relativistic chaos can be studied. For $N\geq 4$, other interesting features emerge. Relativistic self-gravitating systems have a number of interesting problems awaiting further investigation, providing us with a new frontier for exploring relativistic many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Entropy Production in Non-Gaussian Active Matter: A Unified Fluctuation Theorem and Deep Learning Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a general framework for deriving entropy production rates in active matter systems driven by non-Gaussian active fluctuations. Employing the probability flow equivalence technique, we rigorously derive an entropy production decomposition formula and demonstrate that the entropy production, $\Delta s_\mathrm{tot}$, satisfies the integral fluctuation theorem $\langle \exp[ -\Delta s_\mathrm{tot} + B_\mathrm{act}] \rangle = 1$ and the generalized second law of thermodynamics $\langle \Delta s_\mathrm{tot}\rangle \geq\langle B_\mathrm{act}\rangle$, where $B_\mathrm{act}$ is a path-dependent random variable associated with the active fluctuations. Our result holds generally for arbitrary initial conditions, encompassing both steady-state and transient finite-time regimes. In the limiting case where active fluctuations are absent (i.e., $B_\mathrm{act} \equiv 0$), the theorem reduces to the well-established results in stochastic thermodynamics. Building on the theoretical foundation, we propose a deep learning-based methodology to efficiently compute the entropy production, utilizing the L\'{e}vy score function we proposed. To illustrate the validity of this approach, we apply it to two representative systems: a Brownian particle in a periodic active bath and an active polymer system consisting of an active Brownian particle cross-linker interacting with passive Brownian beads. Our results provide a unified framework for analyzing entropy production in active matter systems while offering practical computational tools for investigating complex nonequilibrium behaviors.</description>

      <title>On BPS Equations of Generalized $SU(2)$ Yang-Mills-Higgs Model with Scalars-Dependent Coupling $\theta$-term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a most general $SU(2)$ Yang-Mills-Higgs model consist of terms up to quadratic in first-derivative of the fields, that is the generalized $SU(2)$ Yang-Mills-Higgs with additional scalars-dependent coupling $\theta$-term. Using the BPS Lagrangian method we try to find Bogomolnyi's equations for BPS monopoles and dyons by taking most general BPS Lagrangian density. We obtain more general Bogomolnyi's equations and a relation between all scalars dependent couplings. Interestingly we find the value of $\theta$-term's coupling gives additional contribution to electric charge of BPS Dyons, and thus can determine whether we get BPS monopoles or BPS dyons.</description>

Abstract: We establish an isomorphism between two Frobenius algebra structures, termed CY and LG, on the primitive cohomology of a smooth Calabi--Yau hypersurface in a simplicial Gorenstein toric Fano variety. As an application of our comparison isomorphism, we observe the existence of a Frobenius manifold structure on a finite-dimensional subalgebra of the Jacobian algebra of a homogeneous polynomial which may exhibit a non-compact singularity locus.</description>

      <title>Quantum Field Theory on Multifractal Spacetime: Varying Dimension and Ultraviolet Completeness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by various quantum gravity approaches, we explore quantum field theory where spacetime exhibits scaling properties and dimensional reduction with changing energy scales, effectively behaving as a multifractal manifold. Working within canonical quantization, we demonstrate how to properly quantize fields in such multifractal spacetime. Our analysis reveals that a non-differentiable nature of spacetime is not merely compatible with quantum field theory but significantly enhances its mathematical foundation. Most notably, this approach guarantees the finiteness of the theory at all orders in perturbation theory and enables rigorous construction of the S-matrix in the interaction picture. The multifractal structure tames dominant, large-order divergence sources in the perturbative series and resolves the Landau pole problem through asymptotic safety, substantially improving the theory's behavior in the deep ultraviolet regime. Our formulation preserves all established predictions of standard quantum field theory at low energies while offering novel physical behaviors at high energy scales.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the convergence of spatial discretizations for reaction-diffusion systems with mass-action law satisfying a detailed balance condition. Considering systems on the d-dimensional torus, we construct appropriate space-discrete processes and show convergence not only on the level of solutions, but also on the level of the gradient systems governing the evolutions. As an important step, we prove chain rule inequalities for the reaction-diffusion systems as well as their discretizations, featuring a non-convex dissipation functional. The convergence is then obtained with variational methods by building on the recently introduced notion of gradient systems in continuity equation format.</description>

      <title>The Dirac Equation, Mass and Arithmetic by Permutations of Automaton States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cornerstones of the Cellular Automaton Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics are its underlying ontological states that evolve by permutations. They do not create would-be quantum mechanical superposition states. We review this with a classical automaton consisting of an Ising spin chain which is then related to the Weyl equation in the continuum limit. Based on this and generalizing, we construct a new ``Necklace of Necklaces'' automaton with a torus-like topology that lends itself to represent the Dirac equation in 1 + 1 dimensions. Special attention has to be paid to its mass term, which necessitates this enlarged structure and a particular scattering operator contributing to the step-wise updates of the automaton. As discussed earlier, such deterministic models of discrete spins or bits unavoidably become quantum mechanical, when only slightly deformed.</description>

Abstract: In the spirit of [M. Biskup &amp; O. Louidor, Adv. Math. 330 (2018)], we study the local structure of $\star$-scale invariant fields -- a class of log-correlated Gaussian fields -- around their extremal points by characterising the law of the "shape" of the field's configuration near such points. As a consequence, we obtain a refined understanding of the freezing phenomenon in supercritical Gaussian multiplicative chaos.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a tight-binding chain with dephasing noise on an infinite interval, we exactly calculate the variance of the integrated current for a step initial condition with average densities, $\rho_a$ on the negative axis and $\rho_b$ on the positive axis. Our exact solution reveals that the presence of dephasing, no matter how small, alters the nature of current fluctuations from ballistic to diffusive in the long-time limit. The derivation relies on the Bethe ansatz on the infinite interval and a nontrivial parameter dependence, referred to as the $\omega$-dependence, of the moment generating function for the integrated current. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the asymptotic form of the variance and a numerically obtained cumulant generating function coincide with those in the symmetric simple exclusion process.</description>

      <title>Bulk metric reconstruction from entanglement data via minimal surface area variations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the reconstruction of asymptotically anti-de Sitter (AdS) bulk geometries from boundary entanglement entropy data for ball-shaped entangling regions. By deriving an explicit inversion formula, we relate variations in entanglement entropy to deviations of the bulk metric about a fixed background. Applying this formula, we recover the Schwarzschild-AdS spacetime in the low-temperature regime to first order. We further extend our analysis to include deformations of the bulk geometry with nontrivial dependence on boundary directions, and propose an iterative reconstruction scheme aimed at recovering the full spacetime starting close to a conformal fixed point. We do this by building on recent advances in the mathematics of inverse problems by introducing the higher-order linearization method as a new tool in the context of holographic bulk reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Low Regularity of Self-Similar Solutions of Two-Dimensional Riemann problems with Shocks for the Isentropic Euler system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We are concerned with the low regularity of self-similar solutions of two-dimensional Riemann problems for the isentropic Euler system. We establish a general framework for the analysis of the local regularity of such solutions for a class of two-dimensional Riemann problems for the isentropic Euler system, which includes the regular shock reflection problem, the Prandtl reflection problem, the Lighthill diffraction problem, and the four-shock Riemann problem. We prove that it is not possible that both the density and the velocity are in $H^1$ in the subsonic domain for the self-similar solutions of these problems in general. This indicates that the self-similar solutions of the Riemann problems with shocks for the isentropic Euler system are of much more complicated structure than those for the Euler system for potential flow; in particular, the density and the velocity are not necessarily continuous in the subsonic domain. The proof is based on a regularization of the isentropic Euler system to derive the transport equation for the vorticity, a renormalization argument extended to the case of domains with boundary, and DiPerna-Lions-type commutator estimates.</description>

      <title>Wick rotation in the lapse, admissible complex metrics, and foliation changing diffeomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06047v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Wick rotation in the lapse (not in time) is introduced that interpolates between Riemannian and Lorentzian metrics on real manifolds admitting a codimension-one foliation. The definition refers to a fiducial foliation but covariance under foliation changing diffeomorphisms can be rendered explicit in a reformulation as a rank one perturbation. Applied to scalar field theories a Lorentzian signature action develops a positive imaginary part thereby identifying the underlying complex metric as ``admissible''. This admissibility is ensured in non-fiducial foliations in technically distinct ways also for the variation with respect to the metric and for the Hessian. The Hessian of the Wick rotated action is a complex combination of a generalized Laplacian and a d'Alembertian, which is shown to have spectrum contained in a wedge of the upper complex half plane. Specialized to near Minkowski space the induced propagator differs from the one with the Feynman $i\epsilon$ prescription and on Friedmann-Lema\^{i}tre backgrounds the difference to a Wick rotation in time is illustrated.</description>

Abstract: The fermionic von Neumann entropy, the fermionic entanglement entropy and the fermionic relative entropy are defined for causal fermion systems. Our definition makes use of entropy formulas for quasi-free fermionic states in terms of the reduced one-particle density operator. Our definitions are illustrated in various examples for Dirac spinors in two- and four-dimensional Minkowski space, in the Schwarzschild black hole geometry and for fermionic lattices. We review area laws for the two-dimensional diamond and a three-dimensional spatial region in Minkowski space. The connection is made to the computation of the relative entropy using modular theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00835v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motzkin chain is a model of nearest-neighbor interacting quantum $s=1$ spins with open boundary conditions. It is known that it has a unique ground state which can be viewed as a sum of Motzkin paths. We consider the case of periodic boundary conditions and provide several conjectures about structure of the ground state space and symmetries of the Hamiltonian. We conjecture that the ground state is degenerate and independent states distinguished by eigenvalues of the third component of total spin operator. Each of these states can be described as a sum of paths, similar to the Motzkin paths. Moreover, there exist two operators commuting with the Hamiltonian, which play the roles of lowering and raising operators when acting at these states. We conjecture also that these operators generate the Lie algebra of $C$-type of the rank equal to the number of sites. The symmetry algebra of the Hamiltonian is actually wider, and extended, besides the cyclic shift operator, by a central element contained in the third component of total spin operator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.10713v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A coinless quantisation procedure of general reversible Markov chains on graphs is presented. A quantum Hamiltonian H is obtained by a similarity transformation of the fundamental transition probability matrix K in terms of the square root of the reversible distribution. The evolution of the classical and quantum Markov chains is described by the solutions of the eigenvalue problem of the quantum Hamiltonian H. About twenty plus exactly solvable Markov chains based on the hypergeometric orthogonal polynomials of Askey scheme, derived by Odake-Sasaki, would provide a good window for scrutinising the quantum/classical contrast of Markov chains. Among them five explicit examples, related to the Krawtchouk, Hahn, q-Hahn, Charlier and Meixner, are demonstrated to illustrate the actual calculations.</description>

Abstract: In the paper an explicit formula for an arbitrary $6j$-symbol for finite-dimensional irreducible representations of the algebra $\mathfrak{gl}_3$ is derived. A $6j$-symbol is written as a result of substitution of $\pm 1$ into a series of hypergeometric type, which is similar to a $\Gamma$-series, which is a simplest example of a multivariate series of hypergeometric type. The selection rulers for a $6j$-symbol are derived.</description>

      <title>Sloshing in containers with vertical walls: isoperimetric inequalities for the fundamental eigenvalue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.13684v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One isoperimetric inequality for the fundamental sloshing eigenvalue is derived under the assumption that containers have vertical side walls and either finite or infinite depth. It asserts that among all such containers, whose free surfaces are convex, have two axes of symmetry and a given perimeter length, this eigenvalue is maximized by infinitely deep ones provided the free surface is either the square or the equilateral triangle. The proof is based on the recent isoperimetric result obtained by A. Henrot, A. Lemenant and I.~Lucardesi for the first nonzero eigenvalue of the two-dimensional Neumann Laplacian under the perimeter constraint.
  Another isoperimetric inequality for the fundamental eigenvalue, which describes sloshing in containers with vertical walls, is a consequence of the classical result due to G. Szeg\H o concerning the first nonzero eigenvalue of the free membrane problem.</description>

      <title>Computable and Faithful Lower Bound on Entanglement Cost</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10649v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantifying the minimum entanglement needed to prepare quantum states and implement quantum processes is a key challenge in quantum information theory. In this work, we develop computable and faithful lower bounds on the entanglement cost under quantum operations that completely preserve the positivity of partial transpose (PPT operations), by introducing logarithmic $k$-negativity, a generalization of logarithmic negativity. Our bounds are efficiently computable via semidefinite programming and provide non-trivial values for all states that are not PPT, establishing their faithfulness. Notably, we find and affirm the irreversibility of asymptotic entanglement manipulation under PPT operations for full-rank entangled states. Furthermore, we extend our methodology to derive lower bounds on the entanglement cost of both point-to-point and bipartite quantum channels. Our bound demonstrates improvements over previously known computable bounds for a wide range of states and channels. These findings push the boundaries of understanding the structure of entanglement and the fundamental limits of entanglement manipulation.</description>

Abstract: In this note we prove equicontinuity for the family of one-point densities with respect to a two-dimensional Coulomb gas at an inverse temperature $\beta\ge 1/2$ confined by an external potential of Hele-Shaw (or quasi-harmonic) type. As a consequence, subsequential limiting Lipschitz continuous densities are defined on the microscopic scale. There are several additional results, for example comparing the one-point density with the thermal equilibrium density.</description>

      <title>Flux-balance laws for spinning bodies under the gravitational self-force</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10343v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The motion of an extended, but still weakly gravitating body in general relativity can often be determined by a set of conserved quantities. Much like for geodesic motion, a sufficient number of conserved quantities allows the motion to be solved by quadrature. Under the gravitational self-force (relaxing the "weakly gravitating" assumption), the motion can then be described in terms of the evolution these "conserved quantities". This evolution can be calculated using the (local) self-force on the body, but such an approach is computationally intensive. To avoid this, one often uses flux-balance laws: relationships between the average evolution (capturing the dissipative dynamics) and the values of the field far away from the body, which are far easier to compute. In the absence of spin, such a flux-balance law has been proven in [Isoyama et al., 2019] for any of the conserved action variables appearing in a Hamiltonian formulation of geodesic motion in the Kerr spacetime. In this paper, we derive a corresponding flux-balance law, to linear order in spin, directly relating average rates of change to the flux of a conserved current through the horizon and out to infinity. In the absence of spin, this reproduces results consistent with those in [Isoyama et al., 2019]. To linear order in spin, we construct flux-balance laws for four of the five constants of motion for spinning bodies in the Kerr spacetime, although not in a practical form. However, this result provides a promising path towards deriving the flux-balance law for the (generalized) Carter constant.</description>

      <title>A mechanism to generate varying speed of light via Higgs-dilaton coupling: Theory and cosmological applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02583v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We allow the Higgs field $\Phi$ to interact with a dilaton field $\chi$ of the background spacetime via the coupling $\chi^2\,\Phi^\dagger\Phi$. Upon spontaneous gauge symmetry breaking, the Higgs VEV becomes proportional to $\chi$. While traditionally this linkage is employed to make the Planck mass and particle masses dependent on $\chi$, we present an $\textit alternative$ mechanism: the Higgs VEV will be used to construct Planck's constant $\hbar$ and speed of light $c$. Specifically, each open set vicinity of a given point $x^*$ on the spacetime manifold is equipped with a replica of the Glashow-Weinberg-Salam action operating with its own effective values of $\hbar_*$ and $c_*$ per $\hbar_*\propto\chi^{-1/2}(x^*)$ and $c_*\propto\chi^{1/2}(x^*)$, causing these ``fundamental constants'' to vary alongside the dynamical field $\chi$. Moreover, in each open set around $x^*$, the prevailing value $\chi(x^*)$ determines the length and time scales for physical processes occurring in this region as $l\propto\chi^{-1}(x^*)$ and $\tau\propto\chi^{-3/2}(x^*)$. This leads to an $\textit anisotropic$ relation $\tau^{-1}\propto l^{-3/2}$ between the rate of clocks and the length of rods, resulting in a distinct set of novel physical phenomena. For late-time cosmology, the variation of $c$ along the trajectory of light waves from distant supernovae towards the Earth-based observer necessitates modifications to the Lema\^itre redshift relation and the Hubble law. These modifications are capable of: (1) Accounting for the Pantheon Catalog of SNeIa $\textit{through a declining speed of light in an expanding Einstein--de Sitter universe}$, thus avoiding the need for dark energy; (2) Revitalizing Blanchard-Douspis-Rowan-Robinson-Sarkar's CMB power spectrum analysis that bypassed dark energy [A&amp;A 412, 35 (2003)]; and (3) Resolving the $H_0$ tension without requiring a dynamical dark energy component.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the Casimir effect for parallel plates within the framework of Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz theory in $3+1$ dimensions, considering the effects of roughness, anisotropic scaling factor, and an uniform constant magnetic field. Quantum fluctuations are induced by an anisotropic charged-scalar quantum field subject to Dirichlet boundary conditions. To incorporate surface roughness, we apply a coordinate transformation to flatten the plates, treating the remaining roughness terms as potential. The spectrum is derived using perturbation theory and regularized with the $\zeta$-function method. As an illustrative example, we consider plates with periodic boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Black hole with global monopole charge in self-interacting Kalb-Ramond field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09899v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we explore a static, spherically symmetric black hole solution in the context of a self-interacting Kalb-Ramond field coupled with a global monopole. By incorporating the effects of Lorentz-violating term $\ell$ and the monopole charge $\eta$ in the KR field, we derive the modified gravitational field equations and analyze the resulting black hole spacetime. The obtained solution exhibits deviations from the Schwarzschild metric with topological defect, as it is influenced by the monopole charge and self-interaction potential. We investigate the thermodynamic properties of the black hole, including its Hawking temperature, entropy, and specific heat, revealing novel stability conditions. Additionally, we perform solar system tests such as perihelion precession, gravitational redshift, light deflection, and time delay of signals to impose constraints on the Lorentz-violating parameter and monopole charge. Our findings suggest that these parameters have to be significantly small, although there are different constraints imposed by individual tests, ranging from $10^{-9}\leq|\ell|\leq 10^{-4}$ and $10^{-9}\leq\eta\leq 10^{-6}\, \mathrm{m}^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>A quadratic BSDE approach to normalization for the finite volume 2D sine-Gordon model in the finite ultraviolet regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12172v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to a new construction of the two-dimensional sine-Gordon model on bounded domains by a novel normalization technique in the finite ultraviolet regime. Our methodology involves a family of backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs for short) driven by a cylindrical Wiener process, whose generators are purely quadratic functions of the second unknown variable. The terminal conditions of the quadratic BSDEs are uniformly bounded and converge in probability to the real part of imaginary multiplicative chaos tested against an arbitrarily given test function, which helps us describe our sine-Gordon measure through some delicate estimates concerning bounded mean oscillation martingales. As the ultraviolet cutoffs are vanishing, the quadratic BSDEs converge to a quadratic BSDE that completely characterizes the absolute continuity of our sine-Gordon measure with respect to the law of Gaussian free fields. Our approach can also be used effectively to establish the connection between our sine-Gordon measure and the scaling limit of correlation functions of the critical planar XOR-Ising model and to prove the weak convergence of the normalized charge distributions of two-dimensional log-gases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13221v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove Gamma conjecture I for any flag varieties by following a strategy proposed by Galkin and Iritani. The main ingredient is to prove that the $\widehat{\Gamma}$-class of a flag variety is mirror to the totally positive part of the corresponding Rietsch mirror.</description>

      <title>Strichartz estimates for orthonormal systems on compact manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08504v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish new Strichartz estimates for orthonormal systems on compact Riemannian manifolds in the case of wave, Klein-Gordon and fractional Schr\"odinger equations. Our results generalize the classical (single-function) Strichartz estimates on compact manifolds by Kapitanski, Burq-G\'erard-Tzvetkov, Dinh, and extend the Euclidean orthonormal version by Frank-Lewin-Lieb-Seiringer, Frank-Sabin, Bez-Lee-Nakamura. On the flat torus, our new results for the Schr\"odinger equation cover prior work of Nakamura, which exploits the dispersive estimate of Kenig-Ponce-Vega. We achieve sharp results on compact manifolds by combining the frequency localized dispersive estimates for small time intervals with the duality principle due to Frank-Sabin. We construct examples to show these results can be saturated on the sphere, and we can improve them on the flat torus by establishing new decoupling inequalities for certain non-smooth hypersurfaces. As an application, we obtain the well-posedness of infinite systems of dispersive equations with Hartree-type nonlinearity.</description>

      <title>Packaged Quantum States and Symmetry: A Group-Theoretic Approach to Gauge-Invariant Packaged Entanglements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20295v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A packaged quantum state refers to a quantum state that includes an inseparable block of internal quantum numbers. These types of quantum states are the result of gauge invariance and superselection, and therefore have particular symmetric structures. Here we show that, in multiparticle quantum systems, any nontrivial representation of a finite or compact group inherently induces packaged entanglement that inseparably entangles every internal quantum number (IQN). 
In this theory, every single-particle excitation carries an inseparable IQN block controlled by the irreducible representation of the group. The local gauge constraints or superselection rules forbid the occurrence of any partial charges or partial IQN entanglement. We demonstrate this principle using various specific symmetries, such as gauge symmetries ($U(1)$, $SU(2)$, and $SU(3)$), discrete symmetries (charge conjugation $C$, parity $P$, time reversal $T$, and their combinations), and $p$-form symmetries. In each case, gauge invariance and superselection rules ensure that the resulting quantum states cannot be factorized. We then used these ideas to explain phenomena like Bell-type structures, color confinement, and hybrid gauge-invariant configurations. The packaging principle connects concepts from gauge theory, topological classifications, and quantum information. These results may be useful for applications in exotic hadron spectroscopy, extended symmetries in quantum field theory, and quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>On the open TS/ST correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21762v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The topological string/spectral theory correspondence establishes a precise, non-perturbative duality between topological strings on local Calabi-Yau threefolds and the spectral theory of quantized mirror curves. While this duality has been rigorously formulated for the closed topological string sector, the open string sector remains less understood. Building on the results of [1-3], we make further progress in this direction by constructing entire, off-shell eigenfunctions for the quantized mirror curve from open topological string partition functions. We focus on local $\mathbb{F}_0$, whose mirror curve corresponds to the Baxter equation of the two-particle, relativistic Toda lattice. We then study the standard and dual four-dimensional limits, where the quantum mirror curve for local $\mathbb{F}_0$ degenerates into the modified Mathieu and McCoy-Tracy-Wu operators, respectively. In these limits, our framework provides a way to construct entire, off-shell eigenfunctions for the difference equations associated with these operators. Furthermore, we find a simple relation between the on-shell eigenfunctions of the modified Mathieu and McCoy-Tracy-Wu operators, leading to a functional relation between the operators themselves.</description>
