      <title>Superconducting Diode Effect in Two-dimensional Topological Insulator Edges and Josephson Junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The superconducting diode effect -- the dependence of critical current on its direction -- can arise from the simultaneous breaking of inversion and time-reversal symmetry in a superconductor and has gained interest for its potential applications in superconducting electronics. In this letter, we study the effect in a two-dimensional topological insulator (2D TI) in both a uniform geometry as well as in a long Josephson junction. We show that in the presence of Zeeman fields, a circulating edge current enables a large non-reciprocity of the critical current. We find a maximum diode efficiency 1 for the uniform 2D TI and $(\sqrt{2} - 1)^2 \approx 0.17$ for the long Josephson junction.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous rotation of magnets levitating above high-Tc superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The levitation of a cylindrical permanent magnet over a high-temperature superconductor cooled by liquid nitrogen can be accompanied by spontaneous oscillations and rotation. The reason for spontaneous rotation of the magnet is magnetization inhomogeneity induced by the temperature gradient. An experiment was carried out on the levitation of Nd-Fe-B magnets over a composite high-temperature superconductor. The experimental results confirm that the rotation frequency depends on the difference in the magnetization values in the upper and lower halves of the magnet. Methods for controlling the rotation frequency of a levitating magnet are proposed.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity at 9 K in Pb-Bi Alloy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work, we report the synthesis of Pb-Bi alloy with enhanced Tc up to 9K, which is higher than that of Pb. The alloy is synthesized via solid state reaction route in vacuum encapsulated quartz tube at 700C in an automated furnace. The synthesized sample is characterized by X-ray Diffraction for its phase purity. Rietveld refinement of XRD reveals that the end product is majority hexagonal Pb7Bi3, with minor rhombohedral Bi. The electronic transport measurement shows metallic behavior with the Debye temperature of 108K and a superconductivity transition temperature (Tc) at below 9K, which is maximum till date for any reported Pb-Bi alloy, Pb or Bi at ambient pressure . It is possible that partial substitution of Bi at the Pb site, modifies the free density of electronic states within BCS model to attain the optimum Tc, which is higher by around 2K from the reported Tc of Pb. The superconductor phase diagram derived from magneto-transport measurements reveals that the synthesized alloy is a conventional superconductor with upper critical field (Hc) of 3.9Tesla, which lies well within the Pauli paramagnetic limit.</description>

      <title>Pressure-dependent electronic superlattice in the Kagome-superconductor CsV$\mathrm{_3}$Sb$\mathrm{_5}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a high-resolution single crystal x-ray diffraction study of Kagome superconductor \cvs, exploring its response to variations in pressure and temperature. We discover that at low temperatures, the structural modulations of the electronic superlattice, commonly associated with charge density wave order, undergo a transformation around $p \sim$ 0.7 GPa from the familiar $2\times2$ pattern to a long-range ordered modulation at wavevector $q=(0, 3/8, 1/2)$. Our observations align with inferred changes in the CDW pattern from prior transport and nuclear magnetic resonance studies, providing new insights into these transitions. Interestingly, the pressure-induced variations in the electronic superlattice correlate with two peaks in the superconducting transition temperature as pressure changes, hinting that fluctuations within the electronic superlattice could be key to stabilizing superconductivity. However, our findings contrast with the minimal pressure dependency anticipated by ab initio calculations of the electronic structure. They also challenge prevailing scenarios based on a Peierls-like nesting mechanism involving van Hove singularities.</description>

      <title>Initialization of Majorana qubits by parity-to-magnetism conversion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Initializing the ground state of a quantum bit (qubit) based on Majorana zero modes is one of the most pressing issues for future topological quantum computers. We explore a parity-to-magnetism protocol for initializing such topological qubits based on magnet-superconductor hybrid networks by coupling magnetic chains to a single molecule magnet. The coupling can be activated by switching the spin state of the molecule, allowing the ground state parity of the chain to be controlled. We demonstrate that initialization with either parity for a Majorana qubit can be achieved. We then introduce the dressed Majorana qubit, which includes the state of the molecule in the definition of the logical qubit. Using this definition we can initialize a qubit without high-precision timing.</description>

Abstract: Majorana bound states emerge in topological superconductors as zero-energy edge states exhibiting spatial nonlocality. Despite the enormous advances, the detection of Majorana bound states is still challenging mainly because topologically trivial Andreev bound states produce similar signatures. In this work we consider a topological superconductor with Majorana bound states coupled to quantum dots and investigate the dynamics of their quantum correlations with the aim to explore their entanglement properties. In particular, we characterize entanglement by using concurrence and discord, which are also complemented by the entanglement dynamics and return probability. We find that Majorana bound states at truly zero energy can transform an initially entangled system into its classical state, while they can create maximally entangled states at a finite energy overlap. Interestingly, we show that the system can generate a maximally entangled state between MBSs and a quantum dot by simply controlling the Majorana nonlocality. We demonstrate that these results hold in the scenarios when the initial state is either maximally entangled or separable, albeit in the latter maximally entangled states are achieved in the long time dynamics. Furthermore, we contrast our findings with those produced by a regular fermion and obtain very distinct entanglement signatures. Our work offers an alternative approach to characterize Majorana bound states, which can be also useful towards their utilization for quantum information tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum interactions exchanging different types of particles play a pivotal r\^{o}le in quantum many-body theory, but they are not sufficiently investigated from a mathematical perspective. Here, we consider a system made of two fermions and one boson, in order to study the effect of such an off-diagonal interaction term, having in mind the physics of cuprate superconductors. Additionally, our model also includes a generalized Hubbard interaction (i.e., a general local repulsion term for the fermions). Regarding pairing, exponentially localized dressed bound fermion pairs are shown to exist and their effective dispersion relation is studied in detail. Scattering properties of the system are derived for two channels: the unbound and bound pair channels. We give particular attention to the regime of very large on-site (Hubbard) repulsions, because this situation is relevant for cuprate superconductors.</description>

Abstract: We report muon spin rotation (muSR) measurements of the temperature dependence of the absolute value of the magnetic penetration depth and the magnetic field dependence of the vortex core size in the mixed state of the non-symmorphic superconductor LaNiGa2. The temperature dependence of the normalized superfluid density is shown to be well described by a two-band model with strong interband coupling. Consistent with a strong coupling of the superconducting condensates in two different bands, we show that the field dependence of the vortex core size resembles that of a single-band superconductor. Our results lend support to the proposal that LaNiGa2 is a fully-gapped, internally antisymmetric nonunitary spin-triplet superconductor.</description>

      <title>Molecular Pairing in Twisted Bilayer Graphene Superconductivity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00869v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a theory for how the weak phonon-mediated interaction ($J_{\rm A}\!=\!1\!\sim\!4$meV) wins over the prohibitive Coulomb repulsion ($U\!=\!30\!\sim\!60$meV) and leads to a nematic superconductor in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG). We find the pairing mechanism akin to that in the A$_3$C$_{60}$ family of molecular superconductors: Each AA stacking region of MATBG resembles a C$_{60}$ molecule, in that optical phonons can dynamically lift the degeneracy of the moir\'e orbitals, in analogy to the dynamical Jahn-Teller effect. Such induced $J_{\rm A}$ has the form of an inter-valley anti-Hund's coupling and is less suppressed than $U$ by the Kondo screening near a Mott insulator. Additionally, we also considered an intra-orbital Hund's coupling $J_{\rm H}$ that originates from the on-site repulsion of a carbon atom. Under a reasonable approximation of the realistic model, we prove that the renormalized local interaction between quasi-particles must have a pairing (negative) channel in a doped correlated insulator at $\nu=\pm(2+\delta\nu)$, albeit the bare interaction is positive definite. The proof is non-perturbative and based on $exact$ asymptotic behaviors of the vertex function imposed by Ward identities. Existence of an optimal $U$ for superconductivity is predicted. We also analyzed the pairing symmetry. In a large area of the parameter space of $J_{\rm A}$, $J_{\rm H}$, the ground state has a nematic $d$-wave singlet pairing, which, however, can lead to a $p$-wave-like nodal structure due to the Berry's phase on Fermi surfaces (or Euler obstruction). A fully gapped $s$-wave pairing is also possible but spans a smaller phase space in the phase diagram.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in Two-Dimensional Systems with Unconventional Rashba Bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05051v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In two-dimensional system with Rashba spin-orbit coupling, it is well-known that superconductivity can have mixed spin-singlet and -triplet parity, and the $\boldsymbol{d}$-vector of spin-triplet pairing is parallel to $\boldsymbol{g}$-vector of Rashba spin-orbit coupling. Here, we propose a model to describe a two-dimensional system with unconventional Rashba bands and study its superconductivity. We show that the $\boldsymbol{d}$-vector of spin-triplet pairing can be either parallel or perpendicular to $\boldsymbol{g}$-vector of Rashba spin-orbit coupling depending on the different pairing interaction. We also propose a junction to generate tunneling current depending on the direction of $\boldsymbol{d}$-vector. It provides a detectable evidence to distinguish these two different but very similar pairing channels. Furthermore, we find this model can give arise to a subleading spin-singlet chiral $p$-wave topological superconducting state. More significantly, we find that such unconventional Rashba bands and unconventional superconudcting pairings can be realized on surface of some superconducting topological materials, such as trigonal layered PtBi$_{2}$.</description>

Abstract: We consider electron pairing in a two-dimensional thermally disordered itinerant anti-ferromagnet. It is shown that transverse spin fluctuations in such a state can give rise to superconductivity with a sizeable critical temperature $T_c$. Below $T_c$ there is quasi-long-range spin-singlet and $d_{x^2-y^2}$ superconducting order, together with fluctuating triplet order at momentum $(\pi,\pi)$. The singlet pairs we find are tightly bound together, and the pair wavefunction has a purely inter-sublattice structure due to the U(1) spin rotation symmetry of the anti-ferromagnet.</description>

      <title>A numerical approach to levitated superconductors and its application to a superconducting cylinder in a quadrupole field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11342v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetically levitated superconductors in the Meissner state can be utilized as micro-mechanical oscillators with large mass, high quality factors and long coherence times. In previous works analytical solutions for the magnetic field distribution around a superconducting sphere in a quadrupole field have been found and used to derive the trap parameters, while non-spherical geometries have only been investigated in a few idealized cases. However, superconductors of almost arbitrary shape can be used as levitators in a magnetic trap and, as the trap's properties depend strongly on the superconductors shape, allow for a wider parameter regime to be accessed. Finite element models are suitable to obtain the field distribution around arbitrarily shaped superconductors in arbitrary fields, but have not yet been used widely in the context of levitated superconductors. Here we present a simple numerical model for this purpose and use it to calculate the field distribution around cylindrical superconductors in a quadrupole field and to evaluate the trap parameters. We find that the cylindrical shape, compared to spherical levitators, allows for substantially higher trap frequencies and coupling strengths. This in turn reduces the demands on vibration isolation and significantly eases the requirements for feedback cooling to the ground state. The numerical model is provided as supplemental material and can easily be adapted to various geometries and trap fields.</description>

      <title>Evidence for $\pi$-shifted Cooper quartets and few-mode transport in PbTe nanowire three-terminal Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17703v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Josephson junctions are typically characterized by a single phase difference across two superconductors. This conventional two-terminal Josephson junction can be generalized to a multi-terminal device where the Josephson energy contains terms with contributions from multiple independent phase variables. Such multi-terminal Josephson junctions (MTJJs) are being considered as platforms for engineering effective Hamiltonians with non-trivial topologies, such as Weyl crossings and higher-order Chern numbers. This approach offers unique possibilities that are complementary to phenomena attainable in bulk crystals, including topological states in more than three dimensions and real-time gate-tunability of the Hamiltonians. However, these prospects rely on the ability to create MTJJs with non-classical multi-terminal couplings in which only a handful of quantum modes are populated. Here, we demonstrate these requirements by using a three-terminal Josephson junction fabricated on selective-area-grown (SAG) PbTe nanowires. We observe signatures of a $\pi$-shifted Josephson effect, consistent with inter-terminal couplings mediated by four-particle quantum states called Cooper quartets. We further observe supercurrent co-existent with a non-monotonic evolution of the conductance with gate voltage, indicating transport mediated by a few quantum modes in both two- and three-terminal devices. These results establish a platform for investigations of topological Hamiltonians based on Andreev bound states.</description>

      <title>Stable non-Fermi liquid fixed point at the onset of incommensurate $2k_F$ charge density wave order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02322v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the emergence of a non-Fermi liquid fixed point in two-dimensional metals at the onset of a quantum phase transition from a Fermi liquid state to an incommensurate charge density wave (CDW) ordered phase. The momentum of the CDW boson is centred at the wavevector $ \boldsymbol{ \mathcal Q} $, which connects a single pair of antipodal points on the Fermi surface with antiparallel tangent vectors. We employ the dimensional regularization technique in which the co-dimension of the Fermi surface is extended to a generic value, while keeping the dimension of Fermi surface itself fixed at one. Although the system is strongly coupled at dimension $d=2$, the interactions become marginal at the upper critical dimension $d=d_c$, whose value is found to be $ 5/2$. Using a controlled perturbative expansion in the parameter $\epsilon = d_c - d $, we compute the critical exponents of the stable infrared fixed point characterizing the quantum critical point. The scalings of the original theory are determined by setting $\epsilon =1/2$, where the fermion self-energy is seen to scale with the frequency with a fractional power law of $2/3$, which is the undisputed signature of a typical non-Fermi liquid phase.</description>

Abstract: We theoretically explore the possibility of realizing the symmetry-protected topological Haldane phase of spin-1 chains in a tunable hybrid platform of superconducting islands (SIs) and quantum dots (QDs). Inspired by recent findings suggesting that an appropriately tuned QD-SI-QD block may behave as a robust spin-1 unit, we study the behavior of many such units tunnel-coupled into linear chains. Our efficient and fully microscopic modeling of long chains with several tens of units is enabled by the use of the surrogate model solver [Phys. Rev. B 108, L220506 (2023); arXiv:2402.18357]. Our numerical findings indicate that the QD-SI-QD chains exhibit emblematic features of the Haldane phase, such as fractional spin-1/2 edge states and non-vanishing string order parameters, and that these persist over a sizeable region of parameter space.</description>
