      <title>Outlyingness Scores with Cluster Catch Digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces two novel, outlyingness scores (OSs) based on Cluster Catch Digraphs (CCDs): Outbound Outlyingness Score (OOS) and Inbound Outlyingness Score (IOS). These scores enhance the interpretability of outlier detection results. Both OSs employ graph-, density-, and distribution-based techniques, tailored to high-dimensional data with varying cluster shapes and intensities. OOS evaluates the outlyingness of a point relative to its nearest neighbors, while IOS assesses the total ``influence" a point receives from others within its cluster. Both OSs effectively identify global and local outliers, invariant to data collinearity. Moreover, IOS is robust to the masking problems. With extensive Monte Carlo simulations, we compare the performance of both OSs with CCD-based, traditional, and state-of-the-art outlier detection methods. Both OSs exhibit substantial overall improvements over the CCD-based methods in both artificial and real-world data sets, particularly with IOS, which delivers the best overall performance among all the methods, especially in high-dimensional settings.
  Keywords: Outlier detection, Outlyingness score, Graph-based clustering, Cluster catch digraphs, High-dimensional data.</description>

      <title>Covariate Dependent Mixture of Bayesian Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning the structure of Bayesian networks from data provides insights into underlying processes and the causal relationships that generate the data, but its usefulness depends on the homogeneity of the data population, a condition often violated in real-world applications. In such cases, using a single network structure for inference can be misleading, as it may not capture sub-population differences. To address this, we propose a novel approach of modelling a mixture of Bayesian networks where component probabilities depend on individual characteristics. Our method identifies both network structures and demographic predictors of sub-population membership, aiding personalised interventions. We evaluate our method through simulations and a youth mental health case study, demonstrating its potential to improve tailored interventions in health, education, and social policy.</description>

      <title>Analog Bayesian neural networks are insensitive to the shape of the weight distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated that Bayesian neural networks (BNN's) trained with mean field variational inference (MFVI) can be implemented in analog hardware, promising orders of magnitude energy savings compared to the standard digital implementations. However, while Gaussians are typically used as the variational distribution in MFVI, it is difficult to precisely control the shape of the noise distributions produced by sampling analog devices. This paper introduces a method for MFVI training using real device noise as the variational distribution. Furthermore, we demonstrate empirically that the predictive distributions from BNN's with the same weight means and variances converge to the same distribution, regardless of the shape of the variational distribution. This result suggests that analog device designers do not need to consider the shape of the device noise distribution when hardware-implementing BNNs performing MFVI.</description>

      <title>rmlnomogram: An R package to construct an explainable nomogram for any machine learning algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background: Current nomogram can only be created for regression algorithm. Providing nomogram for any machine learning (ML) algorithms may accelerate model deployment in clinical settings or improve model availability. We developed an R package and web application to construct nomogram with model explainability of any ML algorithms. Methods: We formulated a function to transform an ML prediction model into a nomogram, requiring datasets with: (1) all possible combinations of predictor values; (2) the corresponding outputs of the model; and (3) the corresponding explainability values for each predictor (optional). Web application was also created. Results: Our R package could create 5 types of nomograms for categorical predictors and binary outcome without probability (1), categorical predictors and binary outcome with probability (2) or continuous outcome (3), and categorical with single numerical predictors and binary outcome with probability (4) or continuous outcome (5). Respectively, the first and remaining types optimally allowed maximum 15 and 5 predictors with maximum 3,200 combinations. Web application is provided with such limits. The explainability values were possible for types 2 to 5. Conclusions: Our R package and web application could construct nomogram with model explainability of any ML algorithms using a fair number of predictors.</description>

      <title>Random Sparse Lifts: Construction, Analysis and Convergence of finite sparse networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a framework to define a large class of neural networks for which, by construction, training by gradient flow provably reaches arbitrarily low loss when the number of parameters grows. Distinct from the fixed-space global optimality of non-convex optimization, this new form of convergence, and the techniques introduced to prove such convergence, pave the way for a usable deep learning convergence theory in the near future, without overparameterization assumptions relating the number of parameters and training samples. We define these architectures from a simple computation graph and a mechanism to lift it, thus increasing the number of parameters, generalizing the idea of increasing the widths of multi-layer perceptrons. We show that architectures similar to most common deep learning models are present in this class, obtained by sparsifying the weight tensors of usual architectures at initialization. Leveraging tools of algebraic topology and random graph theory, we use the computation graph's geometry to propagate properties guaranteeing convergence to any precision for these large sparse models.</description>

      <title>From discrete-time policies to continuous-time diffusion samplers: Asymptotic equivalences and faster training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of training neural stochastic differential equations, or diffusion models, to sample from a Boltzmann distribution without access to target samples. Existing methods for training such models enforce time-reversal of the generative and noising processes, using either differentiable simulation or off-policy reinforcement learning (RL). We prove equivalences between families of objectives in the limit of infinitesimal discretization steps, linking entropic RL methods (GFlowNets) with continuous-time objects (partial differential equations and path space measures). We further show that an appropriate choice of coarse time discretization during training allows greatly improved sample efficiency and the use of time-local objectives, achieving competitive performance on standard sampling benchmarks with reduced computational cost.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Error Analysis of Entropy Approximation for Gaussian Mixture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.13059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.13059v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gaussian mixture distributions are commonly employed to represent general probability distributions. Despite the importance of using Gaussian mixtures for uncertainty estimation, the entropy of a Gaussian mixture cannot be calculated analytically. In this paper, we study the approximate entropy represented as the sum of the entropies of unimodal Gaussian distributions with mixing coefficients. This approximation is easy to calculate analytically regardless of dimension, but there is a lack of theoretical guarantees. We theoretically analyze the approximation error between the true and the approximate entropy to reveal when this approximation works effectively. This error is essentially controlled by how far apart each Gaussian component of the Gaussian mixture is. To measure such separation, we introduce the ratios of the distances between the means to the sum of the variances of each Gaussian component of the Gaussian mixture, and we reveal that the error converges to zero as the ratios tend to infinity. In addition, the probabilistic estimate indicates that this convergence situation is more likely to occur in higher-dimensional spaces. Therefore, our results provide a guarantee that this approximation works well for high-dimensional problems, such as neural networks that involve a large number of parameters.</description>

      <title>Function-Space Optimality of Neural Architectures with Multivariate Nonlinearities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.03696v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the function-space optimality (specifically, the Banach-space optimality) of a large class of shallow neural architectures with multivariate nonlinearities/activation functions. To that end, we construct a new family of Banach spaces defined via a regularization operator, the $k$-plane transform, and a sparsity-promoting norm. We prove a representer theorem that states that the solution sets to learning problems posed over these Banach spaces are completely characterized by neural architectures with multivariate nonlinearities. These optimal architectures have skip connections and are tightly connected to orthogonal weight normalization and multi-index models, both of which have received recent interest in the neural network community. Our framework is compatible with a number of classical nonlinearities including the rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation function, the norm activation function, and the radial basis functions found in the theory of thin-plate/polyharmonic splines. We also show that the underlying spaces are special instances of reproducing kernel Banach spaces and variation spaces. Our results shed light on the regularity of functions learned by neural networks trained on data, particularly with multivariate nonlinearities, and provide new theoretical motivation for several architectural choices found in practice.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Joint Additive Factor Models for Multiview Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00778v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is increasingly common in a wide variety of applied settings to collect data of multiple different types on the same set of samples. Our particular focus in this article is on studying relationships between such multiview features and responses. A motivating application arises in the context of precision medicine where multi-omics data are collected to correlate with clinical outcomes. It is of interest to infer dependence within and across views while combining multimodal information to improve the prediction of outcomes. The signal-to-noise ratio can vary substantially across views, motivating more nuanced statistical tools beyond standard late and early fusion. This challenge comes with the need to preserve interpretability, select features, and obtain accurate uncertainty quantification. We propose a joint additive factor regression model (JAFAR) with a structured additive design, accounting for shared and view-specific components. We ensure identifiability via a novel dependent cumulative shrinkage process (D-CUSP) prior. We provide an efficient implementation via a partially collapsed Gibbs sampler and extend our approach to allow flexible feature and outcome distributions. Prediction of time-to-labor onset from immunome, metabolome, and proteome data illustrates performance gains against state-of-the-art competitors. Our open-source software (R package) is available at https://github.com/niccoloanceschi/jafar.</description>

      <title>Wait-Less Offline Tuning and Re-solving for Online Decision Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09594v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Online linear programming (OLP) has found broad applications in revenue management and resource allocation. State-of-the-art OLP algorithms achieve low regret by repeatedly solving linear programming (LP) subproblems that incorporate updated resource information. However, LP-based methods are computationally expensive and often inefficient for large-scale applications. In contrast, recent first-order OLP algorithms are more computationally efficient but typically suffer from worse regret guarantees. To address these shortcomings, we propose a new algorithm that combines the strengths of LP-based and first-order OLP methods. The algorithm re-solves the LP subproblems periodically at a predefined frequency $f$ and uses the latest dual prices to guide online decision-making. In addition, a first-order method runs in parallel during each interval between LP re-solves, smoothing resource consumption. Our algorithm achieves $\mathscr{O}(\log (T/f) + \sqrt{f})$ regret, delivering a "wait-less" online decision-making process that balances the computational efficiency of first-order methods and the superior regret guarantee of LP-based methods.</description>

      <title>Naive Feature Selection: a Nearly Tight Convex Relaxation for Sparse Naive Bayes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.09884</link>
      <description>arXiv:1905.09884v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to its linear complexity, naive Bayes classification remains an attractive supervised learning method, especially in very large-scale settings. We propose a sparse version of naive Bayes, which can be used for feature selection. This leads to a combinatorial maximum-likelihood problem, for which we provide an exact solution in the case of binary data, or a bound in the multinomial case. We prove that our convex relaxation bounds becomes tight as the marginal contribution of additional features decreases, using a priori duality gap bounds dervied from the Shapley-Folkman theorem. We show how to produce primal solutions satisfying these bounds. Both binary and multinomial sparse models are solvable in time almost linear in problem size, representing a very small extra relative cost compared to the classical naive Bayes. Numerical experiments on text data show that the naive Bayes feature selection method is as statistically effective as state-of-the-art feature selection methods such as recursive feature elimination, $l_1$-penalized logistic regression and LASSO, while being orders of magnitude faster.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08999v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the proliferation of increasingly complicated Deep Learning architectures, data synthesis is a highly promising technique to address the demand of data-hungry models. However, reliably assessing the quality of a 'synthesiser' model's output is an open research question with significant associated risks for high-stake domains. To address this challenge, we propose a unique synthesis algorithm that generates data from high-confidence feature space regions based on the Conformal Prediction framework. We support our proposed algorithm with a comprehensive exploration of the core parameter's influence, an in-depth discussion of practical advice, and an extensive empirical evaluation of five benchmark datasets. To show our approach's versatility on ubiquitous real-world challenges, the datasets were carefully selected for their variety of difficult characteristics: low sample count, class imbalance, and non-separability. In all trials, training sets extended with our confident synthesised data performed at least as well as the original set and frequently significantly improved Deep Learning performance by up to 61 percentage points F1-score.</description>

      <title>Robust Point Matching with Distance Profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12641v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show the outlier robustness and noise stability of practical matching procedures based on distance profiles. Although the idea of matching points based on invariants like distance profiles has a long history in the literature, there has been little understanding of the theoretical properties of such procedures, especially in the presence of outliers and noise. We provide a theoretical analysis showing that under certain probabilistic settings, the proposed matching procedure is successful with high probability even in the presence of outliers and noise. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed method using a real data example and provide simulation studies to complement the theoretical findings. Lastly, we extend the concept of distance profiles to the abstract setting and connect the proposed matching procedure to the Gromov-Wasserstein distance and its lower bound, with a new sample complexity result derived based on the properties of distance profiles. This paper contributes to the literature by providing theoretical underpinnings of the matching procedures based on invariants like distance profiles, which have been widely used in practice but have rarely been analyzed theoretically.</description>

      <title>Low-Tubal-Rank Tensor Recovery via Factorized Gradient Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11940v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of recovering a tensor with an underlying low-tubal-rank structure from a small number of corrupted linear measurements. Traditional approaches tackling such a problem require the computation of tensor Singular Value Decomposition (t-SVD), that is a computationally intensive process, rendering them impractical for dealing with large-scale tensors. Aim to address this challenge, we propose an efficient and effective low-tubal-rank tensor recovery method based on a factorization procedure akin to the Burer-Monteiro (BM) method. Precisely, our fundamental approach involves decomposing a large tensor into two smaller factor tensors, followed by solving the problem through factorized gradient descent (FGD). This strategy eliminates the need for t-SVD computation, thereby reducing computational costs and storage requirements. We provide rigorous theoretical analysis to ensure the convergence of FGD under both noise-free and noisy situations. Additionally, it is worth noting that our method does not require the precise estimation of the tensor tubal-rank. Even in cases where the tubal-rank is slightly overestimated, our approach continues to demonstrate robust performance. A series of experiments have been carried out to demonstrate that, as compared to other popular ones, our approach exhibits superior performance in multiple scenarios, in terms of the faster computational speed and the smaller convergence error.</description>

      <title>Expected Coordinate Improvement for High-Dimensional Bayesian Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11917v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) algorithm is very popular for solving low-dimensional expensive optimization problems. Extending Bayesian optimization to high dimension is a meaningful but challenging task. One of the major challenges is that it is difficult to find good infill solutions as the acquisition functions are also high-dimensional. In this work, we propose the expected coordinate improvement (ECI) criterion for high-dimensional Bayesian optimization. The proposed ECI criterion measures the potential improvement we can get by moving the current best solution along one coordinate. The proposed approach selects the coordinate with the highest ECI value to refine in each iteration and covers all the coordinates gradually by iterating over the coordinates. The greatest advantage of the proposed ECI-BO (expected coordinate improvement based Bayesian optimization) algorithm over the standard BO algorithm is that the infill selection problem of the proposed algorithm is always a one-dimensional problem thus can be easily solved. Numerical experiments show that the proposed algorithm can achieve significantly better results than the standard BO algorithm and competitive results when compared with five state-of-the-art high-dimensional BOs. This work provides a simple but efficient approach for high-dimensional Bayesian optimization.</description>

      <title>Imprecise Markov Semigroups and their Ergodicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00081v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of an imprecise Markov semigroup $\mathbf{Q}$. It is a tool that allows to represent ambiguity around both the initial and the transition probabilities of a Markov process via a compact collection of Markov semigroups, each associated with a (possibly different) Markov process. We use techniques from set theory, topology, geometry, and probability to study the ergodic behavior of $\mathbf{Q}$. We show that, if the initial distribution of the Markov processes associated with the elements of $\mathbf{Q}$ is known and invariant, under some conditions that also involve the geometry of the state space, eventually the ambiguity around their transition probability fades. We call this property ergodicity of the imprecise Markov semigroup, and we relate it to the classical notion of ergodicity. We prove ergodicity both when the state space is Euclidean or a Riemannian manifold, and when it is an arbitrary measurable space. The importance of our findings for the fields of machine learning and computer vision is also discussed.</description>

      <title>An Investigation of Conformal Isometry Hypothesis for Grid Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16865v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the conformal isometry hypothesis as a potential explanation for hexagonal periodic patterns in grid cell response maps. The hypothesis posits that grid cell activity forms a high-dimensional vector in neural space, encoding the agent's position in 2D physical space. As the agent moves, this vector rotates within a 2D manifold in the neural space, driven by a recurrent neural network. The conformal hypothesis suggests that this neural manifold is a conformally isometric embedding of physical space, where local displacements in neural space are proportional to those in physical space. In this paper, we conduct numerical experiments to show that this hypothesis leads to the hexagon periodic patterns of grid cells, agnostic to the choice of transformation models. Furthermore, we present a theoretical understanding that hexagon patterns emerge by minimizing our loss function because hexagon flat torus exhibits minimal deviation from local conformal isometry. In addition, we propose a conformal modulation of the agent's input velocity, enabling the recurrent neural network of grid cells to satisfy the conformal isometry hypothesis automatically.</description>

      <title>Flexible inference in heterogeneous and attributed multilayer networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20918v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Networked datasets can be enriched by different types of information about individual nodes or edges. However, most existing methods for analyzing such datasets struggle to handle the complexity of heterogeneous data, often requiring substantial model-specific analysis. In this paper, we develop a probabilistic generative model to perform inference in multilayer networks with arbitrary types of information. Our approach employs a Bayesian framework combined with the Laplace matching technique to ease interpretation of inferred parameters. Furthermore, the algorithmic implementation relies on automatic differentiation, avoiding the need for explicit derivations. This makes our model scalable and flexible to adapt to any combination of input data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in detecting overlapping community structures and performing various prediction tasks on heterogeneous multilayer data, where nodes and edges have different types of attributes. Additionally, we showcase its ability to unveil a variety of patterns in a social support network among villagers in rural India by effectively utilizing all input information in a meaningful way.</description>

      <title>eGAD! double descent is explained by Generalized Aliasing Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08294v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A central problem in data science is to use potentially noisy samples of an unknown function to predict values for unseen inputs. In classical statistics, predictive error is understood as a trade-off between the bias and the variance that balances model simplicity with its ability to fit complex functions. However, over-parameterized models exhibit counterintuitive behaviors, such as "double descent" in which models of increasing complexity exhibit decreasing generalization error. Others may exhibit more complicated patterns of predictive error with multiple peaks and valleys. Neither double descent nor multiple descent phenomena are well explained by the bias-variance decomposition.
  We introduce a novel decomposition that we call the generalized aliasing decomposition (GAD) to explain the relationship between predictive performance and model complexity. The GAD decomposes the predictive error into three parts: 1) model insufficiency, which dominates when the number of parameters is much smaller than the number of data points, 2) data insufficiency, which dominates when the number of parameters is much greater than the number of data points, and 3) generalized aliasing, which dominates between these two extremes.
  We demonstrate the applicability of the GAD to diverse applications, including random feature models from machine learning, Fourier transforms from signal processing, solution methods for differential equations, and predictive formation enthalpy in materials discovery. Because key components of the GAD can be explicitly calculated from the relationship between model class and samples without seeing any data labels, it can answer questions related to experimental design and model selection before collecting data or performing experiments. We further demonstrate this approach on several examples and discuss implications for predictive modeling and data science.</description>

      <title>Near-Optimal and Tractable Estimation under Shift-Invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03383v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How hard is it to estimate a discrete-time signal $(x_{1}, ..., x_{n}) \in \mathbb{C}^n$ satisfying an unknown linear recurrence relation of order $s$ and observed in i.i.d. complex Gaussian noise? The class of all such signals is parametric but extremely rich: it contains all exponential polynomials over $\mathbb{C}$ with total degree $s$, including harmonic oscillations with $s$ arbitrary frequencies. Geometrically, this class corresponds to the projection onto $\mathbb{C}^{n}$ of the union of all shift-invariant subspaces of $\mathbb{C}^\mathbb{Z}$ of dimension $s$. We show that the statistical complexity of this class, as measured by the squared minimax radius of the $(1-\delta)$-confidence $\ell_2$-ball, is nearly the same as for the class of $s$-sparse signals, namely $O\left(s\log(en) + \log(\delta^{-1})\right) \cdot \log^2(es) \cdot \log(en/s).$ Moreover, the corresponding near-minimax estimator is tractable, and it can be used to build a test statistic with a near-minimax detection threshold in the associated detection problem. These statistical results rest upon an approximation-theoretic one: we show that finite-dimensional shift-invariant subspaces admit compactly supported reproducing kernels whose Fourier spectra have nearly the smallest possible $\ell_p$-norms, for all $p \in [1,+\infty]$ at once.</description>

      <title>High-dimensional classification problems with Barron regular boundaries under margin conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07312v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that a classifier with a Barron-regular decision boundary can be approximated with a rate of high polynomial degree by ReLU neural networks with three hidden layers when a margin condition is assumed. In particular, for strong margin conditions, high-dimensional discontinuous classifiers can be approximated with a rate that is typically only achievable when approximating a low-dimensional smooth function. We demonstrate how these expression rate bounds imply fast-rate learning bounds that are close to $n^{-1}$ where $n$ is the number of samples. In addition, we carry out comprehensive numerical experimentation on binary classification problems with various margins. We study three different dimensions, with the highest dimensional problem corresponding to images from the MNIST data set.</description>

      <title>DUET: Dual Clustering Enhanced Multivariate Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10859v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting is crucial for various applications, such as financial investment, energy management, weather forecasting, and traffic optimization. However, accurate forecasting is challenging due to two main factors. First, real-world time series often show heterogeneous temporal patterns caused by distribution shifts over time. Second, correlations among channels are complex and intertwined, making it hard to model the interactions among channels precisely and flexibly.
  In this study, we address these challenges by proposing a general framework called DUET, which introduces dual clustering on the temporal and channel dimensions to enhance multivariate time series forecasting. First, we design a Temporal Clustering Module (TCM) that clusters time series into fine-grained distributions to handle heterogeneous temporal patterns. For different distribution clusters, we design various pattern extractors to capture their intrinsic temporal patterns, thus modeling the heterogeneity. Second, we introduce a novel Channel-Soft-Clustering strategy and design a Channel Clustering Module (CCM), which captures the relationships among channels in the frequency domain through metric learning and applies sparsification to mitigate the adverse effects of noisy channels. Finally, DUET combines TCM and CCM to incorporate both the temporal and channel dimensions. Extensive experiments on 25 real-world datasets from 10 application domains, demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of DUET.</description>

      <title>Consistency Checks for Language Model Forecasters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18544v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Forecasting is a task that is difficult to evaluate: the ground truth can only be known in the future. Recent work showing LLM forecasters rapidly approaching human-level performance begs the question: how can we benchmark and evaluate these forecasters instantaneously? Following the consistency check framework, we measure the performance of forecasters in terms of the consistency of their predictions on different logically-related questions. We propose a new, general consistency metric based on arbitrage: for example, if a forecasting AI illogically predicts that both the Democratic and Republican parties have 60% probability of winning the 2024 US presidential election, an arbitrageur can trade against the forecaster's predictions and make a profit. We build an automated evaluation system that generates a set of base questions, instantiates consistency checks from these questions, elicits the predictions of the forecaster, and measures the consistency of the predictions. We then build a standard, proper-scoring-rule forecasting benchmark, and show that our (instantaneous) consistency metrics correlate with LLM forecasters' ground truth Brier scores (which are only known in the future). We also release a consistency benchmark that resolves in 2028, providing a long-term evaluation tool for forecasting.</description>
