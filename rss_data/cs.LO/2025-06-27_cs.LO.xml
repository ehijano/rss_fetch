      <title>Pebble Games and Algebraic Proof Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analyzing refutations of the well known 0pebbling formulas Peb$(G)$ we prove some new strong connections between pebble games and algebraic proof system, showing that there is a parallelism between the reversible, black and black-white pebbling games on one side, and the three algebraic proof systems Nullstellensatz, Monomial Calculus and Polynomial Calculus on the other side. In particular we prove that for any DAG $G$ with a single sink, if there is a Monomial Calculus refutation for Peb$(G)$ having simultaneously degree $s$ and size $t$ then there is a black pebbling strategy on $G$ with space $s$ and time $t+s$. Also if there is a black pebbling strategy for $G$ with space $s$ and time $t$ it is possible to extract from it a MC refutation for Peb$(G)$ having simultaneously degree $s$ and size $ts$. These results are analogous to those proven in {deRezende et al.21} for the case of reversible pebbling and Nullstellensatz. Using them we prove degree separations between NS, MC and PC, as well as strong degree-size tradeoffs for MC.
  We also notice that for any directed acyclic graph $G$ the space needed in a pebbling strategy on $G$, for the three versions of the game, reversible, black and black-white, exactly matches the variable space complexity of a refutation of the corresponding pebbling formula Peb$(G)$ in each of the algebraic proof systems NS, MC and PC. Using known pebbling bounds on graphs, this connection implies separations between the corresponding variable space measures.</description>

      <title>Deciding Robust Instances of an Escape Problem for Dynamical Systems in Euclidean Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of deciding whether a point escapes a closed subset of $\mathbb{R}^d$ under the iteration of a continuous map $f \colon \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}^d$ in the bit-model of real computation. We give a sound partial decision method for this problem which is complete in the sense that its halting set contains the halting set of all sound partial decision methods for the problem. Equivalently, our decision method terminates on all problem instances whose answer is robust under all sufficiently small perturbations of the function. We further show that the halting set of our algorithm is dense in the set of all problem instances. While our algorithm applies to general continuous functions, we demonstrate that it also yields complete decision methods for much more rigid function families: affine linear systems and quadratic complex polynomials. In the latter case, completeness is subject to the density of hyperbolicity conjecture in complex dynamics. This in particular yields an alternative proof of Hertling's (2004) conditional answer to a question raised by Penrose (1989) regarding the computability of the Mandelbrot set.</description>

      <title>Diophantine Equations over $\mathbb Z$: Universal Bounds and Parallel Formalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores multiple closely related themes: bounding the complexity of Diophantine equations over the integers and developing mathematical proofs in parallel with formal theorem provers.
  Hilbert's Tenth Problem (H10) asks about the decidability of Diophantine equations and has been answered negatively by Davis, Putnam, Robinson and Matiyasevich. It is natural to ask for which subclasses of Diophantine equations H10 remains undecidable. Such subclasses can be defined in terms of universal pairs: bounds on the number of variables $\nu$ and degree $\delta$ such that all Diophantine equations can be rewritten in at most this complexity. Our work develops explicit universal pairs $(\nu, \delta)$ for integer unknowns, achieving new bounds that cannot be obtained by naive translations from known results over $\mathbb N$.
  In parallel, we have conducted a formal verification of our results using the proof assistant Isabelle. While formal proof verification has traditionally been applied a posteriori to known results, this project integrates formalization into the discovery and development process. In a final section, we describe key insights gained from this unusual approach and its implications for mathematical practice. Our work contributes both to the study of Diophantine equations and to the broader question of how mathematics is conducted in the 21st century.</description>

      <title>Universal Proof Theory: Semi-analytic Rules and Uniform Interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.06258</link>
      <description>arXiv:1808.06258v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In \cite{Craig}, we introduced a syntactically defined and highly general class of calculi known as \emph{semi-analytic}. We then demonstrated that any sufficiently strong (modal) substructural logic with a semi-analytic calculus must satisfy the Craig interpolation property. In this paper, we show that if the calculus is also terminating in a certain formal sense, then its logic has the Uniform Interpolation Property (UIP). This result has significant applications. On the positive side, it provides a uniform and modular method for proving UIP for various logics, including $\mathsf{FL_e}$, $\mathsf{FL_{ew}}$, $\mathsf{CFL_e}$, $\mathsf{CFL_{ew}}$, and their $K$, $D$, and $T$-type modal extensions, as well as $\mathsf{CPC}$, $\mathsf{K}$, and $\mathsf{KD}$. However, its more striking consequence lies in the negative direction. It extends the negative results of \cite{Craig} to logics with CIP but without UIP. In particular, it shows that the modal logics $\mathsf{K4}$ and $\mathsf{S4}$ do not have a terminating semi-analytic calculus.

      <title>The Weihrauch degree of finding Nash equilibria in multiplayer games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.00972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.00972v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Is there an algorithm that takes a game in normal form as input, and outputs a Nash equilibrium? If the payoffs are integers, the answer is yes, and lot of work has been done in its computational complexity. If the payoffs are permitted to be real numbers, the answer is no, for continuity reasons. It is worthwhile to investigate the precise degree of non-computability (the Weihrauch degree), since knowing the degree entails what other approaches are available (eg, is there a randomized algorithm with positive success change?). The two player case has already been fully classified, but the multiplayer case remains open and is addressed here. Our approach involves classifying the degree of finding roots of polynomials, and lifting this to systems of polynomial inequalities via cylindrical algebraic decomposition.</description>

      <title>Hydra Battles and AC Termination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.14036v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new encoding of the Battle of Hercules and Hydra as a rewrite system with AC symbols. Unlike earlier term rewriting encodings, it faithfully models any strategy of Hercules to beat Hydra. To prove the termination of our encoding, we employ type introduction in connection with many-sorted semantic labeling for AC rewriting and AC-MPO, a new AC compatible reduction order that can be seen as a much weakened version of AC-RPO.</description>

      <title>Univalent Enriched Categories and the Enriched Rezk Completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11752v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Enriched categories are categories whose sets of morphisms are enriched with extra structure. Such categories play a prominent role in the study of higher categories, homotopy theory, and the semantics of programming languages. In this paper, we study univalent enriched categories. We prove that all essentially surjective and fully faithful functors between univalent enriched categories are equivalences, and we show that every enriched category admits a Rezk completion. Finally, we use the Rezk completion for enriched categories to construct univalent enriched Kleisli categories.</description>

      <title>Derandomization with Pseudorandomness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16614v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Derandomization techniques are often used within advanced randomized algorithms. In particular, pseudorandom objects, such as hash families and expander graphs, are key components of such algorithms, but their verification presents a challenge. This work shows how such algorithms can be expressed and verified in Isabelle and presents a pseudorandom objects library that abstracts away the deep algebraic/analytic results involved. Moreover, it presents examples that show how the library eases and enables the verification of advanced randomized algorithms. Highlighting the value of this framework is that it was recently used to verify the space-optimal distinct elements algorithm by Blasiok from 2018, which relies on the combination of many derandomization techniques to achieve its optimality.</description>

      <title>Data-Aware Hybrid Tableaux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12090v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Labelled tableaux have been a traditional approach to define satisfiability checking procedures for Modal Logics. In many cases, they can also be used to obtain tight complexity bounds and lead to efficient implementations of reasoning tools. More recently, it has been shown that the expressive power provided by the operators characterizing Hybrid Logics (nominals and satisfiability modalities) can be used to \emph{internalize} labels, leading to well-behaved inference procedures for fairly expressive logics. The resulting procedures are attractive because they do not use external mechanisms outside the language of the logic at hand, and have good logical and computational properties.
  Many tableau systems based on Hybrid Logic have been investigated, with more recent efforts concentrating on Modal Logics that support data comparison operators. Here, we introduce an internalized tableau calculus for XPath, arguably one of the most prominent approaches for querying semistructured data. More precisely, we define data-aware tableaux for XPath featuring data comparison operators and enriched with nominals and the satisfiability modalities from Hybrid Logic. We prove that the calculus is sound, complete and terminating. Moreover, we show that tableaux can be explored in polynomial space, therefore establishing that the satisfiability problem for the logic is PSPACE-complete. Finally, we explore different extensions of the calculus, in particular how to handle data trees and other frame classes.</description>

      <title>Localized RETE for Incremental Graph Queries with Nested Graph Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13918v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The growing size of graph-based modeling artifacts in model-driven engineering calls for techniques that enable efficient execution of graph queries. Incremental approaches based on the RETE algorithm provide an adequate solution in many scenarios, but are generally designed to search for query results over the entire graph. However, in certain situations, a user may only be interested in query results for a subgraph, for instance when a developer is working on a large model of which only a part is loaded into their workspace. In this case, the global execution semantics can result in significant computational overhead.
  To mitigate the outlined shortcoming, in this article we propose an extension of the RETE approach that enables local, yet fully incremental execution of graph queries, while still guaranteeing completeness of results with respect to the relevant subgraph.
  We empirically evaluate the presented approach via experiments inspired by a scenario from software development and with queries and data from an independent social network benchmark. The experimental results indicate that the proposed technique can significantly improve performance regarding memory consumption and execution time in favorable cases, but may incur a noticeable overhead in unfavorable cases.</description>
