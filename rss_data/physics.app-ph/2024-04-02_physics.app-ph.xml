      <title>Precise Control of Process Parameters for &gt;23% Efficiency Perovskite Solar Cells in Ambient Air Using an Automated Device Acceleration Platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving high-performance perovskite photovoltaics, especially in ambient air relies heavily on optimizing process parameters. However, traditional manual methods often struggle to effectively control the key variables. This inherent challenge requires a paradigm shift toward automated platforms capable of precise and reproducible experiments. Herein, we use a fully automated device acceleration platform (DAP) to optimize the process parameters for preparing full perovskite devices using a two-step method in ambient air. Eight process parameters that have the potential to significantly influence device performance are systematically optimized. Specifically, we delve into the impact of the dispense speed of organic ammonium halide, a parameter that is difficult to control manually, on both perovskite film and device performance. Through the targeted design of experiments, we reveal that the dispense speed significantly affects device performance primarily by adjusting the residual PbI2 content in the films. We find that moderate dispense speeds, e.g., 50 {\mu}l/s, contribute to top-performance devices. Conversely, too fast or too slow speeds result in devices with relatively poorer performance and lower reproducibility. The optimized parameter set enables us to establish a Standard Operation Procedure (SOP) for additive-free perovskite processing under ambient conditions, which yield devices with efficiencies surpassing 23%, satisfactory reproducibility, and state-of-the-art photo-thermal stability. This research underscores the importance of understanding the causality of process parameters in enhancing perovskite photovoltaic performance. Furthermore, our study highlights the pivotal role of automated platforms in discovering innovative workflows and accelerating the development of high-performing perovskite photovoltaic technologies.</description>

      <title>Small-angle scattering interferometry with neutron orbital angular momentum states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Access to the neutron orbital degree of freedom has been enabled by the recent actualization of methods to prepare and characterize neutron helical waves carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM) at small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) facilities. This provides new avenues of exploration in fundamental science experiments as well as in material characterization applications. However, it remains a challenge to recover phase profiles from SANS measurements. We introduce and demonstrate a novel neutron interferometry technique for extracting phase information that is typically lost in SANS measurements. An array of reference beams, with complementary structured phase profiles, are put into a coherent superposition with the array of object beams, thereby manifesting the phase information in the far-field intensity profile. We demonstrate this by resolving petal-structure signatures of helical wave interference for the first time: an implementation of the long-sought recovery of phase information from small-angle scattering measurements.</description>

      <title>Low-loss liquid metal interconnects for modular superconducting quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building modular architecture with superconducting quantum computing chips is one of the means to achieve qubit scalability, allowing the screening, selection, replacement, and integration of individual qubit modules into large quantum systems. However, the non-destructive replacement of modules within a compact architecture remains a challenge. Liquid metals (LM), specifically gallium alloys, can be alternatives to solid-state galvanic interconnects. This is motivated by their self-healing, self-aligning, and other desirable fluidic properties, potentially enabling non-destructive replacement of modules at room temperatures, even after operating the entire system at millikelvin regimes. In this study, we present high-internal-quality-factor coplanar waveguide resonators (CPWR) interconnected by gallium alloy droplets, demonstrating performance on par with the continuous solid-state CPWRs. Leveraging the desirable fluidic properties of gallium alloys at room temperature and their compact design, we envision a modular quantum system enabled by liquid metals.</description>

      <title>The Mechanics and Physics of Twisted and Coiled Polymer Actuators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twisted and coiled polymer actuators (TCPAs) generate large contractile mechanical work mimicking natural muscles, which makes them suitable for robotics and health-assistive devices. Understanding the mechanism of nylon TCPA remains challenging due to the interplay between their intricate geometry, chirality, residual stresses, and material microstructure. This study integrates a material microstructure model with rod theory to analytically predict the equilibrium helical shape of the nylon TCPA after fabrication and to explain the observed contraction mechanism upon stimulation. The first ingredient of the model is to treat nylon as a two-phase thermomechanical microstructure system capable of storing strain energy and exchanging it among the two phases. This is validated by characterizing the torsional actuation response of twisted and annealed nylon fibers. The second ingredient of the model is to use the classic Kirchhoff Rod Theory and add a necessary term that couples the bending and twisting energy. Validation with experiments shows that the model captures the equilibrium and longitudinal stiffness of the TCPA in both active and passive states, and the stimulated contraction under external load. Importantly, the model quantifies the influence of the stored energy level on the actuation performance. These concepts can be extended to other types of TCPAs and could enable new material design.</description>

      <title>Transforming the Synthesis of Carbon Nanotubes with Machine Learning Models and Automation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Carbon-based nanomaterials (CBNs) are showing significant potential in various fields, such as electronics, energy, and mechanics. However, their practical applications face synthesis challenges stemming from the complexities of structural control, large-area uniformity, and high yield. Current research methodologies fall short in addressing the multi-variable, coupled interactions inherent to CBNs production. Machine learning methods excel at navigating such complexities. Their integration with automated synthesis platforms has demonstrated remarkable potential in accelerating chemical synthesis research, but remains underexplored in the nanomaterial domain. Here we introduce Carbon Copilot (CARCO), an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven platform that integrates transformer-based language models tailored for carbon materials, robotic chemical vapor deposition (CVD), and data-driven machine learning models, empowering accelerated research of CBNs synthesis. Employing CARCO, we demonstrate innovative catalyst discovery by predicting a superior Titanium-Platinum bimetallic catalyst for high-density horizontally aligned carbon nanotube (HACNT) array synthesis, validated through over 500 experiments. Furthermore, with the assistance of millions of virtual experiments, we achieved an unprecedented 56.25% precision in synthesizing HACNT arrays with predetermined densities in the real world. All were accomplished within just 43 days. This work not only advances the field of HACNT arrays but also exemplifies the integration of AI with human expertise to overcome the limitations of traditional experimental approaches, marking a paradigm shift in nanomaterials research and paving the way for broader applications.</description>

      <title>Electrical-controllable antiferromagnet-based tunnel junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrical-controllable antiferromagnet tunnel junction is a key goal in spintronics, holding immense promise for ultra-dense and ultra-stable antiferromagnetic memory with high processing speed for modern information technology. Here, we have advanced towards this goal by achieving an electrical-controllable antiferromagnet-based tunnel junction of Pt/Co/Pt/Co/IrMn/MgO/Pt. The exchange coupling between antiferromagnetic IrMn and Co/Pt perpendicular magnetic multilayers results in the formation of interfacial exchange bias and exchange spring in IrMn. Encoding information states 0 and 1 is realized through the exchange spring in IrMn, which can be electrically written by spin-orbit torque switching with high cyclability and electrically read by antiferromagnetic tunneling anisotropic magnetoresistance. Combining spin-orbit torque switching of both exchange spring andexchange bias, 16 Boolean logic operation is successfully demonstrated. With both memory and logic functionalities integrated into our electrical-controllable antiferromagnetic-based tunnel junction, we chart the course toward high-performance antiferromagnetic logic-in-memory.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the cutting-edge application of silicon-rich nitride (SRN) in the realm of high numerical aperture (NA) metalens design, focusing on the crucial role of pitch size optimization in amplifying lens efficiency through advanced simulations. Our investigation unveils how the exceptional tunable high refractive index of SRN can be harnessed to achieve significant advancements in metalens performance. By meticulously designing and simulating two innovative SRN-based metalenses - Mk1, with an NA of 0.9, reaching an impressive 75% focusing efficiency with full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 0.53{\lambda}, and Mk2, with an NA of 0.99, achieving a 42% efficiency while maintaining an FWHM of 0.48{\lambda}. We demonstrate the critical influence of reduced pitch size on enhancing efficiency. This study not only highlights the unparalleled potential of SRN in optimizing metalens efficiency but also represents a significant leap forward in the field of nanophotonics, offering new pathways for the development of highly efficient flat photonic devices.</description>

      <title>Rotating-modulated Higher-Order Topological States in a Split-ring Photonic Insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emerging field of topology has brought device effects to a new level. Higher-order topological insulators (HOTIs) go beyond traditional descriptions of bulk-edge correspondence, broadening the understanding of topologically insulating phases. In this paper, a second-order split-ring photonic crystal (SSPC) with zero-dimensional (0D) corner states and one-dimensional (1D) edge states is proposed. Based on the coupling strength determined by the opening direction between the split-rings, the electronic transition strength of the electronic system is imitated, and the topological trivial and non-trivial transformation of the topological two-dimensional (2D) SSH model are realized by using the rotating split-ring lattice. Theory and simulation find that SSPC has non-trivial topological edge states that can be quantified by bulk polarization. As the opening direction of the split-rings gradually changes within one period, there will be transitions between four different topological polarizations of the lowest energy bands, which can be conveniently used to achieve transitions between different topological phases. Our research can be extended to higher dimensions and broaden research paths for higher-order photonic topological insulators and semimetals.</description>

      <title>Gradient bandgap enables &gt;13% efficiency sulfide Kesterite solar cells with open-circuit voltage over 800 mV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sulfide Kesterite Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS), a nontoxic and low-cost photovoltaic material, has always being facing severe charge recombination and poor carrier transport, resulting in the cell efficiency record stagnating around 11% for years. Gradient bandgap is a promising approach to relieve these issues, however, has not been effectively realized in Kesterite solar cells due to the challenges in controlling the gradient distribution of alloying elements at high temperatures. Herein, targeting at the Cd alloyed CZTS, we propose a pre-crystallization strategy to reduce the intense vertical mass transport and Cd rapid diffusion in the film growth process, thereby realizing front Cd-gradient CZTS absorber. The Cd-gradient CZTS absorber, exhibiting downward bending conduction band structure, has significantly enhanced the minority carrier transport and additionally improved band alignment and interface property of CZTS/CdS heterojunction. Ultimately, we have achieved a champion total-area efficiency of 13.5% (active-area efficiency: 14.1%) in the cell and in particular a high open-circuit voltage of &gt;800 mV. We have also achieved a certified total-area cell efficiency of 13.16%, realizing a substantial step forward for the pure sulfide Kesterite solar cell.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic conductance of ferroelectric domain walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ferroelectric domain walls hold great promise for innovative applications in ferroelectric devices. However, the underlying mechanisms behind the observed giant conductance of charged domain walls remain poorly understood. Using a first-principles approach that incorporates Boltzmann transport theory and the relaxation time approximation, we determine the carrier concentration, mobility, and conductivity of domain walls with head-to-head and tail-to-tail polarization orientations. Our systematic exploration reveals that the accumulation of carriers, particularly their concentration, plays a dominant role in the domain wall conductance mechanism. However, the observed conductance differences between head-to-head and tail-to-tail domain walls are primarily due to differences in carrier mobility. The width of the domain wall is a key factor determining the device scale. Our calculated domain wall width is significantly smaller than previously reported values. This method, not limited to a certain ferroelectric material, can be used for the optimization and application development of various domain wall materials and devices.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian unidirectional routing of photonic qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient and tunable qubit unidirectional routers and spin-wave diodes play an important role in both classical and quantum information processing domains. Here, we reveal that multi-level neutral cold atoms can mediate both dissipative and coherent couplings. Interestingly, we investigate and practically implement this paradigm in experiments, successfully synthesizing a system with dual functionality as both a photonic qubit unidirectional router and a spin-wave diode. By manipulating the helicity of the field, we can effectively balance the coherence coupling and dissipative channel, thereby ensuring the unidirectional transfer of photonic qubits. The qubit fidelity exceeds 97.49%, and the isolation ratio achieves $16.8\pm0.11$ dB while the insertion loss is lower than 0.36 dB. Furthermore, we show that the spin-wave diode can effectively achieve unidirectional information transfer by appropriately setting the coherent coupling parameters. Our work not only provides new ideas for the design of extensive components in quantum networks, but also opens up new possibilities for non-Hermitian quantum physics, complex quantum networks, and unidirectional quantum information transfer.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Machine Learning Strategies for Accurate Prediction of Thermal Conductivity in Polymeric Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.20021v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Polymers, integral to advancements in high-tech fields, necessitate the study of their thermal conductivity (TC) to enhance material attributes and energy efficiency. The TC of polymers obtained by molecular dynamics (MD) calculations and experimental measurements is slow, and it is difficult to screen polymers with specific TC in a wide range. Existing machine learning (ML) techniques for determining polymer TC suffer from the problems of too large feature space and cannot guarantee very high accuracy. In this work, we leverage TCs from accessible datasets to decode the Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) of polymers into ten features of distinct physical significance. A novel evaluation model for polymer TC is formulated, employing four ML strategies. The Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT)-based model, a focal point of our design, achieved a prediction accuracy of R$^2$=0.88 on a dataset containing 400 polymers. Furthermore, we used an interpretable ML approach to discover the significant contribution of quantitative estimate of drug-likeness and number of rotatable bonds features to TC, and analyzed the physical mechanisms involved. The ML method we developed provides a new idea for physical modeling of polymers, which is expected to be generalized and applied widely in constructing polymers with specific TCs and predicting all other properties of polymers.</description>

Abstract: We investigate superradiant enhancements in the refrigeration performance of a set of $N$ three-level systems that are collectively coupled to a hot and a cold thermal reservoir and are additionally subject to collective periodic (circular) driving. Assuming the system-reservoir coupling to be weak, we explore the regime of stronger periodic driving strengths by comparing collective weak driving, Floquet-Lindblad, and Floquet-Redfield master equations. We identify regimes where the power injected by the periodic driving is used to pump heat from the cold to the hot reservoir and derive analytic sufficient conditions for them based on a cycle analysis of the Floquet-Lindblad master equation. In those regimes, we also argue for which parameters collective enhancements like a quadratic scaling of the cooling current with $N$ can be expected and support our arguments by numerical simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03128v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving area of integrated photonics, there is a growing need for materials that satisfy the particular requirements of increasingly complex and specialized devices and applications. Present photonic material platforms have made significant progress over the past years; however, each platform still faces specific material and performance challenges. We introduce a novel material for integrated photonics: Aluminum Gallium Nitride (AlGaN) on Aluminum Nitride (AlN) as a platform for developing reconfigurable and nonlinear on-chip optical systems. AlGaN combines compatibility with standard semiconductor fabrication technologies, high electro-optic modulation capabilities, and large nonlinear coefficients while providing a broad and low-loss spectral transmission range, making it a viable material for advanced photonic applications. In this work, we design and grow AlGaN/AlN heterostructures and integrate fundamental photonic building blocks into these chips. In particular, we fabricate edge couplers, low-loss waveguides, directional couplers, and tunable high-quality factor ring resonators to enable nonlinear light-matter interaction and quantum functionality. The comprehensive platform we present in this work paves the way for nonlinear photon-pair generation applications, on-chip nonlinear quantum frequency conversion, and fast electro-optic modulation for switching and routing classical and quantum light fields.</description>
