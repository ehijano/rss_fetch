      <title>Asymptotic estimations of a perturbed symmetric eigenproblem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study ill-conditioned positive definite matrices that are disturbed by the sum of $m$ rank-one matrices of a specific form. We provide estimates for the eigenvalues and eigenvectors. When the condition number of the initial matrix tends to infinity, we bound the values of the coordinates of the eigenvectors of the perturbed matrix. Equivalently, in the coordinate system where the initial matrix is diagonal, we bound the rate of convergence of coordinates that tend to zero.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Dimensionality Reduction in Wave-Resistance Problems through Geometric Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reducing the dimensionality and uncertainty of design spaces is a key prerequisite for shape optimisation in computationally intensive fluid problems. However, running these analyses at an offline stage itself poses a computationally demanding task. In this work, we propose a unique framework for the inexpensive implementation of sensitivity analyses for reducing the dimensionality of the design space in wave-resistance problems. At the heart of our approach is the formulation of a geometric operator that leverages, via high-order geometric moments, the underlying connection between geometry and physics, specifically the wave-resistance coefficient ($C_w$), of ships using the slender body theory based on the well-known Vossers' integral. The resulting geometric operator is computationally inexpensive yet physics-informed and can act as a geometry-based surrogate to drive parametric sensitivities. To analytically demonstrate the capability of the proposed approach, we use a well-known benchmark geometry, namely, the modified Wigley hull. Its simple analytical formulation allows for closed expressions of the geometric operators and exploration of computational domains that would otherwise be inaccessible. In this context, the proposed geometric operator outperforms existing similar approaches by achieving 100% similarity with $C_w$ at a fraction of the computational cost.</description>

      <title>A multilayer shallow water model for polydisperse reactive sedimentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A three-dimensional model of polydisperse reactive sedimentation is developed by means of a multilayer shallow water approach. The model consists of a variety of solid particles of different sizes and densities, and substrates diluted in water, which produce biochemical reactions while the sedimentation process occurs. Based on the Masliyah-Lockett-Bassoon settling velocity, compressibility of the sediment and viscosity of the mixture, the system of governing equations is composed by non-homogeneous transport equations, coupled to a momentum equation describing the mass-average velocity. Besides, the free-surface depicted by the total height of the fluid column is incorporated and fully determined through the multilayer approach. A finite volume numerical scheme on Cartesian grids is proposed to approximate the model equations. Numerical simulations of the denitrification process exemplify the performance of the numerical scheme and model under different scenarios and bottom topographies.</description>

      <title>Disk Harmonics for Analysing Curved and Flat Self-affine Rough Surfaces and the Topological Reconstruction of Open Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When two bodies get into contact, only a small portion of the apparent area is actually involved in producing contact and friction forces, because of the surface roughnesses. It is therefore crucial to accurately describe the morphology of rough surfaces for instance by extracting the fractal dimension and the so-called Hurst exponent which is a typical signature of rough surfaces. This can be done using harmonic decomposition, which is easy for periodic and nominally flat surfaces since Fourier transforms allow fast and reliable decomposition. Yet, it remains a challenging task in the general curved and non-periodic cases, where more appropriate basis functions must be used. In this work, disk harmonics based on Fourier-Bessel basis functions are employed for decomposing open single-edge genus-0 surfaces (no holes) as a practical and fast alternative to characterise self-affine rough surfaces with the power Fourier-Bessel spectral density. An analytical relationship between the power spectrum density decay and the Hurst exponent is derived through an extension of the Wiener-Khinchin theorem, in the special case where surfaces are assumed self-affine and isotropic. Finally, this approach is demonstrated to successfully measure the fractal dimension, and the Hurst exponent, without introducing typical biases coming from basis functions boundary conditions, surface discretisation or curvature of the surface patches. This work opens the path for contact mechanics studies based on the Fourier-Bessel spectral representation of curved and rough surface morphologies. All implementation details for this method are available under GNU LGPLv3 terms and conditions.</description>

      <title>A polynomial chaos approach for uncertainty quantification of Monte Carlo transport codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this contribution, we discuss the construction of Polynomial Chaos surrogates for Monte Carlo radiation transport applications via non-intrusive spectral projection. This contribution focuses on improvements with respect to the approach that we previously introduced in previous work. We focus on understanding the impact of re-sampling cost on the algorithm performance and provide algorithm refinements, which allow to obtain unbiased estimators for the variance, estimate the PC variability due to limited samples, and adapt the expansion. An attenuation-only test case is provided to illustrate and discuss the results.</description>

      <title>Mixed virtual element approximation for the five-field formulation of the steady Boussinesq problem with temperature-dependent parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we develop recent research on the fully mixed virtual element method (mixed-VEM) based on the Banach space for the stationary Boussinesq equation to suggest and analyze a new mixed-VEM for the stationary two-dimensional Boussinesq equation with temperature-dependent parameters in terms of the pseudostress, vorticity, velocity, pseudoheat vector and temperature fields. The well-posedness of the continuous formulation is analyzed utilizing a fixed-point strategy, a smallness assumption on the data, and some additional regularities on the solution. The discretization for the mentioned variables is based on the coupling $\mathbb{H}(\mathbf{div}_{6/5})$ -- and $\mathbf{H}(\mathrm{div}_{6/5})$ -- conforming virtual element techniques. The proposed scheme is rewritten as an equivalent fixed point operator equation, so that its existence and stability estimates have been proven. In addition, an a priori convergence analysis is established by utilizing the C\'ea estimate and a suitable assumption on data for all variables in their natural norms showing an optimal rate of convergence. Finally, several numerical examples are presented to illustrate the performance of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Near-optimal convergence of the full orthogonalization method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a near-optimality guarantee for the full orthogonalization method (FOM), showing that the overall convergence of FOM is nearly as good as GMRES. In particular, we prove that at every iteration $k$, there exists an iteration $j\leq k$ for which the FOM residual norm at iteration $j$ is no more than $\sqrt{k+1}$ times larger than the GMRES residual norm at iteration $k$. This bound is sharp, and it has implications for algorithms for approximating the action of a matrix function on a vector.</description>

      <title>Mathematical analysis and numerical comparison of energy-conservative schemes for the Zakharov equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Furihata and Matsuo proposed in 2010 an energy-conserving scheme for the Zakharov equations, as an application of the discrete variational derivative method (DVDM).
  This scheme is distinguished from conventional methods (in particular the one devised by Glassey in 1992) in that the invariants are consistent with respect to time, but it has not been sufficiently studied both theoretically and numerically.
  In this study, we theoretically prove the solvability under the loosest possible assumptions.
  We also prove the convergence of this DVDM scheme by improving the argument by Glassey.
  Furthermore, we perform intensive numerical experiments for comparing the above two schemes.
  It is found that the DVDM scheme is superior in terms of accuracy, but since it is fully-implicit, the linearly-implicit Glassey scheme is better for practical efficiency.
  In addition, we proposed a way to choose a solution for the first step that would allow Glassey's scheme to work more efficiently.</description>

      <title>A novel fast iterative moment method for near-continuum flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a novel fast iterative moment method for the steady-state simulation of near-continuum flows, which are modeled by the high-order moment system derived from the Boltzmann-BGK equation. The fast convergence of the present method is mainly achieved by alternately solving the moment system and the hydrodynamic equations with compatible constitutive relations and boundary conditions. To be specific, the compatible hydrodynamic equations are solved in each iteration to get improved predictions of macroscopic quantities, which are subsequently utilized to expedite the evolution of the moment system. Additionally, a semi-implicit scheme treating the collision term implicitly is introduced for the moment system. With cell-by-cell sweeping strategy, the resulting alternating iteration can be further accelerated for steady-state computation. It is also worth mentioning that such an alternating iteration works well with the nonlinear multigrid method. Numerical experiments for planar Couette flow, shock structure, and lid-driven cavity flow are carried out to investigate the performance of the proposed fast iterative moment method, and all results show wonderful efficiency and robustness.</description>

      <title>P1 Error: A Combination of Absolute and Relative Errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose $\frac{|x-y|}{1+|y|}$, termed the ``P1 error" or ``plus-1 error", as a metric of errors. It equals half the harmonic mean of absolute error and relative error, effectively combining their advantages while mitigating their limitations. The P1 error approaches absolute error when $|y|$ is small, and approaches relative error when $|y|$ is large. An $\epsilon$ P1 error indicates that $x$ is close to $y$ at a tolerance level of $\epsilon$, in compliance with the ``isclose" definition used in popular numerical libraries.</description>

      <title>Tomography of nonlinear materials via the Monotonicity Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we present a first non-iterative imaging method for nonlinear materials, based on Monotonicity Principle. Specifically, we deal with the inverse obstacle problem, where the aim is to retrieve a nonlinear anomaly embedded in linear known background.
  The Monotonicity Principle (MP) is a general property for various class of PDEs, that has recently generalized to nonlinear elliptic PDEs. Basically, it states a monotone relation between the point-wise value of the unknown material property and the boundary measurements. It is at the foundation of a class of non-iterative imaging methods, characterized by a very low execution time that makes them ideal candidates for real-time applications.
  In this work, we develop an inversion method that overcomes some of the peculiar difficulties in practical application of MP to imaging of nonlinear materials, preserving the feasibility for real-time applications. For the sake of clarity, we focus on a specific application, i.e. the Magnetostatic Permeability Tomography where the goal is retrieving the unknown (nonlinear) permeability by boundary measurements in DC operations. This choice is motivated by applications in the inspection of boxes and containers for security.
  Reconstructions from simulated data prove the effectiveness of the presented method.</description>

      <title>Transparent boundary condition and its effectively local approximation for the Schr\"{o}dinger equation on a rectangular computational domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transparent boundary condition for the free Schr\"{o}dinger equation on a rectangular computational domain requires implementation of an operator of the form $\sqrt{\partial_t-i\triangle_{\Gamma}}$ where $\triangle_{\Gamma}$ is the Laplace-Beltrami operator. It is known that this operator is nonlocal in time as well as space which poses a significant challenge in developing an efficient numerical method of solution. The computational complexity of the existing methods scale with the number of time-steps which can be attributed to the nonlocal nature of the boundary operator. In this work, we report an effectively local approximation for the boundary operator such that the resulting complexity remains independent of number of time-steps. At the heart of this algorithm is a Pad\'e approximant based rational approximation of certain fractional operators that handles corners of the domain adequately. For the spatial discretization, we use a Legendre-Galerkin spectral method with a new boundary adapted basis which ensures that the resulting linear system is banded. A compatible boundary-lifting procedure is also presented which accommodates the segments as well as the corners on the boundary. The proposed novel scheme can be implemented within the framework of any one-step time marching schemes. In particular, we demonstrate these ideas for two one-step methods, namely, the backward-differentiation formula of order 1 (BDF1) and the trapezoidal rule (TR). For the sake of comparison, we also present a convolution quadrature based scheme conforming to the one-step methods which is computationally expensive but serves as a golden standard. Finally, several numerical tests are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of our novel method as well as to verify the order of convergence empirically.</description>

      <title>Time-discretization method for a multi-term time fractional differential equation with delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper discusses a multi-term time-fractional delay differential equation in a real Hilbert space. An iterative scheme for a multi-term time-fractional differential equation is established using Rothe's method. The method of semi-discretization is extended to this kind of time fractional problem with delay in the case that the time delay parameter $\nu &gt;0$ satisfies $\nu\leq T$, where $T$ denotes the final time. We apply the accretivity of the operator $A$ in an iterative scheme to establish the existence and regularity of strong solutions to the considered problem. Finally, an example is provided to demonstrate the abstract result.</description>

      <title>Preconditioners based on Voronoi quantizers of random variable coefficients for stochastic elliptic partial differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A preconditioning strategy is proposed for the iterative solve of large numbers of linear systems with variable matrix and right-hand side which arise during the computation of solution statistics of stochastic elliptic partial differential equations with random variable coefficients sampled by Monte Carlo. Building on the assumption that a truncated Karhunen-Lo\`{e}ve expansion of a known transform of the random variable coefficient is known, we introduce a compact representation of the random coefficient in the form of a Voronoi quantizer. The number of Voronoi cells, each of which is represented by a centroidal variable coefficient, is set to the prescribed number $P$ of preconditioners. Upon sampling the random variable coefficient, the linear system assembled with a given realization of the coefficient is solved with the preconditioner whose centroidal variable coefficient is the closest to the realization. We consider different ways to define and obtain the centroidal variable coefficients, and we investigate the properties of the induced preconditioning strategies in terms of average number of solver iterations for sequential simulations, and of load balancing for parallel simulations. Another approach, which is based on deterministic grids on the system of stochastic coordinates of the truncated representation of the random variable coefficient, is proposed with a stochastic dimension which increases with the number $P$ of preconditioners. This approach allows to bypass the need for preliminary computations in order to determine the optimal stochastic dimension of the truncated approximation of the random variable coefficient for a given number of preconditioners.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions and minimal interfaces on manifolds with conical singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using $\Gamma$-convergence, we study the Cahn-Hilliard problem with interface width parameter $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ for phase transitions on manifolds with conical singularities. We prove that minimizers of the corresponding energy functional exist and converge, as $\varepsilon \to 0$, to a function that takes only two values with an interface along a hypersurface that has minimal area among those satisfying a volume constraint. In a numerical example, we use continuation and bifurcation methods to study families of critical points at small $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ on 2D elliptical cones, parameterized by height and ellipticity of the base. Some of these critical points are minimizers with interfaces crossing the cone tip. On the other hand, we prove that interfaces which are minimizers of the perimeter functional, corresponding to $\varepsilon = 0$, never pass through the cone tip for general cones with angle less than $2\pi$. Thus tip minimizers for finite $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ must become saddles as $\varepsilon \to 0$, and we numerically identify the associated bifurcation, finding a delicate interplay of $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ and the cone parameters in our example.</description>

      <title>Direct and inverse time-harmonic scattering by Dirichlet periodic curves with local perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is a continuation of the authors' previous work (A. Kirsch, Math. Meth. Appl. Sci., 45 (2022): 5737-5773.) on well-posedness of time-harmonic scattering by locally perturbed periodic curves of Dirichlet kind. The scattering interface is supposed to be given by a non-self-intersecting Lipschitz curve. We study properties of the Green's function and prove new well-posedness results for scattering of plane waves at a propagative wave number. In such a case there exist guided waves to the unperturbed problem, which are also known as Bounded States in the Continuity (BICs) in physics. In this paper uniqueness of the forward scattering follows from an orthogonal constraint condition enforcing on the total field to the unperturbed scattering problem. This constraint condition, which is also valid under the Neumann boundary condition, is derived from the singular perturbation arguments and also from the approach of approximating a plane wave by point source waves. For the inverse problem of determining the defect, we prove several uniqueness results using a finite or infinite number of point source and plane waves, depending on whether a priori information on the size and height of the defect is available.</description>

      <title>Learning on the correct class for domain inverse problems of gravimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider end-to-end learning approaches for inverse problems of gravimetry. Due to ill-posedness of the inverse gravimetry, the reliability of learning approaches is questionable. To deal with this problem, we propose the strategy of learning on the correct class. The well-posedness theorems are employed when designing the neural-network architecture and constructing the training set. Given the density-contrast function as a priori information, the domain of mass can be uniquely determined under certain constrains, and the domain inverse problem is a correct class of the inverse gravimetry. Under this correct class, we design the neural network for learning by mimicking the level-set formulation for the inverse gravimetry. Numerical examples illustrate that the method is able to recover mass models with non-constant density contrast.</description>

      <title>An Active Contour Model Driven By the Hybrid Signed Pressure Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to the influence of imaging equipment and complex imaging environments, most images in daily life have features of intensity inhomogeneity and noise. Therefore, many scholars have designed many image segmentation algorithms to address these issues. Among them, the active contour model is one of the most effective image segmentation algorithms.This paper proposes an active contour model driven by the hybrid signed pressure function that combines global and local information construction. Firstly, a new global region-based signed pressure function is introduced by combining the average intensity of the inner and outer regions of the curve with the median intensity of the inner region of the evolution curve. Then, the paper uses the energy differences between the inner and outer regions of the curve in the local region to design the signed pressure function of the local term. Combine the two SPF function to obtain a new signed pressure function and get the evolution equation of the new model. Finally, experiments and numerical analysis show that the model has excellent segmentation performance for both intensity inhomogeneous images and noisy images.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal Stokes equation with relaxation on the divergence free equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a new nonlocal approximation to the linear Stokes system with periodic boundary conditions in two and three dimensional spaces . A relaxation term is added to the equation of nonlocal divergence free equation, which is reminiscent to the relaxation of local Stokes equation with small artificial compressibility. Our analysis shows that the well-posedness of the nonlocal system can be established under some mild assumptions on the kernel of nonlocal interactions. Furthermore, the new nonlocal system converges to the conventional, local Stokes system in second order as the horizon parameter of the nonlocal interaction goes to zero. The study provides more theoretical understanding to some numerical methods, such as smoothed particle hydrodynamics, for simulating incompressible viscous flows.</description>

      <title>A boundary integral based particle initialization algorithm for Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Algorithms for initializing particle distribution in SPH simulations of complex geometries have been proven essential for improving the accuracy of SPH simulations. However, no such algorithms exist for boundary integral SPH models, which can model complex geometries without needing virtual particle layers. This study introduces a Boundary Integral based Particle Initialization (BIPI) algorithm. It consists of a particle-shifting technique carefully designed to redistribute particles to fit the boundary by using the boundary integral formulation for particles adjacent to the boundary. The proposed BIPI algorithm gives special consideration to particles adjacent to the boundary to prevent artificial volume compression. It can automatically produce a "uniform" particle distribution with reduced and stabilized concentration gradient for domains with complex geometrical shapes. Finally, a number of examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Mesh Denoising and Inpainting using the Total Variation of the Normal and a Shape Newton Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.11748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.11748v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel approach to denoising and inpainting problems for surface meshes. The purpose of these problems is to remove noise or fill in missing parts while preserving important features such as sharp edges. A discrete variant of the total variation of the unit normal vector field serves as a regularizing functional to achieve these goals. In order to solve the resulting problem, we use a version of the split Bregman (ADMM) iteration adapted to the problem. A new formulation of the total variation regularizer, as well as the use of an inexact Newton method for the shape optimization step, bring significant speed-up compared to earlier methods. Numerical examples are included, demonstrating the performance of our algorithm with some complex 3D geometries.</description>

      <title>A Riemannian optimization method to compute the nearest singular pencil</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.12781v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a square pencil $A+ \lambda B$, where $A$ and $B$ are $n\times n$ complex (resp. real) matrices, we consider the problem of finding the singular complex (resp. real) pencil nearest to it in the Frobenius distance. This problem is known to be very difficult, and the few algorithms available in the literature can only deal efficiently with pencils of very small size. We show that the problem is equivalent to minimizing a certain objective function $f$ over the Riemannian manifold $SU(n) \times SU(n)$ (resp. $SO(n) \times SO(n)$ if the nearest real singular pencil is sought), where $SU(n)$ denotes the special unitary group (resp. $SO(n)$ denotes the special orthogonal group). This novel perspective is based on the generalized Schur form of pencils, and yields competitive numerical methods, by pairing it with { algorithms} capable of doing optimization on { Riemannian manifolds. We propose one algorithm that directly minimizes the (almost everywhere, but not everywhere, differentiable) function $f$, as well as a smoothed alternative and a third algorithm that is smooth and can also solve the problem} of finding a nearest singular pencil with a specified minimal index. We provide numerical experiments that show that the resulting methods allow us to deal with pencils of much larger size than alternative techniques, yielding candidate minimizers of comparable or better quality. In the course of our analysis, we also obtain a number of new theoretical results related to the generalized Schur form of a (regular or singular) square pencil and to the minimal index of a singular square pencil whose nullity is $1$.</description>

      <title>Error Estimates for Finite Element Approximations of Viscoelastic Dynamics: The Generalized Maxwell Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12667v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove error estimates for a finite element approximation of viscoelastic dynamics based on continuous Galerkin in space and time, both in energy norm and in $L^2$ norm. The proof is based on an error representation formula using a discrete dual problem and a stability estimate involving the kinetic, elastic, and viscoelastic energies. To set up the dual error analysis and to prove the basic stability estimates, it is natural to formulate the problem as a system involving evolution equations for the viscoelastic stress, the displacements, and the velocities. The equations for the viscoelastic stress can, however, be solved analytically in terms of the deviatoric strain velocity, and therefore, the viscoelastic stress can be eliminated from the system, resulting in a system for displacements and velocities.</description>

      <title>On the parallel solution of hydro-mechanical problems with fracture networks and contact conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13310v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper presents a numerical method for simulating flow and mechanics in fractured rock. The governing equations that couple the effects in the rock mass and in the fractures are obtained using the discrete fracture-matrix approach. The fracture flow is driven by the cubic law, and the contact conditions prevent fractures from self-penetration. A stable finite element discretization is proposed for the displacement-pressure-flux formulation. The resulting nonlinear algebraic system of equations and inequalities is decoupled using a robust iterative splitting into the linearized flow subproblem, and the quadratic programming problem for the mechanical part. The non-penetration conditions are solved by means of dualization and an optimal quadratic programming algorithm. The capability of the numerical scheme is demonstrated on a benchmark problem for tunnel excavation with hundreds of fractures in 3D. The paper's novelty consists in a combination of three crucial ingredients: (i) application of discrete fracture-matrix approach to poroelasticity, (ii) robust iterative splitting of resulting nonlinear algebraic system working for real-world 3D problems, and (iii) efficient solution of its mechanical quadratic programming part with a large number of fractures in mutual contact by means of own solvers implemented into an in-house software library.</description>

      <title>A fully discretization, unconditionally energy stable finite element method solving the thermodynamically consistent diffuse interface model for incompressible two-phase MHD flows with large density ratios</title>

Abstract: A diffusion interface two-phase magnetohydrodynamic model has been used for matched densities in our previous work [1,2], which may limit the applications of the model. In this work, we derive a thermodynamically consistent diffuse interface model for diffusion interface two-phase magnetohydrodynamic fluids with large density ratios by Onsager's variational principle and conservation law for the first time. The finite element method for spatial discretization and the first order semi-implicit scheme linked with convect splitting method for temporal discretization, is proposed to solve this new model. The mass conservation, unconditionally energy stability and convergence of the scheme can be proved. Then we derive the existence of weak solutions of governing system employing the above properties of the scheme and compactness method. Finally, we show some numerical results to test the effectiveness and well behavior of proposed scheme.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents hybrid numerical techniques for solving the Boltzmann transport equation formulated by means of low-order equations for angular moments of the angular flux. The moment equations are derived by the projection operator approach. The projected equations are closed exactly using a high-order transport solution. The low-order equations of the hybrid methods are approximated with a finite volume scheme of the second-order accuracy. Functionals defining the closures in the discretized low-order equations are calculated by Monte Carlo techniques. In this study, we analyze effects of statistical noise and discretization error on the accuracy of the hybrid transport solution.</description>

      <title>Weak form Shallow Ice Approximation models with an improved time step restriction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06811v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Shallow Ice Approximation (SIA) model on strong form is commonly used for inferring the flow dynamics of grounded ice sheets. The solution to the SIA model is a closed-form expression for the velocity field. When that velocity field is used to advance the ice surface in time, the time steps have to take small values due to quadratic scaling in terms of the horizontal mesh size. In this paper we write the SIA model on weak form, and add in the Free Surface Stabilization Algorithm (FSSA) terms. We find numerically that the time step restriction scaling is improved from quadratic to linear, but only for large horizontal mesh sizes. We then extend the weak form by adding the initially neglected normal stress terms. This allows for a linear time step restriction across the whole range of the horizontal mesh sizes, leading to an improved efficiency. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that the inclusion of FSSA stabilization terms transitions the explicit time stepping treatment of second derivative surface terms to an implicit approach. Moreover, a computational cost analysis, combined with numerical results on stability and accuracy, advocates for preferring the SIA models written on weak form over the standard SIA model.</description>

      <title>A local approach to parameter space reduction for regression and classification tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.10867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.10867v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Parameter space reduction has been proved to be a crucial tool to speed-up the execution of many numerical tasks such as optimization, inverse problems, sensitivity analysis, and surrogate models' design, especially when in presence of high-dimensional parametrized systems. In this work we propose a new method called local active subspaces (LAS), which explores the synergies of active subspaces with supervised clustering techniques in order to carry out a more efficient dimension reduction in the parameter space. The clustering is performed without losing the input-output relations by introducing a distance metric induced by the global active subspace. We present two possible clustering algorithms: K-medoids and a hierarchical top-down approach, which is able to impose a variety of subdivision criteria specifically tailored for parameter space reduction tasks. This method is particularly useful for the community working on surrogate modelling. Frequently, the parameter space presents subdomains where the objective function of interest varies less on average along different directions. So, it could be approximated more accurately if restricted to those subdomains and studied separately. We tested the new method over several numerical experiments of increasing complexity, we show how to deal with vectorial outputs, and how to classify the different regions with respect to the local active subspace dimension. Employing this classification technique as a preprocessing step in the parameter space, or output space in case of vectorial outputs, brings remarkable results for the purpose of surrogate modelling.</description>
