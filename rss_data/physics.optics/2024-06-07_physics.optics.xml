      <title>Modulated Ringdown Comb Interferometry for next-generation high complexity trace gas sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gas samples relevant to health and environment typically contain a plethora of molecular species that span a huge concentration dynamic range. High-concentration molecules impose a strong absorption background that hinders robust identification of low-concentration species. While mid-infrared frequency comb spectroscopy with high-finesse cavity enhancement has realized many of the most sensitive multi-species trace gas detection to date, its robust performance requires gas samples to contain only weak absorption features to avoid dispersing cavity resonances from the comb line frequencies. Here we introduce a new technique that is free from this restriction, thus enabling the development of next-generation multi-species trace gas sensing with broad applicability to complex and dynamic molecular compositions. The principle of Modulated Ringdown Comb Interferometry is to resolve ringdown dynamics carried by massively parallel comb lines transmitted through a length-modulated cavity. This method leverages both periodicity of the field dynamics and Doppler frequency shifts introduced from a Michelson interferometer. Scalable enhancement of both spectral coverage and cavity finesse is enabled with dispersion immune and high-efficiency data collection. Built upon this platform, we realize in the mid-infrared a product of finesse and spectral coverage that is orders of magnitude better than all prior experiments. We demonstrate the power of this technique by measuring highly dispersive exhaled human breath samples over a vastly expanded spectral coverage of 1,010 cm-1 and with cavity finesse of 23,000. This allows for the first time simultaneous quantification of 20 distinct molecular species at &gt; 1 part-per-trillion sensitivity with their concentrations varying by 7 orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Universal properties of locally generated terahertz waveforms from polarization-controlled two- and multi-color ionizing fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The polarization states of terahertz (THz) radiation generated in a photo-ionized gas driven by strong two- or multi-frequency fields with locally controlled polarization are studied. We reveal a universal property of the resulting THz waveforms: the ellipticity of their polarization state increases linearly with the frequency. This ``linear chirp of ellipticity'' makes plasma-based THz generation unique among other THz sources. However, it also puts some constraints on the polarization properties of the generated THz radiation. We derive a general expression for the THz ellipticity and demonstrate how the polarization states of the generated THz waveforms can be manipulated and controlled by the polarization of the pump pulses.</description>

      <title>Topological Materials for Near-Field Radiative Heat Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological materials provide a platform that utilizes the geometric characteristics of structured materials to control the flow of waves, enabling unidirectional and protected transmission that is immune to defects or impurities. The topologically designed photonic materials can carry quantum states and electromagnetic energy, benefiting nanolasers or quantum photonic systems. This article reviews recent advances in the topological applications of photonic materials for radiative heat transfer, especially in the near field. When the separation distance between media is considerably smaller than the thermal wavelength, the heat transfer exhibits super-Planckian behavior that surpasses Planck's blackbody predictions. Near-field thermal radiation in subwavelength systems supporting surface modes has various applications, including nanoscale thermal management and energy conversion. Photonic materials and structures that support topological surface states show immense potential for enhancing or suppressing near-field thermal radiation. We present various topological effects, such as periodic and quasi-periodic nanoparticle arrays, Dirac and Weyl semimetal-based materials, structures with broken global symmetries, and other topological insulators, on near-field heat transfer. Also, the possibility of realizing near-field thermal radiation in such topological materials for alternative thermal management and heat flux guiding in nano-scale systems is discussed based on the existing technology.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the observation of exciton formation from the cooled band-edge carriers in mixed two-dimensional hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites using femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. By monitoring the changes of bleach signal upon excitations with various photon energy, we are able to extract the values of exciton binding energy and the occupancies of carriers of free and bound states for each two-dimensional phase. We also confirm the existence of Mahan exciton when injected carrier density is above the Mott criterion.</description>

      <title>Theory of photoluminescence by metallic structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light emission by metals at room temperature is quenched by fast relaxation processes. Nevertheless, Mooradian reported in 1969 the observation of photoluminescence by metals pumped by a laser. Strikingly, while it is currently at the heart of many promising applications, this phenomenon is still poorly understood. In this work, we report a theory which reproduces quantitatively previously published experimental data. We first provide a general formula that relates the emitted power for a frequency, direction and polarization state to a sum over all transitions involving matrix elements, electronic distribution of all bands and the Green tensor. We then consider the case of intraband recombination and derive a closed-form expression of the emitted power depending only on macroscopic quantities. This formula, which is a generalization of Kirchhoff's law, answers many of the open questions related to intraband photoluminescence.</description>

      <title>Stochastic logic in biased coupled photonic probabilistic bits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical computing often employs tailor-made hardware to implement specific algorithms, trading generality for improved performance in key aspects like speed and power efficiency. An important computing approach that is still missing its corresponding optical hardware is probabilistic computing, used e.g. for solving difficult combinatorial optimization problems. In this study, we propose an experimentally viable photonic approach to solve arbitrary probabilistic computing problems. Our method relies on the insight that coherent Ising machines composed of coupled and biased optical parametric oscillators can emulate stochastic logic. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach by using numerical simulations equivalent to the full density matrix formulation of coupled optical parametric oscillators.</description>

      <title>Conic Surfaces and Transformations for X-Ray Beamline Optics Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical surfaces represented by second-degree polynomials (quadratic or conics) are ubiquitous in optics. We revisit the equations of the conic shapes in the context of grazing incidence optics, gathering together the curves commonly used in x-ray instruments and synchrotron beamlines. We present the equations for paraboloids, ellipsoids, and hyperboloids in a common and consistent notation. We develop the transformations from centered systems that are commonly used to describe conics and their axes of symmetry, to local coordinate systems centered on the off-axis mirror surfaces. The equations presented are directly applicable to ray tracing, fabrication, and metrology calculations. They can also be used to study misalignments, movement tolerances, and aberrations of optical surfaces.</description>

      <title>Initial electron thermalization in metals measured by attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding initial electron thermalization has relevance to both fundamental scientific knowledge and application to the construction of novel devices. In this study, attosecond transient absorption is used to directly measure initial electron thermalization times of 38 $\pm$ 8 fs, 15 $\pm$ 3 fs, 4.2 $\pm$ 1 fs, and 2.0 $\pm$ 0.3 fs for Mg, Pt, Fe, and Co, respectively. Through time dependent density function theory calculations, it is shown that the fast electron thermalization observed in Fe and Co is correlated with a strong local field effect. We find that a simple analytical model can be used to calculate the initial electron thermalization time measured by the transient extreme ultraviolet absorption spectroscopy method performed here. Our results suggest that the most significant contributions to the initial electron thermalization times are the basic metal properties of the density of states volume available for scattering and screened electron interaction. Many-body effects contribute less, but still significantly to the initial electron thermalization time. Ultimately the information gained through this study shows the unique view that attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy contributes to unraveling and monitoring electron dynamics and its connection to many-body effects in metals and beyond.</description>

      <title>Entanglement-assist cyclic weak-value-amplification metrology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Weak measurement has garnered widespread interest for its ability to amplify small physical effects at the cost of low detection probabilities. Previous entanglement and recycling techniques enhance postselection efficiency and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of weak measurement from distinct perspectives. Here, we incorporate a power recycling cavity into the entanglement-assisted weak measurement system. We obtain an improvement of both detection efficiency and Fisher information, and find that the improvement from entanglement and recycling occur in different dimensions. Furthermore, we analyze two types of errors, walk-off errors and readout errors. The conclusions suggest that entanglement exacerbates the walk-off effect caused by recycling, but this detriment can be balanced by proper parameter selection. In addition, power-recycling can complement entanglement in suppressing readout noise, thus enhancing the accuracy in the measurement results and recovering the lost Fisher information. This work delves deeper into the metrological advantages of weak measurement.</description>

      <title>Identification of highly-forbidden optical transitions in highly charged ions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical clocks represent the most precise experimental devices, finding application in fields spanning from frequency metrology to fundamental physics. Recently, the first highly charged ions (HCI) based optical clock was demonstrated using Ar$^{13+}$, opening up a plethora of novel systems with advantageous atomic properties for high accuracy clocks. While numerous candidate systems have been explored theoretically, the considerable uncertainty of the clock transition frequency for most species poses experimental challenges. Here, we close this gap by exploring quantum logic-inspired experimental search techniques for sub-Hertz clock transitions in HCI confined to a linear Paul trap. These techniques encompass Rabi excitation, an optical dipole force (ODF) approach, and linear continuous sweeping (LCS) and their applicability for different types of HCI. Through our investigation, we provide tools to pave the way for the development of exceptionally precise HCI-based optical clocks.</description>

      <title>A Rydberg atom based system for benchmarking mmWave automotive radar chips</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rydberg atomic sensors and receivers have enabled sensitive and traceable measurements of RF fields at a wide range of frequencies. Here we demonstrate the detection of electric field amplitude in the extremely high frequency (EHF) band, at $131\ \mathrm{GHz}$. In our approach we propagate the EHF field in a beam, with control over its direction and polarization at the detector using photonic waveplates. This way, we take advantage of the highest detection sensitivity, registered for collinear propagation and circular polarization. To exhibit the potential for applications in this kind of Rydberg-atom based detection, we perform test measurements on the EHF field emitted from an on-chip radar, planned to be used in automotive industry as a vital sign detector. Our work elucidates practical applications of Rydberg-atom media as well as photonic metamaterial elements.</description>

      <title>Harmonic generation with topological edge states and electron-electron interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been found previously that the presence or absence of topological edge states in the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model has a huge impact on harmonic generation spectra. More specifically, the yield of harmonics for harmonic orders that correspond to photon energies below the band gap is many orders of magnitude different in the trivial and topological phase. It is shown in this work that this effect is still present if electron-electron interaction is taken into account, i.e., if a Hubbard term is added to the SSH Hamiltonian. To that end, finite SSH-Hubbard chains at half filling are considered that are short enough to be accessible to exact diagonalization but already showing edge states in the topological phase. We show that the huge difference in the harmonic yield between the trivial and the topological phase can be reproduced with few-level models employing only the many-body ground state and a few excited many-body states.</description>

      <title>Two-photon polymerization of optical microresonators for precise pH sensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15117v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In water monitoring, environmental analysis, cell culture stability, and biomedical applications, precise pH control is demanded. Traditional methods like pH strips and meters have limitations: pH strips lack precision, while electrochemical meters, though more accurate, are fragile, prone to drift, and unsuitable for small volumes. In this paper, we propose a method for optical detection of the pH value based on the multiplexed sensor with 4D microcavities fabricated with two-photon polymerization. This approach employs pH-triggered reversible variations in microresonator geometry and integrates hundreds of dual optically coupled 4D microcavities to achieve the detection limit of 0.003 pH units. The proposed solution is a clear instance for the use-case oriented application of the two-photon polymerized structures of high optical quality. With benefits of the multiplexed imaging platform, dual 4D microresonators can be integrated alongside other microresonator types for pH-corrected biochemical studies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01310v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As the dimensions of plasmonic structures or the field confinement length approach the mean free path of electrons, mesoscopic optical response effects, including nonlocality, electron density spill-in or spill-out, and Landau damping, are expected to become observable. In this work, we present a quantum-informed local analogue model (QILAM) that maps these nonclassical optical responses onto a local dielectric film. The primary advantage of this model lies in its compatibility with the highly efficient boundary element method (BEM), which includes retardation effects and eliminates the need to incorporate wavevector-dependent permittivity. Furthermore, our approach offers a unified framework that connects two important semiclassical theories: the generalized nonlocal optical response (GNOR) theory and the Feibelman d-parameters formalism. We envision that QILAM could evolve into a multiscale electrodynamic tool for exploring nonclassical optical responses in diverse plasmonic structures in future. This could be achieved by directly translating mesoscopic effects into observable phenomena, such as resonance energy shifts and linewidth broadening in the scattering spectrum.</description>

Abstract: We discuss the Lugiato-Lefever equation and its variant with third-order dispersion, which are mathematical models used to describe how a light beam forms patterns within an optical cavity. It is mathematically demonstrated that the solutions of these equations follow the Talbot effect, which is a phenomenon of periodic self-imaging of an object under certain conditions of diffraction. The Talbot effect is regarded as the underlying cause of pattern formation in optical cavities.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-induced higher-order exceptional points in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10913v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exceptional points of order $n$ (EP$n$s) appear in non-Hermitian systems as points where the eigenvalues and eigenvectors coalesce. They emerge if $2(n-1)$ real constraints are imposed, such that EP2s generically appear in two dimensions (2D). Local symmetries have been shown to reduce this number of constraints. In this work, we provide a complete characterization of the appearance of symmetry-induced higher-order EPs in 2D parameter space. We find that besides EP2s only EP3s, EP4s, and EP5s can be stabilized in 2D. Moreover, these higher-order EPs must always appear in pairs with their dispersion determined by the symmetries. Upon studying the complex spectral structure around these EPs, we find that depending on the symmetry, EP3s are accompanied by EP2 arcs, and two- and three-level open Fermi structures. Similarly, EP4s and closely related EP5s, which arise due to multiple symmetries, are accompanied by exotic EP arcs and open Fermi structures. For each case, we provide an explicit example. We also comment on the topological charge of these EPs, and discuss similarities and differences between symmetry-protected higher-order EPs and EP2s.</description>

Abstract: Metaplectic geometrical optics (MGO) is a recently developed ray-tracing framework to accurately compute the wavefield behavior near a caustic (turning point or focal point), where traditional ray-tracing breaks down. However, MGO has thus far been restricted to having real-valued wavevectors. This is disadvantageous because often upon crossing a caustic from the `illuminated' region to the `shadow' region, two real-valued rays coalesce into one complex-valued ray corresponding to the transition from propagating to evanescent behavior. One can distinguish caustics as having either `illuminated shadows' or `proper shadows' -- the former corresponds to when the shadow still contains real-valued rays (albeit in a fewer quantity than in the illuminated region), while the latter corresponds to when the shadow contains no real-valued rays. Here, by means of examples, we show how MGO can be used to model both types of shadows. First, for illuminated shadows we show that MGO can actually be used `as is', provided a corrected quadrature-angle bias is used compared to that proposed in the original references. This is then implemented and demonstrated in a recently developed MGO ray-tracing code. Second, we show that for proper shadows, the MGO formalism can still be used if the symplectic rotation matrix that removes caustics along rays is allowed to be complex-valued. In both cases, strong agreement is seen between the MGO and the exact solution, demonstrating the potential of MGO for improving the predictive capability of ray-tracing codes and laying the foundations for modeling more complicated evanescent phenomena such as tunnelling with MGO.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of Nanomechanical Resonators: Sensitivity, Response Time, and Practical Considerations in Photothermal Sensing</title>

Abstract: Nanomechanical photothermal sensing has significantly advanced single-molecule/particle microscopy and spectroscopy, and infrared detection through the use of nanomechanical resonators that detect shifts in resonant frequency due to photothermal heating. However, the relationship between resonator design, photothermal sensitivity, and response time remains unclear. This paper compares three resonator types - strings, drumheads, and trampolines - to explore this relationship. Through theoretical modeling, experimental validation, and finite element method simulations, we find that strings offer the highest sensitivity (with a noise equivalent power of 280 fW/Hz$^{1/2}$ for strings made of silicon nitride), while drumheads exhibit the fastest thermal response. The study reveals that photothermal sensitivity correlates with the average temperature rise and not the peak temperature. Finally, the impact of photothermal back-action is discussed, which can be a major source of frequency instability. This work clarifies the performance differences and limits among resonator designs and guides the development of advanced nanomechanical photothermal sensors, benefiting a wide range of applications.</description>
