      <description>arXiv:2507.12510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an algebro-geometric interpretation of the Schur and Macdonald indices of four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal field theories (SCFTs). We conjecture that there exists an affine scheme $X$ such that the Hilbert series of the (appropriately-graded) arc space of its polynomial ring $J_\infty(\mathbb{C}[X])$ encodes the indices. Distinct local descriptions of a (singular) point correspond to distinct choices of $X$, giving rise to a family of $\mathcal{N}=2$ SCFTs each without a Higgs branch. These local descriptions directly translate into nilpotency relations in the operator product expansions. We test our conjecture across a variety of (generalized) Argyres-Douglas (AD) theories.</description>

      <title>Covering space maps for $n$-point functions with three long twists</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider correlation functions in symmetric product orbifold CFTs on the sphere, focusing on the case where all operators are single-cycle twists, and the covering surface is also a sphere. We directly construct the general class of covering space maps where there are three twists of arbitrary lengths, along with any number of twist-2 insertions. These are written as a ratio of sums of Jacobi polynomials with $\Delta N+1$ coefficients $b_N$. These coefficients have a scaling symmetry $b_N\rightarrow \lambda b_N$, making them naturally valued in $\mathbb{CP}^{\Delta N}$. We explore limits where various ramified points on the cover approach each other, which are understood as crossing channel specific OPE limits, and find that these limits are defined by algebraic varieties of $\mathbb{CP}^{\Delta N}$. We compute the expressions needed to calculate the group element representative correlation functions for bare twists. Specializing to the cases $\Delta N=1,2$, we find closed form for these expressions which define four- and five-point functions of bare twists.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studies of axion effective theories in the type IIB Calabi-Yau landscape have revealed that hierarchies in cycle volumes drive correlations between axion physics and the number of axions in a given model. We analyze distributions of divisor volumes in toric hypersurface Calabi-Yau threefolds, and provide evidence that aspects of these distributions are universal across this landscape. Furthermore, we show that axion observables in this landscape can be approximated efficiently in terms of only divisor volumes. Finally, we propose a simple model for the spectrum of divisor volumes and use this model to reproduce results on axion masses and decay constants across the Kreuzer-Skarke axiverse.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a DSSYK-like interpretation of the Schur half-indices of $\mathcal{N}=2$ $SU(2)$ gauge theories with matter, in the presence of fundamental Wilson lines. The Schur half-indices of these theories can be understood as transition amplitudes in a non-vacuum sector of ordinary DSSYK. In the language of chord diagrams, the half-indices are obtained by summing over diagrams with special segments, which correspond to coherent states of the $q$-oscillator algebra. In addition, we show that the Schur half-index of $SU(2)$ gauge theory with $n_F=4$ fundamental half-hypermultiplets corresponds to the partition function of a particle on the quantum disk.</description>

      <title>Higher Structures on Boundary Conformal Manifolds: Higher Berry Phase and Boundary Conformal Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of higher Berry connection and curvature in the space of conformal boundary conditions in (1+1)d conformal field theories (CFT), related to each other by exactly marginal boundary deformations, forming a "boundary conformal manifold." Our definition builds upon previous works on tensor networks, such as matrix product states (MPS), where the triple inner product or multi-wavefunction overlap plays the key geometric role. On the one hand, our boundary conformal field theory (BCFT) formulation of higher Berry phase provides a new analytic tool to study families of invertible phases in condensed matter systems. On the other hand, it uncovers a new geometric structure on the moduli space of conformal boundary conditions, beyond the usual Riemannian structure defined through the Zamolodchikov metric. When the boundary conformal manifold has an interpretation as the position moduli space of a D-brane, our higher Berry connection coincides with the NS-NS $B$-field in string theory. The general definition does not require such an interpretation and is formulated purely field-theoretically, in terms of correlation functions of boundary-condition-changing (bcc) operators. We also explore a connection between higher Berry connections and functional Berry connections in the loop spaces of boundary conformal manifolds.</description>

      <title>You've got a Freund--Rubin in Me: The Aretakis Instability of Extremal Black Branes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how the Aretakis instability affects non-dilatonic extremal black $p$-branes by focusing on their near-horizon geometry. Crucially, the strength of the instability, \textit{i.e.} the number of transverse derivatives needed to see non-decay/blow-up of fields on the horizon at late null time, is given by the scaling dimensions with respect to the near-horizon $\mathrm{AdS}_{p+2}$-factor. This renders the problem of determining the severity of the Aretakis instability equivalent to computing the Kaluza--Klein spectrum of fields on Freund--Rubin spaces. We use this to argue that non-dilatonic extremal black branes suffer from the Aretakis instability even in the absence of additional fields -- we find that this is weaker than for extremal black holes. We also argue that the scaling dimensions determine the smoothness of stationary deformations to the original black brane background -- here, our findings indicate that generically more modes can lead to worse curvature singularities compared to extremal black holes.</description>

      <title>$20'$ Five-Point Function of $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM and Stringy Corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We setup a bootstrap approach to compute the first stringy correction to the supergravity regime of the correlation function of five $20'$ operators in $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills. We use factorization of Mellin amplitudes and supersymmetric constraints to fix almost completely our ansatz. The two last coefficients are fixed by a justified mild assumption based on the flat-space limit of the Mellin amplitude. As a byproduct of our analysis, we also compute the first stringy correction to the four-point correlators of three $20'$ operators and either one R-symmetry current or one stress tensor.</description>

      <title>(Super)$\,$Gravity from Positivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate whether the effective theory for isolated, massive, and weakly interacting spin-$3/2$ particles is compatible with causality and unitarity-i.e., the positivity of scattering amplitudes. We find no solution to positivity constraints, except when gravitons are also present and couple in a (nearly) supersymmetric way. Gravity is thus bootstrapped from $S$-matrix consistency conditions for the longitudinal and transverse polarizations of massive spin-$3/2$ states. For two such particles forming a $U(1)$-charged state, a (gravi)photon gauging the symmetry is also required, with couplings characteristic of supergravity and consistent with both the no global symmetry and weak gravity conjectures. We further explore the EFT-hedron associated with the longitudinal polarizations, the Goldstinos, through novel $t$-$u$ symmetric dispersion relations. We identify the extremal UV models that lie at the corners of the allowed parameter space, recovering familiar models of supersymmetry breaking and uncovering new ones.</description>

      <title>Supergravity from the Bottom Up</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ on-shell methods to construct scattering amplitudes and derive effective theories involving massive spin-3/2 fermions interacting with spin 0, 1 and 2 bosons. The four-point massive amplitudes are constructed using an all-line-transverse momentum shift, assuming that in the massless limit, three-point interactions are smooth and the Ward identity is satisfied. For a Majorana spin-3/2 fermion with mass $m_{3/2}$, we show that interactions with only spin 0 and massive spin-1 bosons do not lead to an effective theory valid up to a cutoff $\Lambda \gg m_{3/2}$ that is independent of particle masses. Instead, adding an interaction with a spin-2 graviton gives rise to four-point amplitudes with a Planck scale unitarity cutoff that reproduces well-known results from $N=1$ supergravity, such as $F$-term breaking with a complex scalar and $D$-term breaking with an additional massive photon. These bottom-up results are then extended to two Majorana spin-3/2 fermions where an interacting effective theory valid up to $\Lambda \gg m_{3/2}$ again requires the introduction of the spin-2 graviton. Unitarity up to the Planck scale is then achieved when the two Majorana spin-3/2 fermions have unequal masses, and necessarily couple to two massive spin-1 states corresponding to the spontaneous breaking of $N=2$ supergravity to $N=0$. Our results, obtained from the bottom-up and without any Lagrangian, imply that broken supergravity is the unique, effective theory involving interactions of massive spin-3/2 fermions valid up to a cutoff $\Lambda \gg m_{3/2}$ that does not depend on particle masses.</description>

      <title>The late time ramp from chord diagrams in the double-scaled SYK model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the ramp of the spectral form factor analytically from chord diagrams in double scaled SYK. We map the double-trace correlator to a sum of single trace two-point functions over a basis of operators. We then reproduce the local eigenvalue correlations in random matrix theory from the chord diagrams perspective, which is the $q= 0$ limit of double scaled SYK, and identify the relevant operators that give rise to the late-time ramp. We then extend the computation to finite $q$, resulting in the late time contribution to the spectral form factor. We verify that the late time asymptotics of the finite $q$ computation gives rise to the expected late time ramp. Our computation also provides the corresponding trumpet partition function and gluing factor for chords, which form the basis of a chord analog to topological recursion.</description>

      <title>Space of conformal boundary conditions from the view of higher Berry phase: Flow of Berry curvature in parametrized BCFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the connection between two subjects: the space of conformal boundary conditions in boundary conformal field theories (BCFTs) and the space of gapped systems characterized by higher Berry phases. We explore this connection by analyzing multi-parameter spectral flow in Dirac fermion BCFTs with continuously parametrized conformal boundary conditions, which are introduced by coupling a CFT to a family of gapped systems. When the gapped systems belong to a nontrivial higher Berry class, the associated conformal boundary conditions induce a flow of the ordinary Berry curvature, resulting in a Chern number pump in the Fock space of the BCFT. This phenomenon is the BCFT analog of Berry curvature flow in one-dimensional parametrized gapped systems, where the flow occurs in real space. Building on this correspondence, we introduce the notions of higher Berry curvature and higher Berry invariants within the BCFT framework. Our results provide a new perspective for studying the topological properties of families of conformal boundary states and gapped ground states: if a family of gapped states belongs to a nontrivial higher Berry class, then the corresponding entanglement Hamiltonians exhibit a multi-parameter spectral flow that carries Berry curvature in the Fock space.</description>

      <title>Bubbling saddles of the gravitational index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the five-dimensional supergravity path integral that computes a supersymmetric index, and uncover a wealth of semiclassical saddles with bubbling topology. These are complex finite-temperature configurations asymptotic to $S^1\times\mathbb{R}^4$, solving the supersymmetry equations. We assume a ${\rm U}(1)^3$ symmetry given by the thermal isometry and two rotations, and present a general construction based on a rod structure specifying the fixed loci of the ${\rm U}(1)$ isometries and their three-dimensional topology. These fixed loci may correspond to multiple horizons or three-dimensional bubbles, and they may have $S^3$, $S^2\times S^1$, or lens space topology. Allowing for conical singularities gives additional topologies involving spindles and branched spheres or lens spaces. As a particularly significant example, we analyze in detail the configurations with a horizon and a bubble just outside of it. We determine the possible saddle-point contribution of these configurations to the gravitational index by evaluating their on-shell action and the relevant thermodynamic relations. We also spell out two limits leading to well-definite Lorentzian solutions. The first is the extremal limit, which gives the BPS black ring and black lens solutions. The on-shell action and chemical potentials remain well-definite in this limit and should thus provide the contribution of the black ring and black lens to the gravitational index. The second is a limit leading to horizonless bubbling solutions, which have purely imaginary action.</description>

      <title>Triangulating quantum gravity in AdS$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The path integral of pure 3D gravity with negative cosmological constant is formulated on a finite region of spacetime $M$, with boundary conditions that fix geodesic lengths or dihedral angles on $\partial M$. In the dual CFT, this quasi-local amplitude calculates corrections to the Gaussian ensemble of OPE coefficients for black hole states. By triangulating $M$ with generalized tetrahedra, we develop a general method to construct semiclassical geometries and to calculate the exact gravitational path integral on a fixed hyperbolic topology. The path integral with fixed-length boundary conditions is a Virasoro TQFT amplitude-squared, and with fixed-angle boundary conditions it is a partition function of Conformal Turaev-Viro theory. The two are related by a modular S-transform. In addition, we show how to translate the calculation of OPE statistics from Virasoro TQFT to the metric formalism, on general topologies. These results are derived exactly, and some examples are also checked semiclassically, including the geometries dual to the Virasoro 6j-symbol and the modular S-matrix. The classical saddlepoint geometries are finite-volume hyperbolic 3-manifolds ending on pleated Riemann surfaces, which have vanishing extrinsic curvature except on geodesics where they can bend into corners. The hyperbolic volumes of these geometries match the predictions of Conformal Turaev-Viro theory and the dual CFT.</description>

      <title>Fractional instantons in 2d $\mathbb{C}P^{N-1}$ model and 4d Yang-Mills theory with 't Hooft twists</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the explicit formula for fractional BPS lumps (or fractional instantons) in the $\mathbb{C}P^{N-1}$ nonlinear sigma model on a two-dimensional torus under various shift-clock twisted boundary conditions. After regularizing the $\mathbb{C}P^{N-1}$ model by an $N$-component Abelian-Higgs model, those twisted boundary conditions introduce nontrivial 't~Hooft fluxes $p/N$ for the $U(1)$ gauge field, and the topological charge becomes fractionalized as $k+p/N\in \mathbb{Z}+p/N$. The moduli space is globally determined as the $\mathbb{C}P^{Nk+p-1}$-fiber bundle on a $2$-torus, which is a K\"ahler manifold of complex dimension $Nk + p$ as predicted by the index theorem. We present two different parametrizations of the moduli space: one of them immediately identifies the small-lump singularity appearing in the $\mathbb{C}P^{N-1}$ limit, while the other makes the modular invariance manifest.
  We also discuss the implications of our finding for the $4$d $SU(N)$ Yang-Mills theory on the $4$-torus with 't~Hooft twists. By tuning the aspect ratio of the 4-torus, fractional instantons in the $\mathbb{C}P^{N-1}$ model with a non-Fubini-Study metric are obtained through the dimensional reduction of $4$d Yang-Mills theory, whose moduli space coincides with the one obtained for the standard $\mathbb{C}P^{N-1}$ model as complex manifolds.</description>

      <title>Functional Renormalization Group Flows and Gauge Consistency in QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider quantum electrodynamics with chiral four-Fermi interactions in the functional renormalization group approach. In gauge theories, the functional flow equation for the effective action is accompanied by the quantum master equation that governs the underlying gauge symmetry. Beyond perturbation theory, fully gauge-consistent solutions are very difficult to obtain. We devise a systematic expansion scheme in which the solutions of the flow equation also solve the Quantum Master Equation. In the present work we apply this construction within the lowest order corrections in the photon two-point functions. In this truncation we discuss the phase structure in terms of the gauge and four-Fermi couplings based on a numerical solution of the system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss physics-informed renormalisation group flows (PIRGs) for general operators. We show that operator PIRGs provide a comprehensive access to all correlation functions of the quantum field theory under investigation. The operator PIRGs can be seen as a completion of the PIRG-approach, whose qualitative computational simplification and structural insights are now fully accessible for general applications. The potential of this setup is assessed within a simple analytic example of the zero-dimensional $\phi^4$-theory for which the generating functions of the fundamental field are computed within a vertex expansion, using the one- to ten-point functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work by Kousvos and Stergiou criticises our work with Zhong Ming Tan [arXiv:1505.00963]. The issue is CFT scaling dimension computations in perturbative Renormalization Group. We identified operators whose correlation functions differ by contact terms. This is allowed because CFT only describes correlation functions away from coincident points. They instead renormalize the contact terms, which are eventually dropped. Our way is not only correct, but preferable as it operates with the minimal set of quantities.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of spin-spin correlators weighted by fermion number measurements with low rapidity threshold in the 2D Ising free-fermion QFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the work, we study the averaged number of massive fermions above a low rapidity threshold $Y$, underlying the form-factor expansions of the spin-spin two-point correlators at an Euclidean distance $r$, in the 2D Ising QFT at the free massive fermion point. Despite the on-shell freeness, the spin operators are still far away from being Gaussian, and create particles in the asymptotic states with complicated correlations. We show how the number observables can still be incorporated into the integrable Sinh-Gordon/Painleve-III framework and controlled by linear differential equations with two variables $(r,Y)$. We show how the differential equations and the information of two crucial scaling functions arising in the $r\rightarrow 0$, $e^{Y}r={\cal O}(1)$ scaling limit, can be combined to fully determine the small-$r$ asymptotics of the observables, in the $\lambda$-extended form. The scaling functions, on the other hand, are analyzed by summing the exponential form-factor expansions directly, generalizing the traditional Ising connecting computations. We show carefully, how the singularities cancel in the physical value limit $\lambda \pi \rightarrow 1$ and how the power-corrections that collapse at this value can be resummed. In particular, we show for the physical $\lambda$-value, the scaling functions are related to an integrated four-point function in the Ising CFT and continue to control the asymptotics of the number-observables in the scaling limit up to ${\cal O}(r^3)$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The experimentally observed temperature-dependent shear and bulk viscosities of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP), along with its apparent violation of the Kovtun-Son-Starinets (KSS) bound $\eta/s=1/(4\pi)$, necessitate a holographic description that incorporates higher-derivative corrections. We propose a five-dimensional Einstein-Scalar-Maxwell-Gauss-Bonnet model in which a scalar-Gauss-Bonnet coupling $H(\phi)$ encodes leading curvature corrections. Although no closed-form black hole solution is available, we employ an entropy-production analysis at the event horizon to derive exact analytic formulas for the shear viscosity $\eta$ and bulk viscosity $\zeta$. These expressions exhibit apparent deviation from the KSS bound and nontrivial temperature dependence. We then perform an independent computation via the retarded Green function (Kubo) method, finding perfect agreement for $\eta$ and isolating a single constant in $\zeta$ that requires numerical determination. Our dual derivation underscores the pivotal role of higher-derivative terms in realistic QGP modeling and demonstrates the efficacy of nonanalytic holographic backgrounds in capturing the dynamics of strongly coupled fluids.</description>

      <title>Remarks on Associated Varieties and Minimal Tension Holography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We comment on certain analogies that have recently emerged between path integral localisation phenomena in minimal tension string theory on $\mathrm{AdS}_3\times S^3\times T^4$ and associated varieties of boundary vertex algebras of 3d $\mathcal{N}=4$ theories. We give evidence for the fact that the path integral localisation relies on an intriguing relation between the conformal boundary of $\mathrm{AdS}_3$ and the associated variety of $V_1(\mathfrak{psl}(2|2))$, (the complexification of) the affine algebra that enters the world-sheet description of the string theory. We explain the origin of certain operators (related to ``secret representations") that have appeared in this description. Based on the expectation that similar statements will hold for $\mathrm{AdS}_5\times S^5$, we explicitly write down free field realisations of $V_1(\mathfrak{psl}(4|4))$ that may hopefully be useful to study the world-sheet dual of free $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Krylov complexity has emerged as an important tool in the description of quantum information and, in particular, quantum chaos. Here we formulate Krylov complexity $K(t)$ for quantum mechanical systems as a path integral, and argue that at large times, for classical chaotic systems with at least two minima of the potential, that have a plateau for $K(t)$, the value of the plateau is described by quantum mechanical instantons, as is the case for standard transition amplitudes. We explain and test these ideas in a simple toy model.</description>

      <title>The Algebraic Structure Underlying Pole-Skipping Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The holographic Green's function becomes ambiguous, taking the indeterminate form `$0/0$', at an infinite set of special frequencies and momenta known as ``pole-skipping points''. In this work, we propose that these pole-skipping points can be used to reconstruct both the interior and exterior geometry of a static, planar-symmetric black hole in the bulk. The entire reconstruction procedure is fully analytical and only involves solving a system of linear equations. We demonstrate its effectiveness across various backgrounds, including the BTZ black hole, its $T\bar{T}$-deformed counterparts, as well as geometries with Lifshitz scaling and hyperscaling-violation. Within this framework, other geometric quantities, such as the vacuum Einstein equations, can also be reinterpreted directly in terms of pole-skipping data. Moreover, our approach reveals a hidden algebraic structure governing the pole-skipping points of Klein-Gordon equations of the form $(\nabla^{2} + V(r))\phi(r) = 0$: only a subset of these points is independent, while the remainder is constrained by an equal number of homogeneous polynomial identities in the pole-skipping momenta. These identities are universal, as confirmed by their validity across a broad class of bulk geometries with varying dimensionality, boundary asymptotics, and perturbation modes.</description>

      <title>Challenges for describing unitary evolution in nontrivial geometries: pictures and representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Description of evolution between spatial slices in a general spacetime suffers from a significant difficulty: the states on the slices, in a given basis, are not related by a unitary transformation. This problem, which occurs in spacetime dimensions above two, is directly related to the infinite number of inequivalent representations of the canonical commutators, and in particular will arise for interacting theories in time-dependent spacetimes. We connect different facets of this issue, and discuss its possible resolution. It is directly related to discussions of failure of a standard Schr\"odinger picture of evolution, and of evolution via "many-fingered time." One requires a condition specifying a physical unitary equivalence class of states; in general this equivalence class evolves with time, and an important question is how it is determined. One approach to this in free theories is by imposing a Hadamard condition on the two point function. We explore a different approach, which also may be helpful for interacting theories, analyzing the structure of the state in a local limit, and relate these approaches. We also elucidate the non-Hadamard behavior of unphysical vacua, and discuss concrete examples of these approaches involving cosmological and black hole evolution. The issues are extended in the context of quantum dynamical geometry, and raise important questions for the proper description of the wavefunction of the universe and for the role of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation.</description>

      <title>Projective Representations, Bogomolov Multiplier, and Their Applications in Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a pedagogical review of projective representations of finite groups and their physical applications in quantum many-body systems. Some of our physical results are new. We begin with a self-contained introduction to projective representations, highlighting the role of group cohomology, representation theory, and classification of irreducible projective representations. We then focus on a special subset of cohomology classes, known as the Bogomolov multiplier, which consists of cocycles that are symmetric on commuting pairs but remain nontrivial in group cohomology. Such cocycles have important physical implications: they characterize (1+1)D SPT phases that cannot be detected by string order parameters and give rise, upon gauging, to distinct gapped phases with completely broken non-invertible $\mathrm{Rep}(G)$ symmetry. We construct explicit lattice models for these phases and demonstrate how they are distinguished by the fusion rules of local order parameters. We show that a pair of completely broken $\mathrm{Rep}(G)$ SSB phases host nontrivial interface modes at their domain walls. As an example, we construct a lattice model where the ground state degeneracy on a ring increases from 32 without interfaces to 56 with interfaces.</description>

      <title>Multi-loop spectra in general scalar EFTs and CFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the most general effective field theory (EFT) Lagrangian with scalar fields and derivatives, and renormalise it to substantially higher loop order than existing results in the literature. EFT Lagrangians have phenomenological applications, for example by encoding corrections to the Standard Model from unknown new physics. At the same time, scalar EFTs capture the spectrum of Wilson--Fisher conformal field theories (CFTs) in $4-\varepsilon$ dimensions. Our results are enabled by a more efficient version of the $R^*$ method for renormalisation, in which the IR divergences are subtracted via a small-momentum asymptotic expansion. In particular, we renormalise the most general set of composite operators up to engineering dimension six and Lorentz rank two. We exhibit direct applications of our results to Ising ($Z_2$), $O(n)$, and hypercubic ($S_n \ltimes (Z_2)^n$) CFTs, relevant for a plethora of real-world critical phenomena, and we perform a detailed comparison between perturbative and non-perturbative predictions. Our results expand the understanding of generic EFTs and open new possibilities in diverse fields, such as the numerical conformal bootstrap.</description>

      <title>A Step in Flux to Suppress Axion Isocurvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The QCD axion in the pre-inflation scenario faces a stringent isocurvature constraint, which requires a relatively low Hubble scale during inflation. If the axion was heavier than the Hubble scale during inflation, its isocurvature is suppressed and the constraint disappears. We point out a novel mechanism for achieving this, relying on the topological nature of a BF-type (monodromy) mass for the axion. Such a mass term has an integer coefficient, so it could naturally have been very large during inflation and exactly zero by the time of the QCD phase transition. This integer can be viewed as a quantized flux, which is discharged in a first-order phase transition that proceeds by the nucleation of charged branes. This mechanism can be embedded in cosmology in several different ways, with tunneling during, at the end of, or after inflation. We provide a detailed case study of the scenario in which the tunneling event occurs during inflation. We also comment briefly on possible UV completions within extra-dimensional gauge theories and string theory. Intriguingly, the phase transition could be accompanied by the emergence of the chiral Standard Model field content from a non-chiral theory during inflation.</description>

      <title>Sommerfeld Enhancement from Quantum Forces for Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum forces are long-range interactions that arise only at the loop level. In this work, we study the Sommerfeld enhancement of dark matter (DM) annihilation cross sections caused by quantum forces. One notable feature of quantum forces is that they are subject to coherent enhancement in the presence of a background of mediator particles, which occurs in many situations in cosmology. We show that this effect has important implications for the Sommerfeld enhancement and DM physics. For the first time, we calculate the Sommerfeld factor induced by quantum forces for both bosonic and fermionic mediators, including the background corrections. We observe several novel features of the Sommerfeld factor that do not exist in the case of the Yukawa potential, such as temperature-induced resonance peaks for massless mediators, and having both enhancement and suppression effects in the same model with different DM masses. As direct applications, we discuss the DM phenomenology affected by the Sommerfeld enhancement from quantum forces, including thermal freeze-out, CMB spectral distortion from DM annihilation, and DM indirect detection. We highlight one particularly interesting effect relevant to indirect detection caused by the Sommerfeld enhancement in a non-thermal background of bosonic mediators in the galaxy, in which case the DM mass is shifted due to the background correction and the effective cross section for DM annihilation can be either enhanced or suppressed. This may be important for DM searches in the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>Spacetime duality between sequential and measurement-feedback circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two prevalent approaches for preparing long-range entangled quantum states are (i) linear-depth sequential unitary (SU) circuits, which apply local unitary gates sequentially, and (ii) constant-depth measurement-feedback (MF) circuits, which employ mid-circuit measurements and conditional feedback based on measurement outcomes. Here, we establish that a broad class of SU and MF circuits are dual to each other under a spacetime rotation. We investigate this spacetime duality in the preparation of various long-range entangled states, including GHZ states, topologically ordered states, and fractal symmetry-breaking states. As an illustration, applying a spacetime rotation to a linear-depth SU circuit that implements a non-invertible Kramers-Wannier duality, originally used to prepare a 1D GHZ state, yields a constant-depth MF circuit that implements a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry gauging map, which equivalently prepares the GHZ state. Leveraging this duality, we further propose experimental protocols that require only a constant number of qubits to measure unconventional properties of 1D many-body states. These include (i) measurement of disorder operators, which diagnose the absence of spontaneous symmetry breaking, and (ii) postselection-free detection of measurement-induced long-range order, which emerges in certain symmetry-protected topological phases. We also show that measurement-induced long-range order provides a lower bound for strange correlators, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Fast evaluation of Feynman integrals for Monte Carlo generators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building on the idea of numerically integrating differential equations satisfied by Feynman integrals, we propose a novel strategy for handling branch cuts within a numerical framework. We develop an integrator capable of evaluating a basis of integrals in both double and quadruple precision, achieving significantly reduced computational times compared to existing tools. We demonstrate the performance of our integrator by evaluating one- and two-loop five-point Feynman integrals with up to nine complex kinematic scales. In particular, we apply our method to the radiative return process of massive electron-positron annihilation into pions plus an energetic photon within scalar QED, for which we also build the differential equation, and extend it to the case where virtual photons acquire an auxiliary complex mass under the Generalised Vector-Meson Dominance model. Furthermore, we validate our approach on two integral families relevant for the two-loop production of $t\bar{t}+\text{jet}$. The integrator achieves, in double precision, execution times of the order of milliseconds for one-loop topologies and hundreds of milliseconds for the two-loop families, enabling for on-the-fly computation of Feynman integrals in Monte Carlo generators and a more efficient generation of grids for the topologies with prohibitive computational costs.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave standard sirens: A brief review of cosmological parameter estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) observations are expected to serve as a powerful and independent probe of the expansion history of the universe. By providing direct and calibration-free measurements of luminosity distances through waveform analysis, GWs provide a fundamentally different and potentially more robust approach to measuring cosmic-scale distances compared to traditional electromagnetic observations, which is known as the standard siren method. In this review, we present an overview of recent developments in GW standard siren cosmology, the latest observational results, and prospects for constraining cosmological parameters using future GW detections. We first introduce standard sirens based on how redshift information is obtained and outline the Bayesian framework used in cosmological parameter estimation. We then review the measurements on the Hubble constant from the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA network and present the potential role of future standard siren observations in cosmological parameter estimations. A central focus of this review is the unique ability of GW observations to break cosmological parameter degeneracies inherent in the EM observations. Since the cosmological parameter degeneracy directions of GW and EM observations are quite different (roughly orthogonal in some cases), their combination can significantly improve constraints on cosmological parameters. This complementarity is expected to become one of the most critical advantages for GW standard siren cosmology. Looking forward, we highlight the importance of combining GW standard sirens with other emerging late-universe cosmological probes such as fast radio bursts, 21 cm intensity mapping, and strong gravitational lensing to forge a precise cosmological probe for exploring the late universe. Finally, we introduce the challenges and the role of machine learning in future standard siren analysis.</description>

      <title>Modular families of elliptic long-range spin chains from freezing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the construction of quantum-integrable spin chains with q-deformed long-range interactions by `freezing' integrable quantum many-body systems with spins. The input is a spin-Ruijsenaars system along with an equilibrium configuration of the underlying spinless classical Ruijsenaars-Schneider system. For a distinguished choice of equilibrium, the resulting long-range spin chain has a real spectrum and admits a short-range limit, providing an integrable interpolation from nearest-neighbour to long-range interacting spins. We focus on the elliptic case. We first define an action of the modular group on the spinless elliptic Ruijsenaars-Schneider system to show that, for a fixed elliptic parameter, it has a whole modular family of classical equilibrium configurations. These typically have constant but nonzero momenta. Then we use the setting of deformation quantisation to provide a uniform framework for freezing elliptic spin-Ruijsenaars systems at any classical equilibrium whilst preserving quantum integrability. As we showed in previous work, the results include the Heisenberg, Inozemtsev and Haldane-Shastry chains along with their xxz-like q-deformations (face-type), or the antiperiodic Haldane-Shastry chain of Fukui-Kawakami, its elliptic generalisation of Sechin-Zotov, and their completely anisotropic q-deformations due to Matushko-Zotov (vertex type).</description>

      <title>Probing the nature of gravity in the low-acceleration limit: wide binaries of extreme separations with perspective effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent statistical analyses of wide binaries have revealed a boost in gravitational acceleration with respect to the prediction by Newtonian gravity at low internal accelerations $\lesssim 10^{-9}$ m\,s$^{-2}$. This phenomenon is important because it does not permit the dark matter interpretation, unlike galaxy rotation curves. We extend previous analyses by increasing the maximum sky-projected separation from 30 to 50 kilo astronomical units (kau). We show that the so-called ``perspective effects'' are not negligible at this extended separation and, thus, incorporate it in our analysis. With wide binaries selected with very stringent criteria, we find that the gravitational acceleration boost factor, $\gamma_g \equiv g_{\rm obs}/g_{\mathrm N}$, is $1.61^{+0.37}_{-0.29}$ (from $\delta_{\rm obs-newt}\equiv (\log_{10}\gamma_g)/\sqrt{2}=0.147\pm0.062$) at Newtonian accelerations $g_{\mathrm N} = 10^{-11.0}$ m\,s$^{-2}$, corresponding to separations of tens of kau for solar-mass binaries. At Newtonian accelerations $g_{\mathrm N} = 10^{-10.3}$ m\,s$^{-2}$, we find $\gamma_g=1.26^{+0.12}_{-0.10}$ ($\delta_{\rm obs-newt}=0.072\pm0.027$). For all binaries with $g_{\rm N}\lesssim10^{-10}$ m\,$s^{-2}$ from our sample, we find $\gamma_g=1.32^{+0.12}_{-0.11}$ ($\delta_{\rm obs-newt}=0.085\pm0.027$). These results are consistent with the generic prediction of MOND-type modified gravity, although the current data are not sufficient to pin down the low-acceleration limiting behavior. Finally, we emphasize that the observed deviation from Newtonian gravity cannot be explained by the perspective effects or any separation-dependent eccentricity variation which we take into account.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Doubly Special Relativity (DSR) models are characterized by the deformation of relativistic symmetries at the Planck scale and constitute one of the cornerstones for quantum gravity phenomenology research, due to the possibility of testing them with cosmological messengers. Some of their predictions manifest themselves as relative locality effects, implying that events local to an observer might not appear to be so for a distant one. In this work we focus on transverse relative locality models, where the delocalization occurs along the direction perpendicular to the one connecting two distant observers. We present the first generalization of these models in curved spacetime, constructing a transverse deformation of the de Sitter algebra in 2 + 1 D and investigating its phenomenological implications on particle propagation.</description>

      <title>Partial decidability protocol for the Wang tiling problem from statistical mechanics and chaotic mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a partial decidability protocol for the Wang tiling problem (which is the prototype of undecidable problems in combinatorics and statistical physics) by constructing a suitable mapping from tilings of finite squares of different sizes. Such mapping depends on the initial family of Wang tiles (the alphabet) with which one would like to tile the plane. This allows to define effective entropy and temperature associated to the alphabet (together with the corresponding partition function). We identify a subclass of good alphabets by observing that when the entropy and temperature of a given alphabet are well-behaved in the thermodynamical sense then such alphabet can tile the infinite two-dimensional plane. Our proposal is tested successfully with the known available good alphabets (which produce periodic tilings, aperiodic but self-similar tilings as well as tilings which are neither periodic nor self-similar). Our analysis shows that the Kendall Tau coefficient is able to distinguish alphabets with a good thermodynamical behavior from alphabets with bad thermodynamical behavior. The transition from good to undecidable behavior is related to a transition from non-chaotic to chaotic regime in discrete dynamical systems of logistic type.</description>

      <title>Decay and lifetime of oscillons coupled to an external scalar field: Insights from instability band analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Oscillons are long-lived, spherically symmetric solitons that can arise in real scalar field theories with potentials shallower than quadratic ones. They are considered to form via parametric resonance during the preheating stage after inflation and have extended lifetimes. However, the estimation of their lifespan becomes complicated when taking into account the interactions between the inflaton field and other fields, as naturally expected in realistic reheating scenarios. In this study, we investigate how the lifetime of a single oscillon is affected by the coupling to the external real scalar field. By numerically computing the instability bands of the external field with the inhomogeneous oscillon profile as background, we show that the resonance behavior depends intricately on the coupling strength and shape of the oscillon. We analyze distinct instability mechanisms that dominate across different regimes of the coupling strength and oscillon shapes. Especially, we show that the parametric resonance fails to occur when the oscillon size is too limited to drive enhancement of the external field. Furthermore, our simulations show that as the oscillon loses energy, the exponential growth of the external field can terminate before the oscillon reaches its critical energy for collapse, which indicates that the external field does not necessarily lead to rapid destruction of oscillons even in the presence of strong coupling or with large amplitudes. These results suggest that oscillons can remain long-lived across a wide range of coupling strengths, with potential implications for their role in cosmological evolution.</description>

      <title>Effective field theory for superfluid vortex lattice from coset construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Guided by symmetry principles, we construct an effective field theory that captures the long-wavelength dynamics of two-dimensional vortex crystals observed in rotating Bose-Einstein condensates trapped in a harmonic potential. By embedding the system into Newton--Cartan spacetime and analyzing its isometries, we identify the appropriate spacetime symmetry group for trapped condensates at finite angular momentum. After introducing a coarse-grained description of the vortex lattice we consider a homogeneous equilibrium configuration and discuss the associated symmetry breaking pattern. We apply the coset construction method to identify covariant structures that enter the effective action and discuss the physical interpretation of the inverse Higgs constraints. We verify that Kohn's theorem is satisfied within our construction and subsequently focus on the gapless sector of the theory. In this regime, the effective theory accommodates a single gapless excitation--the Tkachenko mode--for which we construct both the leading-order and next-to-leading-order actions, the latter including cubic interaction terms.</description>

Abstract: We study the Euclidean path integral of two-dimensional quantum gravity with positive cosmological constant coupled to conformal matter with large and positive central charge. The problem is considered in a semiclassical expansion about a round two-sphere saddle. We work in the Weyl gauge whereby the computation reduces to that for a (timelike) Liouville theory. We present results up to two-loops, including a discussion of contributions stemming from the gauge fixing procedure. We exhibit cancelations of ultraviolet divergences and provide a path integral computation of the central charge for timelike Liouville theory. Combining our analysis with insights from the DOZZ formula we are led to a proposal for an all orders result for the two-dimensional gravitational partition function on the two-sphere.</description>

      <title>The exact Schur index in closed form</title>

      <description>arXiv:2112.09705v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Schur limit of the superconformal index of a four-dimensional N = 2 superconformal field theory encodes rich physical information about the protected spectrum of the theory. For a Lagrangian model, this limit of the index can be computed by a contour integral of a multivariate elliptic function. However, surprisingly, so far it has eluded exact evaluation in closed, analytical form. In this paper we propose an elementary approach to bring to heel a large class of these integrals by exploiting the ellipticity of their integrand. Our results take the form of a finite sum of (products of) the well-studied flavored Eisenstein series. In particular, we derive a compact formula for the fully flavored Schur index of all theories of class S of type a1, we put forward a conjecture for the unflavored Schur indices of all N=4 super Yang-Mills theories with gauge group SU(N), and we present closed-form expressions for the index of various other gauge theories of low ranks. We also discuss applications to non-Lagrangian theories, modular properties, and defect indices.</description>

Abstract: Using the decomposition of the $D$-dimensional space-time into parallel and perpendicular subspaces, we study and prove a connection between Landau and leading singularities for $N$-point one-loop Feynman integrals by applying multi-dimensional theory of residues. We show that if $D=N$ and $D=N+1$, the leading singularity corresponds to the inverse of the square root of the leading Landau singularity of the first and second type, respectively. We make use of this outcome to systematically provide differential equations of Feynman integrals in canonical forms and the extension of the connection of these singularities at multi-loop level by exploiting the loop-by-loop approach. Illustrative examples with the calculation of Landau and leading singularities are provided to supplement our results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.02480v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct two-dimensional supergravity theories endowed with a positive cosmological constant, that admit de Sitter vacua. We consider the cases of $\mathcal{N}=1$ as well as $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetry, and couple the supergravity to a superconformal field theory with the same amount of supersymmetry. Upon fixing a supersymmetric extension of the Weyl gauge, the theories are captured, at the quantum level, by supersymmetric extensions of timelike Liouville theory with $\mathcal{N}=1$ and $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetry respectively. The theories exhibit good ultraviolet properties and are amenable to a variety of techniques such as systematic loop expansions and, in the $\mathcal{N}=2$ case, supersymmetric localization. Our constructions offer a novel path toward a precise treatment of the Euclidean gravitational path integral for de Sitter, and in turn, the Gibbons-Hawking entropy of the de Sitter horizon. We argue that the supersymmetric localization method applied to the $\mathcal{N}=2$ theory must receive contributions from boundary terms in configuration space. We also discuss how these theories overcome several obstructions that appear upon combining de Sitter space with supersymmetry.</description>

Abstract: Consanguinity of entropy and complexity is pointed out through the example of coherent states of the group $SL(d+1,\C)$. Both are obtained from the K\"ahler potential of the underlying geometry of the sphere corresponding to the Fubini-Study metric. Entropy is shown to be equal to the K\"ahler potential written in terms of dual symplectic variables as the Guillemin potential for toric manifolds. The logarithm of complexity relating two states is shown to be equal to Calabi's diastasis function. Optimality of the Fubini-Study metric is indicated by considering its deformation.</description>

Abstract: The free energy, or equivalently the ground state energy in finite volume, may be calculated from forward scattering amplitudes using a formula due to Dashen, Ma, and Bernstein. However a naive treatment leads to singularities when considering the scattering of three or more particles. It is shown in detail how the approach can be applied to multi-particle scattering in various massive scalar theories in 1+1d, with or without integrability. The results for the sinh-Gordon, Lieb-Liniger, and $O(N)$ non-linear sigma models are compared to exact results. It is shown how bound states can be considered in this approach by considering the attractive Lieb-Liniger model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12911v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute 4-point correlators in $\mathcal{N} = 4$ $SU(N)$ Super-Yang-Mills with both single and double-particle $1/2$-BPS operators in the regime of large 't Hooft coupling and large $N$. In particular we give explicit expressions up to $\mathcal{O}(1/N^4)$ for the lightest correlator with two double-particle and two single-particle operators built out of the stress-tensor multiplet. Our derivation makes use of the general holographic prescription applied to an asymptotically AdS$_5\times$S$^5$ geometry that describes a coherent superposition of multi-graviton operators. The final result can be written in terms of a natural generalisation of the standard D-functions and takes a compact form in Mellin space. The correlator we compute here is the simplest of a more general class of correlators where two inserted operators are multi-particles. These can be derived with the same approach, suggesting that the structure found here is general.</description>

Abstract: We develop a formalism for computing the scattering amplitudes in maximally symmetric de Sitter spacetime with compact spatial dimensions. We describe quantum states by using the representation theory of de Sitter symmetry group and link the Hilbert space to geodesic observers. The positive and negative ``energy'' wavefunctions are uniquely determined by the requirement that in observer's neighborhood, short wavelengths propagate as plane waves with positive and negative frequencies, respectively; they define a unique ``Euclidean'' (a.k.a.\ Bunch-Davies) de Sitter invariant vacuum, common to all inertial observers. By following the same steps as in Minkowski spacetime, we show that the scattering amplitudes are given by a generalized Dyson's formula. Compared to the flat case, they describe the scattering of wavepackets with the frequency spectrum determined by geometry. The frequency spread shrinks as the masses and/or momenta become larger than the curvature scale. Asymptotically, de Sitter amplitudes agree with the amplitudes evaluated in Minkowski spacetime.</description>

      <title>How to Minimize the Decoherence Caused by Black Holes</title>

Abstract: We consider an experimentalist, Alice, who creates a quantum superposition of a charged or massive body outside of a black hole (or, more generally, in the presence of a Killing horizon). It was previously shown that emission of soft photons/gravitons into the black hole will result in the decoherence of the components of the superposition if it is held open for a sufficiently long span of time. However, at any finite time, $t_c$, during the process, it is not obvious how much decoherence has irrevocably occurred. Equivalently, it is not obvious how much information an observer inside the black hole can extract about Alice's superposition prior to time $t_c$. In this paper, we solve for the optimal experimental protocol to be followed by Alice for $t &gt; t_c$ so as to minimize the decoherence of the components of her superposition. More precisely, given the entangling radiation that has passed through the horizon prior to the cross-section $\mathcal C$ corresponding to the time $t = t_c$ in Alice's lab, we determine the "optimal purification" of this radiation beyond $\mathcal C$ such that the global quantum state of the radiation through the horizon has maximal overlap (quantum fidelity) with the Hartle-Hawking or Unruh vacuum. Due to the intricate low frequency entanglement structure of the quantum field theory vacuum state, we find this optimal purification to be nontrivial. In particular, even if Alice has already "closed" her superposition by bringing the components back together, we find that she can decrease the net decoherence of the components of her superposition somewhat by re-opening it and performing further manipulations.</description>

      <title>On the Underlying Nonrelativistic Nature of Relativistic Holography</title>

Abstract: Over the past quarter century, considerable effort has been invested in the study of nonrelativistic (NR) string theory, its U-dual NR brane theories, and their geometric foundations in (generalized) Newton-Cartan geometry. Many interesting results have been obtained, both for their intrinsic value and in the hope that they hold useful lessons for relativistic string/M theory. By synthesizing two strands of recent developments (especially, arXiv:2312.13243 and arXiv:2410.03591), we argue that this hope has already come to fruition, because standard, relativistic holography can now be recognized as a statement within a corresponding nonrelativistic brane theory. Our main conclusions are general, but in the familiar example of D3-brane based holography, they read as follows: (i) N=4 SYM is exactly the worldvolume theory of D3-branes within `NR D3-brane theory'; (ii) AdS_5*S^5 is exactly the corresponding RR black 3-brane, and includes an asymptotically flat-Newton-Cartan region; (iii) AdS/CFT duality is precisely synonymous with black-brane/D-brane (i.e., closed-string/open-string) duality within NR D3-brane theory; (iv) Newton-Cartan geometry is the underlying structure upon which entanglement of the D3-brane degrees of freedom builds relativistic spacetime.</description>

Abstract: The recent increase in computational resources and data availability has led to a significant rise in the use of Machine Learning (ML) techniques for data analysis in physics. However, the application of ML methods to solve differential equations capable of describing even complex physical systems is not yet fully widespread in theoretical high-energy physics. Hamiltonian Neural Networks (HNNs) are tools that minimize a loss function defined to solve Hamilton equations of motion. In this work, we implement several HNNs trained to solve, with high accuracy, the Hamilton equations for a massless probe moving inside a smooth and horizonless geometry known as D1-D5 circular fuzzball. We study both planar (equatorial) and non-planar geodesics in different regimes according to the impact parameter, some of which are unstable. Our findings suggest that HNNs could eventually replace standard numerical integrators, as they are equally accurate but more reliable in critical situations.</description>

      <title>Four-point correlators with BPS bound states in AdS$_3$ and AdS$_5$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02855v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider heavy-heavy-light-light (HHLL) correlators in AdS/CFT, focussing on the D1D5 CFT$_2$ and the ${\cal N}= 4$ super Yang-Mills theory. Out of the lightest $1/2$-BPS operator in the spectrum, $O$, we construct a particular heavy operator $O_H$ given by a coherent superposition of multi-particle operators $O^n$, and study the HHLL correlator. When $n$ is of order of the central charge, we show that the bulk equation that computes our boundary HHLL correlators is always a Heun equation. By assuming that the form of the correlator can be continued to the regime where $n$ is ${\mathcal O}(1)$, we first reproduce the known single-particle four-point correlators for $n=1$ and then predict new results for the multi-particle correlators $\langle O^n O^n O O\rangle$. Explicit expressions can be written entirely in terms of $n$-loop ladder integrals and their derivatives, and we provide them for $n=2$ and $n=3$ both in position and in Mellin space. Focussing on the AdS$_5$ case, we study the OPE expansion of these multi-particle correlators and show that several consistency relations with known CFT data are non-trivially satisfied. Finally, we extract new CFT data for double and triple-particle long operators.</description>

      <title>Continuous and Discrete Symmetries in a 4D Field-Theoretic Model: Symmetry Operators and Their Algebraic Structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21680v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Within the framework of Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) formalism, we show the existence of (i) a couple of off-shell nilpotent (i.e. fermionic) BRST and co-BRST symmetry transformations, and (ii) a full set of non-nilpotent (i.e. bosonic) symmetry transformations for an appropriate Lagrangian density that describes the combined system of the free Abelian 3-form and 1-form gauge theories in the physical four (3 + 1)-dimensions of the flat Minkowskian spacetime. This combined BRST-quantized field-theoretic system is essential for the existence of the off-shell nilpotent co-BRST and non-nilpotent bosonic symmetry transformations in the theory. We concentrate on the full algebraic structures of the above continuous symmetry transformation operators along with a couple of very useful discrete duality symmetry transformation operators existing in our four (3 + 1)-dimensional (4D) field-theoretic model. We establish the relevance of the algebraic structures, respected by the above discrete and continuous symmetry operators, to the algebraic structures that are obeyed by the de Rham cohomological operators of differential geometry. One of the highlights of our present endeavor is the observation that there are no ``exotic'' fields with the negative kinetic terms in our present 4D field-theoretic example for Hodge theory.</description>

Abstract: By performing a field redefinition via a cohomomorphism on the Maurer-Cartan action of the $A_\infty$ algebra, we construct an action that reproduces the characteristic structure of boundary string field theory (BSFT), which we refer to as the BSFT-like action. We show that the form and several properties of this BSFT-like action closely resemble those of BSFT. Our results suggest that this approach provides a systematic framework to derive the BSFT action from the OSFT based on $A_\infty$ algebras.</description>

      <title>$\eta$ regularisation and the functional measure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01290v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we revisit Fujikawa's path integral formulation of the chiral anomaly and develop a generalised framework for systematically defining a regularised functional measure. This construction extends the $\eta$ regularisation scheme to operator language, making the connection between spectral asymmetry and measure transformation fully explicit. Before recovering Fujikawa's expression for the chiral anomaly from the regularised measure, we explore the deeper number-theoretic structure underlying the ill-defined spectral sum associated with the anomaly, interpreting it through the lens of smoothed asymptotics. Our approach unifies two complementary perspectives: the analytic regularisation of Fujikawa and the topological characterisation given by the Atiyah-Singer index theorem. We further investigate how the measure transforms under changes to the regularisation scale and derive a function $\iota_E(\Lambda)$ that encodes this dependence, showing how its Mellin moments govern the appearance of divergences. Finally, we comment on the conceptual relationship between the regularised measure, $\eta$ regularisation, and the generalised Schwinger proper-time formalism, with a particular focus on the two-dimensional Schwinger model.</description>

      <title>Phase Transitions at Unusual Values of $\theta$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14879v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We calculate the $\theta$ dependence in a cousin of QCD, where the vacuum structure can be analyzed exactly. The theory is $\mathcal{N}=2$ $SU(2)$ gauge theory with $N_F=0,1,2,3$ flavors of fundamentals, explicitly broken to $\mathcal{N}=1$ via an adjoint superpotential, and coupled to anomaly mediated supersymmetry breaking (AMSB). The hierarchy $m_{AMSB}\ll \mu_{\mathcal{N}=1}\ll \Lambda$ ensures the validity of our IR analysis. As expected from ordinary QCD, the vacuum energy is a function of $\theta$ which undergoes 1st order phase transitions between different vacua where the various dyons condense. For $N_F=0$ we find the expected phase transition at $\theta=\pi$, while for $N_F=1,2,3$ we find phase transitions at fractional values of $\pi$.</description>

Abstract: The Carroll group arises in the vanishing speed of light limit of the Poincar\'{e} group and was initially discarded as just a mathematical curiosity. However, recent developments have proved otherwise. Carroll and conformal Carroll symmetries are now ubiquitous, appearing in diverse physical phenomena starting from condensed matter physics to quantum gravity. This review aims to provide the reader a gateway into this fast-developing field. After an introduction and setting the stage with basics of the symmetry in question, we detail the construction of Carrollian and Carrollian Conformal field theories (CCFT).
  We then focus on applications. By far the most popular of these applications is in the context of the construction of holography in asymptotically flat spacetimes (AFS) in terms of a co-dimension one dual CCFT. We review the early work on AFS$_3$ /CCFT$_2$ before delving into an in-depth analysis for the construction of the dual to 4D AFS.
  Two other important sets of applications are in hydrodynamics and in condensed matter physics, which we discuss in detail. Carroll hydrodynamics is introduced as the $c\to 0$ limit of relativistic hydrodynamics first and then reconstructed from a symmetry based approach. Relations to ultrarelativistic flows and connections to the quark-gluon plasma are discussed with concrete examples of the Bjorken and Gubser flow models. In condensed matter applications, we cover connections to fractons, flat bands, and phase separation in Luttinger liquid models. To conclude, we give very brief outlines of other topics of interest including string theory and black hole horizons.</description>

      <title>An exact solution of planar QCD by a matrix ensemble</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05096v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct an exact solution of the planar QCD loop equation in four-dimensional Euclidean space using a novel matrix-valued momentum loop formalism. Central to this approach is a new loop calculus, where functional derivatives act on the loop velocity $\dot C(\theta)$. This yields finite, well-defined expressions for point and area derivatives in loop space and ensures consistency via the loop-space Bianchi identity.
  The Wilson loop is expressed as an average over matrix-valued momentum loops $P(\theta)$ tracing closed paths in a compact complex manifold, subject to self-duality and boundary constraints. The ensemble of such random walks is supported on manifolds where the classical Yang-Mills term in the loop equation vanishes identically, and the contact terms in the planar ($N \to \infty$) limit are nullified by the boundary conditions. The full planar QCD loop equation is satisfied without modification.
  A key structural feature is invariance under reflection-conjugation symmetry: reversing the loop orientation and taking complex conjugation maps one solution to another. This holds for arbitrary compact Lie groups used in the momentum ensemble and is independent of the original SU($N$) gauge symmetry.
  We conjecture that, in the classical limit, the matrix ensemble defines a generalized minimal surface embedded not in $\mathbb{R}^4$, but in a higher-dimensional vector matrix space. This extended surface possesses self-dual area elements and satisfies the loop equation via geometry and the Bianchi identity. We derive the corresponding differential equations and construct an exact solution for an elliptic planar loop $C$, with minimal area proportional to the Euclidean area bounded by $C$, up to a constant factor ($1/\sqrt{2}$ in this case).</description>

      <title>On gauge transformations in twistless torsional Newton--Cartan geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05105v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Twistless torsional Newton--Cartan (TTNC) geometry exists in two variants, type I and type II, which differ by their gauge transformations. In TTNC geometry there exists a specific locally Galilei-invariant function, called by different names in existing literature, that we dub the `locally Galilei-invariant potential'. We show that in both types of TTNC geometry, there always exists a local gauge transformation that transforms the locally Galilei-invariant potential to zero. For type I TTNC geometry, we achieve this due to the corresponding equation for the gauge parameter taking the form of a Hamilton--Jacobi equation. In the case of type II TTNC geometry, we perform subleading spatial diffeomorphisms. In both cases, our arguments rigorously establish the existence of the respective gauge transformation also in case of only finite-degree differentiability of the geometric fields. This improves upon typical arguments for `gauge fixing' in the literature, which need analyticity.
  We consider two applications of our result. First, it generalises a classical result in standard Newton--Cartan geometry. Second, it allows to (locally) parametrise TTNC geometry in two new ways: either in terms of just the space metric and a unit timelike vector field, or in terms of the distribution of spacelike vectors and a positive-definite cometric.</description>

      <title>Bound-state solutions for the charged Dirac oscillator in a rotating frame in the Bonnor-Melvin-Lambda spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17535v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we determine the relativistic bound-state solutions for the charged (DO) Dirac oscillator in a rotating frame in the Bonnor-Melvin-Lambda spacetime in $(2+1)$-dimensions, where such solutions are given by the two-component normalizable Dirac spinor and by the relativistic energy spectrum. To analytically solve our problem, we consider two approximations, where the first is that the cosmological constant is very small (conical approximation), and the second is that the linear velocity of the rotating frame is much less than the speed of light (slow rotation regime). After solving a second-order differential equation, we obtain a generalized Laguerre equation, whose solutions are the generalized Laguerre polynomials. Consequently, we obtain the energy spectrum, which is quantized in terms of the radial and total magnetic quantum numbers $n$ and $m_j$, and depends on the angular frequency $\omega$ (describes the DO), cyclotron frequency $\omega_c$ (describes the external magnetic field), angular velocity $\Omega$ (describes the rotating frame), spin parameter $s$ (describes the ``spin''), spinorial parameter $u$ (describes the components of the spinor), effective rest mass $m_{eff}$ (describes the rest mass modified by the spin-rotation coupling), and on a real parameter $\sigma$ and cosmological constant $\Lambda$ (describes the Bonnor-Melvin-Lambda spacetime). In particular, we note that this spectrum is asymmetrical (due to $\Omega$) and has its degeneracy broken (due to $\sigma$ and $\Lambda$). Besides, we also graphically analyze the behavior of the spectrum and of the probability density as a function of the parameters of the system for different values of $n$ and $m_j$.</description>

Abstract: The harvesting of quantum resources from the vacuum state of a quantum field is a central topic in relativistic quantum information. While several proposals for the harvesting of entanglement from the quantum vacuum exist, less attention has been paid to other quantum resources, such as non-stabilizerness, commonly dubbed {\em magic} and quantified by the Stabilizer R\'enyi Entropy (SRE). In this work, we show how to harvest SRE from the vacuum state of a massless field using accelerated Unruh-DeWitt detectors in Minkowski spacetime. In particular, one can harvest a particular non-local form of SRE that cannot be erased by local unitary operations. This non-local SRE is a fundamental quantity to study the interplay between entanglement and non-stabilizer resources. We conclude our work with an analysis of the CHSH inequalities: when restricting to stabilizer measurements, i.e. Pauli measurements, one cannot extract a violation from the quantum field.</description>

      <title>Modified gravitational wave propagations in linearized gravity with Lorentz and diffeomorphism violations and their gravitational wave constraints</title>

Abstract: The standard model extension (SME) is an effective field theory framework that can be used to study the possible violations of Lorentz symmetry and diffeomorphism invariance in the gravitational interaction. In this paper, we explore both the Lorentz- and diffeomorphism-violating effects on the propagations of gravitational waves in the SME's linearized gravity. It is shown that the violations of Lorentz symmetry and diffeomorphism invariance modify the conventional linear dispersion relation of gravitational waves, leading to anisotropy, birefringence, and dispersion effects in the propagation of gravitational waves. With these modified dispersion relations, we then calculate the dephasing effects due to the Lorentz and diffeomorphism violations in the waveforms of gravitational waves produced by the coalescence of compact binaries. With the distorted waveforms, we perform full Bayesian inference with the help of the open source software \texttt{BILBY} on the gravitational wave events of the compact binary mergers in the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA catalogs GWTC-3. We consider the effects from the operators with the lowest mass dimension $d=2$ and $d=3$ due to the Lorentz and diffeomorphism violations in the linearized gravity. No signature of Lorentz and diffeomorphism violations arsing from the SME's linearized gravity are found for most GW events, which allows us to give a $90\%$ confidence interval for each Lorentz- and diffeomorphism-violating coefficient.</description>

      <title>Constraining parity and Lorentz violations in gravity with future ground- and space-based gravitational wave detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04776v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The future ground- and space-based gravitational wave (GW) detectors offer unprecedented opportunities to test general relativity (GR) with greater precision. In this work, we investigate the capability of future ground-based GW detectors, the Einstein Telescope (ET) and the Cosmic Explorer (CE), and space-based GW detectors, LISA, Taiji, and TianQin, for constraining parity and Lorentz violations in gravity. We inject several typical GW signals from compact binary systems into GW detectors and perform Bayesian inferences with the modified waveforms with parity and Lorentz-violating effects. These effects are modeled in the amplitude and phase corrections to the GW waveforms with their frequency-dependence described by factors $\beta_{\nu}$, $\beta_{\mu}$, $\beta_{\bar \nu}$, and $\beta_{\bar \mu}$. Our results show that the combined observations of ET and CE will impose significantly tighter bounds on the energy scale of parity and Lorentz violations ($M_{\rm PV}$ and $M_{\rm LV}$) compared to those given by LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) detectors. For cases with positive values of $\beta_{\nu}$, $\beta_{\mu}$, $\beta_{\bar \nu}$, and $\beta_{\bar \mu}$, the constraints on $M_{\rm PV}$ and $M_{\rm LV}$ from ground-based detectors are tighter than those from the space-based detectors. For the $\beta_{\mu} = -1$ case, space-based GW detectors provide constraints on $M_{\rm PV}$ that are better than current LVK observations and comparable to those from ET and CE. Additionally, space-based detectors exhibit superior sensitivity in constraining $M_{\rm LV}$ for $\beta_{\bar \mu} = -2$ case, which is approximately three orders of magnitude tighter than those from ground-based GW detectors. This scenario also enables bounds on the graviton mass at $m_g \lesssim 10^{-35}\; {\rm GeV}$. These findings highlight the promising role of future GW observatories in probing fundamental physics beyond GR.</description>

      <title>Gradient corrections to the local-equilibrium energy-momentum tensor in the Zubarev approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01706v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the expectation value of the energy-momentum tensor of a real scalar field in an approximation which accounts for spacetime gradients of the hydrodynamical variables in local thermodynamical equilibrium. We show that the energy-momentum tensor receives corrections with respect to the standard local-equilibrium result. Notably, the relation between the energy density and pressure, i.e., the equation of state, is modified with respect to the one in global equilibrium. The obtained corrections might be relevant for systems created in relativistic hadron and heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03119v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravity is identical to curved spacetime. It is manifested by the curvature of a Riemannian spacetime in general relativity but by torsion or non-metricity in teleparallel gravity models. In this paper, we apply these multiple options to the spacetime perturbation theory and seek the possibilities of representing the gravitation of the background and that of the perturbation in separate ways. We show that the perturbation around a Riemannian background can be described by torsion or non-metricity, so that we have teleparallel like actions for the perturbation.</description>

      <title>Nuclear Cold QCD: Review and Future Strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17454v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This review examines data from hadron-nucleus collisions, primarily focusing on hard processes like Drell-Yan, heavy flavor and quarkonium production. It highlights observed modifications of particle yields as functions of momentum and rapidity, aiming to clarify the underlying QCD effects in cold nuclear matter (CNM). The paper outlines strategies for future experiments, including the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC), to distinguish between these effects. Key questions address the universality of suppression mechanisms and the role of non-perturbative physics, providing a road map for upcoming nuclear data.</description>

      <title>Quantum stress-energy at timelike boundaries: testing a new beyond-$\Lambda$CDM parameter with cosmological data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the basic cosmological effects of a population of timelike boundaries -- a form of nontrivial spacetime topology -- containing a boundary layer of quantum stress energy. This accumulation of vacuum fluctuations of quantum fields can be consistently negative and UV sensitive, providing an additional source of cosmic energy density strong enough to compete with matter and dark energy. For boundary conditions enabling a solution with fixed comoving boundary size, this effect contributes a qualitatively new term to the Friedmann equation determining the expansion history, scaling like $-1/a$ for scale factor $a$. It naturally dominates at relatively late times ($a\approx1/2$), while leaving intact well-measured early universe physics such as big bang nucleosynthesis and recombination. For a wide window of parameters, the boundaries can be larger than the Planck length throughout their history, back through the start of inflation at any viable scale. We analyze CMB and BAO data sets (Planck, ACT, and DESI) allowing for this component, finding a slight preference ($\sim 2\sigma$) and a relaxation of current tensions in the data (including the neutrino mass) in a physical manner. This novel parameter fits into a larger space of physical parameters beyond-$\Lambda$CDM that may serve this role, including negative spatial curvature, which may also be motivated by topological considerations and chaotic dynamics. Finally, we comment on additional phenomenological prospects for testing for this form of topology in the universe.</description>
