      <title>On the Double: Two Luminous Flares from the Nearby Tidal Disruption Event ASASSN-22ci (AT2022dbl) and Connections to Repeating TDE Candidates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present observations of ASASSN-22ci (AT2022dbl), a nearby tidal disruption event (TDE) discovered by the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN) at a distance of d$_L \simeq 125$ Mpc. Roughly two years after the initial ASAS-SN discovery, a second flare was detected coincident with ASASSN-22ci. UV/optical photometry and optical spectroscopy indicate that both flares are likely powered by TDEs. The striking similarity in flare properties suggests that these flares result from subsequent disruptions of the same star. Each flare rises on a timescale of $\sim$30 days, has a temperature of $\approx$30,000 K, a peak bolometric luminosity of $L_{UV/Opt} = 10^{43.6 - 43.9} \textrm{ erg} \textrm{ s}^{-1}$, and exhibits a blue optical spectrum with broad H, He, and N lines. No X-ray emission is detected during either flare, but X-ray emission with an unabsorbed luminosity of $L_{X} = 3\times10^{41} \textrm{ erg} \textrm{ s}^{-1}$ and $kT = 0.042$ eV is observed between the flares. Pre-discovery survey observations rule out the existence of earlier flares within the past $\approx$6000 days, indicating that the discovery of ASASSN-22ci likely coincides with the first flare. If the observed flare separation of $720 \pm 4.7$ days is the orbital period, the next flare of ASASSN-22ci should occur near MJD 61075 (2026 February 04). Finally, we find that the existing sample of repeating TDE candidates is consistent with Hills capture of a star initially in a binary with a total mass between $\sim$$1 - 4$ M$_{\odot}$ and a separation of $\sim$$0.01 - 0.1$ AU.</description>

      <title>Spin evolution and mass distribution of the Galactic Binary Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binary neutron stars (BNSs) detected in the Milky Way have the total masses distributing narrowly around $\sim2.6-2.7M_\odot$, while the BNS merger GW190425 detected via gravitational wave has a significantly larger mass ($\sim3.4M_\odot$). This difference is not well understood, yet. In this paper, we investigate the BNS spin evolution via an improved binary star evolution model and its effects on the BNS observability, with implementation of various relevant astrophysical processes. We find that the first-born neutron star component in low-mass BNSs can be spun up to millisecond pulsars by the accretion of Roche-lobe overflow from its companion and its radio lifetime can be comparable to the Hubble time. However, most high-mass BNSs have substantially shorter radio lifetime than the low-mass BNSs, and thus smaller probability being detected via radio emission. Adopting the star formation and metal enrichment history of the Milky Way given by observations, we obtain the survived Galactic BNSs with pulsar components from our population synthesis model and find that their distributions on the diagrams of spin period versus spin-period-time-derivative ($P-\dot{P}$) and orbital period versus eccentricity ($P_{\rm orb}-e$) can well match those of the observed Galactic BNSs. The total mass distribution of the observed Galactic BNSs can also be matched by the model. A significant fraction ($\sim19\%-22\%$) of merging BNSs at redshift $z\sim0$ have masses $\gtrsim3M_\odot$, which seems compatible with the GW observations. Future radio observations may detect many more Galactic BNSs, which will put strong constraint on the spin evolution of BNSs during their formation processes.</description>

      <title>Challenges in Forming Millisecond Pulsar-Black Holes from Isolated Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binaries harboring a millisecond pulsar (MSP) and a black hole (BH) are a key observing target for current and upcoming pulsar surveys. We model the formation and evolution of such binaries in isolation at solar metallicity using the next-generation binary population synthesis code POSYDON. We examine neutron star (NS)-BH binaries where the NS forms first (labeled NSBH), as the NS must be able to spin-up to MSP rotation periods before the BH forms in these systems. We find that NSBHs are very rare and have a birth rate &lt; 1 Myr$^{-1}$ for a Milky Way-like galaxy in our typical models. The NSBH birth rate is 2-3 orders of magnitude smaller than that for NS-BHs where the BH forms first (labeled BHNS). These rates are also sensitive to model assumptions about the supernova (SN) remnant masses, natal kicks, and common-envelope efficiency. We find that 100% of NSBHs undergo a mass ratio reversal before the first SN and up to 64% of NSBHs undergo a double common envelope phase after the mass ratio reversal occurs. Most importantly, no NSBH binaries in our populations undergo a mass transfer phase, either stable or unstable, after the first SN. This implies that there is no possibility of pulsar spin-up via accretion, and thus MSP-BH binaries cannot form. Thus, dynamical environments and processes may provide the only formation channels for such MSP-BH binaries.</description>

      <title>Cellular Dynamics of Herium-rich Detonation on sub-Chandrasekhar Mass White Dwarf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most previous efforts for hydrodynamic studies on detonation in the context of Type Ia supernovae did not take into account the scale of the cellular structure for a criterion in initiation, propagation, quenching, and the resolution requirement of detonation, whereas it is quite common to consider cell sizes in the discussion on terrestrial detonation in chemically reactive systems. In our recent study, the terrestrial cell-based theories, which incorporates the cell-size data acquired in 2D simulations of helium detonation in the double-detonation model, were demonstrated to be a powerful diagnostics in reproducing the thresholds in the initiation and quenching provided by previous studies. In the present study, 2D simulation results of the cellular detonation in the base of white-dwarf (WD) envelope are described in detail, in terms of the dynamic wave morphology and chemical abundance structure. The cellular structure is observed at a range of upstream density and envelope composition explored in the present work. C/O contamination by the WD core material reduces the cell width rapidly, as accelerated by the {\alpha}-capture reaction. It is also indicated that nickel production could be significantly delayed for the C/O-rich composition. The small cell width makes it extremely demanding to resolve the detonation structure in full-star simulations of SNe Ia; this could raise a concern on the robustness of the outcomes of some numerical simulations in terms of the success and failure of detonation. This issue may be overcome by sub-grid modeling that incorporates the cellular dynamics acquired in resolved simulations.</description>

      <title>Is the Spin of the Black Hole in GX 339-4 Negative?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have studied the accreting black hole binary GX 339-4 using two highly accurate broad-band X-ray data sets in very soft spectral states from simultaneous NICER and NuSTAR observations. Simultaneous fitting of both data sets with relativistic models of the disk, its Comptonization and reflection allows us to relatively accurately determine the black-hole mass and spin, and the distance and inclination. However, we find the measured values strongly depend on the used disk model. With the widely used thin-disk Kerr models kerrbb and kerrbb2 (which employ color corrections), we find relatively low masses and strongly negative spins. Then, the models utilizing detailed disk atmospheric spectra, bhspec and slimbh, predict moderately positive spins and high masses. When adding a warm corona above the disk (as proposed before for both AGNs and accreting binaries), we find the spin is weakly constrained, but consistent with zero. In all cases, the fitted inclination is low, $\approx$30-$34^\circ$. For the spin aligned with the binary orbit, the mass function for this binary implies large values of the mass, consistent only with those obtained with either slimbh or warm corona. We also test the disk models for an assumed set of mass, distance and inclination. We find that, e.g., kerrbb yields values of the spin parameter lower than bhspec or slimbh by $\sim$0.2-0.3. Our results confirm previously found strong disk-model dependencies of the measured black-hole spin, now for a low-mass X-ray binary.</description>

      <title>IXPE detection of highly polarized X-rays from the magnetar 1E 1841-045</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) observed for the first time highly polarized X-ray emission from the magnetar 1E 1841-045, targeted after a burst-active phase in August 2024. To date, IXPE has observed four other magnetars during quiescent periods, highlighting substantially different polarization properties. 1E 1841-045 exhibits a high, energy-dependent polarization degree, which increases monotonically from ~15% at 2-3 keV up to ~55% at 5.5-8 keV, while the polarization angle, aligned with the celestial North, remains fairly constant. The broadband spectrum (2-79 keV) obtained by combining simultaneous IXPE and NuSTAR data is well modeled by a blackbody and two power-law components. The unabsorbed 2-8 keV flux (~2E-11 erg/cm2/s) is about 10% higher than that obtained from archival XMM-Newton and NuSTAR observations. The polarization of the soft, thermal component does not exceed ~25%, and may be produced by a condensed surface or a bombarded atmosphere. The intermediate power law is polarized at around 30%, consistent with predictions for resonant Compton scattering in the star magnetosphere; while, the hard power law exhibits a polarization degree exceeding 65%, pointing to a synchrotron/curvature origin.</description>

      <title>Time-dependent modelling of short-term variability in the TeV-blazar VER J0521+211 during the major flare in 2020</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The BL Lacertae object VER J0521+211 underwent a notable flaring episode in February 2020. A short-term monitoring campaign, led by the MAGIC (Major Atmospheric Gamma Imaging Cherenkov) collaboration, covering a wide energy range from radio to very-high-energy (VHE, 100 GeV &lt; E &lt; 100 TeV) gamma rays was organised to study its evolution. These observations resulted in a consistent detection of the source over six consecutive nights in the VHE gamma-ray domain. Combining these nightly observations with an extensive set of multiwavelength data made modelling of the blazar's spectral energy distribution (SED) possible during the flare. This modelling was performed with a focus on two plausible emission mechanisms: i) a leptonic two-zone synchrotron-self-Compton scenario, and ii) a lepto-hadronic one-zone scenario. Both models effectively replicated the observed SED from radio to the VHE gamma-ray band. Furthermore, by introducing a set of evolving parameters, both models were successful in reproducing the evolution of the fluxes measured in different bands throughout the observing campaign. Notably, the lepto-hadronic model predicts enhanced photon and neutrino fluxes at ultra-high energies (E &gt; 100 TeV). While the photon component, generated via decay of neutral pions, is not directly observable as it is subject to intense pair production (and therefore extinction) through interactions with the cosmic microwave background photons, neutrino detectors (e.g. IceCube) can probe the predicted neutrino component. Finally, the analysis of the gamma-ray spectra, as observed by MAGIC and the Fermi-LAT telescopes, yielded a conservative 95\% confidence upper limit of z \leq 0.244 for the redshift of this blazar.</description>

      <title>Continuous evolution of the polarization properties in the transient X-ray pulsar RX J0440.9+4431/LS V +44 17</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed time-resolved and phase-resolved polarimetric analysis of the transient X-ray pulsar RX J0440.9+4431/LS V +44 17, using data from the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) during the 2023 giant outburst. We conducted a time-resolved analysis by dividing the data into several intervals for each observation. This analysis reveals a continuous rotation of the phase-averaged polarization angle (PA) across the observations performed during the super-critical and sub-critical regimes. To investigate the origin of the PA rotation, we performed a pulse phase-resolved polarimetric analysis over four time intervals, each spanning approximately three days. Applying the rotating vector model (RVM), the geometric parameters of the system were determined for each interval. Despite the short time gap of just $\sim$ 20 days, we observed significant variation in the RVM parameters between the first interval and the subsequent three, indicating the presence of an additional polarized component alongside the RVM component. Using a two-polarized component model with the assumption that this additional component remains constant across pulse phases, we calculated the phase-averaged PA and polarized flux of both the variable and constant components. The phase-averaged PA of each component remained relatively stable over time, but the polarized flux of the constant component decreased, while that of the variable component increased. The observed rotation of the PA is attributed to the gradual shift in the polarized flux ratio between the two components and is not directly related to the different accretion regimes.</description>

      <title>X-ray polarization of the magnetar 1E 1841-045 in outburst</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on IXPE and NuSTAR observations that began forty days following the onset of the 2024 outburst of the magnetar 1E 1841-045, marking the first ever IXPE observation of a magnetar in an enhanced state. Our spectropolarimetric analysis indicates that a non-thermal double power-law (PL) spectral model can fit the phase-averaged intensity data well, with the soft and hard components dominating below and above around 5 keV, respectively. We find that the soft PL exhibits a polarization degree (PD) of about 20% while the hard X-ray PL displays a PD of about 50%; both components have a polarization angle (PA) compatible with 0 degree. These results are supported through model-independent polarization analysis which shows an increasing PD from about 15% to 70% in the 2-3 keV and 6-8 keV ranges, respectively, while the PA remains consistent with 0 degree. We find marginal evidence for variability in the polarization properties with pulse phase, namely a higher PD at spin phases coinciding with the peak in the hard X-ray pulse. We compare the hard X-ray PL to the expectation from direct resonant inverse Compton scattering (RICS) and secondary pair cascade synchrotron radiation from primary high-energy RICS photons, finding that both can provide reasonable spectropolarimetric agreement with the data, yet, the latter more naturally. Finally, we suggest that the soft power law X-ray component may be emission emanating from a Comptonized corona in the inner magnetosphere.</description>

Abstract: The fact that the standard dispersion relation for photons in vacuum could be modified because of their interaction with the quantum nature of spacetime has been proposed more than two decades ago. A quantitative model [Jacob \&amp; Piran, JCAP 01, 031 (2008)], has been tested extensively using distant highly energetic astrophysical sources, searching for energy-dependent time delays in photon arrival times. Since no delay was firmly measured, lower limits were set on the energy scale $\Lambda$ related to these effects. In recent years, however, different but equally well-grounded expressions beyond the Jacob \&amp; Piran model were obtained for the photon dispersion relation, leading to different expressions for the dependence of lag versus redshift. This article introduces a general parameterization of modified dispersion relations in cosmological symmetry, which directly leads to a general parameterized lag versus redshift dependence encompassing both existing and new models. This parameterization could be used in the future to compare the predicted time lags of the different models and test them against observations. To investigate this possibility, realistic data sets are simulated, mimicking different types of extragalactic sources as detected by current and future instruments. When no lag is injected in the simulated data, each lag-redshift model leads, as expected, to a different value for the limit on $\Lambda$, and the Jacob \&amp; Piran model gives the most stringent bound. When a lag at $\Lambda \sim E_P$ in the Jacob \&amp; Piran model is injected, it is detected for all the other lag-redshift relations considered, although leading to different values. Finally, the possibility to discriminate between several lag-redshift models is investigated, emphasizing the importance of an evenly distributed sample of sources across a wide range of redshifts.</description>

      <title>Self-organized critical characteristics of TeV-photons from GRB 221009A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The very high-energy afterglow in GRB 221009A, known as the `Brightest Of All Time' (B.O.A.T.), has been thoroughly analyzed in previous studies. In this paper, we conducted a statistical analysis of the waiting time behavior of 172 TeV photons from the B.O.A.T. observed by LHAASO-KM2A. The following results were obtained: (I) The waiting time distribution (WTD) of these photons deviates from the exponential distribution. (II) The behavior of these photons exhibits characteristics resembling those of a self-organized critical system, such as power-law distribution and scale-invariance features in the waiting time distribution. The power-law distribution of waiting times is consistent with the prediction of a non-stationary process. (III) The relationship between the power-law slopes of the WTD and the scale-invariant characteristics of the Tsallis q-Gaussian distribution deviates from existing theory. We suggest that this deviation is due to the photons not being completely independent of each other. In summary, the power-law and scale-free characteristics observed in these photons imply a self-organized critical process in the generation of TeV photons from GRB 221009A. Based on other relevant research, we propose that the involvement of a partially magnetically dominated component and the continuous energy injection from the central engine can lead to deviations in the generation of TeV afterglow from the simple external shock-dominated process, thereby exhibiting the self-organized critical characteristics mentioned above.</description>

      <title>Black hole spectroscopy and nonlinear echoes in Einstein-Maxwell-scalar theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the context of Einstein-Maxwell-scalar theory with a nonminimal coupling between the electromagnetic and scalar field, we study linear (non)radial perturbations and nonlinear radial dynamics of spherically symmetric black holes. In a certain region of the parameter space, this theory admits hairy black holes with a stable photon sphere. This has a counterpart in the effective potential of linear perturbations, featuring multiple maxima and minima. The corresponding quasinormal mode spectrum contains long-lived modes trapped in the potential cavity and the time-domain linear response displays echoes, as previously observed for horizonless compact objects. Interestingly, the black-hole dynamics in this theory can be studied at the nonlinear level. By performing fully-fledged 1+1 simulations, we show that echoes are present even when the nonlinearities are significant. To our knowledge, this is the first example of echoes appearing in a consistent theory beyond a linearized analysis. In a follow-up work we will study whether this feature is also present in the post-merger signal from black hole collisions in this theory.</description>

      <title>Non-equatorial scalar rings supported by rapidly spinning Gauss-Bonnet black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Black-hole spacetimes that possess stationary equatorial matter rings are known to exist in general relativity. We here reveal the existence of black-hole spacetimes that support {\it non}-equatorial matter rings. In particular, it is proved that rapidly-rotating Kerr black holes in the dimensionless large-spin regime ${\bar a}&gt;{\bar a}_{\text{crit}}= \sqrt{\big\{{{7+\sqrt{7}\cos\big[{1\over3}\arctan\big(3\sqrt{3}\big)\big]- \sqrt{21}\sin\big[{1\over3}\arctan\big(3\sqrt{3}\big)\big]}\big\}/12}}\simeq0.78$ can support a pair of non-equatorial massive scalar rings which are negatively coupled to the Gauss-Bonnet curvature invariant of the spinning spacetime (here ${\bar a}\equiv J/M^2$ is the dimensionless angular momentum of the central supporting black hole). We explicitly prove that these non-equatorial scalar rings are characterized by the dimensionless functional relation $-{{57+28\sqrt{21}\cos\big[{1\over3}\arctan\big({{1}\over{3\sqrt{3}}}\big)\big]} \over{8(1+\sqrt{1-{\bar a}^2})^6}} \cdot{{\bar\eta}\over{{\bar\mu}^2}}\to 1^{+}$ in the large-mass ${\bar\mu}\equiv M\mu\gg1$ regime (here $\{{\bar\eta}&lt;0,\mu\}$ are respectively the non-trivial coupling parameter of the composed Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet-massive-scalar field theory and the proper mass of the supported non-minimally coupled scalar field).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supermassive black holes are prevalent at the centers of massive galaxies, and their masses scale with galaxy properties, increasing evidence suggesting that these trends continue to low stellar masses. Seeds are needed for supermassive black holes, especially at the highest redshifts explored by the James Webb Space Telescope. We study the hierarchical merging of galaxies via cosmological merger trees and argue that the seeds of supermassive black holes formed in nuclear star clusters via stellar black hole mergers at early epochs. Observable tracers include intermediate-mass black holes, nuclear star clusters, and early gas accretion in host dwarf galaxies, along with a potentially detectable stochastic gravitational wave background, ejection of intermediate and supermassive black holes, and consequences of a significant population of tidal disruption events and extreme-mass ratio inspirals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Aether Scalar Tensor (AeST) theory is an extension of general relativity(GR) successful at reproducing galactic rotational curves, gravitational lensing, linear large scale structure and cosmic microwave background power spectrum observations. We solve the most general static spherically symmetric vacuum equations in the strong-field regime of AeST and find two classes of stealth black hole solutions -- those with exact GR geometries -- containing non-trivial secondary hair. In particular, one of these can be continuously joined to the cosmological solution of AeST. We also derive a non-black hole solution with zero spatial component in the vector field. This result proves the existence of mathematically and observationally consistent candidates for black holes in AeST, and creates a basis for testing the theory in the strong-field regime.</description>

      <title>Tethered Balloons for Radio Detection of Neutrinos?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The long-duration balloon platform for radio detection of energetic neutrinos, pioneered by ANITA, affords large instantaneous effective areas but has limited livetime. Conversely, tethered balloons, traditionally used for radio detection of non-science objectives (such as electronic surveillance), allow for much longer livetimes, albeit at significantly lower altitudes. In this contribution, a tethered balloon platform for neutrino detection is considered, including estimates of the neutrino sensitivity and a discussion the feasibility of such a platform. Both the Askaryan and tau-neutrino induced Extensive Air Shower channels are explored as target science data for the platform. Tethered balloons locations on ice sheets, land, and in steep valleys or fjords will be considered. Ground-based array calibration and cosmic-ray air shower use cases will also be briefly commented on.</description>

      <title>Neutron stars in 4D Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since the derivation of a well-defined $D\to4$ limit for 4D Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (4DEGB) gravity coupled to a scalar field, there has been considerable interest in testing it as an alternative to Einstein's general theory of relativity. Past work has shown that this theory hosts interesting compact star solutions which are smaller in radius than a Schwarzschild black hole of the same mass in general relativity (GR), though the stability of such objects has been subject to question. In this paper we solve the equations for radial perturbations of neutron stars in the 4DEGB theory with SLy/BSk class EOSs, along with the MS2 EOS, and show that the coincidence of stability and maximum mass points in GR is still present in this modified theory, with the interesting additional feature of solutions re-approaching stability near the black hole solution on the mass-radius diagram. Besides this, as expected from past work, we find that larger values of the 4DEGB coupling $\alpha$ tend to increase the mass of neutron stars of the same radius (due to a larger $\alpha$ weakening gravity) and move the maximum mass points of the solution branches closer to the black hole horizon.</description>

      <title>Optical QPOs with 550 day periodicity in the reverberation mapped broad line quasar PG 1411+442</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this manuscript, optical quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) with 550 day periodicity related to a candidate of sub-pc binary black hole (BBH) system are reported in the reverberation mapped broad line quasar PG 1411+442 but with different line profile of broad H$\alpha$ from that of broad H$\beta$ in its rms spectrum. First, considering sine function to describe the 18.8years-long light curves from the CSS, ASAS-SN and ZTF, 550days periodicity can be confirmed with confidence level higher than 5$\sigma$. Second, the stable 550days optical QPOs can be re-confirmed with confidence levels higher than 5$\sigma$ by the Generalized Lomb-Scargle periodogram, the sine-like phase-folded light curves and the WWZ technique determined power maps. Third, based on simulated light curves by CAR process, confidence level higher than $3.5\sigma$ can be confirmed for the optical QPOs not related to intrinsic AGN variability. Moreover, considering spatial separation of central two BH accreting systems smaller than expected sizes of broad emission line regions (BLRs), central total BH mass higher than $10^6{\rm M_\odot}$ could lead to few effects of supposed BBH systems on estimated virial BH masses. Meanwhile, disk precession is not preferred due to the similar estimated sizes of optical and NUV emission regions, and jet precession can be ruled out due to PG 1411+442 as a radio quiet quasar. The results strongly indicate it would be practicable by applying very different line profiles of broad Balmer emission lines to detect candidates of BBH systems in normal broad line AGN in the near future.</description>

      <title>Composite asymmetric dark matter with a dark photon portal: Multimessenger tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Composite asymmetric dark matter (ADM) is the framework that naturally explains the coincidence of the baryon density and the dark matter density of the Universe. Through a portal interaction sharing particle-antiparticle asymmetries in the Standard Model and dark sectors, dark matter particles, which are dark-sector counterparts of baryons, can decay into antineutrinos and dark-sector counterparts of mesons (dark mesons) or dark photon. Subsequent cascade decay of the dark mesons and the dark photon can also provide electromagnetic fluxes at late times of the Universe. We derive constraints on the lifetime of dark matter decay in the composite ADM scenario from the astrophysical observations of the $e^+$, $e^-$, and $\gamma$-ray fluxes. The constraints from cosmic-ray positron measurements by AMS-02 are the most stringent at $\gtrsim2$ GeV: a lifetime should be larger than the order of $10^{26}$ s, corresponding to the cutoff scale of the portal interaction of about $10^8 \text{--} 10^9 \, \mathrm{GeV}$. We also show the importance of neutrino observations with Super-Kamiokande and Hyper-Kamiokande, which give conservative bounds.</description>

Abstract: We present Vela.jl, an efficient, modular, easy-to-use Bayesian pulsar timing and noise analysis package written in Julia. Vela.jl provides an independent, efficient, and parallelized implementation of the full non-linear pulsar timing and noise model along with a Python binding named pyvela. One-time operations such as data file input, clock corrections, and solar system ephemeris computations are performed by pyvela with the help of the PINT pulsar timing package. Its reliability is ensured via careful design utilizing Julia's type system, strict version control, and an exhaustive test suite. This paper describes the design and usage of Vela.jl focusing on the narrowband paradigm.</description>

      <title>Constraining neutron star properties through parity-violating electron scattering experiments and relativistic point coupling interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parity-violating electron scattering experiments on $\rm ^{48}Ca$ (CREX) and $\rm ^{208}Pb$ (PREX-II) offer valuable insight into the isovector properties of finite nuclei, providing constraints for the density dependence of the nuclear equation of state, which is crucial for understanding astrophysical phenomena. In this work, we establish functional dependencies between the properties of finite nuclei - such as weak charge form factors and neutron skin thickness - and the bulk properties of neutron stars, including tidal deformability from binary neutron star mergers and neutron star radii. The dependencies are formulated by introducing a family of $\beta$-equilibrated equations of state based on relativistic energy density functionals with point coupling interactions. The charge minus the weak form factors derived from CREX and PREX-II measurements, combined with the observational constraints on tidal deformability from the GW170817 event, are used to constrain the symmetry energy and neutron star radii. Notably, the energy density expanded up to the fourth order in symmetry energy yields larger radii compared to calculations limited to the second order term. However, the results reveal a discrepancy between the constraints provided by the CREX and PREX-II experiments. For a more quantitative assessment, higher precision parity-violating electron scattering data and neutron star observations are required.</description>

      <title>Chaotic orbital dynamics of pulsating stars around black holes surrounded by dark matter halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the orbital dynamics of spherical test bodies in ``black hole surrounded by dark matter halo'' spherically symmetric spacetimes. When the test body pulsates periodically (such as a variable star), altering its quadrupole tensor, Melnikov's method shows that its orbital dynamics presents homoclinic chaos near the corresponding unstable circular orbits however small the oscillation amplitude is. Since for supermassive black holes the period of revolution of a star near the innermost stable circular orbit roughly spans time intervals from minutes to hours, the formalism can be applied in principle to the astrophysical scenario of a pulsating (variable) star inspiraling into a supermassive black hole, including the black hole SgrA* at the center of our Galaxy. The chaotic nature of its orbit, due to pulsation, is imprinted in the redshift time series of the emitted light and can, in principle, be observed in the corresponding light curves and even in gravitational-wave signals detected by future observatories such as the Laser Inteferometer Space Antenna. Also, although periodic with respect to the star's proper time, the chaotic orbital motion will produce an erratic light curve (and gravitational-wave signal) in terms of observed, coordinate time. Although our results were obtained for a specific exact solution, we argue that this phenomenon is generic for pulsating bodies immersed in black hole spacetimes surrounded by self-gravitating fluids.</description>

      <title>Adding interferometric lightning detection to the Pierre Auger Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Pierre Auger Observatory has detected downward terrestrial gamma-ray flashes (TGFs) with its Surface Detector. A key to understanding this high-energy radiation in thunderstorms is to combine such measurements with measurements of lightning processes in their earliest stages. With eleven modified Auger Engineering Radio Array (AERA) stations we can build an interferometric lightning detection array working in the bandwidth between 30 - 80 MHz inside the Surface Detector array to precisely measure lightning stepped leaders in 3D. These measurements allow us to decipher the cause of TGFs and clarify the reason for the observed high-energy particles in thunderstorms. We will present the current status of the detection plans including the configuration of the interferometric lightning detection array and the steps to take as well as the reconstruction characteristics obtained with AERA.</description>

      <title>X-ray Variability in the Symbiotic Binary RT Cru: Principal Component Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17161v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hard X-ray-emitting ($\delta$-type) symbiotic binaries, which exhibit a strong hard X-ray excess, have posed a challenge to our understanding of accretion physics in degenerate dwarfs. RT Cru, which is a member of the $\delta$-type symbiotics, shows stochastic X-ray variability. Timing analyses of X-ray observations from XMM-Newton and NuSTAR, which we consider here, indicate hourly fluctuations, in addition to a spectral transition from 2007 to a harder state in 2012 seen with Suzaku observations. To trace the nature of X-ray variability, we analyze the multi-mission X-ray data using principal component analysis (PCA), which determines the spectral components that contribute most to the flickering behavior and the hardness transition. The Chandra HRC-S/LETG and XMM-Newton EPIC-pn data provide the primary PCA components, which may contain some variable emission features, especially in the soft excess. Additionally, the absorbing column (first order with 50%), along with the source continuum (20%), and a third component (9%) - which likely accounts for thermal emission in the soft band - are the three principal components found in the Suzaku XIS1 observations. The PCA components of the NuSTAR data also correspond to the continuum and possibly emission features. Our findings suggest that the spectral hardness transition between the two Suzaku observations is mainly due to changes in the absorbing material and X-ray continuum, while some changes in the thermal plasma emission may result in flickering-type variations.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric signal separation in very-high-energy gamma ray observations with probabilistic neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01329v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An intriguing challenge in observational astronomy is the separation signals in areas where multiple signals intersect. A typical instance of this in very-high-energy (VHE, E$\gtrsim$100 GeV) gamma-ray astronomy is the issue of residual background in observations. This background arises when cosmic-ray protons are mistakenly identified as gamma-rays from sources of interest, thereby blending with signals from astrophysical sources of interest. We introduce a deep ensemble approach to determine a non-parametric estimation of source and background signals in VHE gamma observations, as well as a likelihood-derived epistemic uncertainty on these estimations. We rely on minimal assumptions, exploiting the separability of space and energy components in the signals, and defining a small region in coordinate space where the source signal is assumed to be negligible compared to background signal. The model is applied both on mock observations, including a simple toy case and a realistic simulation of dark matter annihilation in the Galactic center, as well as true observations from the public H.E.S.S. data release, specifically datasets of the Crab nebula and the pulsar wind nebula MSH 15-52. Our method performs well in mock cases, where the ground truth is known, and compares favorably against conventional physical analysis approaches when applied to true observations. In the case of the mock dark matter signal in the Galactic center, our work opens new avenues for component separation in this complex region of the VHE sky.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the parameters of keV-scale mass annihilating Dark Matter obtained with SRG/ART-XC observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18371v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we present new constraints on the velocity-independent cross section of keV-scale mass annihilating Dark Matter particles obtained with SRG/ART-XC after 4 full-sky surveys. These constraints are derived from observations of the Milky Way Halo, 33 Local Group spheroidal dwarf (dSph) galaxies and separately for the dSph galaxy Ursa Major III/UNIONS 1. The constraints from the Milky Way Halo are the strongest among others and among all available in literature for this class of Dark Matter models with particle masses from 4 to 15 keV.</description>

      <title>Spectral features and variable circular polarisation in the radio emission from the pre-cataclysmic variable QS Vir</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24157v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: QS Vir is a low-accretion rate cataclysmic variable (CV), or pre-CV, as the M dwarf companion is just filling its Roche lobe. We recently identified radio emission from QS Vir in the Very Large Array Sky Survey, at a flux of ~1 mJy. The origin of radio emission from CVs is not fully understood, with evidence for synchrotron emission from jets and other coherent plasma emission processes, such as electron cyclotron maser emission (ECME) or plasma radiation. Our aim is to constrain the radio emission mechanism for QS Vir, through spectroscopic, polarisation, and time variability measurements, all while checking for correlated X-ray variations. We took 3 epochs of new observations with the VLA in S, C, and X bands, with full Stokes polarisation information, complemented by near-simultaneous Swift/XRT X-ray data. Radio spectra are extracted to search for emission features characteristic of coherent plasma emission processes (e.g. high circular polarisation and narrow-band emission). We fit the X-ray spectra with absorbed power-laws, finding no strong X-ray variability. QS Vir showed a nearly flat radio spectrum, with fluxes of 0.4-0.6 mJy in all bands. Swift/XRT showed L_X ~ 5x10^29 erg/s in all observations. We identified strong, variable circular polarisation, ranging from 33+/-3% in S band in the last observation, to &lt;11% in the middle observation in all bands. Linear polarisation was not detected, with upper limits of at most 15%. Intriguingly, the S-band spectra show circularly polarised spectral bumps (width ~0.5 GHz) that rise and decay within &lt;5 minutes. We suggest that the radio emission from QS Vir consists of two components: a relatively constant, low-polarisation flat-spectrum component and a band-limited, rapidly variable, and strongly circularly polarised component. This latter coherent component may be associated with ECME or plasma radiation.</description>

      <title>CORSIKA 8 with Pythia 8: Simulating Vertical Proton Showers</title>

Abstract: The field of air shower physics, dedicated to understanding the development of cosmic-ray interactions with the Earth's atmosphere, faces a significant challenge regarding the muon content of air showers observed by the Pierre Auger Observatory, and numerous other observatories. Thorough comparisons between extensive air shower (EAS) measurements and simulations are imperative for determining the primary energy and mass of ultra-high energy cosmic rays. Current simulations employing state-of-the-art hadronic interaction models reveal a muon deficit compared to experimental measurements, commonly known as the "Muon Puzzle". The primary cause of this deficit lies in the uncertainties surrounding high-energy hadronic interactions. In this contribution, we discuss the integration of a new hadronic interaction model, Pythia 8, into the effort to resolve the Muon Puzzle. While the Pythia 8 model is well-tailored in the context of Large Hadron Collider (LHC) experiments, its application in air shower studies remained limited until now. However, recent advancements, particularly in the Angantyr model of Pythia 8, offer promising enhancements in describing hadron-nucleus interactions, thereby motivating its potential application in air shower simulations. We present results from EAS simulations conducted using CORSIKA 8, wherein Pythia is employed to model hadronic interactions.</description>

      <title>Status of the CORSIKA 8 particle-shower simulation code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15097v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For over two decades, CORSIKA 7 and its previous versions have been the leading Monte Carlo code for simulating extensive air showers. However, its monolithic Fortran-based software design and hand-optimized code has created challenges for maintenance, adaptation to new computing paradigms, and extensions for more complex simulations. Addressing these limitations, the CORSIKA 8 project represents a comprehensive rewrite of CORSIKA 7, seeing its core functionality re-envisioned in a modern and modular C++ framework. CORSIKA 8 has now reached a "physics-complete" state, offering a robust platform that encourages expert development for specialized applications. It supports high-energy hadronic interactions using models such as Sibyll 2.3d, QGSJet-II.04, EPOS-LHC, and Pythia 8.3, alongside the treatment of electromagnetic cascades with PROPOSAL 7.6.2. Key highlights are the support for multiple interaction media, including cross-media particle showers, and an enhanced calculation of radio emissions from particle showers. This contribution provides an overview of the current functionalities, showcases validation results of its simulations, and discusses future development plans.</description>

      <title>Magnetized neutral 2SC color superconductivity and possible origin of the inner magnetic field of magnetars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12356v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper the neutral 2SC phase of color superconductivity is investigated in the presence of a magnetic field and for diquark coupling constants and baryonic densities that are expected to characterize neutron stars. Specifically, the behavior of the charged gluons Meissner masses is investigated in the parameter region of interest taking into account, in addition, the contribution of a rotated magnetic field. It is found that up to moderately-high diquark coupling constants the mentioned Meissner masses become tachyonic independently of the applied magnetic-field amplitude, hence signalizing the chromomagnetic instability of this phase. To remove the instability, the restructuring of the system ground state is proposed, which now will be formed by vortices of the rotated charged gluons. These vortices boost the applied magnetic field having the most significant increase for relatively low applied magnetic fields. Finally, considering that with the stellar rotational frequency observed for magnetars a field of the order of $10^8$ G can be generated by dynamo effect, we show that by the boosting effect just described the field can be amplified to $10^{17}$ G that is in the range of inner core fields expected for magnetars. Thus, we conclude that the described mechanism could be the one responsible for the large fields characterizing magnetars if the cores of these compact objects are formed by neutral 2SC matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00087v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A number of new balloon or space-based gamma-ray observatories have been proposed to close a "MeV gap" in sensitivity to gamma rays in the MeV-GeV energy band. One aspect of the science case for these instruments is their ability to constrain or discover decaying or annihilating dark matter. In this work, we forecast the sensitivity of these instruments for dark matter annihilation or decay for a range of possible Standard Model final states and compare to existing bounds.</description>
