      <title>Time-Incremented Multiscale Evolution (TIME): A Code-Independent Method for Time-Domain 3D Hydrodynamics and its Application to Roche Lobe Overflow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Many critical physical processes, such as Roche lobe overflow, strain modern simulation methods due to their durations and multidimensionality. Aims. We employ a novel method of time-domain multidimensional simulations to provide the first grid-based time domain 3D model of Roche lobe overflow using VH-1. Methods. Using a piecewise approach which alternates between high-resolution 3D dynamic modeling and computationally fast evolutionary modeling, we present and test a method capable of self-scaling variable time resolution at greatly reduced computational cost. Results. We find mass transfer in the test high mass x-ray binary M33 X-7 to be unstable and fully conservative in both mass and angular momentum transport onto the accretion disk beyond f &gt;~ 1.01. This phase begins on thermal timescales and accelerates to span &lt; 100 yrs beyond f &gt;= 1.1, while the non-conservative stable phase of f &lt;~ 1.01 occurs on roughly nuclear timescales. Conclusions. We identify a critical point f ~ 1.01 which terminates stable overflow, which may correspond to the point Mdot_L1 ~ Mdot_wind or Mdot_L1 ~ 10^-6 M_solar/yr in the general case.</description>

      <title>Convection-Driven Multi-Scale Magnetic Fields Determine the Observed Solar-Disk Gamma Rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The solar disk is a continuous source of GeV--TeV gamma rays. The emission is thought to originate from hadronic Galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) interacting with the gas in the photosphere and uppermost convection zone after being reflected by solar magnetic fields. Despite this general understanding, existing theoretical models have yet to match observational data. At the photosphere and the uppermost convection zone, granular convection drives a multi-scale magnetic field, forming a larger-scale filamentary structure while also generating turbulence-scale Alfv\'{e}n wave turbulence. Here, we demonstrate that the larger-scale filamentary field shapes the overall gamma-ray emission spectrum, and the Alfv\'{e}n wave turbulence is critical for further suppressing the gamma-ray emission spectrum below $\sim 100$~GeV. For a standard Alfv\'{e}n wave turbulence level, our model's predicted spectrum slope from 1~GeV to 1~TeV is in excellent agreement with observations from Fermi-LAT and HAWC, an important achievement. The predicted absolute flux is a factor of 2--5 lower than the observed data; we outline future directions to resolve this discrepancy. The key contribution of our work is providing a new theoretical framework for using solar disk gamma-ray observations to probe hadronic GCR transport in the lower solar atmosphere.</description>

      <title>Can Big Black Holes Merge with the Smallest Black Holes?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational-wave measurements of the binary black hole population provide insights into the evolution of merging binaries. We explore potential correlation between mass and mass ratio with phenomenological population models where the minimum mass of the smaller (secondary) black hole can change with the mass of the bigger (primary) black hole. We use binary black hole signals from the third Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog with and without the relatively extreme mass-ratio GW190814. When excluding GW190814, models with a variable minimum mass are disfavoured compared to one with a constant minimum mass, with log Bayes factors of -2.49 to -0.98, indicating that the biggest black holes can merge with the smallest. When including GW190814, a parabola model that allows the minimum mass to decrease with increasing primary mass is favoured over a constant minimum-mass model with a log Bayes factor of 4.44. When allowing the minimum mass to decrease, the overall population distributions remain similar whether or not GW190814 is included. This shows that with added model flexibility, we can reconcile potential outlier observations within our population. These investigations motivate further explorations of correlations between mass ratio and component masses in order to understand how evolutionary processes may leave an imprint on these distributions.</description>

      <title>Unveiling blazar synchrotron emission: a multiwavelength polarimetric study of HSP and LSP populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarimetric properties of blazars allow us to put constraints on the acceleration mechanisms that fuel their powerful jets. By studying the multiwavelength polarimetric behaviour of high synchrotron peaked (HSP) and low synchrotron peaked (LSP) blazars, we aim to explore differences in their emission mechanisms and magnetic field structure in the acceleration region. In this study, we take advantage of several X-ray polarisation observations of HSP by the IXPE, including four new observations of Mrk 501, and optical polarisation observations of LSP from RoboPol and many others. We find that the polarisation degree (PD) distribution of HSP in X-rays is systematically higher than in optical and mm-radio wavelengths, as reported in previous IXPE publications. The distribution of the X-ray electric vector position angles (PA) is centered around the jet axis with most of the observations consistent with zero difference within uncertainties. In fact, the distribution of the offset of the PA from the jet axis is consistent between the LSP and HSP populations (with PA measured in optical for the first, X-ray for the latter), suggesting a common magnetic field structure close to the acceleration region, in strong support of the emerging energy stratified picture of particle acceleration followed by energy loss in blazar jets.</description>

      <title>Parsec-scale jet precession and a putative supermassive binary black hole system in the blazar AO 0235+164</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The blazar AO 0235+164 is a key source for studying the interplay between multi-wavelength variability in its light curves and changes in the position angles and apparent velocities of its parsec-scale jet components. In this work, we analyse public interferometric radio maps of AO 0235+164 at 15 and 43 GHz, using the Cross Entropy global optimisation technique to determine the structural parameters of its jet components. We identified 36 kinematically distinct jet components across all sky quadrants, indicating a highly relativistic parsec-scale jet with a minimum Lorentz factor of 34 +/- 7 and a maximum viewing angle of 37 +/- 8 degree. The temporal evolution of these jet components was modelled as a relativistic jet under a constant precession rate. The optimal clockwise precession model has a precession period of 8.4 +\- 0.2 years, consistent with the 8.13-year periodicity previously detected in optical light curves, besides providing a time-variable Doppler boosting factor correlated with the most intense flares at gamma-ray energies. For the counter-clockwise precession, a period of 6.0 +\- 0.1 years is found, compatible with the 5-6 year periodicities detected at radio and optical wavelengths. It is plausible that a supermassive black hole binary system in the nucleus of AO 0235+164 drives the parsec-scale jet precession and induces nodding motions consistent with short-term continuum periodicities. Nonetheless, alternative scenarios (e.g., intrinsic curved jet, warped accretion disc instabilities, Lense-Thirring/Bardeen-Petterson effects, dual jets) cannot be ruled out as causes or optional explanations for the precession.</description>

      <title>Compact Objects in Globular Clusters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is now widely established that globular clusters host robust populations of white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes throughout their lifetimes. Within clusters, dynamical processes enabled by stellar densities thousands to millions of times larger than typical galactic environments facilitate interactions involving these stellar remnants that give rise to an array of astrophysical phenomena. In particular, stellar clusters have emerged as an important formation site for X-ray sources, radio pulsars, and merging black hole binaries similar to those recently detected as gravitational wave sources by the LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA detectors. This article reviews our current understanding of compact objects in globular clusters, discussing current observational evidence, ways these objects influence the dynamical evolution of their hosts, and future prospects.</description>

      <title>Machine learning classification of black holes in the mass--spin diagram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the mass--spin diagram for classifying black holes and studying their formation pathways, providing an analogue to the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. This allows for black hole evolutionary tracks as a function of redshift, combining formation, accretion, and merger histories for the variety of black hole populations. A realistic black hole continuum constructed from initial mass and spin functions and approximate redshift evolution reveals possible black hole main sequences, such as sustained coherent accretion through cosmic time (i.e., Cosmic Accretion) or hierarchical merger trees. In the stellar-mass regime, we use a binary population synthesis software to compare three spin prescriptions for tidal evolution of Wolf-Rayet progenitors, showing how the mass--spin diagram exposes interesting modeling differences. We then classify black hole populations by applying supervised and unsupervised machine learning clustering methods to mass--spin datasets. While bare unsupervised clustering can nearly recover canonical population boundaries (stellar-mass, intermediate-mass, and supermassive), a more sophisticated approach utilizing deep learning via variational autoencoders for latent space representation learning aids in clustering of realistic datasets with subclasses that highly overlap in mass--spin space. We find that a supervised random forest can accurately recover the correct clusters from the learned latent space representation depending on the complexity of the underlying dataset, semi-supervised methods show potential for further development, and the performance of unsupervised classifiers is a great challenge. Our findings motivate future machine learning applications and demonstrate that the mass--spin diagram can be used to connect gravitational-wave and electromagnetic observations with theoretical models.</description>

      <title>Constraining Common Envelope Evolution in Binary Neutron Star Formation with Combined Galactic and Gravitational-Wave Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binary neutron stars (BNSs) are among the most interesting sources for multimessenger studies. A number of recently discovered BNSs in the Milky Way by radio telescopes have added new information to the parameter distribution of the Galactic BNSs. The scarce of BNS mergers during the O4 run of the LIGO-Virgo-Kagra (LVK) suggests a BNS local merger rate six times lower than the previous constraint obtained by O1-O3 runs. With these new multimessenger observations, in this letter, we adopt the compact binary population synthesis model and Bayesian analysis to constrain the formation and evolution of BNSs, especially the common envelope (CE) evolution. We find that it is required: (1) a fraction ($f_{\rm HG}\sim0.8$) but not all of the Hertzsprung gap donors merged with their companions in the CE stage, in order to simultaneously explain the low BNS merger rate density and the existence of the short-orbital-period ($\lesssim 1$ day) Galactic BNSs, different from either all ($f_{\rm HG}=1$) or none ($f_{\rm HG}=0$) adopted in previous studies; (2) a large CE ejection efficiency $\alpha$ ($\sim 5$), in order to explain the existence of the long-orbital-period ($\gtrsim 10$ day) Galactic BNSs.</description>

      <title>Parkes transient events: II. Pulsar single pulses database containing raw data segment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have re-processed single pulse candidates from the first four years (1997-2001) of the Parkes Multibeam receiver system observations, creating a new Parkes transient database (PTD II) that contains 165,592 single pulses from 363 known pulsars. Unlike previous databases, PTD II preserves the critical raw data segments of each detected pulse, enabling detailed analyses of emission physics while maintaining a compact size of only 1.5 GB. The database employs a sqlite3 structure organising pulsar metadata, observation files, and pulse events with their raw data stored in binary format. We provide processing tools for extracting and analysing single-pulse data, enabling fluence fitting and statistical analysis. Our pulsars exhibit diverse fluence distributions, such as log-normal, Gaussian, and unimodal. Temporal analyses reveal significant evolution in emission characteristics of several pulsars, including event rate variations spanning two orders of magnitude in PSR J1602-5100 and PSR J0942-5552. Beyond supporting fundamental pulsar emission studies, the database serves as a valuable training resource for developing new single-pulse detection algorithms in the presence of radio frequency interference.</description>

      <title>High-resolution Radio Study of Pulsar Wind Nebula MSH 15-52 and Supernova Remnant RCW 89</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present high-resolution radio observations of the pulsar wind nebula (PWN) MSH15-52, which is renowned for its distinctive hand-like shape, and its associated supernova remnant RCW 89. Using the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA), we obtained 3 and 6,cm radio maps with a resolution of 2 arcsec. These unveil small-scale radio features in the system and allow a direct comparison with the arcsecond-resolution X-ray images. We find that the radio emission is composed of a complex filamentary structure. In particular, there is a bar-like feature across the central pulsar B1509-58 in the inner PWN, and the radio sheath wrapping around the pulsar also appears to be made up of filaments. Some prominent X-ray features are not detected in radio, including the one-sided jet in the south and the finger-like structures in the north. These indicates turn over of the particle distribution at low energies in these regions. For RCW 89, the radio emission well coincides with both the X-ray knots and the H{\alpha} filaments. The high polarization fraction shows that the emission is synchrotron in nature, but it extends well beyond the sharp boundary of the non-thermal X-ray emission, which is difficult to explain.</description>

      <title>MUSE Observations Reveal Optical Coronal Iron Lines from Shock Emission in Supernova Remnant 0540-69.3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the optical shock emission from the Large Magellanic Cloud supernova remnant 0540-69.3 (SNR 0540) using MUSE integral-field-unit data from the VLT. The observations cover the spectral range 4650-9300 $\r{A}$ and provide a $1\times1$ arcmin$^{2}$ field of view, encompassing nearly the entire remnant. We analyse the spatial and spectral properties of shock-related emission lines, and identify clumpy optical shock emission e.g. from [S II] $\lambda\lambda$6716,6731 doublet and the coronal [Fe XIV] $\lambda$5303 line (typically at radial velocities $\lesssim|100|$ km s$^{-1}$ and $\lesssim|170|$ km s$^{-1}$, respectively). These features trace the blast-wave shell seen in previous X-ray studies. Post-shock electron density estimates, based on the [S II]-line ratio, reveal spatial variation, with the highest densities ($\sim10^4$ cm$^{-3}$) in the bright knots in the west, and lower densities ($\sim3\times10^3$ cm$^{-3}$) in the east. The density in the north (southwest) appears significantly lower (higher) but remains unconstrained due to limited signal. We also estimate blast-wave shock velocities using the [Fe XIV] $\lambda$5303/[Fe XI] $\lambda$7892 ratio, finding low velocities ($\sim400$ km s$^{-1}$), consistent with previous studies. All these results support the scenario that the blast wave is interacting with the surrounding interstellar medium, particularly in the western regions. Additionally, we detect four unidentified emission lines, $\sim$2000-3000 km s$^{-1}$ south from the pulsar in transverse velocity, but their origin remains unclear. Possible explanations, including Fe lines from a high-velocity ejecta clump, all present challenges. Our findings highlight the complex nature of the circum- and interstellar medium surrounding SNR 0540.</description>

      <title>SN 2024hpj: a perspective on SN 2009ip-like events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supernovae (SNe) IIn are terminal explosions of massive stars that are surrounded by a dense circumstellar medium (CSM). Among SNe IIn, a notable subset is the SNe 2009ip-like, which exhibit an initial, fainter peak attributed to stellar variability in the late evolutionary stages, followed by a brighter peak, interpreted as the SN explosion itself. We analyse the spectrophotometric evolution of SN 2024hpj, a SN IIn with signs of precursor activity. Comparing it with similar objects in the literature, we identify star-forming regions as their preferred environments, while a statistical analysis on the observed rate of SNe 2009ip-like indicates progenitor masses around 25 - 31 solar masses and lower. The diversity of spectrophotometric features within the sample suggests that variations in CSM mass and distribution influence the observed characteristics, indicating a shared progenitor scenario.</description>

      <title>The radio flare and multi-wavelength afterglow of the short GRB 231117A: energy injection from a violent shell collision</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the early radio detection and multi-wavelength modeling of the short gamma-ray burst (GRB) 231117A at redshift $z=0.257$. The Australia Telescope Compact Array automatically triggered a 9-hour observation of GRB 231117A at 5.5 and 9 GHz following its detection by the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory just 1.3 hours post-burst. Splitting this observation into 1-hour time bins, the early radio afterglow exhibited flaring, scintillating and plateau phases. The scintillation allowed us to place the earliest upper limit ($&lt;10$ hours) on the size of a GRB blast wave to date, constraining it to $&lt;1\times10^{16}$ cm. Multi-wavelength modeling of the full afterglow required a period of significant energy injection between $\sim 0.02$ and $1$ day. The energy injection was modeled as a violent collision of two shells: a reverse shock passing through the injection shell explains the early radio plateau, while an X-ray flare is consistent with a shock passing through the leading impulsive shell. Beyond 1 day, the blast wave evolves as a classic decelerating forward shock with an electron distribution index of $p=1.66\pm0.01$. Our model also indicates a jet-break at $\sim2$ days, and a half-opening angle of $\theta_j=16\mathring{.}6 \pm 1\mathring{.}1$. Following the period of injection, the total energy is $\zeta\sim18$ times the initial impulsive energy, with a final collimation-corrected energy of $E_{\mathrm{Kf}}\sim5.7\times10^{49}$ erg. The minimum Lorentz factors this model requires are consistent with constraints from the early radio measurements of $\Gamma&gt;35$ to $\Gamma&gt;5$ between $\sim0.1$ and $1$ day. These results demonstrate the importance of rapid and sensitive radio follow-up of GRBs for exploring their central engines and outflow behaviour.</description>

      <title>A water Cherenkov detector prototype for future high-energy tau-neutrino experiment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of high-energy tau neutrinos remains a critical challenge in neutrino astronomy, limited by inadequate angular resolution and sensitivity in current detectors like IceCube and KM3NeT. We present a modular water Cherenkov detector prototype optimized for tau-neutrino-induced extensive air showers (EAS) in the 1-100 PeV range, leveraging canyon terrain for natural cosmic-ray shielding. Laboratory validation demonstrates this prototype design has high detection efficiency (&gt;99%) and timing resolution (&lt;2 ns) on MIP particles, enabling precise tau-neutrino-induced EAS reconstruction for future study. The results establish a foundation of a low-cost, scalable neutrino observatory, advancing flavor ratio measurements and cosmic-ray origin problems.</description>

      <title>Particle Injection in 3D Relativistic Magnetic Reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relativistic magnetic reconnection has been proposed as an important nonthermal particle acceleration (NTPA) mechanism that generates power-law spectra and high-energy emissions. Power-law particle spectra are in general characterized by three parameters: the power-law index, the high-energy cutoff, and the low-energy cutoff (i.e., the injection energy). Particle injection into the nonthermal power law, despite also being a critical step in the NTPA chain, has received considerably less attention than the subsequent acceleration to high energies. Open questions on particle injection that are important for both physical understanding and astronomical observations include how the upstream magnetization~$\sigma$ influences the injection energy and the contributions of the known injection mechanisms (i.e., direct acceleration by the reconnection electric field, Fermi kicks, and pickup acceleration) to the injected particle population. Using fully kinetic particle-in-cell simulations, we uncover these relationships by systematically measuring the injection energy and calculating the contributions of each acceleration mechanism to the total injected particle population. We also present a theoretical model to explain these results. Additionally, we compare 2D and 3D simulations to assess the impact of the flux-rope kink and drift-kink instability on particle injection. We conclude with comparisons to previous work and outlook for future work.</description>

      <title>Off-centre convective zones in mass accreting stellar models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the physical origin of transient off-centre convective zones (oCZs) that arise in mass accreting stellar models. Using detailed MESA simulations of binary evolution, we find that these oCZs are not numerical artefacts but emerge due to a local increase in density near the retreating edge of the convective core. The density enhancement raises the local opacity, which amplifies the radiative temperature gradient $\nabla_{\rm rad}$. If this gradient surpasses the Ledoux threshold $\nabla_{\rm L}$, defined by both thermal and compositional stratification, the region becomes convectively unstable. The resulting oCZs are detached from the convective core and transient: mixing within the oCZ erases the local gradient in mean molecular weight, leaving a sharp $\nabla_{\mu}$ discontinuity at the boundary, stabilizing the adjacent layers. This mechanism naturally explains the presence and evolution of oCZs, as previously reported in massive interacting stars.</description>

      <title>Minimum and maximum mass-luminosity relations for stripped stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Envelope stripping, whether through single-star wind mass loss or binary mass transfer, is a key evolutionary pathway for the formation of classical Wolf-Rayet stars and lower-mass stripped helium (He) stars. However, to study the evolution of these objects into black holes, neutron stars, and stripped-envelope supernovae, we need appropriate input models for the core-He burning phase without relying on the uncertain evolution into this evolved phase. Reliable mass-luminosity relations (MLRs) for He stars are needed for stellar wind and evolution studies, but the MLRs currently in literature are either for fully-stripped or chemically homogeneous stars, neither of which reflect the important and recently also observationally confirmed stage of partial stripping. We alleviate this drawback by computing sets of MESA synthetic structure models with partially-stripped chemical profiles, consisting of a pure-He core and a hydrogen (H)-depleted envelope with an H/He chemical gradient left behind from the receding convective core during the main sequence. As the H slope increases from 0 (full chemical homogeneity) to $\infty$ (pure-He stars) in our synthetic models, we find the luminosity to initially increase before eventually decreasing. The maximum luminosity for a given mass is reached for an intermediate H-profile slope corresponding to a partially-stripped structure, exceeding even the values documented for pure-He stars, primarily due to the H shell disproportionately dominating the total luminosity budget. We also provide convenient mass-luminosity fit relations to predict the minimum, maximum, and pure-He luminosities for a given mass -- and vice versa -- while accounting for structures achievable through partial stripping. We also explore the impact of the higher luminosity on the wind properties of partially-stripped configurations using hydrodynamically consistent atmosphere models.</description>

      <title>Development and testing of integrated readout electronics for next generation SiSeRO (Single electron Sensitive Read Out) devices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The first generation of Single electron Sensitive Read Out (SiSeRO) amplifiers, employed as on-chip charge detectors for charge-coupled devices (CCDs) have demonstrated excellent noise and spectral performance: a responsivity of around 800 pA per electron, an equivalent noise charge (ENC) of 3.2 electrons root mean square (RMS), and a full width half maximum (FWHM) energy resolution of 130 eV at 5.9 keV for a readout speed of 625 Kpixel/s. Repetitive Non Destructive Readout (RNDR) has also been demonstrated with these devices, achieving an improved ENC performance of 0.36 electrons RMS after 200 RNDR cycles. In order to mature this technology further, Stanford University, in collaboration with MIT Kavli Institute and MIT Lincoln Laboratory, are developing new SiSeRO detectors with improved geometries that should enable greater responsivity and improved noise performance. These include CCD devices employing arrays of SiSeRO amplifiers to optimize high speed, low noise RNDR readout and a proof-of-concept SiSeRO active pixel sensor (APS). To read out these devices, our team has developed a compact, 8-channel, fast, low noise, low power application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) denoted the Multi-Channel Readout Chip (MCRC) that includes an experimental drain current readout mode intended for SiSeRO devices. In this paper, we present results from the first tests of SiSeRO CCD devices operating with MCRC readout, and our designs for next generation SiSeRO devices.</description>

      <title>Once-in-a-lifetime encounter models for neutrino media II: Quasi-steady states and miscidynamic flavor evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extended the once-in-a-lifetime encounter (OILE) model to stochastic interactions among neutrinos. As in the original OILE model, the new model reproduces the mean-field behavior of a dense neutrino gas for time $t\lesssim (\mu\gamma)^{-1}$, where $\mu$ measures the strength of the mean-field neutrino self-interaction potential and is proportional to the neutrino density, and the dimensionless "impact parameter" $\gamma$ is a measure of the change in the flavor quantum state of a neutrino during interaction with another neutrino when the wave packets of the two neutrinos overlap. As in the mean-field case, the OILE model with random neutrino velocities experiences kinetic flavor decoherence as the flavor quantum states of the neutrinos diverge from each other. Unlike the mean-field case, however, the OILE model has a "collision term" due to the quantum entanglement among neutrinos. For $\gamma\ll1$, this incoherent effect can drive the neutrinos into a quasi-steady state that is similar to the collective precession mode in a homogeneous and isotropic neutrino gas in the mean-field approximation. Subsequently, the collision term drives the neutrino gas adiabatically through different quasi-steady states and eventually to flavor equilibration. This process is an example of miscidynamic flavor evolution, with the mixing equilibria being the quasi-steady precession states.</description>

      <title>Breaking the Baryon Density$\unicode{x2013}$Hubble Constant Degeneracy in Fast Radio Burst Applications with Associated Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are a unique probe of the cosmos, owing to dispersion caused by free electrons in the intergalactic medium (IGM). Two of the main quantities of interest are degenerate: the density of matter $\Omega_\mathrm{b}f_\mathrm{d}$ outside of galaxies and the Hubble constant $H_0$. Here, we present a new possibility of breaking the degeneracy without invoking early Universe priors on $\Omega_\mathrm{b}$. Assuming some FRBs originate in compact object mergers, the combination of dispersion and luminosity distance from the gravitational wave (GW) can be used to measure $\Omega_\mathrm{b}h^2f_\mathrm{d}$ (where $h$ is the dimensionless Hubble constant). We show that this measurement can be combined with the abundant FRBs that have a redshift measurement. This combination breaks the degeneracy with the Hubble constant. We develop a Bayesian framework and forecast that third-generation GW detectors are required to obtain meaningful constraints. We forecast that one year of Einstein Telescope operations can constrain $H_0$ to $\pm 6\,\mathrm{km}\mathrm{s}^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ and $\Omega_\mathrm{b}h^2f_\mathrm{d}$ to $^{+0.0015}_{-0.0016}$ (68$\,\%$ credible interval). The method can also be used with luminosity distances obtained through other means than GWs.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of X-Ray Afterglow Light Curves of GRBs and its implication for constraining Cosmological Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) serve as important cosmological probes, whose X-ray afterglow light curves (LCs) may exhibit a plateau phase (with temporal slope $\alpha$ between 0 and 0.5) that may originate from magnetar energy injection. Similar to Type Ia Supernovae, GRBs with a common physical origin can be used as standardizable candles for cosmological studies. However, observational gaps in GRB light curves introduce significant uncertainties in plateau parameter estimation, thereby affecting cosmological constraints. In this work, we employ a stochastic reconstruction technique to reconstruct the X-ray afterglow LCs for 35 GRB samples exhibiting plateau features, generating 50 simulated data points for each LC. Using the reconstructed LCs, we calibrate three luminosity correlations: the $L_0$-$t_b$, $L_0$-$t_b$-$E_{p,i}$, and $L_0$-$t_b$-$E_{\gamma,\mathrm{iso}}$ relation, which are then applied to constrain both flat and non-flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmological models. The main results include: (i) the $L_0$-$t_b$ relation yields a slope $b \approx -1$, supporting a constant magnetar energy injection rate; (ii) light curve reconstruction has limited impact on cosmological parameter constraints; (iii) for the flat $\Lambda$CDM model constrained by the $L_0$-$t_b$-$E_{p,i}$ relation, the precision of $\Omega_m$ improves by 6.25\%; For the non-flat $\Lambda$CDM model constrained by the $L_0$-$t_b$-$E_{p,i}$ relation, the precision of $\Omega_\Lambda$ improves by 1.01\%. Our findings suggest that increasing the number of LC data points provides limited improvement to cosmological constraints, while expanding the sample size of GRBs with identical physical origins may be more crucial.</description>

      <title>Axion Star Bosenova in Axion Miniclusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Axionic dark matter can form structures known as miniclusters that host an axion star at their center. The axion star feeds on the host, and the axion star mass may grow beyond its stability limit, leading to a potential bosenova. Since a dilute axion star has a stable mass limit only when self-interaction is considered, we include axion self-interaction effects in this paper, and specify the condition for bosenova in the QCD axion and temperature-independent axion-like particle parameter spaces. We find that self-interaction may dominate the mass growth of the axion star. For a minicluster with a large initial overdensity, bosenova occurs in a large fraction of axion parameter space. For the QCD axion, bosenova occurs within the age of the Universe for miniclusters with an initial overdensity $\delta\gtrsim 100$.</description>

      <title>Scrutinizing Fermionic Dark Matter in Scotogenic Model with Low Reheating Temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The scotogenic model provides a minimal and elegant framework that simultaneously explains neutrino masses and accommodates a viable dark matter (DM) candidate. In this work, we investigate the phenomenology of fermionic DM in the scotogenic model, with a particular emphasis on the effects of a non-standard cosmological history characterized by a low reheating temperature. We demonstrate that entropy injection from inflaton decay can significantly dilute the DM abundance, thereby relaxing the annihilation cross section required to reproduce the observed relic density and opening new regions of viable parameter space. We further analyze the complementarity between current and future direct detection experiments and charged lepton flavour violation (cLFV) searches in probing this scenario. Our results show that next-generation direct detection experiments such as DARWIN and XLZD, together with upcoming cLFV searches (in particular the future sensitivity of $\mu \rightarrow 3e$ experiments), will be capable of testing substantial regions of the parameter space, including those associated with low reheating temperatures.</description>

      <title>Hidden (absorbed) Cooling Flows V: Groups and Galaxies including Spirals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cooling flows are observed in X-ray studies of the centres of cool core clusters, galaxy groups and individual elliptical galaxies. They are partly hidden from direct view by embedded cold gas so have been called Hidden Cooling Flows. X-ray spectra from the XMM RGS reveal emission from hot gas modified by photoelectric absorption by cold gas intrinsic to the flow. Here we present the spectral analysis of 6 more low redshift galaxy groups ranging from the nearest fossil group to 2 groups hosting bright radio sources. All reveal absorbed cooling flows. AGN feedback is ineffective in heating the inner cooling gas in groups and elliptical galaxies. We have extended the analysis to include 3 nearby spiral galaxies (the Sombrero, Whirlpool and Sculptor galaxies). They have similar absorbed soft X-ray spectra to elliptical galaxies and may also host cooling flows of 0.3 to 1.1\Msun/yr in their CircumGalactic Medium.</description>

Abstract: We extend the modified Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model -- incorporating exchange interactions via the Fierz transformation -- to finite temperatures in both two- and three-flavor scenarios, and investigate the properties of protoquark stars in $\beta$-equilibrium. Our results show that increasing the strength of exchange interactions, characterized by the parameter $\alpha$, changes the chiral phase transition from first-order to crossover. We examine the effects of finite temperature, lepton fraction, and exchange interactions on the equation of state (EOS), finding that the EOS in the crossover regime is significantly stiffer than in the first-order case. In certain regions of parameter space within the crossover scenario, strange quark matter can support the existence of twin star configurations.</description>

      <title>EECT: an Eccentricity Evolution Consistency Test to distinguish eccentric gravitational-wave signals from eccentricity mimickers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Eccentric compact binary coalescences (CBCs) are expected to be observed in current and future gravitational-wave (GW) detector networks. However, it has been recently pointed out that a number of other physical and beyond-GR effects, could imitate, or be mimicked by, eccentric CBCs. In this work, we propose a conceptually simple but powerful method to directly confirm or reject the eccentric hypothesis, without needing to compare the hypothesis with the plethora of other possible hypotheses. The key idea is that while spurious non-zero values of eccentricity, at some reference frequency, could be acquired when a non-eccentric CBC with additional physical/beyond-GR effects is recovered with an eccentric CBC waveform model, the {\it evolution} of eccentricity with frequency will in general not be mimicked. We accordingly formulate an eccentricity evolution consistency test (EECT). The method compares the eccentricity recovered at some low frequency value (e.g, $10$ Hz), evolved to higher frequencies assuming GR, with eccentricities recovered at those same higher frequencies. Discrepancy between the two eccentricities at any reference frequency would violate EECT and indicate the presence of a mimicker. As a proof of concept, assuming a few eccentric CBC systems, quasi-circular CBCs with additional physics mimicking eccentricity, and an O4-like three-detector-network configuration, we demonstrate that our proposed method is indeed able to reject mimickers at $\geq 68\%$ confidence, while ensuring that truly eccentric CBCs satisfy EECT.</description>

      <title>Test for LISA foreground Gaussianity and stationarity: galactic white-dwarf binaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08263v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Upcoming space-based gravitational-wave detectors will be sensitive to millions and resolve tens of thousands of stellar-mass binary systems at mHz frequencies. The vast majority of these will be double white dwarfs in our Galaxy. The greatest part will remain unresolved, forming an incoherent stochastic foreground signal. Using state-of-the-art Galactic models for the formation and evolution of binary white dwarfs and accurate LISA simulated signals, we introduce a test for foreground Gaussianity and stationarity, building on methods available for ground-based detectors. We explain the observed non-stationarity with a new analytical modulation induced by the LISA constellation motion and the intrinsic anisotropy of the source distribution. By demodulating the foreground signal, we reveal a deviation from Gaussianity in the 2-10 mHz frequency band. Our finding is crucial to design faithful data models: the proposed method serves as a diagnostic and estimation tool to flag and model deviations, respectively. Neglecting them would introduce systematic biases on individual sources and astrophysical foregrounds parameter estimation, ultimately leading to inaccurate interpretation of the LISA data.</description>

      <title>Equation of State of Decompressed Quark Matter, and Observational Signatures of Quark-Star Mergers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09013v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quark stars are challenging to confirm or exclude observationally because they can have similar masses and radii as neutron stars. By performing the first calculation of the non-equilibrium equation of state of decompressed quark matter at finite temperature, we determine the properties of the ejecta from binary quark-star or quark star-black hole mergers. We account for all relevant physical processes during the ejecta evolution, including quark nugget evaporation and cooling, and weak interactions. We find that these merger ejecta can differ significantly from those in neutron star mergers, depending on the binding energy of quark matter. For relatively high binding energies, quark star mergers are unlikely to produce r-process elements and kilonova signals. We propose that future observations of binary mergers and kilonovae could impose stringent constraints on the binding energy of quark matter and the existence of quark stars.</description>

      <title>Early and Extensive Ultraviolet Through Near Infrared Observations of the Intermediate-Luminosity Type Iax Supernovae 2024pxl</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04610v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present ultraviolet (UV) through near-infrared (NIR) photometric and spectroscopic observations of the nearby SN 2024pxl, the third Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) in NGC 6384. SN 2024pxl is a Type Iax supernova (SN Iax) with an intermediate luminosity ($M_r = -16.99\pm0.32$ mag) and an average SN Iax light curve decline rate. SN 2024pxl was discovered $\sim$3 days after first light, and the rising light curve follows a single power law that is inconsistent with significant interaction with a companion star or circumstellar material. Our extensive NIR photometric coverage is comparable to that of the well-observed SNe Iax 2005hk and 2012Z, and we demonstrate that the $J-H$ colors of SNe Iax differ from normal SNe Ia and appear to be more homogeneous as a class. Spectroscopically, we report the earliest-ever NIR spectrum of a SN Iax as measured from maximum light ($t\approx-9$ days): a featureless continuum with similarities to a $\sim$9,000 K blackbody, and the line velocities are consistent with a mixed-ejecta structure, with C, Si, and Fe having similar velocities and velocity evolutions. We find a tentative correlation between the $H$-band break Co II velocity $\sim$20 days post-peak and absolute magnitude, with more luminous SNe Iax showing faster Co II velocities. Our observations suggest that SN 2024pxl resulted from the thermonuclear disruption of a CO white dwarf star that undergoes deflagration burning.</description>

      <title>Shape and ionization of equatorial matter near compact objects from X-ray polarization reflection signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01798v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the success of the IXPE mission, we elucidate what can be inferred about 3D matter structures forming about the equatorial plane of accreting compact objects from 0.1-100 keV linear polarization induced by non-relativistic large-scale reflection. We construct a model of an optically thick elevated axially symmetric reflecting medium with arbitrary ionization profile, representing the known diverse scattering environments: from thick winds and super-Eddington funnel structures formed around black holes and neutron stars, to Compton-thick dusty tori of active galactic nuclei and their broad line regions. We assume a central X-ray power-law source with an isotropic, cosine, and slab-corona emission distribution, including intrinsic polarization. The reprocessing is based on constant-density local reflection tables produced with a Monte Carlo method combined with detailed non-LTE radiative transfer, although we also show examples with classical (semi-)analytical reflection prescriptions. We conclude that varying ionization has a similarly strong impact on observed polarization as the observer's inclination and the skew and opening angle of the reflector's inner walls, altogether producing up to tens of % of reflected polarization both parallelly or perpendicularly to the projected axis, depending on the parameter values combination. After testing 3 different ad-hoc shapes of the reflector: a cone, an elliptical torus, and a bowl, we conclude that while in some configurations, their altered curvature produces more than 30% absolute difference in observed total polarization, in others, the adopted shape has a marginal impact. Lastly, we discuss the change of the observed polarization due to relaxing the optically thick assumption on equatorial winds and accreted matter, providing a continuous range of energy-dependent examples between the optically thick and thin scenarios.</description>

      <title>NuSTAR discovers a long type-I X-ray burst from the clocked burster GS 1826-24</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11231v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The source GS~1826-24 is a neutron star low mass X-ray binary known as the 'clocked burster' because of its extremely regular bursting behavior. We report on the detection of a long type-I X-ray burst from this source. We perform a detailed spectroscopic analysis of the long X-ray burst, lasting for $\sim 600$ s, seen in the NuSTAR observation carried out on 2022 September. The persistent emission is well described by an absorbed thermal Comptonization model (nthcomp), and the source exhibits a soft spectral state during this observation. The observed burst exhibits a rise time of $\sim 25$ s and a decay time of $\sim 282$ s. The time-resolved spectroscopy of the burst shows a significant departure from a pure thermal spectrum and is described with a model consisting of a varying-temperature blackbody plus an evolving persistent emission component. We observe a significant enhancement in the persistent emission during the burst. The enhancement of the pre-burst persistent flux is possibly due to Poynting-Robertson drag or coronal reprocessing. At the peak of the burst, the blackbody temperature and the blackbody emitting radius reached a maximum of $2.10\pm 0.07$ keV and $5.5\pm 2.1$ km, respectively. The peak flux ($F_{peak}$) during the burst is $\approx 2.4\times 10^{-8}$ ergs cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, which corresponds to a luminosity of $\approx 9.7\times 10^{37}$ ergs s$^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>A Panchromatic View of Late-time Shock Power in the Type II Supernova 2023ixf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11747v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present multi-wavelength observations of the type II supernova (SN II) 2023ixf during its first two years of evolution. We combine ground-based optical/NIR spectroscopy with Hubble Space Telescope (HST) far- and near-ultraviolet spectroscopy and James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) near- and mid-infrared photometry and spectroscopy to create spectral energy distributions of SN 2023ixf at +374 and +620 days post-explosion, covering a wavelength range of ~0.1-30 $\mu$m. The multi-band light curve of SN 2023ixf follows a standard radioactive decay decline rate after the plateau until ~500 days, at which point shock powered emission from ongoing interaction between the SN ejecta and circumstellar material (CSM) begins to dominate. This evolution is temporally consistent with 0.3-10 keV X-ray detections of SN 2023ixf and broad ''boxy'' spectral line emission from reprocessing of shock luminosity in a cold dense shell located between forward and reverse shocks. Using the expected absorbed radioactive decay power and the detected X-ray luminosity, we quantify the total shock powered emission at the +374 and +620 day epochs and find that it can be explained by nearly complete thermalization of the reverse shock luminosity as SN 2023ixf interacts with a continuous, ''wind-like'' CSM with a progenitor mass-loss rate of $\dot M \approx 10^{-4}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ ($v_w = 20 \pm 5$ km/s). Additionally, we construct multi-epoch spectral models from the non-LTE radiative transfer code CMFGEN, which contain radioactive decay and shock powers, as well as dust absorption, scattering, and emission. We find that models with shock powers of $L_{sh} = (0.5-1) \times 10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and $(0.5 - 1) \times 10^{-3}$ M$_{\odot}$ of silicate dust in the cold dense shell and/or inner SN ejecta can effectively reproduce the global properties of the late-time (&gt;300 days) UV-to-IR spectra of SN 2023ixf.</description>

Abstract: Dark matter may accumulate in neutron stars given its gravitational interaction and abundance. We investigate the modification of neutron star properties and confront them with the observations in the context of strongly-interacting dark matter scenario, specifically for a QCD-like theory with G$_2$ gauge group for which a first-principles equation-of-state from lattice calculations is available. We study the impact of various observational constraints and modeling of the QCD equation of state on the combined neutron stars. The results indicate that dark matter masses of a few hundred MeV to a few GeV are consistent with the latest observed neutron star properties.</description>

      <title>Stellar-mass black holes in young massive and open stellar clusters -- VI. Role of external galactic field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17780v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Young massive clusters (YMC) and open clusters (OC) are widely considered as potential environments for assembling merging binary stellar-remnant black holes (BBH) via dynamical interactions. However, such moderate mass systems are susceptible to being disrupted by the external tidal field of their host galaxies, potentially limiting their effectiveness as GW sources. In this study, I investigate the formation of BBH mergers in tidally dissolving star clusters. This is achieved with a newly computed grid consisting of 95 evolutionary model star clusters, where the clusters are subjected to a varying extent of tidal stripping. The cluster evolutions are computed with the direct N-body integrator NBODY7 that includes, among others, treatments for post-Newtonian (PN) effects in compact-binary members, mass loss due to stellar evolution, formation of stellar remnants, and tidal stripping. It is found that even strong tidal stripping does not quench the formation of a black hole (BH) core inside a cluster or the formation of dynamical BBH mergers in the system. The overall properties of BBH mergers, e.g., the form of the distribution of merger delay time, primary mass, and mass ratio, and the redshift evolution of merger rate are not significantly altered by the extent of tidal stripping of the parent cluster population. Furthermore, even strongly tidally stripped clusters are capable of dynamically forming Gaia-BH-like detached BH--main-sequence-star binaries that escape into the galactic field. Limitations of the present study and potential future improvements are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18311v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-latency pipelines analyzing gravitational waves from compact binary coalescence events rely on matched filter techniques. Limitations in template banks and waveform modeling, as well as non-stationary detector noise cause errors in signal parameter recovery, especially for events with high chirp masses. We present a quantile regression neural network model that provides dynamic bounds on key parameters such as chirp mass, mass ratio, and total mass. We test the model on various synthetic datasets and real events from the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA gravitational-wave transient GTWC-3 catalog. We find that the model accuracy is consistently over 90% across all the datasets. We explore the possibility of employing the neural network bounds as priors in online parameter estimation. We find that they reduce by 9% the number of likelihood evaluations. This approach may shorten parameter estimation run times without affecting sky localizations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02785v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study tidal Love numbers of static black holes in four-dimensional quadratic theory of gravity, extending the result of GR. We use worldline effective field theory (WEFT) methods to compute metric perturbations from one-point functions, treating the higher-derivative terms perturbatively. We show that insertions of scalar fields on the worldline induce non-zero tidal tails, and the corresponding Love number displays no RG running. The same conclusion holds for the insertions of tensor fields. Furthermore, for scalar dipole perturbations, we derive a Yukawa-deformed Frobenius solution and match the asymptotic behavior to fix the UV charge, finding agreement with EFT predictions of Wilson coefficients. Our work demonstrates that quadratic higher-curvature corrections induce non-zero but scale-independent tidal responses, offering a robust EFT framework to test deviations from GR in gravitational wave observations.</description>

      <title>Explosions of pulsating red supergiants: a natural pathway for the diversity of Type II-P/L supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11077v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Red supergiants (RSGs), which are progenitors of hydrogen-rich Type II supernovae (SNe), have been known to pulsate from both observations and theory. The pulsations can be present at core collapse and affect the resulting SN. However, SN light curve models of such RSGs commonly use hydrostatic progenitor models and ignore pulsations. Here, we model the final stages of a 15 solar-mass RSG and self-consistently follow the hydrodynamical evolution. We find the growth of large amplitude radial pulsations in the envelope. After a transient phase where the envelope restructures, the pulsations settle to a steady and periodic oscillation with a period of 817 days. We show that they are driven by the $\kappa\gamma$-mechanism, which is an interplay between changing opacities and the release of recombination energy of hydrogen and helium. This leads to complex and non-coherent expansion and contraction in different parts of the envelope, which greatly affect the SN progenitor properties, including its location in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. We simulate SN explosions of this model at different pulsations phases. Explosions in the compressed state result in a flat light curve (Type II-P). In contrast, the SN light curve in the expanded state declines rapidly, reminiscent of a Type II-L SN. For cases in between, we find light curves with various decline rates. Features in the SN light curves are directly connected to features in the density profiles. These are in turn linked to the envelope ionization structure, which is the driving mechanism of the pulsations. We predict that some of the observed diversity in Type II SN light curves can be explained by RSG pulsations. For more massive RSGs, we expect stronger pulsations that might even lead to dynamical mass ejections of the envelope and to an increased diversity in SN light curves.</description>

Abstract: It has been proposed that measurements of scattering times ($\tau$) from fast radio bursts (FRB) may be used to infer the FRB host dispersion measure (DM) and its redshift. This approach relies on the existence of a correlation between $\tau$ and DM within FRB hosts such as that observed for Galactic pulsars. We assess the measurability of a $\tau - $DM$_{\rm host}$ relation through simulated observations of FRBs within the ASKAP/CRAFT survey, taking into account instrumental effects. We show that even when the FRB hosts intrinsically follow the $\tau - $DM relation measured for pulsars, this correlation cannot be inferred from FRB observations; this limitation arises mostly from the large variance around the average cosmic DM value given by the Macquart relation, the variance within the $\tau - $DM relation itself, and observational biases against large $\tau$ values. We argue that theoretical relations have little utility as priors on redshift, e.g., for purposes of galaxy identification, and that the recent lack of an observed correlation between scattering and DM in the ASKAP/CRAFT survey is not unexpected, even if our understanding of a $\tau - $DM$_{\rm host}$ relation is correct.</description>
