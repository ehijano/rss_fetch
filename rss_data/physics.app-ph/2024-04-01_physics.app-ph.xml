      <title>Refining microstructures in additively manufactured Al/Cu gradients through TiB$_2$ inclusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The additive manufacture of compositionally graded Al/Cu parts by laser engineered net shaping (LENS) is demonstrated. The use of a blue light build laser enabled deposition on a Cu substrate. The thermal gradient and rapid solidification inherent to selective laser melting enabled mass transport of Cu up to 4 mm away from a Cu substrate through a pure Al deposition, providing a means of producing gradients with finer step sizes than the printed layer thicknesses. Printing graded structures with pure Al, however, was prevented by the growth of Al$_2$Cu$_3$ dendrites and acicular grains amid a matrix of Al$_2$Cu. A combination of adding TiB$_2$ grain refining powder and actively varying print layer composition suppressed the dendritic growth mode and produced an equiaxed microstructure in a compositionally graded part. Material phase was characterized for crystal structure and nanoindentation hardness to enable a discussion of phase evolution in the rapidly solidifying melt pool of a LENS print.</description>

      <title>Thermophysical Properties and Heat Transfer Coefficients for Flowing Packed Particle Beds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate determination of heat transfer coefficients for flowing packed particle beds is essential to the design of particle heat exchangers and other thermal and thermochemical processes. The discrete nature of granular materials alters the thermal transport processes in both the near-wall and bulk regions of flowing particle beds from their stationary counterparts. Heat transfer correlations based on the stationary particle bed thermal conductivity could be inadequate for flowing particles in a heat exchanger. Thermophysical properties of the continuum were often obtained from measurements on stationary beds owing to the difficulty of flowing bed measurements. In this work, we found that the properties of a stationary bed are highly sensitive to the method of particle packing and there is a decrease in the particle bed thermal conductivity and increase in the near-wall thermal resistance, as measured by an air gap thickness, on the onset of particle flow. These variations in the thermophysical properties of stationary vs. flowing particle beds can lead to large errors in heat transfer coefficient calculations. Therefore, we modelled heat transfer coefficients for granular flows using the experimentally determined flowing particle bed thermal conductivity and near-wall air gap for ceramic particles - CARBO CP 40/100 (mean diameter=275 um), HSP 40/70 (404 um) and HSP 16/30 (956 um); at velocities of 5-15 mms-1; and temperatures of 300-650 oC. These calculations, which show good agreement with experiments in literature, can be used as a guide for heat exchanger designs.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Machine Learning Strategies for Accurate Prediction of Thermal Conductivity in Polymeric Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polymers, integral to advancements in high-tech fields, necessitate the study of their thermal conductivity (TC) to enhance material attributes and energy efficiency. The TC of polymers obtained by molecular dynamics (MD) calculations and experimental measurements is slow, and it is difficult to screen polymers with specific TC in a wide range. Existing machine learning (ML) techniques for determining polymer TC suffer from the problems of too large feature space and cannot guarantee very high accuracy. In this work, we leverage TCs from accessible datasets to decode the Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) of polymers into ten features of distinct physical significance. A novel evaluation model for polymer TC is formulated, employing four ML strategies. The Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT)-based model, a focal point of our design, achieved a prediction accuracy of R$^2$=0.88 on a dataset containing 400 polymers. Furthermore, we used an interpretable ML approach to discover the significant contribution of quantitative estimate of drug-likeness and number of rotatable bonds features to TC, and analyzed the physical mechanisms involved. The ML method we developed provides a new idea for physical modeling of polymers, which is expected to be generalized and applied widely in constructing polymers with specific TCs and predicting all other properties of polymers.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As photonic technologies continue to grow in multidimensional aspects, integrated photonics holds a unique position and continuously presents enormous possibilities to research communities. Applications span across data centers, environmental monitoring, medical diagnosis, and highly compact communication components, with further possibilities growing endlessly. Here, we provide a review of state of the art integrated photonic sensors operating in near and mid infrared wavelength regions on various material platforms. Among different materials, architectures, and technologies leading the way for on chip sensors, we discuss optical sensing principles commonly applied to biochemical and gas sensing. Our focus is particularly on passive and active optical waveguides, including dispersion engineered metamaterial based structures an essential approach for enhancing the interaction between light and analytes in chip scale sensors. We harness a diverse array of cutting edge sensing technologies, heralding a revolutionary on chip sensing paradigm. Our arsenal includes refractive index based sensing, plasmonic, and spectroscopy, forging an unparalleled foundation for innovation and precision. Furthermore, we include a brief discussion of recent trends and computational concepts incorporating Artificial Intelligence &amp; Machine Learning (AI/ML) and deep learning approaches over the past few years to improve the qualitative and quantitative analysis of sensor measurements.</description>

      <title>Mechanochemical bistability of intestinal organoids enables robust morphogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How pattern and form are generated in a reproducible manner during embryogenesis remains poorly understood. Intestinal organoid morphogenesis involves a number of mechanochemical regulators, including cell-type specific cytoskeletal forces and osmotically-driven lumen volume changes. However, whether and how these forces are coordinated in time and space via feedbacks to ensure robust morphogenesis remains unclear. Here, we propose a minimal physical model of organoid morphogenesis with local cellular mechano-sensation, where lumen volume changes can impact epithelial shape via both direct mechanical (passive) and indirect mechanosensitive (active) mechanisms. We show how mechano-sensitive feedbacks on cytoskeletal tension generically give rise to morphological bistability, where both bulged (open) and budded (closed) crypt states are possible and dependent on the history of volume changes. Such bistability can explain several paradoxical experimental observations, such as the importance of the timing of lumen shrinkage and robustness of the final morphogenetic state to mechanical perturbations. More quantitatively, we performed mechanical and pharmacological experiments to validate the key modelling assumptions and make quantitative predictions on organoid morphogenesis. This suggests that bistability arising from feedbacks between cellular tensions and fluid pressure could be a general mechanism to allow for the coordination of multicellular shape changes in developing systems.</description>

      <title>Size-dependent fracture in elastomers: experiments and continuum modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Elastomeric materials display a complicated set of stretchability and fracture properties that strongly depend on the flaw size, which has long been of interest to engineers and materials scientists. Here, we combine experiments and numerical simulations for a comprehensive understanding of the nonlocal, size-dependent features of fracture in elastomers. We show the size-dependent fracture behavior is quantitatively described through a nonlocal continuum model. The key ingredient of the nonlocal model is the use of an intrinsic length scale associated with a finite fracture process zone, which is inferred from experiments. Of particular importance, our experimental and theoretical approach passes the critical set of capturing key aspects of the size-dependent fracture in elastomers. Applications to a wide range of synthetic elastomers that exhibit moderate (~100%) to extreme stretchability (~1000%) are presented, which is also used to demonstrate the applicability of our approach in elastomeric specimens with complex geometries.</description>

      <title>Quadratic optical response of CrSBr controlled by spin-selective interlayer coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The optical properties of the layered magnet CrSBr are dominated by intralayer excitons: the antiferromagnetic order between the layers makes layer-to-layer charge hopping, and therefore interlayer excitons, spin-forbidden. An external magnetic field, however, continuously drives the magnetic order towards layer-to-layer ferromagnetic, which opens spin-allowed charge-transfer channels between the layers. Here we elaborate how their admixture changes the composition and nature of the excitons, leading to an extension over many layers, and causes a quadratic red-shift with respect to the external magnetic field. We address these effects by ab-initio $GW$-BSE calculations as a function of magnetic field and cast the data into a minimal four-band model to elucidate the interplay between the various interaction and coupling mechanisms. Our findings should be generally valid for antiferromagnetic layered magnets with and without external magnetic fields, and moreover for any couple of layers with different spin directions. Our insights help to systematically address excitons and predict their optical signatures in such systems.</description>

      <title>Hydroelectric energy conversion of waste flows through hydro-electronic drag</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hydraulic energy is a key component of the global energy mix, yet there exists no practical way of harvesting it at small scales, from flows at low Reynolds number. This has triggered the search for alternative hydroelectric conversion methodologies, leading to unconventional proposals based on droplet triboelectricity, water evaporation, osmotic energy or flow-induced ionic Coulomb drag. Yet, these approaches systematically rely on ions as intermediate charge carriers, limiting the achievable power density. Here, we predict that the kinetic energy of small-scale "waste" flows can be directly and efficiently converted into electricity thanks to the hydro-electronic drag effect, by which an ion-free liquid induces an electronic current in the solid wall along which it flows. This effect originates in the fluctuation-induced coupling between fluid motion and electron transport. We develop a non-equilibrium thermodynamic formalism to assess the efficiency of such hydroelectric energy conversion, dubbed hydronic energy. We find that hydronic energy conversion is analogous to thermoelectricity, with the efficiency being controlled by a dimensionless figure of merit. However, in contrast to its thermoelectric analogue, this figure of merit combines independently tunable parameters of the solid and the liquid, and can thus significantly exceed unity. Our findings suggest new strategies for blue energy harvesting without electrochemistry, and for waste flow mitigation in membrane-based filtration processes.</description>

      <title>A microstructure-sensitive electro-chemo-mechanical phase-field model of pitting and stress corrosion cracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An electro-chemo-mechanical phase-field formulation is developed to simulate pitting and stress corrosion in polycrystalline materials. The formulation incorporates dependencies of mechanical properties and corrosion potential on crystallographic orientation. The model considers the formation and charging dynamics of an electric double layer through a new general boundary condition for the solution potential. The potential of the model is demonstrated by simulating corrosion in polycrystalline materials with various grain morphology distributions. The results show that incorporating the underlying microstructure yields more extensive defects, faster defect kinetics, and irregular pit and crack shapes relative to a microstructurally-insensitive homogeneous material scenario.</description>

Abstract: Magnetic resonance methods offer a unique chance for in-depth study of conductive organic material systems, not only accounts for number of charge carriers, but also allows manipulations of spin dynamics of particles. Here we present a study of continuous-wave electrically detected magnetic resonance on a range of organic conjugate polymers under transistor architecture, with tunability in both carrier concentration and drifting electric field. We demonstrate the general existence of bipolaron between mobile and trapped charges at the magnetic resonance condition, then estimates the wavefunction expansion of charge carriers on their hopping sites along conductive pathways. This finding allows direct observation of energetically disordered trap sites under the charge hopping picture, linking-up the microscopic structural properties to the bulk electronic performances.</description>

      <title>Sample-Efficient and Surrogate-Based Design Optimization of Underwater Vehicle Hulls</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.12420v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physics simulations like computational fluid dynamics (CFD) are a computational bottleneck in computer-aided design (CAD) optimization processes. To overcome this bottleneck, one requires either an optimization framework that is highly sample-efficient, or a fast data-driven proxy (surrogate model) for long-running simulations. Both approaches have benefits and limitations. Bayesian optimization is often used for sample efficiency, but it solves one specific problem and struggles with transferability; alternatively, surrogate models can offer fast and often more generalizable solutions for CFD problems, but gathering data for and training such models can be computationally demanding. In this work, we leverage recent advances in optimization and artificial intelligence (AI) to explore both of these potential approaches, in the context of designing an optimal unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV) hull. Our study finds that the Bayesian Optimization-Lower Condition Bound (BO-LCB) algorithm is the most sample-efficient optimization framework and has the best convergence behavior of those considered. Subsequently, we show that our DNN-based surrogate model predicts drag force on test data in tight agreement with CFD simulations, with a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 1.85%. Combining these results, we demonstrate a two-orders-of-magnitude speedup (with comparable accuracy) for the design optimization process when the surrogate model is used. To our knowledge, this is the first study applying Bayesian optimization and DNN-based surrogate modeling to the problem of UUV design optimization, and we share our developments as open-source software.</description>

      <title>Associative memory by virtual oscillator network based on single spin-torque oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13198v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A coupled oscillator network may be able to perform an energy-efficient associative memory operation. However, its realization has been difficult because inhomogeneities unavoidably arise among the oscillators during fabrication and lead to an unreliable operation. This issue could be resolved if the oscillator network were able to be formed from a single oscillator. Here, we performed numerical simulations and theoretical analyses on an associative memory operation that uses a virtual oscillator network based on a spin-torque oscillator. The virtual network combines the concept of coupled oscillators with that of feedforward neural networks. Numerical experiments demonstrate successful associations of $60$-pixel patterns with various memorized patterns. Moreover, the origin of the associative memory is shown to be forced synchronization driven by feedforward input, where phase differences among oscillators are fixed and correspond to the colors of the pixels in the pattern.</description>
