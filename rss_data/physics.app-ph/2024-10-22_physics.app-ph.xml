      <title>Pivot Bearings for Efficient Torsional Magneto-Mechanical Resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rotating magnets have recently emerged as an efficient method for producing ultra-low frequency signals for through-earth and through-seawater communications. Magneto-mechanical resonator (MMR) arrays, which are magnetized torsional rotors with a restoring torque, are a promising implementation of this idea that use resonance to enhance the magnetic signal generation. The fundamental challenge for MMR design is to have a suspension system for the rotors capable of resisting large transverse magnetic forces while allowing for a large angle of motion at low dissipation and hence high efficiency. Here, we study flexure-based pivot bearings as compliant support elements for MMR rotors which address this challenge and demonstrate their efficient low damping operation. A crossed-flexure configuration enables large angular rotation around a central axis, large transverse stiffness, and compact assembly of closely spaced rotor arrays via geometric flexure interlocking. We characterize the eigen frequency performance and structural damping of MMR supported by these proposed pivot bearings. We develop analytical and numerical models to study their static and dynamic behaviors, including their coupled dynamic modes. We demonstrate that their damping coefficient is up to 80 times lower than corresponding ball bearing MMR. This study is broadly applicable to various systems that leverage arrays of coupled torsional oscillators such as magneto-mechanical transmitters, metamaterials, and energy harvesters.</description>

      <title>Spin-layer coupling in altermagnets multilayer: a design principle for spintronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of collinear symmetric-compensated altermagnets (AM) with intrinsic spin splitting provides a route towards energy-efficient and ultrafast device applications. Here, using first-principles calculations and symmetry analysis, we propose a series of AM Cr2SX (X=O, S, Se) monolayer and explore the spin splitting in Cr2SX multilayer. A general design principle for realizing the spin-layer coupling in odd/even-layer is mapped out based on the comprehensive analysis of spin group symmetry. The spin splitting behavior related with the MzUt, Mz and ML symmetries in AM multilayer can be significantly modulated by magnetic orders, crystal symmetry and external perpendicular gate field (Ez). Due to the spin-compensated bands of sublayers linked by overall Mz and interlayers ML symmetries, the Cr2S2 odd-layer exhibits the unique coexistence of spin splitting and spin degeneracy at high symmetric paths and X/Y valley, respectively. Furthermore, owing to the higher priority of overall ML symmetry compared to interlayers ML symmetry in AM even-layer, the spin-layer coupling of AM multilayer shows strong odd/even-layer dependence. Our work not only offer a new direction for manipulating spin splitting, but also greatly enrich the research on AM monolayer and multilayer.</description>

      <title>On the grain growth behavior of Ni-W alloys in the extremely fine-grained regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanocrystalline pure FCC metals and some alloys are known to exhibit abnormal grain growth. Addition of solutes, such as W, has led to improved grain size stability in nanocrystalline Ni. While several groups have investigated grain growth behavior in Ni-based binary alloys, grain sizes greater than 15 nm were primarily investigated. In the present study, grain growth behavior is examined in grain size regime below 10 nm in nanocrystalline Ni-W alloys with 8 to 15 at% W at 773K. In this size regime, normal grain growth behavior was observed in these alloys, evidenced from (a) parabolic kinetics in plots of square of average grain size against annealing time, and (b) statistical self-similarity on the scaled size distribution in a log-normal plot.</description>

      <title>Nonvolatile Electrochemical Memory at 600C Enabled by Composition Phase Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CMOS-based microelectronics are limited to ~150{\deg}C and therefore not suitable for the extreme high temperatures in aerospace, energy, and space applications. While wide bandgap semiconductors can provide high-temperature logic, nonvolatile memory devices at high temperatures have been challenging. In this work, we develop a nonvolatile electrochemical memory cell that stores and retains analog and digital information at temperatures as high as 600 {\deg}C. Through correlative electron microscopy, we show that this high-temperature information retention is a result of composition phase separation between the oxidized and reduced forms of amorphous tantalum oxide. This result demonstrates a memory concept that is resilient at extreme temperatures and reveals phase separation as the principal mechanism that enables nonvolatile information storage in these electrochemical memory cells.</description>

      <title>Bound States-to-Bands in the Continuum in Cylindrical Granular Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate and experimentally demonstrate that genuine bound states in the continuum (BICs) -- polarization-protected BICs -- can be completely localized within finite-size solid resonators. This bound mode is realized in a highly tunable mechanical system made of cylindrical granular crystals, where tunning the contact boundaries enables the in situ transition from the BICs to quasi-BICs in a controllable manner. Since a single-particle resonator can support BICs itself, these bound states can extend to form bound bands within periodic structures composed of such resonators. We experimentally demonstrate the emergence of a quasi-bound (flat) band in a finite chain with broken resonator symmetry, using a laser Doppler vibrometer. Remarkably, we show that all cylindrical resonators within the entire chain exhibit high-Q and dispersionless resonance.</description>

      <title>3 kV Monolithic Bidirectional GaN HEMT on Sapphire</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: More than 3 kV breakdown voltage was demonstrated in monolithic bidirectional GaN HEMTs for the first time having potential applications in 1200V or 1700V-class novel power converters. The on resistance of the fabricated transistors was ~20 ohm.mm or ~11 mili ohm.cm^2. Breakdown voltage was optimized by utilizing two field plates in either side of the transistor and optimizing their geometry. Shorter first field plate lengths (less than 2 micron) resulted in higher breakdown voltage and the possible reason for this was discussed. The transistors had a steep subthreshold swing of 92 mV / dec. The on/off ratio was greater than 10^5 and it was limited by the tool capacity. The fabricated 3 kV transistor was benchmarked against the state-of-the-art monolithic bidirectional GaN HEMTs in the performance matrices of breakdown voltage and on resistance, that showed crucial progress.</description>

      <title>Dual wavelength brillouin laser terahertz source stabilized to carbonyl sulfide rotational transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical-based terahertz sources are important for many burgeoning scientific and technological applications. Among such applications is precision spectroscopy of molecules, which exhibit rotational transitions at terahertz frequencies. Stemming from precision spectroscopy is frequency discrimination and stabilization of terahertz sources. Because many molecular species exist in the gas phase at room temperature, their transitions are prime candidates for practical terahertz frequency references. We demonstrate the stabilization of a low phase-noise, dual-wavelength Brillouin laser (DWBL) terahertz oscillator to a rotational transition of carbonyl sulfide (\ce{OCS}). We achieve an instability of $1.2\times10^{-12}/\sqrt{\tau}$, where $\tau$ is the averaging time in seconds. The signal-to-noise ratio and intermodulation limitations of the experiment are also discussed. We thus demonstrate a highly stable and spectrally pure terahertz frequency source. Our presented architecture will likely benefit metrology, spectroscopy, precision terahertz studies, and beyond.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-based Detection of Bacterial Swarm Motion Using a Single Image</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distinguishing between swarming and swimming, the two principal forms of bacterial movement, holds significant conceptual and clinical relevance. This is because bacteria that exhibit swarming capabilities often possess unique properties crucial to the pathogenesis of infectious diseases and may also have therapeutic potential. Here, we report a deep learning-based swarming classifier that rapidly and autonomously predicts swarming probability using a single blurry image. Compared with traditional video-based, manually-processed approaches, our method is particularly suited for high-throughput environments and provides objective, quantitative assessments of swarming probability. The swarming classifier demonstrated in our work was trained on Enterobacter sp. SM3 and showed good performance when blindly tested on new swarming (positive) and swimming (negative) test images of SM3, achieving a sensitivity of 97.44% and a specificity of 100%. Furthermore, this classifier demonstrated robust external generalization capabilities when applied to unseen bacterial species, such as Serratia marcescens DB10 and Citrobacter koseri H6. It blindly achieved a sensitivity of 97.92% and a specificity of 96.77% for DB10, and a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 97.22% for H6. This competitive performance indicates the potential to adapt our approach for diagnostic applications through portable devices or even smartphones. This adaptation would facilitate rapid, objective, on-site screening for bacterial swarming motility, potentially enhancing the early detection and treatment assessment of various diseases, including inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) and urinary tract infections (UTI).</description>

      <title>Physically Guided Deep Unsupervised Inversion for 1D Magnetotelluric Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The global demand for unconventional energy sources such as geothermal energy and white hydrogen requires new exploration techniques for precise subsurface structure characterization and potential reservoir identification. Magnetotelluric (MT) inversion is crucial for these tasks, providing critical information on the distribution of subsurface electrical resistivity at depths ranging from hundreds to thousands of meters. However, traditional iterative algorithm-based inversion methods require the adjustment of multiple parameters, demanding time-consuming and exhaustive tuning processes to achieve proper cost function minimization. Although recent advances have incorporated deep learning algorithms for MT inversion, these have been primarily based on supervised learning, which needs large labeled datasets for training. Therefore, it causes issues in generalization and model characteristics that are restricted to the neural network's features. This work utilizes TensorFlow operations to create a differentiable forward MT operator, leveraging its automatic differentiation capability. Moreover, instead of solving for the subsurface model directly, as classical algorithms perform, this paper presents a new deep unsupervised inversion algorithm guided by physics to estimate 1D MT models. Instead of using datasets with the observed data and their respective model as labels during training, our method employs a differentiable modeling operator that physically guides the cost function minimization, making the proposed method solely dependent on observed data. Therefore, the optimization problem is updating the network weights to minimize the data misfit. We test the proposed method with field and synthetic data at different acquisition frequencies, demonstrating that the resistivity models are more accurate than other results using state-of-the-art techniques.</description>

      <title>The twisting dynamics of large lattice mismatch van der Waals heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Van der Waals (vdW) homo-/hetero-structures are ideal systems for studying interfacial tribological properties such as structural superlubricity. Previous studies concentrated on the mechanism of translational motion in vdW interfaces. However, detailed mechanisms and general properties of the rotational motion are barely explored. Here, we combine experiments and simulations to reveal the twisting dynamics of the MoS$_2$/graphite heterostructure. Unlike the translational friction falling into the superlubricity regime with no twist angle dependence, the dynamic rotational resistances highly depend on twist angles. Our results show that the periodic rotational resistance force originates from structural potential energy changes during the twisting. The structural potential energy of MoS$_2$/graphite heterostructure increases monotonically from0 to 30 degrees twist angles, and the estimated relative energy barrier is (1.43 +/- 0.36) x 10 J/m. The formation of Moir\'e superstructures in the graphene layer is the key to controlling the structural potential energy of the MoS$_2$/graphene heterostructure. Our results suggest that in twisting 2D heterostructures, even if the interface sliding friction is negligible, the evolving potential energy change results in a non-vanishing rotational resistance force. The structural change of the heterostructure can be an additional pathway for energy dissipation in the rotational motion, further enhancing the rotational friction force.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce an all-optical system, termed the "lying mirror", to hide input information by transforming it into misleading, ordinary-looking patterns that effectively camouflage the underlying image data and deceive the observers. This misleading transformation is achieved through passive light-matter interactions of the incident light with an optimized structured diffractive surface, enabling the optical concealment of any form of secret input data without any digital computing. These lying mirror designs were shown to camouflage different types of input image data, exhibiting robustness against a range of adversarial manipulations, including random image noise as well as unknown, random rotations, shifts, and scaling of the object features. The feasibility of the lying mirror concept was also validated experimentally using a structured micro-mirror array along with multi-wavelength illumination at 480, 550 and 600 nm, covering the blue, green and red image channels. This framework showcases the power of structured diffractive surfaces for visual information processing and might find various applications in defense, security and entertainment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microfluidics has revolutionized control over small volumes through the use of physical barriers. However, the rigidity of these barriers limits flexibility in applications. We present an optofluidic toolbox that leverages structured light and photothermal conversion to create dynamic, reconfigurable fluidic boundaries. This system enables precise manipulation of fluids and particles by generating 3D thermal landscapes with high spatial control. Our approach replicates the functions of traditional barriers while additionally allowing real-time reconfiguration for complex tasks, such as individual particle steering and size-based sorting in heterogeneous mixtures. These results highlight the platform's potential for adaptive and multifunctional microfluidic systems in applications such as chemical synthesis, lab-on-chip devices, and microbiology, seamlessly integrating with existing setups due to its flexibility and minimal operation requirements.</description>

      <title>Piezoelectric Manipulation and Engineering for Layertronics in Two-Dimensional Materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The electronic transport characteristics of two-dimensional (2D) systems have widespread application prospects in the fabrication of multifunctional nanodevices. However, the current research for basic transport phenomena, such as anomalous valley Hall effect (AVHE) and piezoelectric response, is limited to discrete discussion. Here, we theoretically propose a valley-piezoelectricity coupling strategy beyond the existing paradigm to realize AVHE and layer Hall effect (LHE) in ferrovalley (FV) systems, and its essential principle can be extended to general valleytronic materials. Through first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that the large polarized electric field of 2.8*106 (1.67*107) V/m can be induced by 0.1% uniaxial strain in FV 2H-LaHF (1T-LaHF) monolayers. In addition, the microscopic mechanism of interlayer antiferromagnetic (AFM) state of 2H-LaHF bilayer is uncovered by the spin Hamiltonian and super-superexchange (SSE) interaction. Our findings pave the way for new explorations of valley Hall-related effect involving piezoelectricity.</description>

      <title>Approaching High-efficiency Spatial Light Modulation with Lossy Phase-change Material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The prevalent high intrinsic absorption in the crystalline state of phase-change materials (PCMs), typically leads to a decline in modulation efficiency for phase-change metasurfaces, underutilizing their potential for quasi-continuous phase-state tuning. This research introduces a concise design approach that maximizes the exploitation of the quasi-continuous phase transition properties of PCM, achieving high-efficiency spatial light modulation. By optimizing the metasurface design, the phase modulation process is strategically localized in a low crystallization ratio state, significantly reducing the impact of material absorption on modulation efficiency. Utilizing GSST as an example, numerical simulations demonstrate a minimum reflectance of 46.5% at the target wavelength of 1550 nm, with a phase modulation depth of 246.6{\deg}. The design is fruther extended to dynamic polarization modulation by incorporating structural anisotropy, enabling independent control of amplitude and phase modulation in orthogonal polarization directions. This strategy not only circumvents the efficiency limitations of crystalline states but also harnesses the full potential of PCMs for multifunctional photonic applications.</description>

      <title>Highly Transparent Lead-Free Piezoelectric Haptic Device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Acoustic haptic technology adds touch sensations to human-machine interfaces by integrating piezoelectric actuators onto touchscreens. Traditional piezoelectric haptic technologies use opaque lead-containing ceramics that are both toxic and visible. We have developed a highly transparent lead-free piezoelectric haptic device using potassium sodium niobate (KNN) and transparent conductive oxide thin films. The KNN film, grown on glass, exhibits a pure perovskite phase and a dense microstructure. This device achieves up to 80% transmittance, surpassing lead zirconate titanate (PZT) thin films. It generates an acoustic resonance at 16.5 kHz and produces a peak-to-peak displacement of 1.0 um at 28 V unipolar, making it suitable for surface rendering applications. This demonstrates the potential of transparent lead-free piezoelectric actuators as an effective alternative to conventional PZT haptic actuators.</description>

      <title>Simulating quantum emitters in arbitrary photonic environments using FDTD: beyond the semi-classical regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a numerical algorithm that integrates quantum two-level systems (TLSs) into the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) framework for simulating quantum emitters in arbitrary 3D photonic environments. Conventional methods struggle with these systems due to their semi-classical nature and spurious self-interactions that arise when a TLS is driven by its own radiation field. We address these issues by determining the correct electric field for driving the TLS, as well as the current source used in FDTD for modeling photon emission. Our method, focusing on single-excitation states, employs a total field-incident field (TF-IF) technique to eliminate self-interactions, enabling precise simulations of photon emission and scattering. The algorithm also successfully models complex phenomena such as resonant energy transfer, superradiance, and vacuum Rabi splitting. This powerful computational tool is expected to substantially advance research in nanophotonics, quantum physics, and beyond.</description>

      <title>Surface acoustic waves Brillouin photonics on a silicon nitride chip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Seamlessly integrating stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) in a low-loss and mature photonic integration platform remains a complicated task. Virtually all current approaches fall short in simultaneously achieving strong SBS, low losses, and technological scalability. In this work we incorporate stong SBS into a standard silicon nitride platform by a simple deposition of a tellurium oxide layer, a commonly used material for acousto-optic modulators. In these heterogeneously integrated waveguides, we harness novel SBS interactions actuated by surface acoustic waves (SAWs) leading to more than two orders of magnitude gain enhancement. Three novel applications are demonstrated in this platform: (i) a silicon nitride Brillouin amplifier with 5 dB net optical gain, (ii) a compact intermodal stimulated Brillouin laser (SBL) capable of high purity radio frequency (RF) signal generation with 7 Hz intrinsic linewidth, and (iii) a widely tunable microwave photonic notch filter with ultra-narrow linewidth of 2.2 MHz enabled by Brillouin induced opacity. These advancements can unlock an array of new RF and optical technologies to be directly integrated in silicon nitride.</description>

      <title>Exceptional Points in Gyrator-Based Circuit and Nonlinear High-Sensitivity Oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.00639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.00639v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a scheme for high-sensitive oscillators based on an exceptional point of degeneracy (EPD) in a circuit made of two LC resonators coupled by a gyrator. The frequency of oscillation is very sensitive to perturbations of a circuit element, like a capacitor. We show conditions that lead to an EPD, assuming one of the two resonators is composed of an inductor and a capacitor of negative values. The EPD occurrence and sensitivity to perturbations in the linear case are demonstrated by showing that the eigenfrequency bifurcation around the EPD is described by the relevant Puiseux (fractional power) series expansion. We also investigate the effect of small losses in the system and show that they lead to instability. We fabricate the circuit, and exploit its instability and nonlinearity, observing experimentally stable self-oscillations under the saturated regime. We measure the circuit's sensitivity to a small capacitor perturbation. A shift in frequency of oscillation after saturation is well detectable with very distinct spectral peaks with 10 Hz linewidth, clean until -70 dB from the peak value. The sensitivity is (i) higher than the one of a comparable simple LC linear resonator, (ii) comparable or better than other published EPD circuits, and (iii) applicable to both negative and positive values of the capacitance perturbation, contrary to what happens in PT-symmetric circuits. The proposed scheme can pave the way for a new generation of high-sensitive sensors to measure slight variations in physical, chemical or biological quantities.</description>

      <title>A nanoporous capacitive electrochemical ratchet for continuous ion separations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.00951v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Directed ion transport in liquid electrolyte solutions underlies many phenomena in Nature and industry. While Nature has devised structures that drive continuous ion flow without Faradaic redox reactions, artificial analogs do not exist. Here we report the first demonstration of an ion pump that drives aqueous ions against a force using a capacitive ratchet mechanism that does not require redox reactions. Modulation of an electric potential between gold thin films on either face of a nanoporous alumina wafer immersed in solution resulted in persistent voltages and ionic currents indicative of directional ion pumping. This occurs due to the non-linear capacitive nature of electric double layers, whose repeated charging and discharging sustains a continuous ion flux. The generated ionic power was used in conjunction with an additional shunt pathway to demonstrate electrolyte demixing. These ratchet-based ion pumps can potentially enable continuous desalination and selective ion separation using a modular, electrically powered device with no moving parts.</description>

      <title>Low-Loss Higher-Order Cross-Sectional Lam\'e Mode SAW Devices in 10-20 GHz Range</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14272v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents surface acoustic wave (SAW) acoustic delay lines (ADL) for studying propagation loss mechanisms in Lithium Niobate (LN). Devices were fabricated by depositing 50 nm aluminum patterns on 600 nm X-Cut LN on amorphous silicon on silicon carbide, where longitudinally dominant SAW was targeted. Upon fabrication, higher-order thickness-based cross-sectional Lam\'e modes and Rayleigh modes were studied for their Q factors using acoustic delay lines. Utilizing bi-directional electrodes, ADL with lateral lambda values ranging from 0.4 um to 0.6 um were measured. Higher order Lame modes were found to have consistently higher Q factors than their Rayleigh mode counterpart, on the order of 1000-3000, showing high-frequency SAW devices as still viable candidates for frequency scaling without a substantial increase in loss.</description>

      <title>Wide-field microwave magnetic field imaging with nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16528v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-invasive imaging of microwave (MW) magnetic fields with microscale lateral resolution is pivotal for various applications, such as MW technologies and integrated circuit failure analysis. Diamond nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center magnetometry has emerged as an ideal tool, offering $\mu$m-scale resolution, millimeter-scale field of view, high sensitivity, and non-invasive imaging compatible with diverse samples. However, up until now, it has been predominantly used for imaging of static or low-frequency magnetic fields or, concerning MW field imaging, to directly characterize the same microwave device used to drive the NV spin transitions. In this work we leverage an NV center ensemble in diamond for wide-field imaging of MW magnetic fields generated by a test device employing a differential measurement protocol. The microscope is equipped with a MW loop to induce Rabi oscillations between NV spin states, and the MW field from the device-under-test is measured through local deviations in the Rabi frequency. This differential protocol yields magnetic field maps of a 2.57 GHz MW field with a sensitivity of $\sim$ 9 $\mu$T Hz$^{-1/2}$ for a total measurement duration of $T = 357$ s, covering a $340\times340$ $\mu$m$^2$ field of view with a $\mu$m-scale spatial resolution and a DUT input power dynamic range of 30 dB. This work demonstrates a novel NV magnetometry protocol, based on differential Rabi frequency measurement, that extends NV wide-field imaging capabilities to imaging of weak MW magnetic fields that would be difficult to measure directly through standard NV Rabi magnetometry.</description>

      <title>Hydroelectric energy conversion of waste flows through hydroelectronic drag</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20209v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hydraulic energy is a key component of the global energy mix, yet there exists no practical way of harvesting it at small scales, from flows at low Reynolds number. This has triggered the search for alternative hydroelectric conversion methodologies, leading to unconventional proposals based on droplet triboelectricity, water evaporation, osmotic energy or flow-induced ionic Coulomb drag. Yet, these approaches systematically rely on ions as intermediate charge carriers, limiting the achievable power density. Here, we predict that the kinetic energy of small-scale "waste" flows can be directly and efficiently converted into electricity thanks to the hydro-electronic drag effect, by which an ion-free liquid induces an electronic current in the solid wall along which it flows. This effect originates in the fluctuation-induced coupling between fluid motion and electron transport. We develop a non-equilibrium thermodynamic formalism to assess the efficiency of such hydroelectric energy conversion, dubbed hydronic energy. We find that hydronic energy conversion is analogous to thermoelectricity, with the efficiency being controlled by a dimensionless figure of merit. However, in contrast to its thermoelectric analogue, this figure of merit combines independently tunable parameters of the solid and the liquid, and can thus significantly exceed unity. Our findings suggest new strategies for blue energy harvesting without electrochemistry, and for waste flow mitigation in membrane-based filtration processes.</description>

      <title>Multiscale Physics-Informed Neural Networks for the Inverse Design of Finite-Size Hyperuniform Metamaterials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07878v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we employ multiscale physics-informed neural networks (MscalePINNs) for the inverse retrieval of the spatially inhomogeneous effective permittivity and for the homogenization of finite-size photonic media with stealthy hyperuniform (SHU) disordered geometries. Specifically, we show that MscalePINNs can capture the fast spatial variations of complex fields scattered by arrays of dielectric nanocylinders arranged according to isotropic SHU point patterns, thus enabling a systematic methodology to inversely retrieve their effective dielectric profiles. Our approach extends the recently developed high-frequency homogenization theory of hyperuniform media and retrieves more general permittivity profiles for applications-relevant finite-size SHU systems, unveiling unique features related to their isotropic nature. In particular, we numerically corroborate the existence of a transparency region beyond the long-wavelength approximation, enabling effective and isotropic homogenization even without disorder-averaging, in contrast to the case of uncorrelated Poisson random patterns. The flexible multiscale network approach introduced here enables the efficient inverse design of more general effective media and finite-size metamaterials with isotropic electromagnetic responses beyond the limitations of traditional homogenization theories.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Pockels Coefficient of Ferroelectric Nitride ScAlN</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07978v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nitride ferroelectrics have recently emerged as promising alternatives to oxide ferroelectrics due to their compatibility with mainstream semiconductor processing. ScAlN, in particular, has exhibited remarkable piezoelectric coupling strength ($K^2$) comparable to that of lithium niobate (LN), making it a valuable choice for RF filters in wireless communications. Recently, ScAlN has sparked interest in its use for nanophotonic devices, chiefly due to its large bandgap facilitating operation in blue wavelengths coupled with promises of enhanced nonlinear optical properties such as a large second-order susceptibility ($\chi^{(2)}$). It is still an open question whether ScAlN can outperform oxide ferroelectrics concerning the Pockels effect -- an electro-optic coupling extensively utilized in optical communications devices. In this paper, we present a comprehensive theoretical analysis and experimental demonstration of ScAlN's Pockels effect. Our findings reveal that the electro-optic coupling of ScAlN, despite being weak at low Sc concentration, may be significantly enhanced and exceed LiNbO$_3$ at high levels of Sc doping, which points the direction of continued research efforts to unlock the full potential of ScAlN.</description>

      <title>Ultrahigh-speed thin-film lithium niobate optical coherent receiver</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02878v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of the thin-film lithium niobate platform has established it as a premier choice for high-performance photonics integration. High-speed optical coherent receivers are essential for supporting the large communication capacities required by data center interconnects. Although high-speed photodiodes have been demonstrated on the thin-film LiNbO3 platform, the development of an ultrahigh-speed optical coherent receiver on this platform has not yet been realized. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate an ultra-wideband PD and ultrahigh-speed optical coherent receiver on an InP-LiNbO3 wafer-level heterogeneous integration platform. The fabricated single PD exhibits a record-high bandwidth of 140 GHz and successfully receives a high-quality 100-Gbaud pulse amplitude modulation (PAM4) signal. Furthermore, a thin-film LiNbO3 optical coherent receiver, featuring a large balanced detection bandwidth of 60 GHz, a large common mode rejection ratio (CMRR) exceeding 20 dB, and a low energy consumption of 9.6 fJ per bit, enables an ultrahigh-speed coherent reception with advanced modulation formats. The single-polarization I-Q coherent receiver, incorporating a compact 2x4 90 optical hybrid and a balanced photodetector array, achieves a receiving capacity of 600 Gbps per channel with 100-Gbaud 64 quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) signal and 512 Gbps per channel with 128-Gbaud 16 QAM signal. Additionally, we demonstrate a long-distance reception of 100 Gbaud quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK) and 16 QAM signals over transmission distances of 1040 km and 25 km. A seven-channel single-polarization I-Q coherent receiving chip achieves a total receiving capacity of 3.584 Tbps. This heterogeneous-integrated thin-film LiNbO3 optical coherent receiver shows the potential for Pbps-scale applications in future hyperscale data center interconnects.</description>
