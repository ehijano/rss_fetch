      <title>Viewing Quasi-Coherent Sheaves of Ideals as Ideals of a Ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a technique for viewing quasi-coherent sheaves of ideals of a given blowup as regular ideals of a ring. In the paper, we first describe (Zariski) models as integral schemes that are separated and of finite type over an integral domain $D$. We then construct a ring $D^*$ for a given projective model (e.g. blowup of $D$ over a finitely generated ideal) by intersecting Nagata function rings. The spectrum of $D^*$ contains the projective model, but similar to the Proj-construction, it includes additional prime ideals. We characterize the relevant ideals and construct a faithfully flat morphism of schemes from the spectrum of $D^*$ to the model. Finally, using Abhyankar's definition of ideals on models, we identify the relevant ideals of $D^*$ with the quasi-coherent sheaves of ideals of the corresponding projective model.</description>

      <title>Splitting the difference: Computations of the Reynolds operator in classical invariant theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If $G$ is a linearly reductive group acting rationally on a polynomial ring $S$, then the inclusion $S^{G} \hookrightarrow S$ possesses a unique $G$-equivariant splitting, called the Reynolds operator. We describe algorithms for computing the Reynolds operator for the classical actions as in Weyl's book. The groups are the general linear group, the special linear group, the orthogonal group, and the symplectic group, with their classical representations: direct sums of copies of the standard representation and copies of the dual representation.</description>

      <title>{n the Equality $\sum_{j} e_jf_j=[L:K]$ \vspace{2mm} On the Equality $\sum_{j} e_jf_j=[L:K]$ for a Finite Separable Extension $L$ of $K$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $v$ be a discrete valuation of a field $K$, which indicates that the valuation group of $v$ is isomorphic to the integers $\mathbb{Z}$ with the natural order, and let $L$ be a finite separable extension of $K$ with a complete set $\{V_1,V_2,...,V_g\}$ of extended valuations of $v$. Then it is well-known that the following basic equation holds: \[\sum_{j=1}^{g} e_jf_j= [L:K],\] where $e_j$ and $f_j$ denote the ramification index and the relative degree for each $j$, respectively. We extend this result to the case when $v$ is a semi-discrete valuation, indicating that the valuation group is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}^n\ (n\geq 1)$ with lexicographic order. As a corollary to this result, we show that it is necessary and sufficient for the integral closure $D$ of the valuation ring $A$ of $v$ to be a free $A$-module that all prime ideals of $D$ other than the maximal ideals are unramified.</description>

      <title>Computing Direct Sum Decompositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problems of finding isomorphism classes of indecomposable modules with certain properties, or determining the indecomposable summands of a module, are ubiquitous in commutative algebra, group theory, representation theory, and other fields. The purpose of this work is to describe and prove correctness of a practical algorithm for computing indecomposable summands of finitely generated modules over a finitely generated k-algebra, for k a field of positive characteristic. Our algorithm works over multigraded rings, which enables the computation of indecomposable summands of coherent sheaves on subvarieties of toric varieties (in particular, for varieties embedded in projective space). We also present multiple examples, including some which present previously unknown phenomena regarding the behavior of summands of Frobenius pushforwards and syzygies over Artinian rings.</description>

      <title>Calabi-Yau completions for roots of dualizing dg bimodules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Roots of shifted Serre functors appear naturally in representation theory and algebraic geometry. We give an analogue of Keller's Calabi-Yau completion for roots of shifted inverse dualizing bimodules over dg categories. Given a positive integer $a$, we introduce the notion of the $a$-th root pair on smooth dg categories and define its Calabi-Yau completion. We prove that the Calabi-Yau completion has the Calabi-Yau property when the $a$-th root pair has certain invariance under an action of the cyclic group of order $a$, and observe that it is only twisted Calabi-Yau in general. Next, we establish a bijection between Adams graded Calabi-Yau dg categories of Gorenstein parameter $a$ and $a$-th root pairs on a dg category with the cyclic invariance. Applying this bijection, we prove that a certain operation on dg categories, called the $a$-Segre product, allows us to reproduce Calabi-Yau dg categories. Furthermore, we discuss the cluster category of these Calabi-Yau completions, and prove that it is a $\mathbb{Z}/a\mathbb{Z}$-quotient of the usual cluster category, which thereby establishes the $a$-th root versions of cluster categories. In the appendix, we give a generalization of Beilinson's theorem on tilting bundles on projective spaces to the setting of Adams graded dg categories.</description>

      <title>Higher hereditary algebras arising from some toric singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study graded and ungraded singularity categories of some commutative Gorenstein toric singularities, namely, Veronese subrings of polynomial rings, and Segre products of some copies of polynomial rings. We show that the graded singularity category has a tilting object whose endomorphism ring is higher representation infinite. Moreover, we construct the tilting object so that the endomorphism ring has a strict root pair of its higher Auslander-Reiten translation, which allows us to give equivalences between singularity categories and (folded) cluster categories in a such a way that their cluster tilting objects correspond to each other. Our distinguished form of tilting objects also allows us to construct (twisted) Calabi-Yau algebras as the Calabi-Yau completions of the root pairs. We give an explicit description of these twisted Calabi-Yau algebras as well as the higher representation infinite algebras in terms of quivers and relations. Along the way, we prove that certain idempotent quotients of higher representation infinite algebras remain higher representation infinite.</description>

      <title>Vop\v{e}nka's Principle, Maximum Deconstructibility, and set-generation of torsion classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deconstructibility is an often-used sufficient condition on a class $\mathcal{C}$ of modules that allows one to carry out homological algebra \emph{relative to $\mathcal{C}$}. The principle \textbf{Maximum Deconstructibility (MD)} asserts that a certain necessary condition for a class to be deconstructible, is also sufficient. MD implies, for example, that the classes of Gorenstein Projective modules, Ding Projective modules, their relativized variants, and all torsion classes are deconstructible over any ring. MD was known to follow from Vop\v{e}nka's Principle and imply the existence of an $\omega_1$-strongly compact cardinal. We prove that MD is equivalent to Vop\v{e}nka's Principle, and to the assertion that all torsion classes of abelian groups are generated by a set (yielding the converse of a theorem of G\"obel and Shelah).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the category $\mathop{\mathrm{ref}}\Lambda$ of reflexive modules over a two-sided Noetherian ring $\Lambda$. We show that the category $\mathop{\mathrm{ref}}\Lambda$ is quasi-abelian if and only if $\Lambda$ satisfies certain Auslander-type condition on the minimal injective resolution of the ring itself. Furthermore, we establish a Morita theorem which characterizes the category of reflexive modules among quasi-abelian categories in terms of generator-cogenerators.</description>

      <title>Conjugation, loop and closure invariants of the iterated-integrals signature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a feature set for the shape of a closed loop, it is natural to ask which features in that set do not change when the starting point of the path is moved. For example, in two dimensions, the area enclosed by the path does not depend on the starting point. In the present article, we characterize such loop invariants among all those features known as interated integrals of a given path. Furthermore, we relate these to conjugation invariants, which are a canonical object of study when treating (tree reduced) paths as a group with multiplication given by the concatenation. Finally, closure invariants are a third class in this context which is of particular relevance when studying piecewise linear trajectories, e.g. given by linear interpolation of time series.

      <title>The Existence of MacWilliams-Type Identities for the Lee, Homogeneous and Subfield Metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11926v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Famous results state that the classical MacWilliams identities fail for the Lee metric, the homogeneous metric and for the subfield metric, apart from some trivial cases. In this paper we change the classical idea of enumerating the codewords of the same weight and choose a finer way of partitioning the code that still contains all the information of the weight enumerator of the code. The considered decomposition allows for MacWilliams-type identities which hold for any additive weight over a finite chain ring. For the specific cases of the homogeneous and the subfield metric we then define a coarser partition for which the MacWilliams-type identities still hold. This result shows that one can, in fact, relate the code and the dual code in terms of their weights, even for these metrics. Finally, we derive Linear Programming bounds stemming from the MacWilliams-type identities presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:0912.4412v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a question of sum-keeping about a multiplicative subsemigroup and its generator subsets in a semiring, and develop some elementary (collapse) process of the sum-keeping retraction through subsets until one minimal generators subset. As an application, we study and analyze several classical problems in additive number theory on the semiring of non-negative integers by this algebraic and combinatory idea, and provide new proofs in more simple and direct way for several classical results in number theory. Some further questions are also presented and discussed.</description>
