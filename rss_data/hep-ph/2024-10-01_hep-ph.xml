      <title>Large neutrino asymmetry from forbidden decay of dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark matter (DM), in spite of being stable or long-lived on cosmological scales, can decay in the early Universe due to finite-temperature effects. In particular, a first order phase transition (FOPT) in the early Universe can provide a finite window for such decay, guaranteeing DM stability at lower temperatures, consistent with observations. The FOPT can lead to the generation of stochastic gravitational waves (GW) with peak frequencies correlated with DM mass. On the other hand, early DM decay into neutrinos can create a large neutrino asymmetry which can have interesting cosmological consequences in terms of enhanced effective relativistic degrees of freedom $N_{\rm eff}$, providing a solution to the recently observed Helium anomaly among others. Allowing DM decay to occur below sphaleron decoupling temperature, thereby avoiding overproduction of baryon asymmetry, forces the FOPT to occur at sub-electroweak scale. This leaves the stochastic GW within range of experiments like LISA, $\mu$ARES, NANOGrav etc.</description>

      <title>Looping Around Neutrino Charge Radius at Ultra-Near Reactor Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We scrutinize the potential of upcoming ultra-near reactor neutrino experiments to detect radiative corrections in the elastic neutrino-electron scattering channel, focusing on the JUNO-TAO and CLOUD detectors, which employ advanced scintillator detection technologies. Previous reactor experiments have already constrained the electron neutrino charge radius, which is a neutrino property associated with a certain subset of the total radiative corrections, and have achieved limits that are only about an order of magnitude away from the Standard Model prediction. Our study demonstrates that JUNO-TAO and CLOUD could discover the neutrino charge radius in the near future, considering the established treatment of the charge radius. However, we show that it is necessary to go beyond this standard treatment. By including the complete set of one-loop level radiative corrections, we find a partial cancellation with the charge radius effect, reducing the experimental sensitivity to this quantity. Nevertheless, JUNO-TAO and CLOUD still have the potential to achieve a $5\sigma$ discovery but over longer timescales within a reasonable operational timeframe.</description>

      <title>Effective field theory analysis of rare $|\Delta c|=|\Delta u|=1$ charm decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a global analysis of $|\Delta c| = |\Delta u| = 1$ transitions using recent data on $D^0 \to \mu^+\mu^-$, $D^+ \to \pi ^+\,\mu^+\mu^-$, $\Lambda_c \to p\,\mu^+\mu^-$, and $D^0 \to \pi^+\pi^-\,\mu^+\mu^-$ decays, and work out constraints on new physics Wilson coefficients $\mathcal{C}_{7,9,10}^{(\prime)}$. While results are consistent with the standard model, we find sizeable room for new physics that can be cleanly signaled with null test observables, not probed with searches in other sectors such as kaon and $b$-decays. The decay $D^0 \to \pi^+\pi^-\,\mu^+\mu^-$ requires better understanding of hadronic contributions to be competitive in the current fit. Progress can be achieved by precision study of the double differential decay rate in the dipion and dimuon masses, together with improved theory modelling and $D \to \pi \pi$ transition form factors. On the other hand, the 4-body decay is an important contributor to the future global analysis due to its angular distributions that probe complementary combinations of Wilson coefficients, and as a QCD laboratory. The decay $\Lambda_c \to p\,\ell^+\ell^-$ is the rising star due to the simplicity of a 3-body decay with available form factors from lattice QCD, sensitivity to both 4-fermion and electromagnetic dipole couplings and its null test forward-backward asymmetry.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative Origin of the Electroweak Scale with Dyson-Schwinger: Fermionic Mass Gap and Higher-order Excitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study interaction of a fermion field $\psi$ with a scalar field $\phi$ and analyze the spectrum of the theory obtained in this way. It is shown that due to non-perturbative dynamics in the hidden fermion sector, $\phi$ develops a vacuum expectation value (vev) in the form of a mass gap which triggers the electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB) and dynamically generates the SM Higgs boson mass. For estimating the non-perturbatively generated mass scale, we solve the hierarchy of Dyson-Schwinger Equations in form of partial differential equations using the exact solution known via a novel technique developed by Bender, Milton and Savage. We employ Jacobi Elliptic function as exact background solution and show that the mass gap that arises in the fermion sector can be transmuted to the EW sector, expressed in terms of fermion mass and the $\phi$ self-quartic. We identify the suitable parameter space where the observed SM Higgs boson can be successfully generated .</description>

      <title>Production asymmetry of $D$ and ${\bar D}$ mesons in the LHCb fixed target experiment and intrinsic charm in the nucleon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss production of $D^0$ and ${\bar D}^0$ mesons in proton-nucleus collisions in fixed target experiments. We include gluon-gluon fusion, intrinsic charm and perturbative recombination. We compare rapidity and transverse momentum distributions obtained within our approach with recent fixed target LHCb experimental data. All the mechanisms seem important for inclusive production of $D^0 + {\bar D}^0$ mesons. The recombination mechanism seems crucial to understand asymmetry in production of $D^0$ and ${\bar D}^0$ mesons.</description>

      <title>Towards unifying perturbative and Holographic Light-Front QCD via holomorphic coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a QCD coupling ${\mathcal{A}}(Q^2)$ in the Effective Charge (ECH) scheme of the canonical part $d(Q^2)$ of the (inelastic) polarised Bjorken Sum Rule (BSR) ${\overline \Gamma}_1^{{\rm p-n}}(Q^2)$. In the perturbative domain, the coupling ${\mathcal{A}}(Q^2)$ practically coincides with the perturbative coupling $a(Q^2)$ [$\equiv \alpha_s(Q^2)/\pi$] in the four-loop ECH renormalisation scheme. In the deep infrared (IR) regime, ${\mathcal{A}}(Q^2)$ behaves as suggested by the Holographic Light-Front QCD up to the second derivative. Furthermore, in contrast to its perturbative counterpart $a(Q^2)$, the coupling ${\mathcal{A}}(Q^2)$ is holomorphic in the entire complex $Q^2$-plane with the exception of the negative semiaxis, reflecting the holomorphic properties of the BSR observable $d(Q^2)$ [or: ${\overline \Gamma}_1^{{\rm p-n}}(Q^2)$] as dictated by the general principles of the Quantum Field Theory. It turns out that the obtained coupling, used as ECH, reproduces quite well the experimental data for ${\overline \Gamma}_1^{{\rm p-n}}(Q^2)$ in the entire $N_f=3$ regime $0 &lt; Q^2 \lesssim 5 \ {\rm GeV}^2$.</description>

      <title>Hadronic rescattering to solve helicity puzzle in $B^+\to p\bar p \pi^+(K^+)$ decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the contribution of hadronic final state interactions (FSI) to propose a production mechanism and interpret the puzzle on helicity angle distributions in $B^+\to p\bar p \pi^+$ and $B^+\to p\bar p K^+$ decays. Experimental results indicate opposite helicity angle $\theta_p$ distributions in those two channels with the difference presenting a remarkable linear dependence on $\cos \theta_p$. We assume the production mechanism is driven by $B^+\to xy\, m^+ \to p\bar p m^+$, where $m =\pi$ or $K$, and $xy$ represents favorable mesonic decay channels producing $p\bar p$. We develop a model that includes three-body final state interaction between the $p\,,~\bar p$ and $\pi^+$ or $K^+$ considering the dominance of elastic channels $\pi^+p$ and $K^+\bar p$ interactions below 2\,GeV/c$^2$. Our three-body framework with FSI explains qualitatively the observed opposite behavior of the helicity distributions and the observed linearity.</description>

      <title>Enhancing DUNE's solar neutrino capabilities with neutral-current detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) has the potential to make a precise measurement of the total active flux of 8B solar neutrinos via neutral-current (NC) interactions with argon. This would complement proposed precise measurements of solar-neutrino fluxes in DUNE via charged-current (CC) interactions with argon and mixed CC/NC interactions with electrons. Together, these would enable DUNE to make a SNO-like comparison of rates and thus to make the most precise measurements of $\sin^2\theta_{12}$ and $\Delta m^2_{21}$ using solar neutrinos. Realizing this potential requires dedicated but realistic efforts to improve DUNE's low-energy capabilities and separately to reduce neutrino-argon cross section uncertainties. Comparison of mixing-parameter results obtained using solar neutrinos in DUNE and reactor antineutrinos in JUNO (Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory) would allow unprecedented tests of new physics.</description>

      <title>On the temperature effects in QCD axion mass mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we extend the QCD axion mass mixing in the early Universe and investigate the temperature effects in the mixing. We explore the scenario where two $Z_{\mathcal N}$ QCD axions undergo mass mixing during the QCD phase transition, yielding three distinct mixing scenarios: mixing I, II, and III. These scenarios are realized through fine-tuning of the axion decay constants, the temperature parameters, as well as the value of $\mathcal N$. We conduct a thorough analysis of the level crossing phenomena in these three mixing scenarios, detailing the conditions under which they occur. Notably, in the mixing I and II, the level crossing precedes the critical temperature of the QCD phase transition ($T_{\rm QCD}$), with minimal non-essential discrepancies in the cosmological evolution of the mass eigenvalues at $T_{\rm QCD}$. In contrast, the mixing III exhibits a unique double level crossings, occurring both before and at $T_{\rm QCD}$. Despite superficial similarities in axion evolution between the mixing II and III, we uncover fundamental differences between them. Additionally, we briefly address the transition in energy density between the two axions within our mixing scenarios. This work contributes to a deeper understanding of the role of the QCD axion in the early Universe and its potential implications for dark matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this contribution, we present new results of next-to-leading order (NLO) electroweak corrections to the doubly polarized $W^+W^-$ production cross sections at the LHC, via the full leptonic final state. This calculation has been recently achieved independently by two groups: one in Germany and our group in Vietnam. A comparison of the two results will be presented. We include also the NLO QCD corrections in the numerical analysis since they are dominant and therefore important for comparison with experimental results.</description>

      <title>Low-$Q^{2}$ nucleon structure from an infrared-safe evolution scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The low-$Q^2$ nucleon structure is given with a simple nonperturbative input of three valence quarks and an all-order infrared-safe evolution scheme, showing some consistences with the experimental data. The resonance peaks in the experimental data of $F_2$ structure function are found to be modulated by the valence quark distributions. With little sea quark distribution at low $Q^2$ the valence-quark bump is clearly shown in the structure function. The three valence quark distributions at the hadronic scale is found to be the dominant origin of the PDFs at the hard scales. The high-twist corrections are needed to explain the sizeable discrepancy between the theory and the experimental measurements at low $Q^2$. The infrared-safe evolution scheme is a powerful tool for connecting the nucleon structures in the nonperturbative and perturbative regions.</description>

      <title>Separating the transverse and longitudinal modes of $\phi$, $\rho$, $K^*$ and $K_1$ mesons through their angular-dependent two-body decay modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mass shift a spin-1 particle moving in the nuclear medium will depend on its polarization direction. To study polarization-independent mass shifts in the medium, we explore methods to isolate each polarization direction of spin-1 mesons through the angular-dependent two-body decay modes. Specifically, we study $\phi\to K^{+}K^{-}$, $\rho\to\pi\pi$, $K^{*}\to K\pi$, $\phi\to e^{+}e^{-}$ and $K_{1}\to\rho K(K^{*}\pi)$ decays. While each polarization mode can be isolated through angular dependencies, accomplishing the decomposition for the $K_1$ meson further requires measuring the polarization of the $\rho(K^*)$ meson. Concerning $K^{*}$ and $K_1$ mesons, since both particles have vacuum widths smaller than 100 MeV, they are ideal candidates for experimentally measuring chiral partners. The simultaneous observation of mass shifts of these chiral partners would provide valuable insights into the contribution of chiral symmetry breaking to the generation of hadron masses.</description>

      <title>Long-lived sterile neutrinos from an axionlike particle at Belle II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Axionlike particles (ALPs) can be produced in meson decays via tree-level quark-flavor-violating couplings, and decay to a pair of sterile neutrinos if also coupled to them. Such light sterile neutrinos are necessarily long-lived and may give rise to striking signatures of displaced vertices (DVs) at terrestrial experiments. In this work, we study the prospect of the ongoing Belle II experiment for detecting the sterile neutrinos from the ALP, leveraging the $\mathcal{O}(10^{10})$ $B$-mesons produced at the experiment. We propose search strategies for one or two DVs, and perform Monte-Carlo simulations in order to estimate the sensitivity reach of Belle II to active-sterile-neutrino mixing $|V_{eN}|^2$ as functions of the sterile-neutrino mass, under the legitimate assumption of zero background. Our results show that the proposed search strategies can probe values of $|V_{eN}|^2$ orders of magnitude beyond the existing bounds. Compared to the one-DV search, the two-DV one, despite its weaker sensitivities as a result of double exponential suppression of the sterile-neutrino decay positions, possesses the advantage of possible full reconstruction of the signal event allowing for pinning down the masses of the sterile neutrino and the ALP, if a discovery is made.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the parameter space of a minimal extension of the Standard Model with a non-abelian $SU(2)$ group, in which the gauge bosons are stable and acquire mass through a mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking involving a new scalar doublet which interacts with the Higgs boson through a quartic coupling. The exploration aims to assess whether it is possible to obtain a first-order phase transition while ensuring that the gauge bosons are viable dark matter candidates. Theoretical, astrophysical and collider bounds are considered. The results are then tested against the sensitivity of future experiments for the detection of gravitational wave signals.</description>

      <title>Molecular states with charm: insights from vacuum and finite-temperature analyses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This contribution to the SQM2024 conference covers the molecular hypothesis for the internal structure of some open and hidden charm states. The use of effective theories that incorporate heavy-quark spin symmetry, combined with unitarization techniques, has provided strong evidences supporting this interpretation. In the heavy-light sector, we discuss the double pole structure of the $D_0^*(2300)$ and the generation of the $D_{s0}^*(2317)$. In the hidden charm sector, we focus on the exotic $X(3872)$ and its heavy-quark partner, the $X(4014)$. Furthermore, we emphasize the benefits of femtoscopic measurements in $p+p$ collisions to establish the nature of these states, as well as the potential role of temperature to discern their internal structure.</description>

      <title>Residual flavour (anti)symmetries at the modular self-dual point and constraints on neutrino masses and mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the implications of symmetries that remain unbroken at the self-dual point $\tau=i$ in modular invariant theories. Assuming that (a) the three generations of lepton doublets transform as an irreducible representation of a finite modular group $\Gamma_N$, and (b) the light neutrino masses arise from the Weinberg operator and are in modular form, we demonstrate that this setup yields a unique residual flavor symmetry or antisymmetry for the neutrinos, depending on the modular weight. In the antisymmetric case, one neutrino is always massless, and the other two can be degenerate if the mass matrix is real. These findings are independent of the level $N$. If the charged leptons are arranged to exhibit an appropriate residual symmetry from the same $\Gamma_N$, they determine a column of the leptonic mixing matrix, leading to specific correlations between the mixing angles and the Dirac CP phase. The presence of residual (anti)symmetries enables the application of standard flavor symmetry techniques to derive these predictions, and we scan all possible $\Gamma_N$ satisfying condition (a). Most solutions yield ${\cal O}(1)$ entries in the fixed column, favouring relatively large lepton mixing.</description>

      <title>Hidden charm-bottom structures $bc\overline{b}\overline{c}$: Axial-vector case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mass and width of a hidden charm-bottom axial-vector structure $T$ containing $bc \overline{b}\overline{c}$ quarks are calculated in QCD sum rule framework. It is treated as a diquark-antidiquark state built of scalar diquark and axial-vector antidiquark components. The mass of $T$ is computed using the two-point sum rule method. The width of this particle is evaluated by considering eight decay modes: The decays to $\eta _{b}J/\psi $, $\eta _{c}\Upsilon (1S)$, $B_{c}^{-}B_{c}^{\ast +}$, and $B_{c}^{+}B_{c}^{\ast -}$ are dissociation processes, in which all initial quarks are distributed between the final-state particles. Four decays to $DD$ mesons with appropriate charges and spin-parities are channels generated due to the annihilation of $b$ and $\overline{b}$ quarks from $T$. Partial widths for all of these processes are obtained by employing the three-point sum rule approach necessary to find the strong couplings at relevant tetraquark-meson-meson vertices. Our results for the mass $m=(12715\pm 90)~\mathrm{MeV}$ and width $\Gamma[T] =(104.2 \pm 11.2)~ \mathrm{MeV}$ of the tetraquark $T$, as well as its numerous decay channels explored in this article are useful for ongoing and future experimental investigations of fully heavy resonances.</description>

      <title>Back-to-back dijet production in DIS at next-to-eikonal accuracy and twist-3 gluon TMDs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider dijet production in deep inelastic scattering at small $x$, on a purely gluonic unpolarized target. Starting from earlier results obtained at next-to-eikonal accuracy in the high-energy limit, we perform the expansion in the back-to-back dijet limit, at next-to-leading power accuracy. We rewrite our results in the language of transverse-momentum-dependent (TMD) factorization, in terms of twist-2 and twist-3 TMD gluon distributions (gluon TMDs). Among the next-to-eikonal corrections, we find in particular twist-2 contributions corresponding to the $x$ dependent phase of the twist-2 gluon TMDs. We also find two types of twist-3 unpolarized gluon TMDs, as well as correlators of three gluon field strength tensors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the discovery of the fully charmed tetraquark state $X(6900)$ in the invariant mass spectrum of $J/\psi$ pairs by the LHCb collaboration, this study explores the potential existence of fully heavy pentaquark states. We systematically investigate the low-lying s-wave fully heavy pentaquark states across all possible configurations. The classification of these states is performed using the Young-Yamounachi bases through the Young-tableau technique. We analyze the mass spectrum and magnetic moments of pentaquarks with quantum numbers $J^P$= $\frac{1}{2}^{\pm}$,$\frac{3}{2}^{\pm}$ and $\frac{5}{2}^{\pm}$ utilizing effective mass and screened charge schemes. Our findings are compared with various theoretical models, providing valuable insights for future experimental studies.</description>

      <title>Current Status of Inert Higgs Dark Matter with Dark Fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The precision measurements of the muon magnetic moment and the $W$ boson mass have sparked interest in the potential deviations from standard model (SM) predictions. While it may be premature to attribute any excesses in these precision measurements to new physics, they do offer a valuable indication of potential directions for physics beyond the SM. Additionally, the particle nature of dark matter (DM) remains a crucial enigma. Despite the absence of any definitive DM signal in direct detection and collider experiments, the Galactic Center GeV $\gamma$-ray excess and the AMS-02 antiproton ($\overline{p}$) excess could potentially offer hints related to the evidence of DM. Motivated by these observations, we propose a simple DM model that addresses all these issues. This model extends the SM by incorporating singlet and doublet Dirac fermion fields, along with a doublet complex scalar field. For the viable parameter regions in this model, we find that future upgrades of the Large Hadron Collider and DM direct detection experiments can only partially probe them, while future high-energy muon colliders hold promise for exploring the unexplored parameter space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the energy dependence of the total and diffractive neutrino-nucleon and neutrino-nucleus cross sections at very high energies. The calculation employs the QCD dipole model and the small-$x$ nonlinear Balitsky-Kovchegov evolution. We show the sensitivity of the nuclear effect quantification on the nuclear setup, and predict up to $\sim 10\%$ nuclear suppression in the inclusive neutrino-oxygen scattering stemming from the nonlinear evolution. Diffractive contribution to the total scattering is small, which is only few percentage. The $\left|q\bar{q}g\right&gt;$ componnent of the $W^{\pm}$ boson is found to contribute significantly to the diffractive process, which reaches up to $\sim 40\%$ of the diffractive cross section.</description>

      <title>Quantum Closures for Neutrino Moment Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A computationally efficient method for calculating the transport of neutrino flavor in simulations is to use angular moments of the neutrino one-body reduced density matrix, i.e., `quantum moments'. As with any moment-based radiation transport method, a closure is needed if the infinite tower of moment evolution equations is truncated. We derive a general parameterization of a quantum closure and the limits the parameters must satisfy in order for the closure to be physical. We then derive from multi-angle calculations the evolution of the closure parameters in two test cases which we then progressively insert into a moment evolution code and show how the parameters affect the moment results until the full multi-angle results are reproduced. This parameterization paves the way to setting prescriptions for genuine quantum closures adapted to neutrino transport in a range of situations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on recent papers, we discuss the formulation of the first-order relativistic spin magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) with the totally antisymmetric spin current and properties of the anisotropic linear waves awaken near an equilibrium configuration. We show that there appears a critical angle in the momentum direction of the linear waves, where a pair of propagating modes turns into purely diffusive modes. Due to this critical behavior, polynomial solutions do not fully capture the angle dependence of the linear waves.</description>

      <title>New calculation of collision integrals for cosmological phase transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: First order phase transitions in the early universe may have left a variety of experimentally accessible imprints. The dynamics of such transitions is governed by the density perturbations caused by the propagation of the bubble wall in the false vacuum plasma, conveniently described by a Boltzmann equation. The determination of the bubble wall expansion velocity is crucial to determine the experimental signatures of the transition. We report on the first full (numerical) solution to the Boltzmann equation. Differently from traditional ones, our approach does not rely on any ansatz. The results significantly differ from the ones obtained within the fluid approximation and large differences for the friction acting on the bubble wall are found. The wall velocity is calculated in a singlet extension of the Standard Model, including out-of-equilibrium contributions from both the top quark and the electroweak gauge bosons.</description>

      <title>Nanohertz gravitational waves and primordial quark nuggets from dense QCD matter in the early universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first-order QCD phase transition at high temperature features a large transition rate in the magnitude of $\beta/H \sim 10^4$ with induced stochastic gravitational waves typically lying in the LISA range. High baryon density in the early universe can be generated through Affleck-Dine baryogenesis. The baryon chemical potential enhances the potential barrier and significantly reduces the transition rate, which decreases from infinity at the critical end point (CEP) to zero at the critical nucleation point (CNP). Nanohertz gravitational waves can be produced in a narrow window of high baryon chemical potential with transition rate in the order of $\beta/H \sim 10^1$. When the phase transition rate reaches zero, the false vacuum of high baryon density quark matter is unlikely to decay and can persist over cosmological time scales. Therefore the primordial quark nuggets (PQN) can form and survive in the early universe as the seeds of compact stars, thereby dramatically accelerating the evolution of compact stars and the formation of galaxies, which may explain the high red-shift massive galaxies observed by the James Webb Space Telescope.</description>

      <title>Unlocking the Inelastic Dark Matter Window with Vector Mediators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the robust cosmological and astrophysical evidence confirming the existence of a non-baryonic matter component in the Universe, the underlying nature of Dark Matter (DM) remains a mystery. Among the several possible scenarios, light DM candidates thermally produced in the early Universe are especially interesting, since their abundance could be set via the standard freeze-out mechanism. Additionally, new light states can present a rich phenomenology and are attracting increasing attention due to recent experimental capabilities to probe dark sectors with feeble interactions. In particular, inelastic DM (iDM) candidates are an appealing option, since they can avoid cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation bounds as well as indirect and direct detection searches. Although such models have been intensively studied in the literature, the usual scenario is to consider a secluded dark photon mediator. In this work, we consider the case of iDM with general vector mediators and explore the consequences of such a choice in the relic density computation, as well as for the cosmological and experimental bounds. We examine models with couplings to baryon and lepton number and show new viable parameter regions for inelastic dark matter models. Especially, anomaly-free gauge groups with non-universal couplings to leptons open new windows of the parameter space for thermal dark matter yet unexplored by experiments. We also provide a numerical Python library to compute the relic densities for user-defined gauge charges.</description>

      <title>Massive neutrinos and cosmic composition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmological data probe massive neutrinos via their effects on the geometry of the Universe and the growth of structure, both of which are degenerate with the late-time expansion history. We clarify the nature of these degeneracies and the individual roles of both probes in neutrino mass inference. Geometry is strongly sensitive to neutrino masses: within $\Lambda$CDM, the primary cosmic microwave background anisotropies alone impose that the matter fraction $\Omega_m$ must increase fivefold with increasing neutrino mass. Moreover, large-scale structure observables, like weak lensing of the CMB, are dimensionless and thus depend not on the matter density (as often quoted) but in fact the matter fraction. We explore the consequential impact of this distinction on the interplay between probes of structure, low-redshift distances, and CMB anisotropies. We derive constraints on the neutrino's masses independently from their suppression of structure and impact on geometry, showing that the latter is at least as important as the former. While the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument's recent baryon acoustic oscillation data place stringent bounds largely deriving from their geometric incompatibility with massive neutrinos, all recent type Ia supernova datasets drive marginal preferences for nonzero neutrino masses because they prefer substantially larger matter fractions. Recent CMB lensing data, however, neither exclude neutrinos' suppression of structure nor constrain it strongly enough to discriminate between mass hierarchies. Current data thus evince not a need for modified dynamics of neutrino perturbations or structure growth but rather an inconsistent compatibility with massive neutrinos' impact on the expansion history. We identify two of DESI's measurements that strongly influence its constraints, and we also discuss neutrino mass measurements in models that alter the sound horizon.</description>

      <title>Entanglement entropy of a color flux tube in (2+1)D Yang-Mills theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a novel flux tube entanglement entropy (FTE$^2$), defined as the excess entanglement entropy relative to the vacuum of a region of color flux stretching between a heavy quark-anti-quark pair in pure gauge Yang-Mills theory. We show that FTE$^2$ can be expressed in terms of correlators of Polyakov loops, is manifestly gauge-invariant, and therefore free of the ambiguities in computations of the entanglement entropy in gauge theories related to the choice of the center algebra. Employing the replica trick, we compute FTE$^2$ for $SU(2)$ Yang-Mills theory in (2+1)D and demonstrate that it is finite in the continuum limit. We explore the properties of FTE$^2$ for a half-slab geometry, which allows us to vary the width and location of the slab, and the extent to which the slab cross-cuts the color flux tube. Following the intuition provided by computations of FTE$^2$ in (1+1)D, and in a thin string model, we examine the extent to which our FTE$^2$ results can be interpreted as the sum of an internal color entropy and a vibrational entropy corresponding to the transverse excitations of the string.</description>

      <title>Probing fermionic asymmetric dark matter cores using global neutron star properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is possible for asymmetric dark matter (ADM) to accumulate in neutron star interiors and affect their global properties. Considering the effects of this accumulation, neutron star mass-radius measurements can deliver new insights into the cold dense matter equation of state (EoS). In this paper, we employ Bayesian parameter estimation using real and synthetic neutron star mass-radius data to infer constraints on the combined baryonic matter and fermionic ADM EoS, where the fermionic ADM forms a core in the neutron star interior. Using currently available mass-radius data, we find that the lower bound of the ratio between ADM effective self-repulsion strength ($g_\chi/m_\phi$) and particle mass ($m_\chi$) can be constrained at the 68% (95%) credible level to $10^{-6.59}$ ($10^{-7.36}$). We also find that, if neutron star mass-radius measurement uncertainties are reduced to the 2% level, the constraints on lower bound on the ratio of $g_\chi/m_\phi$ to $m_\chi$ can be improved to $10^{-6.5}$ and $10^{-7.29}$ at the 68% and 95% credible levels, respectively. However, all other combinations, of $m_\chi$, $g_\chi$, and the ADM mass-fraction, $F_\chi$, (i.e., the ratio of the gravitational ADM mass to the gravitational mass of the neutron star) are unconstrained. Furthermore, in the pressure-energy density and mass-radius planes, the inferences which include the possibility of fermionic ADM cores are nearly identical with the inferences that neglect fermionic ADM for $F_\chi \leq 1.7\%$ and neutron star mass-radius uncertainties $\geq 2\%$. Therefore, we find that neutron star mass-radius measurements can constrain ADM in some scenarios and that the presence of ADM in neutron star cores is as equally consistent with current data as the absence of ADM.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new method to calculate moments of parton distribution functions of any order with lattice QCD computations. This method leverages the gradient flow for fermion and gauge fields. The flowed matrix elements of twist-2 operators renormalize multiplicatively, and the matching with physical matrix elements is achieved through the use of continuum symmetries. We derive the matching coefficients at one-loop in perturbation theory for moments of any order in the flavor non-singlet case and provide specific examples of operators suitable for lattice QCD computations. The multiplicative renormalization and matching are independent of the choice of Lorentz indices, allowing the use of temporal indices for twist-2 operators of any dimension. This approach should then also significantly enhance the signal-to-noise ratio in the computation of moments.</description>

      <title>Learning to Reconstruct Quirky Tracks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analysis of data from particle physics experiments traditionally sacrifices some sensitivity to new particles for the sake of practical computability, effectively ignoring some potentially striking signatures. However, recent advances in ML-based tracking allow for new inroads into previously inaccessible territory, such as reconstruction of tracks which do not follow helical trajectories. This paper presents a demonstration of the capacity of ML-based tracking to reconstruct the oscillating trajectories of quirks. The technique used is not specific to quirks, and opens the door to a program of searching for many kinds of non-standard tracks.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Field Effects on Hadron Yields and Fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the impact of an external magnetic field on hadron yields and fluctuations in a thermalized system within the hadron resonance gas (HRG) model using an expanded Thermal-FIST package. The magnetic field sizably enhances the final proton-to-pion (p/$\pi$) ratio due to $\Delta(1232)^{++}$ decay feeddown indicating that this ratio may serve as a potential magnetometer for freeze-out conditions. At the same time, magnetic field does not generate additional dynamical fluctuations of hadron numbers. This suggests that fluctuations in heavy-ion collisions provide limited additional information about the magnetic field beyond what is already inferred from mean multiplicities.</description>

      <title>Fisher Forecast of Finite-Size Effects with Future Gravitational Wave Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use Fisher information theory to forecast the bounds on the finite-size effects of astrophysical compact objects with next-generation gravitational wave detectors, including the ground-based Cosmic Explorer (CE) and Einstein Telescope (ET), as well as the space-based Laser Infrared Space Antenna (LISA). Exploiting the worldline effective field theory (EFT) formalism, we first characterize three types of quadrupole finite-size effects: the spin-induced quadrupole moments, the conservative tidal deformations, and the tidal heating. We then derive the corresponding contributions to the gravitational waveform phases for binary compact objects in aligned-spin quasi-circular orbits. We separately estimate the constraints on these finite-size effects for black holes using the power spectral densities (PSDs) of the CE+ET detector network and LISA observations. For the CE+ET network, we find that the bounds on the mass-weighted spin-independent dissipation number $H_0$ are of the order $O(1)$, while the bounds on the mass-weighted tidal Love number $\tilde{\Lambda}$ are of the order $O(10)$. For high-spin binary black holes with dimensionless spin $\chi \simeq 0.8$, the bounds on the symmetric spin-induced quadrupole moment $\kappa_s$ are of the order $O(10^{-1})$. LISA observations of supermassive black hole mergers offer slightly tighter constraints on all three finite-size parameters. Additionally, we perform a Fisher analysis for a binary neutron star merger within the CE+ET network. The bounds on the tidal parameter $H_0$ and on $\tilde \Lambda$ are around two orders of magnitude better than the current LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) bounds.</description>

      <title>Instability of nonsingular black holes in nonlinear electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that nonsingular black holes realized in nonlinear electrodynamics are always prone to Laplacian instability around the center because of a negative squared sound speed in the angular direction. This is the case for both electric and magnetic BHs, where the instability of one of the vector-field perturbations leads to enhancing a dynamical gravitational perturbation in the even-parity sector. Thus, the background regular metric is no longer maintained in a steady state. Our results suggest that the construction of stable, nonsingular black holes with regular centers, if they exist, requires theories beyond nonlinear electrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Cross Correlating the Unresolved Gamma-Ray Background with Cosmic Large-Scale Structure from DESI: Implications for Astrophysics and Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The unresolved gamma-ray background (UGRB) is a diffuse gamma-ray emission arising from numerous extragalactic sources below the detection threshold and is an important component of the gamma-ray sky. Studying the UGRB is crucial for understanding high-energy astrophysical processes in the universe and for probing fundamental physics, such as the nature of dark matter. In this work, we forecast the cross-correlation between the UGRB and galaxy catalogs from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey. First, we study the expected astrophysical contributions to the UGRB and their cross-correlation with DESI spectroscopic galaxies. Our calculations show that the cross-correlation signal-to-noise ratio is expected to be significant, with the highest value predicted to be 20.6 for DESI luminous red galaxies due to a higher predicted overlap in the redshift distribution with the UGRB. We consider two science cases that the UGRB-spectroscopic galaxies cross-correlation can be applied to: 1) measuring the UGRB flux as a function of redshift, achieving a precision of 10\% in some redshift bins, and 2) searching for annihilating dark matter potentially up to a mass of about 300~GeV, three times higher than the currently strongest constraints. This work underscores the importance of cross correlating the UGRB with cosmic large-scale structure tracers and highlights the multiwavelength approaches to advancing our understanding of high-energy astrophysical phenomena and fundamental physics.</description>

      <title>Vector interaction bounds in NJL-like models from LQCD estimated curvature of the chiral crossover line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain improved bounds on both the flavor-independent and -dependent vector interactions in a $2+1$-flavor Nambu\textendash Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model using the latest precise LQCD results of the curvature coefficients of the chiral crossover line. We find that these lattice estimated curvature coefficients allow for both attractive and repulsive types of interactions in both the cases. With this constrained ranges of vector interactions, we further predict the behavior of the second $(\kappa_2^B)$ and fourth $(\kappa_4^B)$ order curvature coefficients as a function of the strangeness chemical potential $(\mu_S)$. We observe that the flavor mixing effects, arising from the flavor-independent vector interaction as well as from the 't Hooft interaction, play an important role in $k_2^B$. We propose that the mixing effects due to the vector interaction can be separated from those arising from the 't Hooft interaction by analyzing the behavior of $k_2^B$ as a function of $\mu_S$. Finally, we locate the critical endpoint in the $T-\mu_B$ plane using the model-estimated ranges of vector interactions and find the model's predictions to be consistent with the latest LQCD bounds.</description>

      <title>Production and study of antideuterium with the GBAR beamline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The potential of circulating antideuterons ($\mathrm{\overline{d}}$) in the AD/ELENA facility at CERN is currently under investigation. Approximately 100 $\mathrm{\overline{d}}$ per bunch could be delivered as a $100\,\mathrm{keV}$ beam based on measured cross-sections. These $\mathrm{\overline{d}}$ could be further decelerated to $12\,\mathrm{keV}$ using the GBAR scheme, enabling the synthesis of antideuterium ($\mathrm{\overline{D}}$) via charge exchange with positronium, a technique demonstrated with $6\,\mathrm{keV}$ antiprotons for antihydrogen production. While this would demonstrate the production of low-energy $\mathrm{\overline{D}}$, higher fluxes are required to facilitate spectroscopic studies. We propose enhancing the anti-atom production by using laser-excited positronium in the $2P$ state within a cavity, which is expected to increase the $\mathrm{\overline{D}}(2S)$ production cross-section by almost an order of magnitude for $\mathrm{\overline{d}}$ with $2\,\mathrm{keV}$ energy. The ELENA team is currently studying the possibility of increasing the $\mathrm{\overline{d}}$ rate using an optimized new target geometry. We present the projected precision for measuring the antideuterium Lamb shift and extracting the antideuteron charge radius, as a function of the beam flux.</description>

Abstract: LHCb data on $B^0\to\jpsi \pi^+\pi^-$, $B_{s} ^0\to\jpsi \pi^+\pi^-$ and $B_{s} ^0\to\jpsi K^+K^-$ are fitted in a coupled-channel analysis jointly with data on radiative $\jpsi$ decays, $\pi\pi$ elastic scattering and further data sets. Branching ratios for $B_{(s)} ^0\to\jpsi f_0,f_2$ are determined and compared to branching ratios from radiative $J/\psi$ decays. Above 1500\,MeV, only little intensity is observed in $B_{(s)} ^0\to\jpsi f_0,f_2$ decays while in radiative $\jpsi$ decays the intensities peak at 1865\,MeV in the scalar, and at 2210\,MeV in the tensor wave. This pattern is interpreted as further support for the glueball interpretation of $G_0(1865)$ and $G_2(2210)$.</description>

      <title>Soft-photon theorem for pion-proton elastic scattering revisited</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.12673v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the reactions $\pi p \to \pi p$ and $\pi p \to \pi p \gamma$ from a general quantum field theory (QFT) point of view, describing these reactions in QCD and lowest relevant order of electromagnetism. We consider the pion-proton elastic scattering both off shell and on shell. The on-shell amplitudes for $\pi^{\pm} p \to \pi^{\pm} p$ scattering are described by two invariant amplitudes, while the off-shell amplitudes contain eight invariant amplitudes. We study the photon emission amplitudes in the soft-photon limit where the c.m. photon energy $\omega \to 0$. The Laurent expansion in $\omega$ of the $\pi^{\pm} p \to \pi^{\pm} p \gamma$ amplitudes is considered and the terms of the orders $\omega^{-1}$ and $\omega^{0}$ are derived. These terms can be expressed by the on-shell invariant amplitudes and their partial derivatives with respect to $s$ and~$t$. The pole term $\propto \omega^{-1}$ in the amplitudes corresponds to Weinberg's soft-photon theorem and is well known from the literature. We derive the next-to-leading term $\propto \omega^{0}$ using only rigorous methods of QFT. We give the relation of the Laurent series for $\pi^{0} p \to \pi^{0} p \gamma$ and Low's soft-photon theorem. Our formulas for the amplitudes in the limit $\omega \to 0$ are valid for photon momentum $k$ satisfying $k^{2} \geqslant 0$, $k^{0} = \omega \geqslant 0$, that is, for both real and virtual photons. Here we consider a limit where with $\omega \to 0$ we have also $k^{2} \to 0$. We discuss the behavior of the corresponding cross-sections for $\pi^{-} p \to \pi^{-} p \gamma$ with respect to $\omega$ for $\omega \to 0$. We consider cross sections for unpolarized as well as polarized protons in the initial and final states.</description>

Abstract: We consider the effects of a local axion dark matter background on the $g-2$ of the electron. We calculate loop corrections to the photon-electron vertex and determine analytical formulas for the spin and cyclotron frequencies when the electron is in an external magnetic field. By comparing with current measurements of these observables, we are able to place the strongest constraint on the axion-elecron coupling for axion masses below $3\times10^{-18}\text{eV}$.</description>

      <title>A Dark Sink Enhances the Direct Detection of Freeze-in Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14152v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe a simple dark sector structure which, if present, has implications for the direct detection of dark matter (DM): the Dark Sink. A Dark Sink transports energy density from the DM into light dark-sector states that do not appreciably contribute to the DM density. As an example, we consider a light, neutral fermion $\psi$ which interacts solely with DM $\chi$ via the exchange of a heavy scalar $\Phi$. We illustrate the impact of a Dark Sink by adding one to a DM freeze-in model in which $\chi$ couples to a light dark photon $\gamma '$ which kinetically mixes with the Standard Model (SM) photon. This freeze-in model (absent the sink) is itself a benchmark for ongoing experiments. In some cases, the literature for this benchmark has contained errors; we correct the predictions and provide them as a public code. We then analyze how the Dark Sink modifies this benchmark, solving coupled Boltzmann equations for the dark-sector energy density and DM yield. We check the contribution of the Dark Sink $\psi$'s to dark radiation; consistency with existing data limits the maximum attainable cross section. For DM with a mass between $\text{MeV} -\mathcal{O}(10\text{ GeV})$, adding the Dark Sink can increase predictions for the direct detection cross section all the way up to the current limits.</description>

      <title>Probing Light Inelastic Dark Matter from Direct Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03128v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For dark matter (DM) direct detections, the kinematic effects such as those of the inelastic scattering can play important role in light DM searches. The light DM detection is generally difficult because of its small recoil energy. But the recoil energy of the exothermic inelastic DM scattering could exceed the detection threshold due to the contribution from the DM mass-splitting, making the direct detection of sub-GeV DM feasible. In this work, we systematically study signatures of the light exothermic inelastic DM from the recoil spectra including both the DM-electron scattering and Migdal effect. Such inelastic DM has mass around (sub-)GeV scale with DM mass-splitting of $O(1-10^2)$keV. We analyze the direct detection sensitivities to such light inelastic DM. For different inelastic DM masses and mass-splittings, we find that the DM-electron recoil and Migdal effect can contribute significantly and differently to the direct detection signatures. The DM-lepton and/or DM-quark interactions may vary for different DM models, and their interplay leads to a diversity in the recoil spectra. Hence, it is important to perform a combined analysis to include both the DM-electron recoil and Migdal effect. We further demonstrate that this analysis has strong impacts on the cosmological and laboratory bounds for the inelastic DM.</description>

Abstract: Light mesons have always been an important part of the whole hadron family, once inspiring the SU(3) classification of hadrons as a typical example~\cite{Gell-Mann:1964ewy}. Until now, the search for light mesons has been an ongoing task in hadron physics. In particular, with the accumulation of experimental data, more and more light flavor mesons with the masses around 2.2 GeV were found, including the $Y(2175)$ observed in $J/\psi\to \eta \phi f_0(980)$~\cite{BES:2007sqy} and the $X(2370)$ reported in the decay of $J/\psi\to \gamma \eta^\prime \pi^+\pi^-$~\cite{BESIII:2010gmv,BESIII:2019wkp}. These progresses show that there is a chance to construct the light meson family, which is also an effective approach to deepen our understanding of non-perturbative behavior of the strong interaction.</description>

Abstract: In present work, we perform a coupled-channel analysis of $B^{(*)}_{(s)}\bar{B}^{(*)}_{(s)}$ systems with the one-boson-exchange potentials. We first study the $I(J^{PC})=1(1^{+-})$ $B\bar{B}^{*}/B^{*}\bar{B}^{*}$ system to describe the $Z_{b}(10610)$ and $Z_{b}(10650)$ particles as molecular states and determine the reasonable range of cutoff parameter $\Lambda$. Then, other $B^{(*)}_{(s)}\bar{B}^{(*)}_{(s)}$ combinations with different quantum numbers are systematically investigated. Some bound states and resonances appear in the isoscalar systems, while only several shallow bound states exist for isovector systems. Far away from the excited conventional $P-$wave bottomium, these predicted states can be easily identified as exotic particles both theoretically and experimentally. Moreover, the $\eta_b(nS)/\Upsilon(nS)$ plus light mesons are the excellent final states to search for the bound states, while the $B\bar B^*+h.c.$ and $B^* \bar B^*$ channels are suitable for the resonances. We highly recommend that the LHCb and Belle II Collaborations can hunt for these bottomonium-like states in future.</description>

      <title>Analytical insights into the interplay of momentum, multiplicity and the speed of sound in heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10401v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a minimal model of ultracentral heavy-ion collisions to study the relation between the speed of sound of the produced plasma and the final particles' energy and multiplicity. We discuss how the particles' multiplicity $N_{\textrm{tot}}$ and average energy $E_{\textrm{tot}}/N_{\textrm{tot}}$ is related to the speed of sound $c_s$ by $c_s^2=d \ln (E_{\textrm{tot}}/N_{\textrm{tot}})/d\ln N_{\textrm{tot}}$ if the fluid is inviscid, its speed of sound is constant and all final particles can be measured. We show that finite rapidity cuts on the particles' multiplicity $N$ and energy $E$ introduce corrections between $c_s^2$ and $d \ln (E/N)/d\ln N$ that depend on the system's lifetime. We study analytically these deviations with the Gubser hydrodynamic solution, finding that, for ultrarelativistic bosons, they scale as the ratio of the freezeout temperature $T_{\mathrm{FO}}$ over the maximum initial temperature of the fluid $T_{0}$; the non-thermodynamic aspect of these corrections is highlighted through their dependence on the system's initial conditions.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking the Non-flow Contributions to the Elliptic Flow Parameter ($v_{_2}$) in Proton-Proton Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13981v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This manuscript reports on the elliptic flow parameter, $v_{_2}$, in proton-proton (p-p) collisions using PYTHIA8 event generator simulations. The typical Event Plane ($EP$) method $v_{_2}$($EP$) as the one used for the real data analysis has been adopted to measure the $v_{_2}$ of particles composed of different quark flavors, and produced at mid-pseudorapidity $|\eta| \le 1$ at center-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s}$ = 200 GeV and $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV. The event plane has been constructed using the soft charged particles with transverse momentum ($p{_{_T}} &lt; $ 2 GeV/c) produced in various $\eta$ ranges. The pseudorapidity gap technique ($\Delta\eta$) between the particle of interest and the soft charged particles contributed to the event plane constructions has been utilized to benchmark the non-flow contributions. The $v_{_2}^{\pi^{^\pm,}\pi^{^0}}$, $v_{_2}^{J/\psi,\Upsilon, K, D, B}$, and the $v_{_2}^{\gamma_{dir}}$ show similar pattern dependence on the transverse momentum for the same $\Delta\eta$, at both $\sqrt{s}$ = 200 GeV and $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV. At each center-of-mass energy, the measured $v_{_2}$ shows obvious dependence on the quark flavor contents where $v_{_2}^{\gamma_{dir}}$ $\le$ $v_{_2}^{J/\psi, \Upsilon, K, D, B}$ $\le$ $v_{_2}^{\pi^{^\pm,}\pi^{^0}}$ for similar $\Delta\eta$ gap. The measured $v_{_2}$ shows slightly higher values at smaller $\sqrt{s}$ for particles of similar values of $\Delta\eta$ gaps, particularly at small $\Delta\eta$ gap. The measured $v_{_2}$ for all particles shows systematic decreases with increasing the $\Delta\eta$ gap as expected from the previous experimental results. Because PYTHIA8 simulations do not incorporate final state interactions, the $v_{_2}(EP)$ values reported here primarily reflect the non-flow contributions and its dependence on the quark contents, pseudorapidity gap as a function on $p_{T}$ at each center of mass-energy.</description>

      <title>Magnetic field effect on hadron yield ratios and fluctuations in a hadron resonance gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16306v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work studies the influence of an external magnetic field on hadron yields and fluctuations in a hadron resonance gas by performing calculations within an updated version of the open-source Thermal-FIST package. The presence of the magnetic field has a sizable influence on certain hadron yield ratios. Most notably, it leads to enhanced $p/\pi$ and suppressed $n/p$ ratios, which may serve as a magnetometer in heavy-ion collisions. By attributing the centrality dependence of the $p/\pi$ ratio in Pb-Pb collisions at 5.02~TeV measured by the ALICE Collaboration entirely to the magnetic field, its maximal strength at freeze-out is estimated to be $eB \simeq 0.12$~GeV$^2 \simeq 6.3 m_\pi^2$ in peripheral collisions. The magnetic field also enhances various conserved charge susceptibilities, which is qualitatively consistent with recent lattice QCD data and is driven in the HRG model by the increase of hadron densities. However, the variances of hadrons do not show any enhancement when normalized by the means, therefore, measurements of second-order fluctuations in heavy-ion collisions appear to offer limited additional information about the magnetic field relative to mean multiplicities.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal chiral contributions to generalized parton distributions of the proton at nonzero skewness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03412v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the one-loop contributions to spin-averaged generalized parton distributions (GPDs) in the proton from pseudoscalar mesons with intermediate octet and decuplet baryon states at nonzero skewness. Our framework is based on nonlocal covariant chiral effective theory, with ultraviolet divergences regularized by introducing a relativistic regulator derived consistently from the nonlocal Lagrangian. Using the splitting functions calculated from the nonlocal Lagrangian, we find the nonzero skewness GPDs from meson loops by convoluting with the phenomenological pion GPD and the generalized distribution amplitude, and verify that these satisfy the correct polynomiality properties. We also compute the lowest two moments of GPDs to quantify the meson loop effects on the Dirac, Pauli and gravitational form factors of the proton.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14673v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Heavy meson decays with missing energy in the final state offer interesting avenues to search for light invisible new physics such as dark matter (DM). In this context, we show that such new physics (NP) interactions also affect lifetime difference in neutral meson-antimeson mixing. We consider general dimension-six effective quark interactions involving a pair of DM particles and calculate their contributions to lifetime difference in beauty and charm meson systems. We use the latest data on mixing observables to constrain the relevant effective operators. We find that lifetime differences provide novel and complementary flavor constraints compared to those obtained from heavy meson decays.</description>

      <title>A complete study of RGE induced leptogenesis in flavor symmetry scenarios</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18285v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the literature, motivated by the observed peculiar neutrino mixing pattern and a preliminary experimental hint for maximal Dirac CP phase (i.e., $\delta \sim 3\pi/2$), a lot of flavor and CP symmetries have been proposed to help us understand and explain these experimental results. However, for some flavor-symmetry scenarios (see section~3.1), the leptogenesis mechanism is prohibited to work as usual. To tackle this problem, in this paper we have made an exhausitive study on the possibility that the renormalization group evolution effect may induce a successful leptogenesis for these particular scenarios. Our study provides some complementarities to the previous related studies in Refs. [26, 27, 28] (see section~3.2).</description>

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated that the tau produced in charged current neutrino deeply inelastic interactions at the GeV -- TeV neutrino energy range is not fully polarized. In this paper we investigate the impact of the tau polarization on the pions generated in its decay. In particular, we consider tau neutrino - tungsten interactions at the LHC energies and estimate the associated pion momentum, energy and angular distributions. The contribution of the $F_5$ is also investigated. Our results indicate that the pion properties are sensitive to the tau polarization state as well as to the magnitude of $F_5$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11904v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that placing a radioactive source such as ${}^{51}$Cr near a liquid xenon detector may allow to detect the contribution induced by the anapole moment to neutrino-electron scattering in the Standard Model. Although the anapole moment of neutrinos induces a scattering rate with the same spectral shape as the neutral and charged current contributions, exposures of $\sim$ 10 tonne $\times$ year at XENONnT or XLZD may be enough to accumulate sufficient statistics. We also discuss a simple model where the anapole moment of neutrinos is shifted with respect to the SM expectation, further demonstrating how a potential measurement of the anapole moment of neutrinos would allow to constrain new physics.</description>

      <title>Is Tokenization Needed for Masked Particle Modelling?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12589v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we significantly enhance masked particle modeling (MPM), a self-supervised learning scheme for constructing highly expressive representations of unordered sets relevant to developing foundation models for high-energy physics. In MPM, a model is trained to recover the missing elements of a set, a learning objective that requires no labels and can be applied directly to experimental data. We achieve significant performance improvements over previous work on MPM by addressing inefficiencies in the implementation and incorporating a more powerful decoder. We compare several pre-training tasks and introduce new reconstruction methods that utilize conditional generative models without data tokenization or discretization. We show that these new methods outperform the tokenized learning objective from the original MPM on a new test bed for foundation models for jets, which includes using a wide variety of downstream tasks relevant to jet physics, such as classification, secondary vertex finding, and track identification.</description>

      <title>$4b + X$ via electroweak multi-Higgs production as smoking gun signals for Type-I 2HDM at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19643v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extending the Standard Model (SM) by one additional Higgs doublet leads to the Two-Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM). A specific charge assignment of the SM fermions under the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry leads to the Type-I 2HDM. A key feature of the Type-I 2HDM is that all the additional Higgs bosons can be fermiophobic, when their couplings to the SM fermions are suppressed. As a result, all the new Higgs states can be fairly light, $\sim$100 GeV or less, without being in conflict with the current data from the direct Higgs boson searches and the $B$-physics measurements. In a recent study Ref.~\cite{Mondal:2023wib}, which this proceeding is based on, we established that the new neutral as well as the charged Higgs bosons in this model can all be simultaneously observable in the multi-$b$ final state. An experimental validation of our results would be a clear indication that the true underlying Higgs sector in nature is the Type-I 2HDM.</description>

      <title>A variational study of two-nucleon systems with lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.10835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.10835v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The low-energy spectrum and scattering of two-nucleon systems are studied with lattice quantum chromodynamics using a variational approach. A wide range of interpolating operators are used: dibaryon operators built from products of plane-wave nucleons, hexaquark operators built from six localized quarks, and quasi-local operators inspired by two-nucleon bound-state wavefunctions in low-energy effective theories. Sparsening techniques are used to compute the timeslice-to-all quark propagators required to form correlation-function matrices using products of these operators. Projection of these matrices onto irreducible representations of the cubic group, including spin-orbit coupling, is detailed. Variational methods are applied to constrain the low-energy spectra of two-nucleon systems in a single finite volume with quark masses corresponding to a pion mass of 806 MeV. Results for S- and D-wave phase shifts in the isospin singlet and triplet channels are obtained under the assumption that partial-wave mixing is negligible. Tests of interpolating-operator dependence are used to investigate the reliability of the energy spectra obtained and highlight both the strengths and weaknesses of variational methods. These studies and comparisons to previous studies using the same gauge-field ensemble demonstrate that interpolating-operator dependence can lead to significant effects on the two-nucleon energy spectra obtained using both variational and non-variational methods, including missing energy levels and other discrepancies. While this study is inconclusive regarding the presence of two-nucleon bound states at this quark mass, it provides robust upper bounds on two-nucleon energy levels that can be improved in future calculations using additional interpolating operators and is therefore a step toward reliable nuclear spectroscopy from the underlying Standard Model of particle physics.</description>

Abstract: The first Edition of this book was released in 2000, just before the symposium ``Thirty Years of Supersymmetry'' was held at the William I. Fine Theoretical Physics Institute (FTPI) of the University of Minnesota. Founders and trailblazers of supersymmetry descended on FTPI, as well as a large crowd of younger theorists deeply involved in research in this area. Since then 23 years have elapsed and significant changes happened in supersymmetry (SUSY). Its history definitely needs an update. Such an update is presented below. The Second Edition of the revised collection will be released in 2024.</description>

Abstract: The low-energy finite-volume spectrum of the two-nucleon system at a quark mass corresponding to a pion mass of $m_\pi \approx 806$ MeV is studied with lattice quantum chromodynamics (LQCD) using variational methods. The interpolating-operator sets used in [Phys.Rev.D 107 (2023) 9, 094508] are extended by including a complete basis of local hexaquark operators, as well as plane-wave dibaryon operators built from products of both positive- and negative-parity nucleon operators. Results are presented for the isosinglet and isotriplet two-nucleon channels. In both channels, noticably weaker variational bounds on the lowest few energy eigenvalues are obtained from operator sets which contain only hexaquark operators or operators constructed from the product of two negative-parity nucleons, while other operator sets produce low-energy variational bounds which are consistent within statistical uncertainties. The consequences of these studies for the LQCD understanding of the two-nucleon spectrum are investigated.</description>

      <title>A study of nuclear structure of light nuclei at the Electron-Ion Collider</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07844v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the substructure of atomic nuclei, particularly the clustering of nucleons inside them, is essential for comprehending nuclear dynamics. Various cluster configurations can emerge depending on excitation energy, the number and types of core clusters, and the presence of excess neutrons. Despite the prevalence of tightly bound cluster formations in low-lying states, understanding the correlation between clusters and their formation mechanisms remains incomplete. This exploring study investigates nuclear clustering at the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) using simulations based on the modified BeAGLE model. By simulating collisions involving $e$+$^{9}$Be, $e$+$^{12}$C, and $e$+$^{16}$O nuclei, we find that the average energy of particles $\langle E \rangle$ and the system size ratios of particles at forward rapidity exhibit sensitivity to alpha clustering and its various configurations. These findings offer valuable insights into the dynamics of nuclear clustering and its implications for future studies at the EIC.</description>

      <title>Cosmology with varying fundamental constants from hyperlight, coupled scalars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10358v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The fundamental constants at recombination can differ from their present-day values due to degeneracies in cosmological parameters, raising the possibility of yet-undiscovered physics coupled directly to the Standard Model. We study the cosmology of theories in which a new, hyperlight scalar field modulates the electron mass and fine-structure constant at early times. We find new degeneracies in cosmologies that pair early recombination with a new contribution to the matter density arising at late times, whose predictions can be simultaneously consistent with CMB and low-redshift distance measurements. Such "late dark matter" already exists in the Standard Model in the form of massive neutrinos but is necessarily realized by the scalar responsible for shifting the early-time fundamental constants. After detailing the physical effects of varying constants and hyperlight scalar fields on cosmology, we show that variations of the electron mass and fine structure constant are constrained at the percent and permille level, respectively, and a hyperlight scalar in the mass range $10^{-32}~\mathrm{eV} \lesssim m_\phi \lesssim 10^{-28}~\mathrm{eV}$ can impact what variations are allowed while composing up to a percent of the present dark matter density. We comment on the potential for models with a varying electron mass to reconcile determinations of the Hubble constant from cosmological observations and distance-ladder methods, and we show that parameter inference varies significantly between recent baryon acoustic oscillation and type Ia supernova datasets.</description>

      <title>First detection of X-ray pulsations and spectrum of the high Galactic latitude pulsar PSR J0837-2454 and direct Urca cooling implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14952v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: PSR J0837-2454 is a young 629 ms radio pulsar whose uncertain distance has important implications. A large distance would place the pulsar far out of the Galactic plane and suggest it is the result of a runaway star, while a short distance would mean the pulsar is extraordinarily cold. Here we present further radio observations and the first deep X-ray observation of PSR J0837-2454. Data from the Parkes Murriyang telescope show flux variations over short and long timescales and also yield an updated timing model, while the position and proper motion (and, less strongly, parallax) of the pulsar are constrained by a number of low-significance detections with the Very Long Baseline Array. XMM-Newton data enable detection of X-ray pulsations for the first time from this pulsar and yield a spectrum that is thermal and blackbody-like, with a cool blackbody temperature ~70 eV or atmosphere temperature ~50 eV, as well as a small hotspot. The spectrum also indicates the pulsar is at a small distance of &lt;~1 kpc, which is compatible with the marginal VLBA parallax constraint that favours a distance of &gt;~330 pc. The low implied luminosity (~7.6x10^31 erg s^-1 at 0.9 kpc) suggests PSR J0837-2454 has a mass high enough that fast neutrino emission from direct Urca reactions operates in this young star and points to a nuclear equation of state that allows for direct Urca reactions at the highest densities present in neutron star cores.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Dark Energy from Lattice Quantum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08963v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the behavior of the vacuum in Euclidean dynamical triangulations (EDT). Algorithmic improvements and better lattice spacing determinations allow us to test the properties of the emergent de Sitter geometries of our simulations to higher precision than previously possible. Although the agreement with de Sitter is good, the improved precision reveals deviations that can be interpreted as non-trivial vacuum dynamics, well-described by a cosmological constant that runs with scale. The simulations show that the dominant running is quadratic and that the scale can be identified with the Hubble rate. Several key cross-checks support this picture, including consistent results across multiple lattice spacings and the fact that the null energy condition is not violated. The parameters of the running are fully determined by simulations, enabling predictions when extrapolated to the scales relevant for our universe. This leads to a model for dark energy that is compatible with current observations, but which predicts deviations from $\Lambda$CDM at the ${\cal O}(10^{-3})$ level in cosmological observables that could be tested with future improvements in precision measurements.</description>

      <title>The Search for the Cosmological Axion -- A New Refined Narrow Mass Window and Detection Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09553v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Based upon a previous axion mass proposal and detection scheme, as well as considering the axion mass ranges suggested by persuasive simulations in recent years, we present a revised axion/ALP search strategy and our calculations, concentrating on a slightly narrower axion mass (and corresponding Compton frequency) window in this report. The sole aim of this study was to provide a pin-point mass value for a resonant cavity detection scheme, and the outcome of calculations presented here reinforces the earlier mass window and the results (slightly different values from our calculations but within the same window) obtained by the calculations and simulations by Kawasaki et al. (2015) and Buschmann et al. (2020). The window comprises the spectral region of 18.99 to 19.01GHz (that falls within the Ku microwave band), with a center frequency of 19.00GHz (+0.1GHz), with equivalence to an axion mass range of 78.6 to 79.6 micro-eV, with the center mass at the value of 78.582 (+5.0) micro-eV, our suggested most likely value for an axionic/ALP field mass, if these fields exist. Our search strategy, as summarized herewith, is based upon the assumption that the dark matter that exists in the current epoch of our physical universe is dominated by axions and thus the local observable axion density is the density of the light cold dark matter, permeating our local neighborhood (mainly in the Milky Way galactic halo). Some ideas and the design of an experiment, based upon the inverse Primakoff effect, and built around a Josephson Parametric Amplifier and Resonant Tunneling Diode combination installed in a resonant RF cavity, are also some possibly novel ideas, as introduced in this report.</description>

      <title>Search for the Hawking radiation of primordial black holes: prospective sensitivity of LHAASO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10897v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs), more generally, BHs, undergo evaporation and, in principle, will end their lives in bursts of very high-energy gamma rays. The notable aspect of the PBHs with an initial mass of $\sim10^{14}$ g is that they are expected to end their lives today. In this work, we assess the potential sensitivity of the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) in detecting the local burst rate density of PBHs. Our results suggest that LHAASO is capable of probing for PBH bursts within a proximity of $\sim0.1$ pc from the Sun, measuring a local burst rate density of $\sim$ 1200 (or 700)$\,\mathrm{pc}^{-3}\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ with $99\%$ confidence during a 3-year (or 5-year) observational campaign. This level of sensitivity surpasses the most rigorous observational constraint provided by the High Altitude Water Cherenkov Observatory (HAWC) by an order of magnitude. Additionally, we propose data analysis strategies for LHAASO to optimize the search for PBHs and reach its potential detection limits.</description>

      <title>Memory burden effect mimics reheating signatures on SGWB from ultra-low mass PBH domination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04436v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultra-low mass primordial black holes (PBH), briefly dominating the expansion of the universe, would leave detectable imprints in the secondary stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB). Such a scenario leads to a characteristic doubly peaked spectrum of SGWB and strongly depends on the Hawking evaporation of such light PBHs. However, these observable signatures are significantly altered if the memory burden effect during the evaporation of PBHs is taken into account. We show that for the SGWB induced by PBH density fluctuations, the memory burden effects on the Hawking evaporation of ultra-low mass PBHs can mimic the signal arising due to the non-standard reheating epoch before PBH domination. Finally, we point out that this degeneracy can be broken by the simultaneous detection of the first peak in the SGWB, which is typically induced by the inflationary adiabatic perturbations.</description>

      <title>Constraining burdened PBHs with gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05953v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the implications of memory burden on the gravitational wave (GW) spectrum arising from the Hawking evaporation of light primordial black holes (PBHs). By considering both rotating (Kerr) and non-rotating (Schwarzschild) PBHs, we demonstrate that the overproduction of primordial GWs from burdened PBHs could impose stringent constraints on the parameters governing backreaction effects. These constraints, derived from $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ measurements by Planck and prospective experiments such as CMB-S4 and CMB-HD, offer novel insights into the impact of memory burden on PBH dynamics.</description>
