      <title>Adaptive Behavioral AI: Reinforcement Learning to Enhance Pharmacy Services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pharmacies are critical in healthcare systems, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Procuring pharmacists with the right behavioral interventions or nudges can enhance their skills, public health awareness, and pharmacy inventory management, ensuring access to essential medicines that ultimately benefit their patients. We introduce a reinforcement learning operational system to deliver personalized behavioral interventions through mobile health applications. We illustrate its potential by discussing a series of initial experiments run with SwipeRx, an all-in-one app for pharmacists, including B2B e-commerce, in Indonesia. The proposed method has broader applications extending beyond pharmacy operations to optimize healthcare delivery.</description>

      <title>Information Theory for Complex Systems Scientists</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.12482v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the 21st century, many of the crucial scientific and technical issues facing humanity can be understood as problems associated with understanding, modelling, and ultimately controlling complex systems: systems comprised of a large number of non-trivially interacting components whose collective behaviour can be difficult to predict. Information theory, a branch of mathematics historically associated with questions about encoding and decoding messages, has emerged as something of a lingua franca for those studying complex systems, far exceeding its original narrow domain of communication systems engineering. In the context of complexity science, information theory provides a set of tools which allow researchers to uncover the statistical and effective dependencies between interacting components; relationships between systems and their environment; mereological whole-part relationships; and is sensitive to non-linearities missed by commonly parametric statistical models.
  In this review, we aim to provide an accessible introduction to the core of modern information theory, aimed specifically at aspiring (and established) complex systems scientists. This includes standard measures, such as Shannon entropy, relative entropy, and mutual information, before building to more advanced topics, including: information dynamics, measures of statistical complexity, information decomposition, and effective network inference. In addition to detailing the formal definitions, in this review we make an effort to discuss how information theory can be interpreted and develop the intuition behind abstract concepts like "entropy," in the hope that this will enable interested readers to understand what information is, and how it is used, at a more fundamental level.</description>

      <title>Global Optimisation of Black-Box Functions with Generative Models in the Wasserstein Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11917v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new uncertainty estimator for gradient-free optimisation of black-box simulators using deep generative surrogate models. Optimisation of these simulators is especially challenging for stochastic simulators and higher dimensions. To address these issues, we utilise a deep generative surrogate approach to model the black box response for the entire parameter space. We then leverage this knowledge to estimate the proposed uncertainty based on the Wasserstein distance - the Wasserstein uncertainty. This approach is employed in a posterior agnostic gradient-free optimisation algorithm that minimises regret over the entire parameter space. A series of tests were conducted to demonstrate that our method is more robust to the shape of both the black box function and the stochastic response of the black box than state-of-the-art methods, such as efficient global optimisation with a deep Gaussian process surrogate.</description>
