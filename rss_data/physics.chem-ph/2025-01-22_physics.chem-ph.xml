      <title>Improving Aufbau Suppressed Coupled Cluster Through Perturbative Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Guided by perturbative analysis, we improve the accuracy of Aufbau suppressed coupled cluster theory in simple single excitations, multi-configurational single excitations, and charge transfer excitations while keeping the cost of its leading-order terms precisely in line with ground state coupled cluster. Combining these accuracy improvements with a more efficient implementation based on spin-adaptation, we observe high accuracy in a large test set of single excitations, and, in particular, a mean unsigned error for charge transfer states that outperforms equation-of-motion coupled cluster theory by 0.25 eV. We discuss how these results are achieved via a systematic identification of which amplitudes to prioritize for single- and multi-configurational excited states, and how this prioritization differs in important ways from the ground state theory. In particular, our data show that a partial linearization of the theory increases accuracy by mitigating unwanted side effects of Aufbau suppression.</description>

      <title>Ionic Associations and Hydration in the Electrical Double Layer of Water-in-Salt Electrolytes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Water-in-Salt-Electrolytes (WiSEs) are an exciting class of concentrated electrolytes finding applications in energy storage devices because of their expanded electrochemical stability window, good conductivity and cation transference number, and fire-extinguishing properties. These distinct properties are thought to originate from the presence of an anion-dominated ionic network and interpenetrating water channels for cation transport, which indicates that associations in WiSEs are crucial to understanding their properties. Currently, associations have mainly been investigated in the bulk, while little attention has been given to the electrolyte structure near electrified interfaces. Here, we develop a theory for the electrical double layer (EDL) of WiSEs, where we consistently account for the thermoreversible associations of species into Cayley tree aggregates. The theory predicts an asymmetric structure of the EDL. At negative voltages, hydrated Li$^+$ dominate and cluster aggregation is initially slightly enhanced before disintegration at larger voltages. At positive voltages when compared to the bulk, clusters are strictly diminished. Performing atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the EDL of WiSE provides EDL data for validation and bulk data for parameterization of our theory. Validating the predictions of our theory against MD showed good qualitative agreement. Furthermore, we performed electrochemical impendence measurements to determine the differential capacitance of the studied LiTFSI WiSE and also found reasonable agreement with our theory. Overall, the developed approach can be used to investigate ionic aggregation and solvation effects in the EDL, which amongst other properties, can be used to understand the pre-cursers for solid-electrolyte interphase formation.</description>

      <title>Direct unconstrained optimization of excited states in density functional theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orbital-optimized density functional theory (DFT) has emerged as an alternative to time-dependent (TD) DFT capable of describing difficult excited states with significant electron density redistribution, such as charge-transfer, Rydberg, and double-electron excitations. Here, a simple method is developed to solve the main problem of the excited-state optimization -- the variational collapse of the excited states onto the ground state. In this method, called variable-metric time-independent DFT (VM TIDFT), the electronic states are allowed to be nonorthogonal during the optimization but their orthogonality is gradually enforced with a continuous penalty function. With nonorthogonal electronic states, VM TIDFT can use molecular orbital coefficients as independent variables, which results in a closed-form analytical expression for the gradient and allows to employ any of the multiple unconstrained optimization algorithms that guarantees convergence of the excited-state optimization. Numerical tests on multiple molecular systems show that the variable-metric optimization of excited states performed with a preconditioned conjugate gradient algorithm is robust and produces accurate energies for well-behaved excitations and, unlike TDDFT, for more challenging charge-transfer and double-electron excitations.</description>

      <title>Partial separability of the Schroedinger equation combined with a Jastrow factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Describing the Coulomb interactions between electrons in atomic or molecular systems is an important step to help us obtain accurate results for the different observables in the system. One convenient approach is to separate the dynamic electronic correlation, i.e., Coulomb electron-electron repulsion, from the motion of the electrons in the nuclei electric field. The wave function is written as the product of two terms, one accounting for the electron-electron interactions, which is symmetric under identical particle exchange; the other is antisymmetric and represents the dynamics and exchange of electrons within the nuclear electric field. In this work, we present a novel computational scheme based on this idea that leads to an expression of the energy as the sum of two terms. To illustrate the method, we look into few-body Coulombic systems, H2, H3+ and Li(1s2,2s), and discuss the possible extension to larger systems. A simple correlation factor, based on the Jastrow exponential term, is employed to represent the dynamics of the electron pairs leading to simple analytical forms and accurate results. We also present and illustrate a different approach with the Li atom based on the partial separability applied to a portion of the atom.</description>

      <title>Dependence of energy relaxation and vibrational coherence on the location of light-harvesting chromoproteins in photosynthetic antenna protein complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phycobilisomes are antenna protein complexes in cyanobacteria and red algae. In phycobilisomes, energy transfer is unidirectional with an extremely high quantum efficiency close to unity. We investigate intraprotein energy relaxation and quantum coherence of constituent chromoproteins of allophycocyanin (APC) and two kinds of C-phycocyanin (CPC) in phycobilisomes using two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2D-ES). These chromoproteins have similar adjacent pairs of pigments $\alpha$84 and $\beta$84, which are excited to delocalized exciton states. However, the kinetics and coherence of exciton states are significantly different from each other. Even CPCs with almost the same molecular structure display significantly different spectra and kinetics when the locations in the phycobilisome are different. This difference may be one of the key mechanisms for the efficient and unidirectional energy transfer in phycobilisomes. We observe low-frequency coherent vibrational motion of approximately 200 cm$^{-1}$ with large amplitude and a decay time of 200 fs. The wave packet motion involving energy relaxation and oscillatory motions on the potential energy surface of the exciton state is clearly visualized using beat-frequency-resolved 2D-ES.</description>

      <title>Ion Trap Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work aims to find ion trap geometry for a high-quality ion trap mass analyzer that minimizes mass shift and is easy to fabricate. The theoretical procedure of the ion trap mass shift evaluation is developed, which provides a quantitative criterion of the mass shift (ion ejection delay in comparison with ideal ion trap) for the correct comparison of the different ion trap geometries. This procedure is validated by comparison with known experimental facts about existing mass analyzers: 3D hyperbolic ion trap (Finnigan), 2D hyperbolic ion trap (Thermo), Rectilinear Ion Trap (Purdue), and quadrupole mass filter. The developed theoretical procedure optimizes known ion trap geometries for low mass shift. Applying this procedure to various ion trap geometries reveals that in terms of the mass shift existing ion traps are close to the optimum in a framework of chosen geometry. Alternative ion trap geometry of very low mass shift, simple in fabrication, and satisfying the requirement of high mechanical accuracy is proposed. The proposed alternative ion trap geometry provides a lower ejection delay than linear ion traps with hyperbolic rods.</description>

      <title>Computational Study of Li+ Solvation Structures in Fluorinated Ether, Non-Fluorinated Ether, and Organic Carbonate-Based Electrolytes at Low and High Salt Concentrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the solvation structure of electrolytes is crucial for optimizing the performance and stability of lithium-ion batteries. Novel solvents are essential for enhancing electrolyte structure and ensuring better integration with modern electrode systems. However, there are limited studies focused on fluorinated solvent-based electrolytes. Herein, we report a new weakly solvated ether electrolyte (WSEE) composed of a pure fluorinated ether solvent, which results in an anion-rich solvation structure even at a low salt concentration of 1M. To explore this, we selected the advanced fluorinated solvent 2,2-Difluoroethyl Methyl Ether (FEME) and compared it with Dipropyl Ether (DPE), Ethylene Carbonate (EC), and Diethyl Carbonate (DEC). The prepared electrolyte systems include DPE with 1M, 1.8M, and 4M LiFSI, FEME with 1M, 1.8M, and 4M LiFSI, and a 1:1 vol% EC/DEC mixture containing 1M LiPF6. In this work, we comprehensively investigate the Li+ solvation structures in these electrolytes using Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations and Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. Our computational findings indicate the presence of large ion aggregates (AGGs) in each DPE- and FEME-based electrolyte, while SSIPs (68%) are the dominant species in the mixed EC/DEC electrolyte. Notably, the formation of large ion aggregates is more pronounced in FEME-based electrolytes. We find that, similar to DPE, FEME solvent also exhibits weak solvating power across all examined salt concentrations. Furthermore, the quantum mechanical features of the Li+ solvation structures in DPE+1.8M LiFSI, FEME+1.8M LiFSI, and EC/DEC+1M LiPF6 electrolytes have been analyzed in detail using DFT calculations. We anticipate that this study will provide valuable insights into the Li+ solvation structures in DPE, FEME, and EC/DEC electrolytes, where the ether-based electrolytes exhibit closely similar properties.</description>

      <title>Pilot study of electrochemical reduction of selected nucleotides and double-stranded DNA at pristine micro-/ultrananocrystalline boron-doped diamond electrodes at very negative potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pristine polycrystalline boron-doped diamond electrodes (BDDEs) -- microcrystalline (B-MCDE) and ultrananocrystalline (B-UNCDE) were applied for the electrochemical reduction of several selected purine nucleotides -- Guanosine 5'-monophosphate (GMP), 2'-Deoxyguanosine 5'-monophosphate (dGMP), Adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP), Adenosine 5'-diphosphate (ADP), Adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP), and pyrimidine nucleotides -- Cytidine 5'-monophosphate (CMP), Thymidine 5'-monophosphate (TMP), as well as low-molecular-weight double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) at very negative potentials via linear sweep voltammetry (LSV). Three different types of electrode surfaces were employed -- "H-terminated" B-MCDE (H-B-MCDE) and "O-terminated" B-MCDE/B-UNCDE (O-B-MCDE/O-B-UNCDE). It was found that electrochemical reduction of all tested analytes (except GMP) is possible at H-B-MCDE. On the other hand, electrochemical reduction of all selected analytes (except dsDNA) is possible at O-B-MCDE/O-B-UNCDE. Ambient oxygen and preadsorption step in the manner of incubation of the corresponding sensor in the analyte solution for 30 s had a profound effect on the repeatability of the results and, in the case of H-B-MCDE, also on the magnitude of voltammetric signals and the possibility of electrochemical reduction of dGMP. The use of the proposed sensors and their main advantages and disadvantages for the voltammetric determination of the tested analytes (demonstrated via electrochemical reduction of AMP) in the presence of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Theory for Critical Conditions of Like-Charge Attraction Between Polarizable Spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite extensive experimental and theoretical efforts, a concise quantitative theory to predict the occurrence of like-charge attraction (LCA) between polarizable spheres remains elusive. In this work, we first derive a novel three-point image formula, based on a key observation that connects the classical Neumann's image principle with the incomplete beta function. This approach naturally yields simple yet precise critical conditions for LCA, with a relative discrepancy of less than $1\%$ compared to numerical simulations, validated across diverse parameter settings. The obtained critical conditions may provide physical insights into various processes potentially involving LCA, such as self-assembly, crystallization, and phase separation across different length scales. Additionally, the new image formula is directly applicable to enhance the efficiency of polarizable force field calculations involving polarizable spheres.</description>

      <title>Nanoscale defects and heterogeneous cavitation in water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cavitation, the formation of vapor bubbles in metastable liquids, is highly sensitive to nanoscale surface defects. Using molecular dynamics simulations and classical nucleation theory, we show that pure water confined within defect-free walls can withstand extreme negative pressures, far beyond those observed experimentally. Hydrophobic surfaces trigger heterogeneous cavitation and lower the cavitation pressure magnitude, but not to experimental levels. Notably, a single nanoscopic surface defect capable of hosting a vapor bubble drastically reduces the tensile strength of water. We find that defects as small as 1-2 nm can act as effective cavitation nuclei, a scale smaller than predicted by simple mechanical stability arguments. This discrepancy arises from stochastic fluctuations of the vapor bubble, which can overcome the kinetic free-energy barrier for cavitation. Our findings show that cavitation is predominantly determined by the largest surface defect rather than the overall defect density, emphasizing the importance of eliminating the largest surface imperfections to enhance stability against cavitation.</description>

      <title>Electronic States and Mechanical Behaviors of Phosphorus Carbide Nanotubes -- Structural and Quantum Phase Transitions in a Quasi-one-dimensional Material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasi-one-dimensional (1D) materials can manifest exotic electronic properties in manners that are distinct from the bulk phase or other low-dimensional systems. Helical symmetries in such materials -- e.g., nanotubes with intrinsic or applied twist -- can simultaneously lead to strong electronic correlation and anomalous transport behavior. However, these materials remain underexplored, in part due to computational challenges. Using specialized symmetry-adapted first-principles calculations, we show that mono-layer $P_2C_3$ -- identified in a previous letter to possess ``double Kagome bands'' -- exhibits a number of striking properties when rolled up into phosphorous carbide nanotubes ($P_2C_3$NTs). Both armchair and zigzag $P_2C_3$NTs are stable at room temperature and display a degenerate combination of Dirac points and electronic flat bands at the Fermi level. Notably, these flat bands are highly resilient to elastic deformations. Large strains can transform the nanotube structure from honeycomb-kagome to ``brick-wall'', and trigger multiple quantum phase transitions. Edge states in $P_2C_3$NTs, spin-degeneracy lifting induced by vacancies and dopants, and strain-tunable magnetism are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Metal-Support Interaction Dictates Cu Nanoparticle Sintering on Al$_2$O$_3$ Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nanoparticle sintering remains a critical challenge in heterogeneous catalysis. In this work, we present a unified deep potential (DP) model for Cu nanoparticles on three Al$_2$O$_3$ surfaces ($\gamma$-Al$_2$O$_3$(100), $\gamma$-Al$_2$O$_3$(110), and $\alpha$-Al$_2$O$_3$(0001)). Using DP-accelerated simulations, we reveal striking facet-dependent nanoparticle stability and mobility patterns across the three surfaces. The nanoparticles diffuse several times faster on $\alpha$-Al$_2$O$_3$(0001) than on $\gamma$-Al$_2$O$_3$(100) at 800 K while expected to be more sluggish based on their larger binding energy at 0 K. Diffusion is facilitated by dynamic metal-support interaction (MSI), where the Al atoms switch out of the surface plane to optimize contact with the nanoparticle and relax back to the plane as the nanoparticle moves away. In contrast, the MSI on $\gamma$-Al$_2$O$_3$(100) and on $\gamma$-Al$_2$O$_3$(110) is dominated by more stable and directional Cu-O bonds, consistent with the limited diffusion observed on these surfaces. Our extended long-time MD simulations provide quantitative insights into the sintering processes, showing that the dispersity of nanoparticles (the initial inter-nanoparticle distance) strongly influences coalescence driven by nanoparticle diffusion. We observed that the coalescence of Cu$_{13}$ nanoparticles on $\alpha$-Al$_2$O$_3$(0001) can occur in a short time (10 ns) at 800 K even with an initial inter-nanoparticle distance increased to 30 \r{A}, while the coalescence on $\gamma$-Al$_2$O$_3$(100) is inhibited significantly by increasing the initial inter-nanoparticle distance from 15 \r{A} to 30 \r{A}. These findings demonstrate that the dynamics of the supporting surface is crucial to understanding the sintering mechanism and offer guidance for designing sinter-resistant catalysts by engineering the support morphology.</description>

Abstract: We study the static and dynamic properties of a cyclic Rouse chain modified by the inclusion of an effective, spherically symmetric, attracting potential of entropic nature , is the position vector of ring center of mass, is the position vector of the segment with number n, is the Boltzmann constant multiplied on absolute temperature, is a parameter of the potential, square of which is inverse to strength of the potential. It is shown that very weak potentials with , N is the number Kuhn segments in polymer ring, b is the length of Kuhn segment, lead to dramatic compression of the polymer chain whose radius of inertia becomes much smaller compared to the free size At values of the potential parameter of order , is the concentration of Kuhn segments in the melt, the concentration of the intrinsic segments of the polymer ring becomes of order and the state of the polymer ring can be regarded as globular. The terminal relaxation time of the polymer ring turns out to be of the order of , the mean squared displacement of the center of mass of the macromolecule during this time , which can lead to a pseudo plateau for the time dependence of the mean squared displacements of the polymer segments before entering the normal diffusion mode of motion.</description>

      <title>A Theoretical Framework for an Efficient Normalizing Flow-Based Solution to the Electronic Schrodinger Equation</title>

Abstract: A central problem in quantum mechanics involves solving the Electronic Schrodinger Equation for a molecule or material. The Variational Monte Carlo approach to this problem approximates a particular variational objective via sampling, and then optimizes this approximated objective over a chosen parameterized family of wavefunctions, known as the ansatz. Recently neural networks have been used as the ansatz, with accompanying success. However, sampling from such wavefunctions has required the use of a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach, which is inherently inefficient. In this work, we propose a solution to this problem via an ansatz which is cheap to sample from, yet satisfies the requisite quantum mechanical properties. We prove that a normalizing flow using the following two essential ingredients satisfies our requirements: (a) a base distribution which is constructed from Determinantal Point Processes; (b) flow layers which are equivariant to a particular subgroup of the permutation group. We then show how to construct both continuous and discrete normalizing flows which satisfy the requisite equivariance. We further demonstrate the manner in which the non-smooth nature ("cusps") of the wavefunction may be captured, and how the framework may be generalized to provide induction across multiple molecules. The resulting theoretical framework entails an efficient approach to solving the Electronic Schrodinger Equation.</description>

      <title>The Role of Superlattice Phonons in Charge Localization Across Quantum Dot Arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02188v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding charge transport in semiconductor quantum dot (QD) assemblies is important for developing the next generation of solar cells and light-harvesting devices based on QD technology. One of the key factors that governs the transport in such systems is related to the hybridization between the QDs. Recent experiments have successfully synthesized QD molecules, arrays, and assemblies by directly fusing the QDs, with enhanced hybridization leading to high carrier mobilities and coherent band-like electronic transport. In this work, we theoretically investigate the electron transfer dynamics across a finite CdSe-CdS core-shell QD array, considering up to seven interconnected QDs in one dimension. We find that, even in the absence of structural and size disorder, electron transfer can become localized by the emergent low-frequency superlattice vibrational modes when the connecting neck between QDs is narrow. On the other hand, we also identify a regime where the same vibrational modes facilitate coherent electron transport when the connecting necks are wide. Overall, we elucidate the crucial effects of electronic and superlattice symmetries and their couplings when designing high-mobility devices based on QD superlattices.</description>

      <title>Large Deviation Theory Approach to Fluctuation Theorems and Landauer's Principle through Heat Redefinition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15725v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large deviation theory (LDT) provides a mathematical framework to quantify the probabilities of rare events in stochastic systems. In this study, we applied LDT to model a chemical reaction system and demonstrated that the fluctuation theorem for nonequilibrium reaction systems can be derived from the symmetry of the cumulant generating function defined through the rate function. Notably, this derivation does not depend on the assumption of local detailed balance. Furthermore, we redefined heat using this rate function based on information theory and evaluated Landauer's principle, which addresses the minimum energy cost associated with information erasure. These findings show the utility of LDT as a comprehensive framework for analyzing a wide range of nonequilibrium systems.</description>

      <title>Excitation Energy Transfer between Porphyrin Dyes on a Clay Surface: A study employing Multifidelity Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20551v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Natural light-harvesting antenna complexes efficiently capture solar energy using chlorophyll, i.e., magnesium porphyrin pigments, embedded in a protein matrix. Inspired by this natural configuration, artificial clay-porphyrin antenna structures have been experimentally synthesized and have demonstrated remarkable excitation energy transfer properties. The study presents the computational design and simulation of a synthetic light-harvesting system that emulates natural mechanisms by arranging cationic free-base porphyrin molecules on an anionic clay surface. We investigated the transfer of excitation energy among the porphyrin dyes using a multiscale quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) approach based on the semi-empirical density functional-based tight-binding (DFTB) theory for the ground state dynamics. To improve the accuracy of our results, we incorporated an innovative multifidelity machine learning (MFML) approach, which allows the prediction of excitation energies at the numerically demanding time-dependent density functional theory level with the Def2-SVP basis set. This approach was applied to an extensive dataset of 640K geometries for the 90-atom porphyrin structures, facilitating a thorough analysis of the excitation energy diffusion among the porphyrin molecules adsorbed to the clay surface. The insights gained from this study, inspired by natural light-harvesting complexes, demonstrate the potential of porphyrin-clay systems as effective energy transfer systems.</description>

      <title>Post-CCSD(T) corrections in the S66 noncovalent interactions benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12004v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For noncovalent interactions, it is generally assumed that CCSD(T) is nearly the exact solution within the 1-particle basis set. For the S66 noncovalent interactions benchmark, we present for the majority of species CCSDT and CCSDT(Q) corrections with a polarized double-zeta basis set. For hydrogen bonds, pure London complexes, and mixed-influence complexes, CCSD(T) benefits from error cancellation between (usually repulsive) higher-order triples, $T_3 - (T)$, and (almost universally attractive) connected quadruples, (Q). For $\pi$-stacking complexes, this cancellation starts breaking down and CCSD(T) overbinds; CCSD(T)$_\Lambda$ corrects the problem at the expense of London complexes. A fairly simple two-parameter model predicts CCSDT(Q)--CCSD(T) differences to 0.01 kcal/mol RMS, requiring no calculations that scale more steeply than $O(N^7)$.</description>

      <title>Double Ionization Potential Equation-of-Motion Coupled-Cluster Approach with Full Inclusion of 4-Hole-2-Particle Excitations and Three-Body Clusters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10688v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The double ionization potential (DIP) equation-of-motion (EOM) coupled-cluster (CC) method with a full treatment of 4-hole-2-particle (4$h$-2$p$) correlations and triply excited clusters, abbreviated as DIP-EOMCCSDT(4$h$-2$p$), and its approximate form called DIP-EOMCCSD(T)(a)(4$h$-2$p$) have been formulated and implemented in the open-source CCpy package available on GitHub. The resulting codes work with both nonrelativistic and spin-free scalar-relativistic Hamiltonians. By examining the DIPs of a few small molecules, for which accurate reference data are available, we demonstrate that the DIP-EOMCCSDT(4$h$-2$p$) and DIP-EOMCCSD(T)(a)(4$h$-2$p$) approaches improve the results obtained using the DIP-EOMCC methods truncated at 3$h$-1$p$ or 4$h$-2$p$ excitations on top of the CC calculations with singles and doubles.</description>

Abstract: The first experimental evidence of quantum Drude oscillator behavior in liquids is determined using probabilistic machine learning-augmented iterative Boltzmann inversion applied to noble gas radial distribution functions. Furthermore, classical force fields for noble gases are shown to be reduced to a single parameter through simple empirical relations linked to atomic dipole polarizability. These findings highlight how neutron scattering data can inspire innovative force field design and offer insight into interatomic forces to advance molecular simulations.</description>

      <title>Efficient ground-state energy estimation and certification on early fault-tolerant quantum computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.09827v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A major thrust in quantum algorithm development over the past decade has been the search for the quantum algorithms that will deliver practical quantum advantage first. Today's quantum computers - and even early fault-tolerant quantum computers - are limited in the number of operations they can implement per circuit. We introduce quantum algorithms for ground-state energy estimation (GSEE) that accommodate this design constraint. The first algorithm estimates ground-state energies, offering a quadratic improvement on the ground state overlap parameter compared to other methods in this regime. The second algorithm certifies that the estimated ground-state energy is within a specified error tolerance of the true ground-state energy, addressing the issue of gap estimation that beleaguers several ground state preparation and energy estimation algorithms. We note, however, that the scaling of this certification technique is currently less favorable than that of the GSEE algorithm. To develop the certification algorithm, we propose a novel use of quantum computers to facilitate rejection sampling. After a classical computer generates initial samples, the quantum computer is used to accept or reject these samples, resulting in a set of accepted samples that approximate draws from a target distribution. Although we apply this technique specifically for ground-state energy certification, it may find broader applications. Our work pushes the boundaries of what operation-limited quantum computers can achieve, bringing the prospect of quantum advantage closer to realization.</description>

      <title>A Monte Carlo simulation framework for investigating the effect of inter-track coupling on H$_2$O$_2$ productions at ultra-high dose rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16722v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Background: Lower production of H$_2$O$_2$ in water is a hallmark of ultra-high dose rate (UHDR) compared to the conventional dose rate (CDR). However, the current computational models based on the predicted yield of H$_2$O$_2$ are in opposite of the experimental data. Methods: We construct an analytical model for the rate equation in the production of H$_2$O$_2$ from \ce{^{.}OH}-radicals and use it as a guide to propose a hypothetical geometrical inhomogeneity in the configuration of particles in the FLASH-UHDR beams. We perform a series of Monte Carlo (MC) simulations of the track structures for a system of charged particles impinging the medium in the form of clusters and/or bunches. Results: We demonstrate the interplay of diffusion, reaction rates, and overlaps in track-spacing attribute to a lower yield of H$_2$O$_2$ at FLASH-UHDR vs. CDR. This trend is reversed if spacing among the tracks becomes larger than a critical value, with a length scale that is proportional to the diffusion length of \ce{^{.}OH}-radicals modulated by a rate of decay due to recombination with other species, available within a track, and the space among the tracks. The latter is substantial on the suppressing of the H$_2$O$_2$ population at FLASH-UHDR relative to CDR. Conclusions: Based on our analysis of the present work, at FLASH-UHDR, the lower yield in H$_2$O$_2$ can be interpreted as a signature of bunching the particles in beams of ionizing radiation. The beams enter the medium in closely packed clusters and form inhomogeneities in the track-structure distribution. Thus the MC simulations based on the assumption of uniformly distributed tracks are unable to explain the experimental data.</description>

      <title>Non-Iterative Disentangled Unitary Coupled-Cluster based on Lie-algebraic structure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14289v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to their non-iterative nature, fixed Unitary Coupled-Cluster (UCC) ans\"atze are attractive for performing quantum chemistry Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) computations as they avoid pre-circuit measurements on a quantum computer. However, achieving chemical accuracy for strongly correlated systems with UCC requires further inclusion of higher-order fermionic excitations beyond triples increasing circuit depth. We introduce $k$-NI-DUCC, a fixed and Non-iterative Disentangled Unitary Coupled-Cluster compact ansatz, based on specific $"k"$ sets of "qubit" excitations, eliminating the needs for fermionic-type excitations. These elements scale linearly ($\mathcal{O}(n)$) by leveraging Lie algebraic structures, with $n$ being the number of qubits. The key excitations are screened through specific selection criteria, including the enforcement of all symmetries, to ensure the construction of a robust set of generators. NI-DUCC employs $"k"$ products of the exponential of $\mathcal{O}(n)$- anti-Hermitian Pauli operators, where each operator has a length $p$. This results in a fewer two-qubit CNOT gates circuit, $\mathcal{O}(knp)$, suitable for hardware implementations. Tested on LiH, H$_6$ and BeH$_2$, NI-DUCC-VQE achieves both chemical accuracy and rapid convergence even for molecules deviating significantly from equilibrium. It is hardware-efficient, reaching the exact Full Configuration Interaction energy solution at specific layers, while reducing significantly the VQE optimization steps. While NI-DUCC-VQE effectively addresses the gradient measurement bottleneck of ADAPT-VQE-like iterative algorithms, the classical computational cost of constructing the $\mathcal{O}(n)$ set of excitations increases exponentially with the number of qubits. We provide a first implementation for constructing the generators' set able to handle up to 20 qubits and discuss the efficiency perspectives.</description>

      <title>Quantization of Visible Light by a Ni$_2$ Molecular Optical Resonator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01444v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantization of an optical field is a frontier in quantum optics with implications for both fundamental science and technological applications. Here, we demonstrate that a dinickel complex (Ni$_2$) traps and quantizes classical visible light, behaving as an individual quantum system or the Jaynes Cummings molecule.The composite system forms through coherently coupling the two level NiNi charge transfer transition with the local scattering field, which produces nonclassical light featuring photon anti bunching and squeezed states, as verified by a sequence of discrete photonic modes in the incoherent resonance fluorescence. Notably, in this Ni$_2$ system, the collective coupling of N molecule ensembles scales as N, distinct from the Tavis-Cummings model, which allows easy achievement of ultrastrong coupling. This is exemplified by a vacuum Rabi splitting of 1.2 eV at the resonance (3.25 eV) and a normalized coupling rate of 0.18 for the N = 4 ensemble. The resulting quantum light of single photonic modes enables driving the molecule field interaction in cavity free solution, which profoundly modifies the electronic states. Our results establish Ni$_2$ as a robust platform for quantum optical phenomena under ambient conditions, offering new pathways for molecular physics, polaritonic chemistry and quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Discontinuous Structural Transitions in Fluids with Competing Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01629v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper explores how competing interactions in the intermolecular potential of fluids affect their structural transitions. This study employs a versatile potential model with a hard core followed by two constant steps, representing wells or shoulders, analyzed in both one-dimensional (1D) and three-dimensional (3D) systems. Comparing these dimensionalities highlights the effect of confinement on structural transitions. Exact results are derived for 1D systems, while the rational function approximation is used for unconfined 3D fluids. Both scenarios confirm that when the steps are repulsive, the wavelength of the oscillatory decay of the total correlation function evolves with temperature either continuously or discontinuously. In the latter case, a discontinuous oscillation crossover line emerges in the temperature--density plane. For an attractive first step and a repulsive second step, a Fisher--Widom line appears. Although the 1D and 3D results share common features, dimensionality introduces differences: these behaviors occur in distinct temperature ranges, require deeper wells, or become attenuated in 3D. Certain features observed in 1D may vanish in 3D. We conclude that fluids with competing interactions exhibit a rich and intricate pattern of structural transitions, demonstrating the significant influence of dimensionality and interaction features.</description>

      <title>Quantum-inspired super-resolution of fluorescent point-like sources</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16835v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the experimental super-resolution of pairs of point-like fluorescent sources using a modified image inversion interferometer microscope. The technique is inspired by recent developments in the application of quantum parameter estimation theory to semiclassical imaging problems. We find that the image inversion technique requires special polarization filtering to account for the dipolar nature of the emission. Using an azimuthal polarizer, we obtain improvements in the Fisher information of point-source separation by over an order of magnitude relative to direct imaging. Unlike established super-resolution fluorescence techniques, the method does not require sequential photoswitching/blinking of the fluorophores, and thus could facilitate significant speed-ups for certain biological imaging/tracking tasks.</description>
