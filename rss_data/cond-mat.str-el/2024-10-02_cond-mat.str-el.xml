      <title>Anyonic phase transitions in the 1D extended Hubbard model with fractional statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study one-dimensional (1D) lattice anyons with extended Hubbard interactions at unit filling using bosonization and numerical simulations. The behavior can be continuously tuned from Bosonic to Fermionic behavior by adjusting the topological exchange angle $\theta$, which leads to a competition of different instabilities. We present the bosonization theory in presence of dynamic gauge fields, which predicts a phase diagrams of four different gapped phases with distinct dominant correlations. Advanced numerical simulations determine and analyze the exact phase transitions between Mott insulator, charge density wave, dimerized state, and Haldane insulator, all of which meet at a multi-critical line in the parameter space of anyonic angle $\theta$, onsite interaction $U$, and nearest neighbor repulsion $V$. Superfluid and pair-superfluid phases are stable in a region of small $V$.</description>

      <title>Bionic fractionalization in the trimer model of twisted bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the rapid experimental progress in twisted van der Waals materials, we study the triangular trimer model as a representative framework for extended Wannier orbitals in twisted bilayer graphene at 1/3-filling. This deceptively simple model exhibits a rich suite of complex phases, including unusual excitations exhibiting the physics of fractionalization and fractons. For our investigations, we carry out extensive Monte Carlo simulations using an efficient cluster algorithm. The so-obtained finite-temperature phase diagram reveals a novel polar fluid and an ordered brick-wall phase characterized by fractionally charged $e/3$ excitations with subdimensional lineonic dynamics. Notably, we identify a critical trimer liquid phase for the particularly simple model of hard trimers. For this, we derive a new field theory which takes the form of a U(1)$\times$U(1) gauge theory. Its $e/3$ monomers are fractionalized bionic excitations: they carry a {\it pair} of emergent gauge charges, as evidenced by algebraic correlations with two distinct exponents. These field theoretical predictions offer theoretical grounds for numerical observations of critical exponents. Our study highlights the triangular trimer model as a new key platform for investigating fractionalization and fractons, where trimer liquid bionic monomers can transform into lineons or fractons in proximate phases, and calls for experimental investigations of this physics in twisted van der Waals materials and a broader class of systems with intermediate-range interactions.</description>

      <title>Static structure factor and the dispersion of the Girvin-MacDonald-Platzman density-mode for fractional quantum Hall fluids on the Haldane sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the neutral excitations in the bulk of the fractional quantum Hall (FQH) fluids generated by acting the Girvin-MacDonald-Platzman (GMP) density operator on the uniform ground state. Creating these density modulations atop the ground state costs energy since any density fluctuation in the FQH system has a gap stemming from the underlying inter-particle interactions. We calculate the GMP density mode dispersion for many bosonic and fermionic FQH states on the Haldane sphere using the ground state static structure factor computed on the same geometry. Previously, this computation was carried out on the plane. Analogous to the GMP algebra of the lowest Landau level (LLL) projected density operators in the plane, we derive the algebra for the LLL-projected density operators on the sphere, which facilitates the computation of the density mode dispersion. Contrary to previous results on the plane, we find that in the long wavelength limit, the GMP mode does provide an accurate description of the dynamics of the primary Jain states.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Jahn-Teller Phenomena in Heavy Transition Metal Compounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper reviews recent experimental and theoretical developments of the dynamic Jahn-Teller effect-driven phenomena in heavy transition metal spin-orbit Mott insulators. In cubic $4d/5d$ transition metal compounds, the spin, orbital, and lattice degrees of freedom can form quantum entanglement on metal sites and induce unconventional quantum phenomena. Fingerprints of orbital-lattice entanglement called the dynamic Jahn-Teller effect appear in spectroscopic data such as resonant inelastic x-ray scattering spectra. In cubic $5d^1$ compounds with the fcc structure, the dynamic Jahn-Teller states on metal sites behave cooperatively and exhibit rich ordered phases.</description>

      <title>An algorithm for computing perturbation series of dynamical mean field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show how to use diagrammatic techniques to compute the weak-coupling perturbation series of the self-consistent solution to a Dynamical Mean Field Theory (DMFT) problem. This approach constitutes an alternative to using diagrammatic techniques directly as an impurity solver. It allows one to bypass the need of multiple perturbative series resummations within the DMFT self-consistency loop. It can be applied at or out of equilibrium, with any diagrammatic formalism, such as real times, imaginary times, or Matsubara frequencies formalisms. As a proof of principle, we illustrate our method with the half-filled Hubbard model on the Bethe lattice in the DMFT approximation, using Quantum Quasi-Monte Carlo (QQMC) to obtain the impurity perturbation series on the real time axis.</description>

      <title>Orbital selective Mott transition and magnetic moment in charge density wave heterostructures NbSe$_2/$Ta$X_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the electronic properties of charge density wave (CDW) heterostructures out of monolayers of 1T-NbSe$_2$ and 1T-Ta$X_2$ (where, $X=$ S and Se) using first-principles followed by dynamical calculations. The CDW-ordered crystal structures are simulated using $\sqrt{13}\times\sqrt{13}$ supercells of NbSe$_2$ and Ta$X_2$. These two-dimensional heterostructures are modeled by stacking monolayers of NbSe$_2$ and Ta$X_2$ along (001) direction. Our investigations reveal the presence of non-zero magnetic moments in NbSe$_2/$TaS$_2$, albeit without a long-range magnetic order, raising the issue of a possible quantum spin liquid (QSL) as suggested for monolayer 1T-TaS$_2$ recently. In contrast, the NbSe$_2/$TaSe$_2$ heterostructure exhibits no magnetic moment. In order to capture the dynamical effects of local correlation, we use DFT plus multi-orbital dynamical mean field theory (MO-DMFT). Our findings indicate that NbSe$_2/$TaS$_2$ is considerably influenced by the dynamic corrections, whereas NbSe$_2/$TaSe$_2$ shows minimal effects. Additionally, an orbital-selective Mott transition (OSMT) is observed in the NbSe$_2/$TaS$_2$ bilayer heterostructure.</description>

      <title>Photo-induced phase transition on black samarium monosulfide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To investigate the role of the excitons for the origin of the pressure-induced phase transition (BGT) from the black-colored insulator (BI) to the golden-yellow-colored metal (GM) of samarium monosulfide (SmS), optical reflectivity, Sm $3d$ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) with the creation of excitons by photoexcitation (PE) are reported. In the pump-probe reflectivity measurement, following a huge reflectivity change of about 22 %, three different relaxation times with a vibration component were observed. The fast component with the relaxation time ($\tau$) of less than 1 ps is due to the excitation and relaxation of electrons into the conduction band, and the slowest one with $\tau &gt; {\rm several} 100$ ps originates from the appearance of the photo-induced (PI) state. The components with $\tau \sim 10$ ps and vibration originate from the appearance of the PI state and the interference between the reflection lights at the sample surface and the boundary between the BI and PI states, suggesting that the electronic structure of the PI phase is different from that of the BI state. XAS spectra indicate that the Sm mean valence is shifted from the Sm$^{2+}$ dominant to the intermediate between Sm$^{2+}$ and Sm$^{3+}$ by PE but did not change to that of the GM phase across BGT, consistent with the reflectivity data. The XRD result after PE shows that the PI state has much less lattice contraction than the GM phase. These results suggest that the BGT cannot be achieved solely by creating excitons after PE but requires other effects, such as a lattice contraction.</description>

      <title>Relaxation dynamics of integrable field theories after a global quantum quench</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply the linked cluster expansion as well as the quench action approach to study the time evolution of one-point functions after a quantum quench in integrable field theories. We argue that the relaxation towards the stationary value fundamentally differs depending on the locality properties of the considered observable: while for local operators both exponential and power-law decaying terms are present in the dynamics, for semi-local operators the latter are absent. We explicitly confirm this for the Ising field theory, the sinh-Gordon model, and the repulsive sine-Gordon model.</description>

      <title>Self-organized magnon condensation in quasi-one-dimensional edge-shared cuprates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the dynamics of magnons in quantum magnetism is a captivating area of condensed matter physics. Magnons exhibit unique collective behaviours, including the formation of multimagnon bound states (MBSs). Predicted by Bethe over 90 years ago, MBSs in one-dimensional (1D) quantum magnets remain a significant subject of study due to their fundamental and technological implications. While recent advancements in quantum simulation with ultracold atoms have enabled the observation of MBSs in optical lattices, observing these states in naturally occurring materials presents an even more exciting prospect. This study proposes a novel mechanism for the stabilisation of MBSs in quasi-1D (Q1D) edge-shared cuprates, materials known for their complex magnetic interactions. Contrary to conventional approaches that require high external magnetic fields, our mechanism leverages small antiferromagnetic (AFM) interchain couplings, which act analogously to an internal magnetic field. These couplings induce collinear AFM order within individual chains, facilitating the formation of stable MBSs. This self-organised magnon condensation driven by interchain interactions is experimentally more accessible and opens new avenues for observations. Our findings offer a fresh perspective on magnetic ordered states driven by interchain-coupling-induced internal magnetic fields. We provide a comprehensive theoretical framework, present numerical results compared with experimental data from specific Q1D cuprates like Li$_2$CuO$_2$, Ca$_2$Y$_2$Cu$_5$O$_{10}$, LiCuSbO$_4$, and PbCuSO$_4$(OH)$_2$, and discuss the broader implications of our discoveries. This work paves the way for future research exploring the potential of interchain coupling-driven magnon condensation, significantly advancing the fields of quantum computing, spintronics, and magnonics.</description>

      <title>Antiferromagnetic weak topological state in Bismuth square-net based nonsymmorphic lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ZrSiS-class of layered materials offer interesting topological and magnetic characteristics suitable for spintronics applications. In this work, we have synthesized a polycrystalline NdBiTe using solid-state reaction technique and have examined the magnetic properties in 2 - 300 K temperature range using temperature and field-dependent magnetization measurements. Our magnetic and specific heat data demonstrates a long-range antiferromagnetic ordering in the material below 4.5 K. Furthermore, our isothermal magnetization data show a signature of spin-reorientation below Neel temperature. The observed nonlinearity in inverse susceptibility vs temperature data, and a hump in specific heat in 5-20 K range, indicate the existence of crystal field splitting in the material. Our transport properties measurements show the metallic behavior with positive magnetoresistance in the temperature range of 2 - 300 K. The observed rise in resistivity as function of temperature below Neel temperature infers the strongly correlated fermions, which is consistent with the observed large Sommerfeld coefficient. Consistent with experimental results, our first-principles calculations predict an antiferromagnetic semimetallic nature of NdBiTe. Further, our spin-orbit coupled simulations of electronic structure show a signature of weak topological nature of the material.</description>

      <title>Invariant Hamiltonian Bootstrap for Quantum Many-body Ground States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hamiltonian bootstrap methods use semidefinite relaxation to find certifiable lower bounds to the ground state energy of a Hamiltonian, along with approximations of ground state correlation functions. We give a thorough treatment of the role of symmetry in finite-dimensional Hamiltonian bootstrap, and show that symmetry can be used to significantly reduce the required computational resources. We additionally incorporate arbitrary Hermitian linear constraints in our analysis, which allows one to find properties of the ground state within a specified subspace. We demonstrate our approach using the 1D Hubbard model. We find quantitative agreement with exact diagonalization on $10$ sites at both half-filling and quarter-filling. Additionally, we apply our method on $100$ sites at half-filling and find quantitative agreement with the exact ground state energy density in thermodynamic limit derived from the Bethe ansatz.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetism from interaction-driven itinerant magnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnetism, a new phase of collinear spin-order sharing similarities with antiferromagnets and ferromagnets, has introduced a new guiding principle for spintronic/thermoelectric applications due to its direction-dependent magnetic properties. Fulfilling the promise to exploit altermagnetism for device design depends on identifying materials with tuneable transport properties. The search for intrinsic altermagnets has so far focused on the role of anisotropy in the crystallographic symmetries and in the bandstructure. Here, we present a different mechanism that approaches this goal by leveraging the interplay between a Hubbard local repulsion and the itinerant magnetism given by the presence of van Hove singularities. We show that altermagnetism is stable for a broad range of interactions and dopings and we focus on tunability of the spin-charge conversion ratio.</description>

      <title>A new series of 3D CFTs with $\mathrm{Sp}(N)$ global symmetry on fuzzy sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quest to discover new 3D CFTs has been intriguing for physicists. For this purpose, fuzzy sphere reguarlisation that studies interacting quantum systems defined on the lowest Landau level on a sphere has emerged as a powerful tool. In this paper, we discover a series of new CFTs with global symmetry $\mathrm{Sp}(N)$ in the fuzzy sphere models that are closely related to the $\mathrm{SO}(5)$ deconfined phase transition, and are described by a $\mathrm{Sp}(N)/(\mathrm{Sp}(M)\times \mathrm{Sp}(N-M))$ non-linear sigma model with a Wess-Zumino-Witten term. We numerically verify the emergent conformal symmetry by observing the integer-spaced conformal multiplets and studying the finite-size scaling of the conformality. We discuss possible candidates for these newly discovered CFTs, the most plausible ones being Chern-Simons-matter theories which have $N$ flavour of gapless bosons or fermions coupled to a non-Abelian (viz. $\mathrm{Sp}(1)$, $\mathrm{Sp}(2)$, etc.) Chern-Simons gauge field. Our work provides new avenues for studying interacting CFTs in 3D, possibly facilitating the non-perturbative study of critical gauge theories and previously undiscovered CFTs.</description>

      <title>High-temperature Superconducting Oxide without Copper at Ambient Pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of superconductivity in the Ba-La-Cu-O system (the cuprate) at the 30 K range in 1986 marked a significant breakthrough, as it far exceeded the highest known critical temperature ($T_c$) at the time and surpassed the predicted 30 K limit, which was thought to be the maximum before phonon-mediated electron pairing would break down due to thermal excitation. Despite recent successful observations of superconductivity in nickel-oxide-based compounds (the nickelate), superconductivity above 30 K at ambient pressure in a system that is isostructural and isoelectronic to the cuprate but without copper has remained elusive. Here, we report a superconducting $T_c$ above 35 K under ambient pressure in hole-doped, late rare-earth infinite-layer nickel oxide (Sm-Eu-Ca-Sr)NiO$_2$ thin films. Electron microscopy reveals a small thickness of ~2 nm of infinite-layer phase stabilised at present, which indicates a higher temperature superconductivity should be observable in clean bulk crystals.</description>

Abstract: The half-Heusler compound GdBiPt orders antiferromagnetically around $T_\mathrm{N}=8.5$ K which implies breaking the time reversal symmetry as well as the translational symmetry. This combination preserves the global symmetry. Here, we used rotational anisotropy of second harmonic generation (SHG) to study the symmetry changes associated with this phase transition. GdBiPt crystallizes in the space group $F\overline{4}3m$, which does not change through the phase transition. From powder neutron diffraction, the proposed magnetic point group for the magnetic unit cell is $3m$. We carried out a symmetry analysis of the SHG patterns. Above \tn, the SHG data shows a $C_2$ symmetry which excludes the point group $\overline{4}3m$, as well as the $3m$ point group which represents a $[1 1 1]$ facet of the sample. Thus, we considered the point groups $2$ and $m$, but we have to reject the first one as the associated tensor elements poorly represent the angular dependence SHG. Finally, a superposition consisting of the point groups $3m$ and $m$ fit the data correctly. Below \tn, we had to add a third contribution associated with magnetic points group $m'$ in order to properly describe the SHG signal. The SHG intensity is linearly proportional to the antiferromagnetic order parameter. This allows us to determine $T_\mathrm{N}=9.61\pm0.48$ K and a critical exponent $\beta=0.346\pm0.017$, which are in agreement with the values found in the literature.</description>

      <title>Exploring entanglement in finite-size quantum systems with degenerate ground state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop an approach for characterizing non-local quantum correlations in spin systems with exactly or nearly degenerate ground states. Starting with linearly independent degenerate eigenfunctions calculated with exact diagonalization we generate a finite set of their random linear combinations with Haar measure, which guarantees that these combinations are uniformly distributed in the space spanned by the initial eigenstates. Estimating the von Neumann entropy of the random wave functions helps to reveal previously unknown features of the quantum correlations in the phases with degeneracy of the ground state. For instance, spin spiral phase of the quantum magnet with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction is characterized by the enhancement of the entanglement entropy, which can be qualitatively explained by the changes in behaviour of two- and three-spin correlation functions. To establish the connection between our theoretical findings and real experiments we elaborate on the problem of estimating observables on the basis of the single-shot measurements of numerous degenerate eigenstates.</description>

      <title>Theory of Nonlinear Hall Effect Induced by Electric Field and Temperature Gradient in 3D Chiral Magnetic Textures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the current proportional to the cross product of an electric field and a temperature gradient, which we call the Nonlinear Chiral Thermo-Electric (NCTE) Hall effect, in 3D chiral magnetic structures. We analyze both discrete and continuous magnetization cases. From the analysis of discrete magnetization, we clarify the conditions for the emergence of the NCTE Hall effect caused by magnetic textures. In the continuous magnetization case, we show that the NCTE Hall conductivity is proportional to the density of magnetic monopoles. This study discovers unconventional phenomena unique to 3D magnetic textures, and has significant implications for spintronics and quantum transport.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a JT gravity setup coupled with $U(1)$ and $SU(2)$ Yang-Mills fields in two dimensions that reveals the onset of a small black hole to large black hole phase transition at finite chemical potential(s). We identify these black hole solutions as topological defects in the thermodynamic phase space and calculate the associated topological numbers following the standard procedure. We confirm the robustness of our model by estimating perturbative corrections to the bulk free energy at an arbitrary order in the Yang-Mills coupling. We also construct the Schwarzian for the boundary theory using the 2D gravitational action in the bulk and comment on the dual SYK like model where similar observations can be made.</description>

      <title>Topological orbital Hall effect caused by skyrmions and antiferromagnetic skyrmions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The topological Hall effect is a hallmark of topologically non-trivial magnetic textures such as magnetic skyrmions. It quantifies the transverse electric current once an electric field is applied and occurs as a consequence of the emergent magnetic field of the skyrmion. Likewise, an orbital magnetization is generated. Here we show that the charge currents are orbital polarized even though the conduction electrons couple to the skyrmion texture via their spin. The topological Hall effect is accompanied by a topological orbital Hall effect even for s electrons without spin-orbit coupling. As we show, antiferromagnetic skyrmions that have a compensated emergent field, exhibit a pure topological orbital Hall conductivity that is not accompanied by charge transport and can be orders of magnitude larger than the topological spin Hall conductivity.</description>

      <title>Layer-dependent magnetic property in a superconducting quintuple-layer nickelate La6Ni5O12</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To investigate the detailed magnetic properties of a recently discovered superconducting nickelate Nd6Ni5O12, we performed the first-principles electronic structure calculation based on density functional theory. The band dispersion, electronic charge distribution and the magnetic moment are computed with La substituted for Nd, and compared with another structural type of nickel-based superconducting material, namely, RNiO2 (R: rare-earth elements). In particular, we estimated the magnetic exchange interaction strength based on magnetic force theory. Our results show that the inter-atomic magnetic couplings are notably reduced by intrinsic hole doping from the blocking fluorite slab which validates the conventional view of regarding Nd6Ni5O12 as a doped case of its infinite-layer counterpart. At the same time, however, the interactions are markedly layer-dependent. The outer most NiO2 layer adjacent to the blocking fluorite roughly corresponds to the 20% chemical doping in the infinite-layer material whereas the inner layers have stronger couplings. The long-range nature and the out-of-plane interactions are also presented. Our results provide useful information to understand this new superconducting nickelate whose intrinsic layer structure is obviously distinctive.</description>

      <title>Kinetic magnetism and stripe order in the doped AFM bosonic ${t-J}$ model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unraveling the microscopic mechanisms governing the physics of doped quantum magnets is a central challenge in strongly correlated many-body physics. Quantum simulation platforms, e.g. ultracold atoms trapped in optical lattices or tweezer arrays, offer an exciting pathway to investigate the interplay between spin and charge motion, thereby providing an avenue to addressing longstanding questions such as the nature of charge pairing in high-temperature superconductors. Here, in a new twist, we seek to disentangle the role of particle statistics in the physics of strongly correlated systems by exploring the strong coupling limit of doped bosonic quantum magnets, specifically the antiferromagnetic (AFM) bosonic $t-J$ model. We perform large-scale density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations to map out the phase diagram of the AFM bosonic $t-J$ model on the 2D square lattice at finite doping. We find that in the low doping regime, bosonic holes tend to form partially-filled stripes, akin to those observed in high-$T_c$ cuprates. As doping increases beyond a critical value $\delta \gtrsim \delta^*_\mathrm{PP} (\delta^*_\mathrm{FM})$, a transition occurs between AFM and ferromagnetic (FM) ground states, driven by the competition between Heisenberg-type AFM and Nagaoka-type FM mediated by the motion of mobile bosonic holes. In the high doping or large $t/J$ limit, the system evolves into a fully-polarized SU(2) ferromagnet, consistent with a phase transition linked to Nagaoka polarons. Our findings shed light on the role of particle statistics in strongly correlated quantum matter and connect to phases in the 2D Fermi-Hubbard and $t-J$ models. Our results may be realized in state-of-the-art quantum simulation experiments with bosonic quantum gas microscopes, paving the way for further exploration of doped bosonic quantum magnets.</description>

Abstract: Microscopically understanding competing orders in strongly correlated systems is a key challenge in modern quantum many-body physics. For example, the study of magnetic polarons and their relation to pairing in the Fermi-Hubbard model in different geometries remains one of the central questions, and may help to understand the mechanism underlying unconventional superconductivity in cuprates or transition metal dichalcogenides. With recent advances in analog quantum simulation of the Fermi-Hubbard model on non-bipartite lattices, frustrated physics can now be explored experimentally in systems lacking particle-hole symmetry. Here, we study the singly doped $t-J$ model on the triangular lattice, focusing on the competition between kinetic and magnetic frustration as a function of temperature. In doublon doped systems, we uncover a crossover between Nagaoka-type ferromagnetic (FM) correlations at high temperature and exchange mediated antiferromagnetic (AFM) order around the doublon at low temperature. For hole doped systems, kinetic Haerter-Shastry-type AFM at high temperature as well as exchange interactions at low temperature favor $120^{\circ}$ order, strengthening magnetic correlations compared to the undoped system. In the ground state, the presence of AFM correlations throughout a wide range of interactions indicates confinement of both types of dopants. In this regime we firmly establish the presence of linear confining potentials via energy scaling arguments, supporting the picture of geometric strings in the frustrated triangular $t-J$ model.</description>

      <title>Orbital-selective effect of spin reorientation on the Dirac fermions in a non-charge-ordered kagome ferromagnet Fe$_3$Ge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.06399v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kagome magnets provide a fascinating platform for the realization of correlated topological quantum phases under various magnetic ground states. However, the effect of the magnetic spin configurations on the characteristic electronic structure of the kagome lattice layer remains elusive. Here, utilizing angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations, we report the spectroscopic evidence for the spin-reorientation effect of a kagome ferromagnet Fe$_3$Ge, which is composed solely of kagome planes. As the Fe moments cant from the $c$ axis into the $ab$ plane upon cooling, the two kinds of kagome-derived Dirac fermions respond quite differently. The one with less-dispersive bands ($k_z$ $\sim$ 0) containing the $3d_{z^2}$ orbitals evolves from gapped into nearly gapless, while the other with linear dispersions ($k_z$ $\sim$ $\pi$) embracing the $3d_{xz}$/$3d_{yz}$ components remains intact, suggesting that the effect of spin reorientation on the Dirac fermions has an orbital selectivity. Moreover, we demonstrate that there is no signature of charge order formation in Fe$_3$Ge, contrasting with its sibling compound FeGe, a newly established charge-density-wave kagome magnet.</description>

Abstract: Ever since the discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in cuprates, gaining microscopic insights into the nature of pairing in strongly correlated, repulsively interacting fermionic systems has remained one of the greatest challenges in modern condensed matter physics. Following recent experiments reporting superconductivity in the bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ (LNO) with remarkably high critical temperatures of $T_c = 80$ K, it has been argued that the low-energy physics of LNO can be described by the strongly correlated, mixed-dimensional bilayer $t-J$ model. Here we investigate this bilayer system and utilize density matrix renormalization group techniques to establish a thorough understanding of the model and the magnetically induced pairing through comparison to the perturbative limit of dominating inter-layer spin couplings. In particular, this allows us to explain appearing finite-size effects, firmly establishing the existence of long-range superconducting order in the thermodynamic limit that is described by the XXZ universality class of hard-core bosons constituted by $s$-wave singlet pairs. As the effective model in the perturbative limit is known to show linear resistivity above the superconducting transition temperature, we propose a pair-based interpretation of the extended strange metal phase observed in LNO. By analyzing binding energies, we predict a BEC-BCS crossover as a function of the Hamiltonian parameters, whereas LNO is anticipated to lie on the BCS side in vicinity of the transition. We find large binding energies of the order of the inter-layer coupling that suggest strikingly high critical temperatures of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition, raising the question whether (mixD) bilayer superconductors possibly facilitate critical temperatures above room temperature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14137v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The physics of doped Mott insulators is at the heart of strongly correlated materials and is believed to constitute an essential ingredient for high-temperature superconductivity. In systems with higher SU(N) spin symmetries, even richer magnetic ground states appear at a filling of one particle per site compared to the case of SU(2) spins, but their fate upon doping remains largely unexplored. Here we address this question by studying a single hole in the SU(3) $t$-$J$ model, whose undoped ground state features long-range, diagonal spin stripes. By analyzing both ground state and dynamical properties utilizing the density matrix renormalization group, we establish the appearence of magnetic polarons consisting of chargons and flavor defects, whose dynamics is constrained to a single effective dimension along the ordered diagonal. We semi-analytically describe the system using geometric string theory, where paths of hole motion are the fundamental degrees of freedom. With recent advances in the realization and control of SU(N) Fermi-Hubbard models with ultracold atoms in optical lattices, our results can directly be observed in quantum gas microscopes with single-site resolution. Our work suggests the appearance of intricate ground states at finite doping constituted by emergent, coupled Luttinger liquids along diagonals, and is a first step towards exploring a wealth of physics in doped SU(N) Fermi-Hubbard models on various geometries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17366v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We calculate the equilibrium Josephson current through a disordered interacting quantum dot described by a Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model fully contacted by two BCS superconductors, such that all modes of the dot contribute to the coupling, which encodes hopping and spin-flip processes. We show that, at zero temperature and at the conformal limit, i.e. in the strong interacting limit, the Josephson current is suppressed by $U$, the strength of the interaction, as $\ln(U)/U$ and becomes universal, namely it gets independent on the superconducting gap. At finite temperature, instead, it depends on the ratio between the gap and the temperature. A proximity effect exists but the self-energy corrections induced by the coupling with the superconducting leads seem subleading as compared to the interaction self-energy and the tunneling matrix for large number of particles. Finally we compare the results of the original four-fermion model with those obtained considering zero interaction, two-fermions and a generalized q-fermion model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13306v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The underlying mechanism of the thermal Hall effect (THE) generated by phonons in a variety of insulators is yet to be identified. Here, we report on a sizeable thermal Hall conductivity in NiPS$_3$, a van der Waals stack of honeycomb layers with a zigzag antiferromagnetic order below $T_N$ = 155 K. The longitudinal ($\kappa_{aa}$) and the transverse ($\kappa_{ab}$) thermal conductivities peak at the same temperature and the thermal Hall angle, at this peak, respects a previously identified bound. The amplitude of $\kappa_{ab}$ is extremely sensitive to the amplitude of magnetization along the $b$-axis, in contrast to the phonon mean free path, which is not at all. We show that the magnon and acoustic phonon bands cross each other along the $b^\ast$ orientation in the momentum space. The relevance of a thermodynamic property, combined with the irrelevance of the mean free path, points to an intrinsic origin.</description>

      <title>Natural anomalous cyclotron response in a hydrodynamic local quantum critical metal in a periodic potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11095v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study DC magnetotransport in a quantum critical metal in the presence of a lattice. In the regime where the transport is hydrodynamical the interplay of the Lorentz force and the lattice gives rise to a natural anomalous contribution to the cyclotron frequency that changes it from its canonical charge-to-mass ratio. The size of this effect is universal as it is determined only by thermodynamic quantities. Remarkably the Drude weight changes in such a way that to first subleading order in the lattice strength the Hall resistivity and Hall coefficient do not change, though the Hall angle does change. We confirm our results with numerical simulations in a holographic model of a strange metal. For weak lattice strength these hydrodynamic effects are shown to be present. The numerical simulations also suggest that strong lattice effects beyond a hydrodynamic regime may provide a resolution to the experimentally observed anomalous Hall response of cuprate strange metals.</description>

      <title>Robust stripes in the mixed-dimensional $t-J$ model</title>

Abstract: Microscopically understanding competing orders in strongly correlated systems is a key challenge in modern quantum many-body physics. For example, the origin of stripe order and its relation to pairing in the Fermi-Hubbard model remains one of the central questions, and may help to understand the origin of high-temperature superconductivity in cuprates. Here, we analyze stripe formation in the doped mixed-dimensional (mixD) variant of the $t-J$ model, where charge carriers are restricted to move only in one direction, whereas magnetic SU(2) interactions are two-dimensional. Using the density matrix renormalization group at finite temperature, we find a stable vertical stripe phase in the absence of pairing, featuring incommensurate magnetic order and long-range charge density wave profiles over a wide range of dopings. We find high critical temperatures on the order of the magnetic coupling $\sim J/2$, hence being within reach of current quantum simulators. Snapshots of the many-body state, accessible to quantum simulators, reveal hidden spin correlations in the mixD setting, whereby antiferromagnetic correlations are enhanced when considering purely the magnetic background. The proposed model can be viewed as realizing a parent Hamiltonian of the stripe phase, whose hidden spin correlations lead to the predicted resilience against quantum and thermal fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Quantifying hole-motion-induced frustration in doped antiferromagnets by Hamiltonian reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.02440v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unveiling the microscopic origins of quantum phases dominated by the interplay of spin and motional degrees of freedom constitutes one of the central challenges in strongly correlated many-body physics. When holes move through an antiferromagnetic spin background, they displace the positions of spins, which induces effective frustration in the magnetic environment. However, a concrete characterization of this effect in a quantum many-body system is still an unsolved problem. Here we present a Hamiltonian reconstruction scheme that allows for a precise quantification of hole-motion-induced frustration. We access non-local correlation functions through projective measurements of the many-body state, from which effective spin-Hamiltonians can be recovered after detaching the magnetic background from dominant charge fluctuations. The scheme is applied to systems of mixed dimensionality, where holes are restricted to move in one dimension, but SU(2) superexchange is two-dimensional. We demonstrate that hole motion drives the spin background into a highly frustrated regime, which can quantitatively be described by an effective $J_1-J_2-$type spin model. We exemplify the applicability of the reconstruction scheme to ultracold atom experiments by recovering effective spin-Hamiltonians of experimentally obtained 1D Fermi-Hubbard snapshots. Our method can be generalized to fully 2D systems, enabling promising microscopic perspectives on the doped Hubbard model.</description>

      <title>Signatures of Kondo-Majorana interplay in ac response</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.03605v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze dynamical transport properties of a hybrid nanostructure, comprising a correlated quantum dot embedded between the source and drain electrodes, which are subject to an ac voltage, focusing on signatures imprinted on the charge transport by the side-attached Majorana zero-energy mode. The considerations are based on the Kubo formula, for which the relevant correlation functions are determined by using the numerical renormalization group approach, which allows us to consider the correlation effects due to the Coulomb repulsion and their interplay with the Majorana mode in a non-perturbative manner. We point out universal features of the dynamical conductance, showing up in the Kondo-Majorana regime, and differentiate them against the conventional Kondo and Majorana systems. In particular, we predict that the Majorana quasiparticles give rise to universal fractional values of the ac conductance in the well-defined frequency range below the peak at the Kondo scale. We also show this Kondo scale to actually increase with strengthening the coupling to the topological superconducting wire.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic constraint on $T_c$ for unconventional superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07128v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Can room temperature superconductivity be achieved in correlated materials under ambient pressure? Our answer to this billion-dollar question is probably no, at least for realistic models within the current theoretical framework. This is shown by our systematic simulations on the pairing instability of some effective models for two-dimensional superconductivity. For a square lattice model with nearest-neighbour pairing, we find a plaquette state formed of weakly-connected $2\times2$ blocks for sufficiently large pairing interaction. The superconductivity is suppressed on both sides away from its melting quantum critical point. Thus, the plaquette state constrains the magnitude of $T_c$ for large pairing interactions and may be viewed as a strong-coupling parent state of $d$-wave superconductivity, in resemblance of other competing orders. We then extend our simulations to a variety of effective models covering nearest-neighbour or onsite pairings, single layer or two-layer structures, intralayer or interlayer pairings, and find an intrinsic maximum of the ratio $T_c/J\approx 0.04-0.07$, where $J$ is the onsite or nearest-neighbour pairing interaction. Comparison with existing experiments supports this constraint in cuprate, iron-based, nickelate, and heavy fermion superconductors, despite that these compounds are so complicated well beyond our simplified models. As a result, the known families of unconventional superconductivity, possibly except the infinite-layer nickelates, seem to almost exhaust their potentials in reaching the maximal $T_c$ allowed by their spin exchange interaction, while achieving room temperature superconductor would require a much larger $J$ beyond 400-700 meV, which seems unrealistic and hence demands novel pairing mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Spin-Energy Entanglement of a Time-Focused Neutron</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07967v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Intra-particle entanglement of individual particles such as neutrons could enable another class of scattering probes that are sensitive to entanglement in quantum systems and materials. In this work, we present experimental results demonstrating quantum contextuality as a result of entanglement between the spin and energy modes (i.e., degrees of freedom) of single neutrons in a beam using a pair of resonant radio-frequency neutron spin flippers in the MIEZE configuration (Modulated IntEnsity with Zero Effort). We verified the mode-entanglement by measuring a Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) contextuality witness $S$ defined in the spin and energy subsystems, observing a clear breach of the classical bound of $|S| \leq 2$, obtaining $S = 2.40 \pm 0.02$. These entangled beams could enable alternative approaches for directly probing dynamics and entanglement in quantum materials whose low-energy excitation scales match those of the incident entangled neutron.</description>

      <title>Local control and mixed dimensions: Exploring high-temperature superconductivity in optical lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02551v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The simulation of high-temperature superconducting materials by implementing strongly correlated fermionic models in optical lattices is one of the major objectives in the field of analog quantum simulation. Here we show that local control and optical bilayer capabilities combined with spatially resolved measurements create a versatile toolbox to study fundamental properties of both nickelate and cuprate high-temperature superconductors. On the one hand, we present a scheme to implement a mixed-dimensional (mixD) bilayer model that has been proposed to capture the essential pairing physics of pressurized bilayer nickelates. This allows for the long-sought realization of a state with long-range superconducting order in current lattice quantum simulation machines. In particular, we show how coherent pairing correlations can be accessed in a partially particle-hole transformed and rotated basis. On the other hand, we demonstrate that control of local gates enables the observation of $d$-wave pairing order in the two-dimensional (single-layer) repulsive Fermi-Hubbard model through the simulation of a system with attractive interactions. Lastly, we introduce a scheme to measure momentum-resolved dopant densities, providing access to observables complementary to solid-state experiments -- which is of particular interest for future studies of the enigmatic pseudogap phase appearing in cuprates.</description>

      <title>The quantum metric of electrons with spin-momentum locking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06659v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum materials are characterized by electromagnetic responses intrinsically linked to the geometry and topology of the electronic wavefunctions. These properties are encoded in the quantum metric and Berry curvature. While Berry curvature-mediated transport effects such as the anomalous and nonlinear Hall effects have been identified in several magnetic and nonmagnetic systems, quantum metric-induced transport phenomena remain limited to topological antiferromagnets. Here we show that spin-momentum locking -- a general characteristic of the electronic states at surfaces and interfaces of spin-orbit coupled materials -- leads to a finite quantum metric. This metric activates a nonlinear in-plane magnetoresistance that we measure and electrically control in 111-oriented LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ interfaces. These findings demonstrate the existence of quantum metric effects in a vast class of materials and provide new strategies to design functionalities based on the quantum geometry.</description>

      <title>What is the dual Ginzburg-Landau theory for holographic superconductors?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13956v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Holographic superconductors are holographic duals of superconductors. Macroscopically, a superconductor should be described by the Ginzburg-Landau (GL) theory. There is ample evidence that the holographic superconductors are described by the standard GL theory, but the exact form of the dual GL theory is little known. We identify the dual GL theory for a class of bulk 5-dimensional holographic superconductors, where numerical coefficients are obtained exactly.</description>

      <title>Full distribution of local observables in an exactly solvable current carrying steady state of a driven XXZ chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10458v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current carrying steady states of interacting spins chains exhibit rich structures generated through an interplay of current induced correlations and energetic constraints from the Hamiltonian. The XXZ spin chain when coupled to maximally polarizing Lindblad terms admits an exact solution in a matrix product state (MPS) form. We use this exact solution to study the correlations and distributions of simple local spin observables in the non equilibrium steady state (NESS). We present exact expressions for spin correlators, entropy per site, cumulant generating functions for distributions of local observables in the XX limit (Ising anisotropy $\Delta=0$). Further, we use the exact MPS solution in systems with $\Delta&gt;0$, to numerically exactly calculate the entropy, correlations, as well as distributions of spin observables in blocks as large as $n\sim 200$ sites allowing an estimation of the rate functions. The $z$ magnetization distribution is consistant with short range spin correlations in the $z$ direction while the $x$-magnetization shows a double peak structure at larger $\Delta$ suggesting short range ferromagnetic ordering. We find that the distribution of $z$-magnetization sharpens for parameters where the current is maximized.</description>
