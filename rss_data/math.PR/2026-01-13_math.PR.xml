      <title>Well-posedness of state-dependent rank-based interacting systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the existence and uniqueness of rank-based interacting systems of stochastic differential equations. These systems can be seen as modifications with state-dependent coefficients of the Atlas model in mathematical finance. The coefficients of the underlying SDEs are possibly discontinuous. We first establish strong well-posedness for a planar system with rank-dependent drift coefficients, and non-rank-dependent and non-uniformly elliptic diffusion coefficients. We then state weak well-posedness for two classes of high-dimensional rank-based interacting SDEs with elliptic diffusion coefficients. Finally, we address the positivity of solutions in the case where the diffusion coefficients vanish at zero.</description>

      <title>Integration of branched rough paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When the one-form is $Lip\left(\gamma-1\right) $ with $\gamma &gt;p\geq 1$, we construct the integral of a branched $p$-rough path, which defines another branched $p$-rough path. We derive a quantitative bound for this integral and prove that it depends continuously on the driving branched rough path in rough path metric. Moreover, we prove that the first level branched rough integral coincides with a first level integral of the associated $\Pi$-rough path.</description>

      <title>Splitting of Liftings in Product Spaces II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(X, \mfA,P)$ and $(Y, \mfB,Q)$ be two probability spaces, $R$ be their skew product on the product $\sigma$-algebra $\mfA\otimes\mfB$ and $\{(\mfA_y,S_y)\colon y\in{Y}\}$ be a $Q$-disintegration of $R$. Then let $\mfA\dd\mfB$ be the $\sigma$-algebra generated $\mfA\otimes\mfB$ and by the family $\mcM:=\{E\subset{X\times{Y}}\colon \exists\;N\in\mfB_0\;\forall\;y\notin{N}\;\wh{S_y}(E^y)=0\}$ and $\wh{R_{\dd}}$ be the extension of $R$ such that $\mcM$ becomes the family of $\wh{R_*}$-zero sets ($\wh{S_y}$ is the completion of $S_y$ and $\mfB_0=\{B\in\mfB: Q(B)=0\}$). We prove that there exist a lifting $\pi$ on $\mcL^{\infty}(\wh{R_{\dd}})$ and liftings $\sigma_y$ on $\mcL^{\infty}(\wh{S_y})$ , $y\in Y$, such that \[ [\pi(f)]^y= \sigma_y\Bigl([\pi(f)]^y\Bigr) \qquad\mbox{for every} \quad y\in Y\quad\mbox{and every}\quad f\in\mcL^{\infty}(\wh{R_{\dd}}). \] In case of a separable $P$ and in case when $R\ll{P}\times{Q}$ a characterization of stochastic processes possessing an equivalent measurable version is presented. The theorem is a generalization and correction of \cite[Theorem 3.8]{mu25}.</description>

      <title>On a stochastic Cahn-Hilliard-Brinkman model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a stochastic version of the Cahn-Hilliard-Brinkman model in a smooth two- or three-dimensional domain with dynamical boundary conditions. The system describes creeping two-phase flows and is basically a coupling of the Brinkman equation for the velocity field that governs the flow through the porous media coupled with convective Cahn-Hilliard equations for the phase field, both with two independent sources of randomness given by general multiplicative-type Wiener noises in the Cahn-Hilliard equations. The existence of a weak solution, both in the probabilistic and PDEs sense, is proved. Our construction of a solution is based on the classical Faedo-Galerkin approximation, the Yosida approximation and uses a compactness method. Our paper is the first attempt to generalize the paper \cite{Colli+Knopf+Schimperna+Signor_2024} to a stochastic setting.</description>

      <title>Generalized Space-Fractional Poisson Process via Variable-Order Stable Subordinator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a variable-order stable subordinator (VOSS) $S^{\alpha(t)}(t)$ with index $\alpha(t)\in(0,1)$, where $\alpha(t)$ is a right-continuous piecewise constant function. We drive the Generalized Space-Fractional Poisson Process via Variable-Order Stable Subordinator (GSFPP-VO) defined by $\{N(S^{\alpha(t)}(t))\}_{t \geq 0}$, obtained by time-changing a homogeneous Poisson process $\{N(t,\lambda)\}_{t\geq 0}$ with rate parameter $\lambda&gt;0$ by an independent VOSS. Explicit expressions for the Laplace transform, probability generating function, probability mass function, and moment generating function of the GSFPP-VO are derived, and these quantities are shown to satisfy partial differential equations. Finally, we establish the associated generalized distributions, analyze the hitting-time properties, and characterize the L\'evy measures of the GSFPP-VO.</description>

      <title>Explosion and non-explosion in pure birth Crump--Mode--Jagers branching processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this short note, we provide an explicit sufficient condition for non-explosion of Crump--Mode--Jagers branching processes with pure birth reproduction. It shows that the standard sufficient condition for explosion, namely the convergence of the series of reciprocals of the birth rates, is -- at least for rate sequences without excessive oscillations -- remarkably close to being necessary. At the same time, it is not necessary in full generality: we construct a counterexample which also yields a general preferential attachment tree without fitness with an infinite path and no vertices of infinite degree, thereby answering an open question previously raised in the literature.</description>

      <title>Surface Dean--Kawasaki equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider stochastic particle dynamics on hypersurfaces represented in Monge gauge parametrization. Starting from the underlying Langevin system, we derive the surface Dean-Kawasaki (DK) equation and formulate it in the martingale sense. The resulting SPDE explicitly reflects the geometry of the hypersurface through the induced metric and its differential operators. Our framework accommodates both pairwise interactions and environmental potentials, and we extend the analysis to evolving hypersurfaces driven by an SDE that interacts with the particles, yielding the corresponding surface DK equation for the coupled surface-particle system. We establish a weak uniqueness result in the non-interacting case, and we develop a finite-volume discretization preserving the fluctuation-dissipation relation. Numerical experiments illustrate equilibrium properties and dynamical behavior influenced by surface geometry and external potentials.</description>

      <title>Quantitative convergence rates for extended mean field games with volatility control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the convergence of symmetric stochastic differential games with interactions via control, where the volatility terms of both idiosyncratic and common noises are controlled. We apply the stochastic maximum principle, following the approach of Lauri\`{e}re and Tangpi, to reduce the convergence analysis to the study of forward-backward propagation of chaos. Under the standard monotonicity conditions, we derive quantitative convergence rates for open-loop Nash equilibria of $N$-player stochastic differential games toward the corresponding mean field equilibrium. As a prerequisite, we also establish the well-posedness of the conditional McKean--Vlasov forward-backward stochastic differential equations by the method of continuation. Moreover, we analyze a specific class of linear-quadratic settings to demonstrate the applicability of our main result.</description>

      <title>From Continuous to Discrete: a No-U-Turn Sampler for Permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a discrete-space analogue of the No-U-Turn sampler on the symmetric group $S_n$, yielding a locally adaptive and reversible Markov chain Monte Carlo method for $\mathrm{Mallows}(d,\sigma_0)$. Here $d:S_n\times S_n\to[0,\infty)$ is any fixed distance on $S_n$, $\sigma_0\in S_n$ is a fixed reference permutation, and the target distribution on $S_n$ has mass function $\pi(\sigma)\propto e^{-\beta d(\sigma,\sigma_0)}$ where $\beta&gt;0$ is the inverse temperature. The construction replaces Hamiltonian trajectories with measure-preserving group-orbit exploration. A randomized dyadic expansion is used to explore a one-dimensional orbit until a probabilistic \emph{no-underrun} criterion is met, after which the next state is sampled from the explored orbit with probability proportional to the target weights. On the theory side, embedding this transition within the Gibbs self-tuning (GIST) framework provides a concise proof of reversibility. Moreover, we construct a \emph{shift coupling} for orbit segments and prove an explicit edge-wise contraction in the Cayley distance under a mild Lipschitz condition on the energy $E(\sigma)=d(\sigma,\sigma_0)$. A path-coupling argument then yields an $O(n^2\log n)$ total-variation mixing-time bound.</description>

      <title>Large Deviations for the d'Arcais Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The d'Arcais polynomials $P_n(z)$ for $n\in\{0,1,\dots\}$ are defined as $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} P_n(z) q^n = \exp(-z\ln((q;q)_{\infty}))$ where the $q$-Pochhammer symbol is $(q;q)_{\infty} = \prod_{k=1}^{\infty} (1-q^k)$ for $|q|&lt;1$. Denoting the coefficients for $n \in \mathbb{N}$ by the formula $P_n(z) = \sum_{k=1}^{n} A(2,n,k) z^k/n!$, we prove that $k_n! A(2,n,k_n)/n!$ satisfies a Bahadur-Rao type large deviation formula in the limit $n \to \infty$ with $k_n/n \to \kappa \in [0,1)$ as long as $k_n \to \infty$. The large deviation rate function is the Legendre-Fenchel transform $g^*(-\kappa)$ where $g(\kappa) = f^{-1}(\kappa)$ for the function $f : (0,\infty) \to \mathbb{R}$ given by $f(y)= \ln(-\ln((e^{-y};e^{-y})_{\infty}))$. We relate this fact to information about the abundancy index.</description>

      <title>Minimum and extremal process for a branching random walk outside the boundary case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07129v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work extends the studies on the minimum and extremal process of a supercritical branching random walk outside the boundary case which cannot be reduced to the boundary case. We study here the situation where the log-generating function explodes at $1$ and the random walk associated to the spine possesses a stretched exponential tail with exponent $b\in(0,\frac12)$. Under suitable conditions, we confirm the conjecture of Barral, Hu and Madaule [Bernoulli 24(2) 2018 801-841], and obtain the weak convergence for the minimum and the extremal process. We also establish an a.s. infimum result over all infinity rays of this system.</description>

      <title>Approximate FKG inequalities for phase-bound spin systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The FKG inequality is an invaluable tool in monotone spin systems satisfying the FKG lattice condition, which provides positive correlations for all coordinate-wise increasing functions of spins. However, the FKG lattice condition is somewhat brittle and is not preserved when confining a spin system to a particular phase. For instance, consider the Curie-Weiss model, which is a model of a ferromagnet with two phases at low temperature corresponding to positive and negative overall magnetization. It is not a priori clear if each phase internally has positive correlations for increasing functions, or if the positive correlations in the model arise primarily from the global choice of positive or negative magnetization.
  In this article, we show that the individual phases do indeed satisfy an approximate form of the FKG inequality in a class of generalized higher-order Curie-Weiss models (including the standard Curie-Weiss model as a special case), as well as in ferromagnetic exponential random graph models (ERGMs). To cover both of these settings, we present a general result which allows for the derivation of such approximate FKG inequalities in a straightforward manner from inputs related to metastable mixing; we expect that this general result will be widely applicable. In addition, we derive some consequences of the approximate FKG inequality, including a version of a useful covariance inequality originally due to Newman as well as Bulinski and Shabanovich. We use this to extend the proof of the central limit theorem for ERGMs within a phase at low temperatures, due to the second author, to the non-forest phase-coexistence regime, answering a question posed by Bianchi, Collet, and Magnanini for the edge-triangle model.</description>

      <title>Local linearization for the nonlinear damped stochastic Klein-Gordon equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the $1+1$ dimensional nonlinear damped stochastic Klein-Gordon equation driven by space-time white noise, we prove that the second-order increments of the solution can be approximated, after scaling with the diffusion coefficient, by those of the corresponding linearized stochastic Klein-Gordon equation. This extends the result of Huang et al. \cite{HOO2024} for the stochastic wave equation. A key difficulty arises from the more complex structure of the Green function, which we overcome by means of subtle analytical estimates. As applications, we analyze the quadratic variation of the solution and construct a consistent estimator for the diffusion parameter.</description>

      <title>On Limiting Behaviour of Moves in Multidimensional Elephant Random Walk with Stops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we discuss the number of moves in multidimensional elephant random walk with stops (MERWS). We obtain the conditional mean increments of the number of moves. Using this conditional result, a recursive relation for the expected number of moves of MERWS is derived and a multiplicative martingale is constructed. The asymptotic behaviour of the solution of this recursive relation is discussed. Later, we discuss several convergence results for the number of moves that include the law of large numbers and law of iterated logarithm.</description>

      <title>The value of random zero-sum games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the value of a two-player zero-sum game on a random matrix $M\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times m}$, defined by $v(M) = \min_{x\in\Delta_n}\max_{y\in \Delta_m}x^T M y$. In the setting where $n=m$ and $M$ has i.i.d. standard Gaussian entries, we prove that the standard deviation of $v(M)$ is of order $\frac{1}{n}$. This confirms an experimental conjecture dating back to the 1980s. We also investigate the case where $M$ is a rectangular Gaussian matrix with $m = n+\lambda\sqrt{n}$, showing that the expected value of the game is of order $\frac{\lambda}{n}$, as well as the case where $M$ is a random orthogonal matrix. Our techniques are based on probabilistic arguments and convex geometry. We argue that the study of random games could shed new light on various problems in theoretical computer science.</description>

      <title>Critical level-set percolation on finite graphs and spectral gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the bond percolation on finite graphs induced by the level-sets of zero-average Gaussian free field on the associated metric graph above a given height (level) parameter $h \in \mathbb{R}$. We characterize the near- and off-critical phases of this model for any expanders family $\mathcal{G}_n = (V_n, E_n)$ with uniformly bounded degrees. In particular, we show that the volume of the largest open cluster at level $h_n$ is of the order $|V_n|^{\frac23}$ when $h_n$ lies in the corresponding critical window which we identify as $|h_n| = O(|V_n|^{-\frac13})$. Outside this window, the volume starts to deviate from $\Theta(|V_n|^{\frac23})$ culminating into a linear order in the supercritical phase $h_n = h &lt; 0$ (the giant component) and a logarithmic order in the subcritical phase $h_n = h &gt; 0$. We deduce these from effective estimates on tail probabilities for the maximum volume of an open cluster at any level $h$ for a generic base graph $\mathcal{G}$. The estimates depend on $\mathcal{G}$ only through its size and upper and lower bounds on its degrees and spectral gap respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first instance where a mean-field critical behavior is derived under such general setup for finite graphs. The generality of these estimates preclude any local approximation of $\mathcal{G}$ by regular infinite trees -- a standard approach in the area. Instead, our methods rely on exploiting the connection between spectral gap of the graph $\mathcal{G}$ and its connection to the level-sets of zero-average Gaussian free field mediated via a set function we call the zero-average capacity.</description>

      <title>Supercritical long-range percolation on graphs of polynomial growth: the truncated one-arm exponent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider supercritical long-range percolation on transitive graphs of polynomial growth. In this model, any two vertices $x$ and $y$ of the underlying graph $G$ connect by a direct edge with probability $1-\exp(-\beta J(x,y))$, where $J(x,y)$ is a function that is invariant under the automorphism group of $G$, and we assume that $J$ decays polynomially with the graph distance between $x$ and $y$. We give up-to-constant bounds on the decay of the radius of finite cluster for $\beta &gt; \beta_c$. In the same setting, we also give upper and lower bounds on the tail volume of finite clusters. The upper and lower bounds are of matching order, conjecturally on sharp volume bounds for spheres in transitive graphs of polynomial growth. As a corollary, we obtain a lower bound on the anchored isoperimetric dimension of the infinite component.</description>

      <title>Local Density of Activated Random Walk on $\mathbb{Z}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider one-dimensional activated random walk (ARW) on $\mathbb{Z}$ started from a `point source' initial condition, with many particles at the origin and no other particles. We prove that, uniformly throughout a macroscopic window around the source, the probability that a site contains a sleeping particle after the configuration is stabilized is approximately the critical density. This represents a first step towards understanding the local structure of the critical stationary measure for ARW.</description>

      <title>A Clarifying Note on Long-Horizon Investment and Dollar-Cost Averaging: An Effective Investment Exposure Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is widely claimed in investment education and practice that extending the investment horizon reduces risk, and that diversifying investment timing, for example through dollar-cost averaging (DCA), further mitigates investment risk. Although such claims are intuitively appealing, they are often stated without precise definitions of risk or a clear separation between risk and uncertainty.
  This paper revisits these two beliefs within a unified probabilistic framework. We define risk at the expectation level as a property of the generating distribution of cumulative investment outcomes, and distinguish it from uncertainty, understood as the dispersion of realized outcomes across possible paths. To enable meaningful comparisons across horizons and investment schedules, we introduce the notion of effective investment exposure, defined as time-integrated invested capital.
  Under stationary return processes with finite variance, we show that extending the investment horizon does not alter expected risk, expected return, or the risk-return ratio on a per-unit-exposure basis. In contrast, different investment timing strategies can induce distinct exposure profiles over time. As a result, lump-sum investment and dollar-cost averaging may differ not only in uncertainty but also in expected risk when compared at equal return exposure, although the resulting risk differences are of constant order and do not grow with the investment horizon.
  These results clarify why common narratives surrounding long-horizon investment and dollar-cost averaging are conceptually misleading, while also explaining why adopting such strategies under budgetary or timing constraints need not be regarded as irrational.</description>

      <title>Eigenvalues of $p$-adic random matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop the basic theory of eigenvalues of $p$-adic random matrices, analogous to the classical theory for random matrices over $\mathbb{R}$ and $\mathbb{C}$. Such eigenvalue statistics were proposed as a model for the zeroes of $p$-adic $L$-functions by Ellenberg-Jain-Venkatesh, who computed the limiting distribution of the number of eigenvalues in a unit disc. We compute the full joint distribution of the $n$ eigenvalues of an $n \times n$ matrix with Haar distribution, obtaining Coulomb gas type formulas as in the archimedean case, with Vandermonde terms leading to eigenvalue repulsion.
  From these Coulomb gas density functions we derive asymptotics of eigenvalue statistics as $n \to \infty$. These include exact computations, such as a closed form
  $$\rho(x,y) = 1 - \theta_3(-\sqrt{p};||x-y||^2/p)$$
  for the limiting pair correlation of eigenvalues in $\mathbb{Z}_p$, and similar results in quadratic extensions. Such formulas yield concrete numerical predictions on zeroes of $p$-adic $L$-functions.
  For eigenvalues in arbitrary extensions of $\mathbb{Q}_p$ we also give precise estimates on their pair-repulsion and expected number of eigenvalues in each extension. Finally, we compute the asymptotic probability that all eigenvalues lie in $\mathbb{Z}_p$.
  Our proofs combine results from several distinct areas: $p$-adic orbital integrals, roots of random $p$-adic polynomials, the Sawin-Wood moment method for random modules, and Markov chains associated with measures on integer partitions.</description>

      <title>Reduction and classification of higher-order Markov chains for categorical data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Categorical time series models are powerful tools for understanding natural phenomena. Most available models can be formulated as special cases of $m$-th order Markov chains, for $m\geq 1$. Despite their broad applicability, theoretical research has largely focused on first-order Markov chains, mainly because many properties of higher-order chains can be analyzed by reducing them to first-order chains on an enlarged alphabet. However, the resulting first-order representation is sparse and possesses a highly structured transition kernel, a feature that has not been fully exploited.
  In this work, we study finite-alphabet Markov chains with arbitrary memory length and introduce a new reduction framework for their structural classification. We define the skeleton of a transition kernel, an object that captures the intrinsic pattern of transition probability constraints in a higher-order Markov chain.
  We show that the class structure of a binary matrix associated with the skeleton completely determines the recurrent classes and their periods in the original chain. We also provide an explicit algorithm for efficiently extracting the skeleton, which in many cases yields substantial computational savings. Applications include simple criteria for irreducibility and essential irreducibility of higher-order Markov chains and a concrete illustration based on a 10th-order Markov chain.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Models with Heavy-Tailed Targets: Score Estimation and Sampling Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Score-based diffusion models have become a powerful framework for generative modeling, with score estimation as a central statistical bottleneck. Existing guarantees for score estimation largely focus on light-tailed targets or rely on restrictive assumptions such as compact support, which are often violated by heavy-tailed data in practice. In this work, we study conventional (Gaussian) score-based diffusion models when the target distribution is heavy-tailed and belongs to a Sobolev class with smoothness parameter $\beta&gt;0$. We consider both exponential and polynomial tail decay, indexed by a tail parameter $\gamma$. Using kernel density estimation, we derive sharp minimax rates for score estimation, revealing a qualitative dichotomy: under exponential tails, the rate matches the light-tailed case up to polylogarithmic factors, whereas under polynomial tails the rate depends explicitly on $\gamma$. We further provide sampling guarantees for the associated continuous reverse dynamics. In total variation, the generated distribution converges at the minimax optimal rate $n^{-\beta/(2\beta+d)}$ under exponential tails (up to logarithmic factors), and at a $\gamma$-dependent rate under polynomial tails. Whether the latter sampling rate is minimax optimal remains an open question. These results characterize the statistical limits of score estimation and the resulting sampling accuracy for heavy-tailed targets, extending diffusion theory beyond the light-tailed setting.</description>

Abstract: Inspired by the Erd\H{o}s R\'enyi model, we propose a new model for freesquare random monomial ideals generated by edges and covers of a graph. This permit us to investigate the conditions of normality for which we obtain asymptotic results. We also elaborate on asymptotic results for other invariants such as the Krull dimension (for which we obtain threshold function), the regularity and the $v$-number.</description>

      <title>Extensions of the solidarity principle of the spectral gap for Gibbs samplers to their blocked and collapsed variants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.06745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Connections of a spectral nature are formed between Gibbs samplers and their blocked and collapsed variants. The solidarity principle of the spectral gap for full Gibbs samplers is generalized to different cycles and mixtures of Gibbs steps. This generalized solidarity principle is employed to establish that every cycle and mixture of Gibbs steps, which includes blocked Gibbs samplers and collapsed Gibbs samplers, inherits a spectral gap from a full Gibbs sampler. Exact relations between the spectra corresponding to blocked and collapsed variants of a Gibbs sampler are also established. An example is given to show that a blocked or collapsed Gibbs sampler does not in general inherit geometric ergodicity or a spectral gap from another blocked or collapsed Gibbs sampler.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.06830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A novel framework for density estimation under expectation constraints is proposed. The framework minimizes the Wasserstein distance between the estimated density and a prior, subject to the constraints that the expected value of a set of functions adopts or exceeds given values. The framework is generalized to include regularization inequalities to mitigate the artifacts in the target measure. An annealing-like algorithm is developed to address non-smooth constraints, with its effectiveness demonstrated through both synthetic and proof-of-concept real world examples in finance.</description>

Abstract: We study discrete-time Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) on finite state-action spaces and analyze the stability of optimal policies and value functions in the long-run discounted risk-sensitive objective setting. Our analysis addresses robustness with respect to perturbations of the risk-aversion parameter and the discount factor, the emergence of ultimate stationarity, and the interaction between discounted and averaged formulations under suitable mixing assumptions. We further investigate limiting regimes associated with vanishing discount and vanishing risk sensitivity, and discuss the role of Blackwell-type stability properties in the discounted setting. Finally, we provide numerical illustrations that highlight the intrinsic non-stationarity of optimal discounted risk-sensitive policies.</description>

      <title>The Greedy Algorithm for Dissociated Sets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A set $\mathcal S\subset \mathbb N$ is said to be a \textit{subset-sum-distinct} or \textit{dissociated} if all of its finite subsets have different sums. Alternately, an equivalent classification is if any equality of the form $$\sum_{s\in \mathcal S} \varepsilon_s \cdot s =0$$ where $\varepsilon_s \in \{-1,0,+1\}$ implies that all the $\varepsilon_s$'s are $0$. For a dissociated set $\mathcal S$, we prove that for $c_\ast = \frac 12 \log_2 \left(\frac \pi 2\right)$ and any $c_\ast-1&lt;C&lt;c_\ast$, we have $$\mathcal S(n) \,:=\, \mathcal S\cap [1,n] \,\le\, \log_2 n +\frac 12 \log_2\log_2 n + C$$ for all $n\in \mathcal N_C$ with asymptotic density $\mathbf d\left(\mathcal N_C\right)=2-2^{c_\ast-C}$. Further, we consider the greedy algorithm for generating these sets and prove that this algorithm always eventually doubles. Finally, we also consider some generalizations of dissociated sets and prove similar results about them.</description>

      <title>Dynamic redundancy and mortality in stochastic search</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Search processes are a fundamental part of natural and artificial systems. In such settings, the number of searchers is rarely constant: new agents may be recruited while others can abandon the search. Despite the ubiquity of these dynamics, their combined influence on search efficiency remains unexplored. Here we present a general framework for stochastic search in which independent agents progressively join and leave the process, a mechanism we term \emph{dynamic redundancy and mortality} (DRM). Under minimal assumptions on the underlying search dynamics, this framework yields exact first-passage time statistics. It further reveals surprising connections to stochastic resetting, including a regime in which the resetting mean first-passage time emerges as a universal lower bound for DRM, as well as regimes in which DRM search is faster. We illustrate our results through a detailed analysis of one-dimensional Brownian DRM search. Altogether, this work provides a rigorous foundation for studying first-passage processes with a fluctuating number of searchers, with direct relevance across physical, biological, and algorithmic systems.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Breaking, Hysteresis, and Convergence to the Mean Voter in two-party Spatial Competition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical spatial models of two-party competition typically predict convergence to the median voter, yet real-world party systems often exhibit persistent and asymmetric polarization. We develop a spatial model of two-party competition in which voters evaluate parties through general satisfaction functions, and a width parameter $q$ captures how tolerant they are of ideological distance. This parameter governs the balance between centripetal and centrifugal incentives and acts as the bifurcation parameter governing equilibrium configurations. Under mild regularity assumptions, we characterize Nash equilibria through center-distance coordinates, which separate the endogenous political center from polarization. When the voter density is symmetric, the reduced equilibrium condition exhibits a generic supercritical pitchfork bifurcation at a critical value $q_{c}$. Above $q_{c}$, the unique stable equilibrium features convergence to the center, recovering the classical median voter result, whereas below it two symmetric polarized equilibria arise. Asymmetry in the voter distribution unfolds the pitchfork, producing drift in the endogenous center and asymmetric polarized equilibria. The resulting equilibrium diagram has an S-shaped geometry that generates hysteresis, allowing polarization to persist even after tolerance returns to levels that would support convergence in a symmetric environment. In the high-tolerance regime, we show that the unique non-polarized equilibrium converges to the mean of the voter distribution, while the median is recovered only under symmetry. Hence, unlike the Hotelling--Downs model, where convergence to the median is universal, the median voter appears here as an asymptotic benchmark rather than a robust predictor.</description>

Abstract: Group testing enables the identification of a small subset of defective items within a larger population by performing tests on pools of items rather than on each item individually. Over the years, it has not only attracted attention from the academic community, but has also demonstrated its potential in addressing real-world problems such as infectious disease screening, drug discovery and manufacturing quality control. With the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, interest in group testing has grown further, particularly in non-adaptive testing, due to its time efficiency compared to adaptive approaches. This highlights the importance of improving the performance currently achievable in such a scheme. This article focuses on advancing the field of noiseless non-adaptive group testing. The main objective of this work is to study and maximize the probability of successfully identifying the subset of defective items while performing as few tests as possible. To this end, we first note current well-known decoding algorithms, as well as established test design strategies for assigning items to pools. From this review, we identify key opportunities for improvement that inform the development of new decoding algorithms. Specifically, we propose a novel method, Weighted Sequential Combinatorial Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (W-SCOMP), to enhance the efficiency of existing detection procedures. Theoretical results demonstrate that W-SCOMP outperforms other algorithms in noiseless non-adaptive group testing. Furthermore, we develop a simulation framework to model the group testing process and conduct comparative evaluations between the proposed and existing algorithms. The empirical results are consistent with the theoretical findings. Overall, our work expands the range of available decoding algorithms and contributes to the broader understanding of noiseless non-adaptive group testing.</description>

      <title>The random stable roommates problem typically has no solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Assume that $n = 2k$ potential roommates each have an ordered preference of the $n-1$ others. A stable matching is a perfect matching of the $n$ roommates in which no two unmatched people prefer each other to their matched partners. In their seminal 1962 stable marriage paper, Gale and Shapley noted that not every instance of the stable roommates problem admits a stable matching. In the case when the preferences are chosen uniformly at random, Gusfield and Irving predicted in 1989 that there is no stable matching with high probability for large $n$. We prove this conjecture and show that for $n$ sufficiently large, the probability there is a stable matching is at most $n^{-1/17}$.</description>

      <title>Anticoncentration of random spanning trees in almost regular graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The celebrated formula of Otter \emph{[Ann. of Math. (2) 49 (1948), 583--599]} asserts that the complete graph contains exponentially many non-isomorphic spanning trees. In this paper, we show that every connected almost regular graph with sufficiently large degree already contains exponentially many non-isomorphic spanning trees. Indeed, we prove a stronger statement: for every fixed $n$-vertex tree $T$, $$
  \Pr\bigl[\mathcal{T} \simeq_{\mathrm{iso}} T\bigr] = e^{-\Omega(n)}, $$ where $\mathcal{T}$ is a uniformly random spanning tree of a connected $n$-vertex almost regular graph with sufficiently large degree. To prove this, we introduce a graph-theoretic variant of the classical balls--into--bins model, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Dimension reduction for path signatures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14723v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the mathematical framework for reducing the complexity of models using path signatures. The structure of these signatures, which can be interpreted as collections of iterated integrals along paths, is discussed and their applications in areas such as stochastic differential equations (SDEs) and financial modeling are pointed out. In particular, exploiting the rough paths view, solutions of SDEs continuously depend on the lift of the driver. Such continuous mappings can be approximated using (truncated) signatures, which are solutions of high-dimensional linear systems. In order to lower the complexity of these models, this paper presents methods for reducing the order of high-dimensional truncated signature models while retaining essential characteristics. The derivation of reduced models and the universal approximation property of (truncated) signatures are treated in detail. Numerical examples, including applications to the (rough) Bergomi model in financial markets, illustrate the proposed reduction techniques and highlight their effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Additive processes on the real line and Loewner chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18742v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates additive processes with respect to several different independences in non-commutative probability in terms of the convolution hemigroups of the distributions of the increments of the processes. In particular, we focus on the relation of monotone convolution hemigroups and chordal Loewner chains, a special kind of family of conformal mappings. Generalizing the celebrated Loewner differential equation, we introduce the concept of ``generator'' for a class of Loewner chains. The locally uniform convergence of Loewner chains is then equivalent to a suitable convergence of generators. Using generators, we define homeomorphisms between the aforementioned class of chordal Loewner chains, the set of monotone convolution hemigroups with finite second moment, and the set of classical convolution hemigroups on the real line with finite second moment. Moreover, we define similar homeomorphisms between classical, free, and boolean convolution hemigroups on the real line, but without any assumptions on the moments.</description>

      <title>The multi-level friendship paradox for sparse random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17724v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In Hazra, den Hollander and Parvaneh (2025) we analysed the friendship paradox for sparse random graphs. For four classes of random graphs we characterised the empirical distribution of the friendship biases between vertices and their neighbours at distance $1$, proving convergence as $n\to\infty$ to a limiting distribution, with $n$ the number of vertices, and identifying moments and tail exponents of the limiting distribution. In the present paper we look at the multi-level friendship bias between vertices and their neighbours at distance $k \in \mathbb{N}$ obtained via a $k$-step exploration according to a backtracking or a non-backtracking random walk. We identify the limit of empirical distribution of the multi-level friendship biases as $n\to\infty$ and/or $k\to\infty$. We show that for non-backtracking exploration the two limits commute for a large class of sparse random graphs, including those that locally converge to a rooted Galton-Watson tree. In particular, we show that the same limit arises when $k$ depends on $n$, i.e., $k=k_n$, provided $\lim_{n\to\infty} k_n = \infty$ under some mild conditions. We exhibit cases where the two limits do not commute and show the relevance of the mixing time of the exploration.</description>

Abstract: This paper considers the orthogonal expansion of the fractional Brownian motion relative to the Legendre polynomials. Such an expansion has not only theoretical but also practical interest, since it can be applied to approximate and simulate the fractional Brownian motion in continuous time. The relations for the mean square approximation error are presented, and a comparison with the previously obtained result is carried out.</description>

Abstract: We discuss the relationship between the capacity and the geometry for the range of the random walk for $d=3$. In particular, we consider how efficiently the random walk moves or what shape it forms in order to maximize its capacity. In one of our main results, we show a functional law for the capacity of the random walk. In addition, we find that there is a phase transition for the asymptotics of the capacity of the random walk when we condition the diameter of the random walk.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13712v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically and computationally investigate long-memory processes based on the Markovian lifts of affine jump-diffusion processes. A nominal superposition process consisting of an infinite number of interacting affine processes is considered, along with its finite-dimensional version and associated generalized Riccati equations. We propose a splitting scheme suited to the Markovian lifts where jump and diffusion parts are dealt with separately based on recently developed exact discretization methods. We examine the computational performance of the scheme through comparisons with the analytical results. We also numerically investigate a more complex model arising in the environmental sciences and some extended cases in which superposed processes belong to a class of nonlinear processes that generalize affine processes.</description>

      <title>Second Order Properties of Thinned Counts in Finite Birth--Death Processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20174v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper studies the counting process arising as a subset of births and deaths in a birth--death process on a finite state space. Whenever a birth or death occurs, the process is incremented or not depending on the outcome of an independent Bernoulli experiment whose probability is a state-dependent function of the birth and death and also depends on whether it is a birth or death that has occurred. We establish a formula for the asymptotic variance rate of this process, also presented as the ratio of the asymptotic variance and the asymptotic mean. Several examples including queueing models illustrate the scope of applicability of the results. An analogous formula for the countably infinite state space is conjectured and tested.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15772v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We to define a Path Integral in Lorentzian time by restricting the relevant domain of integration on $C([0,1],M)$ over a Riemannian configuration manifold $(M,g)$ and considering the dynamics of a particle evolving between to fixed endpoints with a referential non-degenerate classical trajectory, formulating a framework around a quadratic Lagrangian. Through fibration, we reduce the infinite-dimensional space under consideration to an $L^2$-isometric flux spaces in which we consider a stochastic process associated to a Gaussian measure. The Path Integral is subsequently defined as an expectation value with respect to the Gaussian measure, allowing us to rigorously formulate the former as a functional integral. We prove mathematical correspondence between the Stochastic Path Integral and the Euclidean Path Integral theory formulated rigorously under the Feynman-Kac theorem.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates a local central limit theorem for a normalized sequence of random variables belonging to a fixed order Wiener chaos and converging to the standard normal distribution. We prove, without imposing any additional conditions, that the optimal rate of convergence of their density functions to the standard normal density in the Sobolev space $W^{k,r}(\mathbb{R})$, for every $k \in \mathbb{N} \cup \{0\}$ and $r \in [1,\infty]$, is determined by the maximum of the absolute values of their third and fourth cumulants. We also obtain exact asymptotics for this convergence under an additional assumption. Our approach is based on Malliavin--Stein techniques combined with tools from the theory of generalized functionals in Malliavin calculus.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09123v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the two-dimensional analogue of the asymptotics for Toeplitz determinants with Fisher-Hartwig singularities, for general real symbols. This formula has applications to random normal matrices with complex spectra: (i) the characteristic polynomial converges to a Gaussian multiplicative chaos random measure on the limiting droplet, in the subcritical phase; (ii) the electric potential converges pointwise to a logarithmically correlated field; (iii) the measure of its level sets (i.e. thick points) is identified; (iv) the associated free energy undergoes a freezing transition.
  This establishes emergence of the Liouville quantum gravity measure from free fermions in 2d, and universality with respect to the external potential.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13648v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a stochastic analysis of the sine-Gordon Euclidean quantum field $(\cos (\beta \varphi))_2$ on the full space up to the second threshold, i.e. for $\beta^2 &lt; 6 \pi$. The basis of our method is a forward-backward stochastic differential equation (FBSDE) for a decomposition $(X_t)_{t \geqslant 0}$ of the interacting Euclidean field $X_{\infty}$ along a scale parameter $t \geqslant 0$. This FBSDE describes the optimiser of the stochastic control representation of the Euclidean QFT introduced by Barashkov and one of the authors. We show that the FBSDE provides a description of the interacting field without cut-offs and that it can be used effectively to study the sine-Gordon measure to obtain results about large deviations, integrability, decay of correlations for local observables, singularity with respect to the free field, Osterwalder-Schrader axioms and other properties.</description>

      <title>Improved performance guarantees for Tukey's median</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00219v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Is there a natural way to order data in dimension greater than one? The approach based on the notion of data depth, often associated with John Tukey, is among the most popular. Tukey's depth has found applications in robust statistics, graph theory, and the study of elections and social choice. We present improved performance guarantees for empirical Tukey's median, a deepest point associated with a given sample, when the data-generating distribution is elliptically symmetric and possibly anisotropic. Some of our results remain valid in the wider class of affine equivariant estimators. As a corollary of our bounds, we show that the typical diameter of the set of all empirical Tukey's medians scales like $o(n^{-1/2})$ where $n$ is the sample size. Moreover, when the data follow the bivariate normal distribution, we prove that with high probability, the diameter is of order $O(n^{-3/4}\log^{1/2}(n))$. On the technical side, we show how affine equivariance can be leveraged to improve concentration bounds; moreover, we develop sharp strong approximation results for empirical processes indexed by halfspaces that could be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Fluctuations in Various Regimes of Non-Hermiticity and a Holographic Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15854v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The variance of the number of particles in a set is an important quantity in understanding the statistics of non-interacting fermionic systems in low dimensions. An exact map of their ground state in a harmonic trap in one and two dimensions to the classical Gaussian unitary and complex Ginibre ensemble, respectively, allows to determine the counting statistics at finite and infinite system size. We will establish two new results in this setup. First, we uncover an interpolating central limit theorem between known results in one and two dimensions, for linear statistics of the elliptic Ginibre ensemble. We find an entire range of interpolating weak non-Hermiticity limits, given by a two-parameter family for the mesoscopic scaling regime. Second, we considerably generalize the proportionality between the number variance and the entanglement entropy between Fermions in a set $A$ and its complement in two dimensions. Previously known only for rotationally invariant sets and external potentials, we prove a holographic principle for general non-rotationally invariant sets and random normal matrices. It states that both number variance and entanglement entropy are proportional to the circumference of $A$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20607v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the Potts spin glass with additional ferromagnetic interaction parametrized by $t$. It has long been observed that the Potts color symmetry breaking for the spin glass order parameter is closely related to the ferromagnetic phase transition. To clarify this, we identify a single critical value $t_\mathrm{c}$, which marks the onset of both color symmetry breaking and the transition to ferromagnetism.</description>

      <title>Nondeterministic Behaviours in Double Categorical Systems Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02517v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we build double theories capturing the idea of nondeterministic behaviors and trajectories. Following Libkind and Myers' Double Operadic Theory of Systems, we construct monoidal semi double categories of interfaces, along with what we call semimodules of systems, in the case of Moore machines, working with Markov categories with conditionals to handle nondeterminism. We use conditional products in these Markov categories to define trajectories in a compositional way, and represent nondeterministic systems using Markov maps; channels between systems are assumed to be deterministic.</description>

      <title>A new measure of dependence: Integrated $R^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18146v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel measure of dependence that captures the extent to which a random variable $Y$ is determined by a random vector $X$. The measure equals zero precisely when $Y$ and $X$ are independent, and it attains one exactly when $Y$ is almost surely a measurable function of $X$. We further extend this framework to define a measure of conditional dependence between $Y$ and $X$ given $Z$. We propose a simple and interpretable estimator with computational complexity comparable to classical correlation coefficients, including those of Pearson, Spearman, and Chatterjee. Leveraging this dependence measure, we develop a tuning-free, model-agnostic variable selection procedure and establish its consistency under appropriate sparsity conditions. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real datasets highlight the strong empirical performance of our methodology and demonstrate substantial gains over existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Efficient Online Random Sampling via Randomness Recycling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18879v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article studies the fundamental problem of using i.i.d. coin tosses from an entropy source to efficiently generate random variables $X_i \sim P_i$ $(i \ge 1)$, where $(P_1, P_2, \dots)$ is a random sequence of rational discrete probability distributions subject to an \textit{arbitrary} stochastic process. Our method achieves an amortized expected entropy cost within $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ bits of the information-theoretically optimal Shannon lower bound using $O(\log(1/\varepsilon))$ space. This result holds both pointwise in terms of the Shannon information content conditioned on $X_i$ and $P_i$, and in expectation to obtain a rate of $\mathbb{E}[H(P_1) + \dots + H(P_n)]/n + \varepsilon$ bits per sample as $n \to \infty$ (where $H$ is the Shannon entropy). The combination of space, time, and entropy properties of our method improves upon the Knuth and Yao (1976) entropy-optimal algorithm and Han and Hoshi (1997) interval algorithm for online sampling, which require unbounded space. It also uses exponentially less space than the more specialized methods of Kozen and Soloviev (2022) and Shao and Wang (2025) that generate i.i.d. samples from a fixed distribution. Our online sampling algorithm rests on a powerful algorithmic technique called \textit{randomness recycling}, which reuses a fraction of the random information consumed by a probabilistic algorithm to reduce its amortized entropy cost.
  On the practical side, we develop randomness recycling techniques to accelerate a variety of prominent sampling algorithms. We show that randomness recycling enables state-of-the-art runtime performance on the Fisher-Yates shuffle when using a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator, and that it reduces the entropy cost of discrete Gaussian sampling. Accompanying the manuscript is a performant software library in the C programming language.</description>

      <title>Simulating Posterior Bayesian Neural Networks with Dependent Weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22095v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider fully connected and feedforward deep neural networks with dependent and possibly heavy-tailed weights, as introduced in Lee et al. 2023, to address limitations of the standard Gaussian prior. It has been proved in Lee et al. 2023 that, as the number of nodes in the hidden layers grows large, according to a sequential and ordered limit, the law of the output converges weakly to a Gaussian mixture. Among our results, we present sufficient conditions on the model parameters (the activation function and the associated L\'evy measures) which ensure that the sequential limit is independent of the order. Next, we study the neural network through the lens of the posterior distribution with a Gaussian likelihood. If the random covariance matrix of the infinite-width limit is positive definite under the prior, we identify the posterior distribution of the output in the wide-width limit according to a sequential regime. Remarkably, we provide mild sufficient conditions to ensure the aforementioned invertibility of the random covariance matrix under the prior, thereby extending the results in L. Carvalho et al. 2025. We illustrate our findings using numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Time-complexity of sampling from a multimodal distribution using sequential Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02763v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a sequential Monte Carlo algorithm to sample from the Gibbs measure with a non-convex energy function at a low temperature. We use the practical and popular geometric annealing schedule, and use a Langevin diffusion at each temperature level. The Langevin diffusion only needs to run for a time that is long enough to ensure local mixing within energy valleys, which is much shorter than the time required for global mixing. Our main result shows convergence of Monte Carlo estimators with time complexity that, approximately, scales like the fourth power of the inverse temperature, and the square of the inverse allowed error. We also study this algorithm in an illustrative model scenario where more explicit estimates can be given.</description>

      <title>Infinitesimal moments in free and c-free probability and Motzkin paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22700v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Infinitesimal moments associated with infinitesimal freeness and infinitesimal conditional freeness are studied. For free random variables, we consider continuous deformations of moment functionals associated with Motzkin paths $w$, which provide a decomposition of their moments, and we compute their derivatives at zero. We show that the first-order derivative of each functional vanishes unless the path has exactly one local maximum. Geometrically, this means that $w$ is a pyramid path, which is consistent with the characteristic formula for alternating moments of infinitesimally free centered random variables. In this framework, infinitesimal Boolean independence is also obtained and it corresponds to flat paths. A similar approach is developed for infinitesimal conditional freeness, for which we show that the only moment functionals that have a non-zero first-order derivative are associated with concatenations of a pyramid path and a flat path. This charaterization leads to a Leibniz-type definition of infinitesimal conditional freeness at the level of moments.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Control Methods for Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01248v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate a stochastic control framework for global optimization over both Euclidean spaces and the Wasserstein space of probability measures, where the objective function may be non-convex and/or non-differentiable. In the Euclidean setting, the original minimization problem is approximated by a family of regularized stochastic control problems; using dynamic programming, we analyze the associated Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman equations and obtain tractable representations via the Cole--Hopf transformation and the Feynman--Kac formula. For optimization over probability measures, we formulate a regularized mean-field control problem characterized by a master equation, and further approximate it by controlled $N$-particle systems. We establish that, as the regularization parameter tends to zero (and as the particle number tends to infinity for the optimization over probability measures), the value of the control problem converges to the global minimum of the original objective. Building on the resulting probabilistic representations, Monte Carlo-based numerical schemes are proposed and numerical experiments are reported to illustrate the effectiveness of the methods and to support the theoretical convergence rates.</description>
