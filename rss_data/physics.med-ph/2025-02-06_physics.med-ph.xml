      <title>Quality assurance and reporting for FLASH clinical trials:the experience of the FEATHER trial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Research on ultra-high dose rate (UHDR) radiation therapy has indicated its potential to spare normal tissue while maintaining equivalent tumor control compared to conventional treatments. First clinical trials are underway. The randomized phase II/III FEATHER clinical trial at the Paul Scherrer Institute in collaboration with the University of Zurich Animal Hospital is one of the first curative domestic animal trials to be attempted, and it is designed to provide a good example for human trials. However, the lack of standardized quality assurance (QA) guidelines for FLASH clinical trials presents a significant challenge in trial design. This work aims to demonstrate the development and testing of QA and reporting procedures implemented in the FEATHER clinical trial. We have expanded the clinical QA program to include UHDR-specific QA and additional patient-specific QA. Furthermore, we have modified the monitor readout to enable time-resolved measurements, allowing delivery log files to be used for dose and dose rate recalculations. Finally, we developed a reporting strategy encompassing relevant parameters for retrospective studies. We evaluated our QA and reporting procedures with simulated treatments. This testing confirmed that our QA procedures effectively ensure the correct and safe delivery of the planned dose. Additionally, we demonstrated that we could reconstruct the delivered dose and dose rate using the delivery log files. We developed and used in practice a comprehensive QA and reporting protocol for a FLASH clinical trial at the Paul Scherrer Institute. This work aims to establish guidelines and standardize reporting practices for future advancements in the FLASH-RT field.</description>

      <title>When are Diffusion Priors Helpful in Sparse Reconstruction? A Study with Sparse-view CT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on image generation, and are gaining traction for sparse medical image reconstruction tasks. However, compared to classical reconstruction algorithms relying on simple analytical priors, diffusion models have the dangerous property of producing realistic looking results \emph{even when incorrect}, particularly with few observations. We investigate the utility of diffusion models as priors for image reconstruction by varying the number of observations and comparing their performance to classical priors (sparse and Tikhonov regularization) using pixel-based, structural, and downstream metrics. We make comparisons on low-dose chest wall computed tomography (CT) for fat mass quantification. First, we find that classical priors are superior to diffusion priors when the number of projections is ``sufficient''. Second, we find that diffusion priors can capture a large amount of detail with very few observations, significantly outperforming classical priors. However, they fall short of capturing all details, even with many observations. Finally, we find that the performance of diffusion priors plateau after extremely few ($\approx$10-15) projections. Ultimately, our work highlights potential issues with diffusion-based sparse reconstruction and underscores the importance of further investigation, particularly in high-stakes clinical settings.</description>

      <title>A Beam's Eye View to Fluence Maps 3D Network for Ultra Fast VMAT Radiotherapy Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy (VMAT) revolutionizes cancer treatment by precisely delivering radiation while sparing healthy tissues. Fluence maps generation, crucial in VMAT planning, traditionally involves complex and iterative, and thus time consuming processes. These fluence maps are subsequently leveraged for leaf-sequence. The deep-learning approach presented in this article aims to expedite this by directly predicting fluence maps from patient data. We developed a 3D network which we trained in a supervised way using a combination of L1 and L2 losses, and RT plans generated by Eclipse and from the REQUITE dataset, taking the RT dose map as input and the fluence maps computed from the corresponding RT plans as target. Our network predicts jointly the 180 fluence maps corresponding to the 180 control points (CP) of single arc VMAT plans. In order to help the network, we pre-process the input dose by computing the projections of the 3D dose map to the beam's eye view (BEV) of the 180 CPs, in the same coordinate system as the fluence maps. We generated over 2000 VMAT plans using Eclipse to scale up the dataset size. Additionally, we evaluated various network architectures and analyzed the impact of increasing the dataset size. We are measuring the performance in the 2D fluence maps domain using image metrics (PSNR, SSIM), as well as in the 3D dose domain using the dose-volume histogram (DVH) on a validation dataset. The network inference, which does not include the data loading and processing, is less than 20ms. Using our proposed 3D network architecture as well as increasing the dataset size using Eclipse improved the fluence map reconstruction performance by approximately 8 dB in PSNR compared to a U-Net architecture trained on the original REQUITE dataset. The resulting DVHs are very close to the one of the input target dose.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of Deep Learning-based Scatter Correction on a Long-axial Field-of-view PET scanner</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01341v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Objective: Long-axial field-of-view (LAFOV) positron emission tomography (PET) systems allow higher sensitivity, with an increased number of detected lines of response induced by a larger angle of acceptance. However this extend angle increase the number of multiple scatters and the scatter contribution within oblique planes. As scattering affects both quality and quantification of the reconstructed image, it is crucial to correct this effect with more accurate methods than the state-of-the-art single scatter simulation (SSS) that can reach its limits with such an extended field-of-view (FOV). In this work, which is an extension of our previous assessment of deep learning-based scatter estimation (DLSE) carried out on a conventional PET system, we aim to evaluate the DLSE method performance on LAFOV total-body PET.
  Approach: The proposed DLSE method based on an convolutional neural network (CNN) U-Net architecture uses emission and attenuation sinograms to estimate scatter sinogram. The network was trained from Monte-Carlo (MC) simulations of XCAT phantoms [18F]-FDG PET acquisitions using a Siemens Biograph Vision Quadra scanner model, with multiple morphologies and dose distributions. We firstly evaluated the method performance on simulated data in both sinogram and image domain by comparing it to the MC ground truth and SSS scatter sinograms. We then tested the method on 7 [18F]-FDG and 7 [18F]-PSMA clinical datasets, and compare it to SSS estimations.
  Results: DLSE showed superior accuracy on phantom data, greater robustness to patient size and dose variations compared to SSS, and better lesion contrast recovery. It also yielded promising clinical results, improving lesion contrasts in [18 F]-FDG datasets and performing consistently with [18F]-PSMA datasets despite no training with [18F]-PSMA.</description>

      <title>Imaging simulation of a dual-panel PET geometry with ultrafast TOF detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01006v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In positron emission tomography (PET), time-of-flight (TOF) information localizes source positions along lines of response. Cherenkov-radiator-integrated microchannel-plate photomultiplier tubes have achieved 30 ps TOF resolution, demonstrating cross-sectional imaging without reconstruction. Such ultrafast TOF detectors would free PET from conventional ring geometries. Therefore, this study aimed at investigating imaging characteristics of a dual-panel PET with ultrafast TOF detectors using Geant4 simulation. Two detector panels ($142 \times 142~mm^2$), which consisted of 5.0 mm-thick bismuth germanate pixelized crystals with a 5.75 mm pitch, were placed face-to-face at a 300 mm distance. Spatial resolution and image noise with various TOF resolutions from 30 to 90 ps were evaluated. Because degraded efficiency may cancel TOF gain in image quality, detection efficiency was also parameterized by reducing coincidence counts. A numerical phantom, which consisted of multi-rod and uniform cylindrical activities (21 MBq in total), was simulated for 600 s. Regarding image reconstruction, results of a backprojection (i.e., no reconstruction) were compared with those of the maximum likelihood expectation maximization (MLEM). The dual-panel PET required a 40 ps TOF resolution to have a similar spatial resolution to that of a non-TOF ring PET (300 mm in diameter) for the same detection efficiency. The TOF resolution should be 30 ps with half the efficiency to maintain a similar image noise to that of the 40 ps TOF with complete efficiency. MLEM provided better imaging performance than backprojection, even at 30 ps TOF. The feasibility of the proposed dual-panel PET with ultrafast TOF detectors was shown.</description>
