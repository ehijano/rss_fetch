      <title>Super commuting graphs of finite groups and their Zagreb indices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $B$ be an equivalence relation defined on a finite group $G$. The $B$ super commuting graph on $G$ is a graph whose vertex set is $G$ and two distinct vertices $g$ and $h$ are adjacent if either $[g] = [h]$ or there exist $g' \in [g]$ and $h' \in [h]$ such that $g'$ commutes with $h'$, where $[g]$ is the $B$-equivalence class of $g \in G$. Considering $B$ as the equality, conjugacy and same order relations on $G$, in this article, we discuss the graph structures of equality/conjugacy/order super commuting graphs of certain well-known families of non-abelian groups viz. dihedral groups, dicyclic groups, semidihedral groups, quasidihedral groups, the groups $U_{6n}, V_{8n}, M_{2mn}$ etc. Further, we compute the Zagreb indices of these graphs and show that they satisfy Hansen-Vuki{\v{c}}evi{\'c} conjecture.</description>

      <title>Chain projection ordered categories and DRC-restriction semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we provide a theory of chain projection ordered categories and generalize that of chain projection ordered groupoids developed by East and Azeef Muhammed recently. By using chain projection ordered categories, we obtain a structure theorem for DRC-restriction semigroups. More specifically, we prove that the category of DRC-restriction semigroups together with (2,1,1)-homomorphisms is isomorphic to the category of chain projection ordered categories together with chain projection ordered functors. Moreover, some special cases are also considered. As applications of the main theorem, we demonstrate that the existence of free projection-generated DRC-restriction semigroups associated to any strong two-sided projection algebra and reobtain the structures of projection-fundamental DRC-restriction semigroups. Our work may be regarded as an answer for the fourth problem proposed by East and Azeef Muhammed in [Advances in Mathematics, 437 (2024) 109447].</description>

      <title>Characters of diagonal products and Hilbert-Schmidt stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the character theory of diagonal products as well as alternating and elementary enrichments of groups. Our motivation is to show Hilbert-Schmidt stability for various diagonal products, including the classical family of B. H. Neumann groups. Additionally, we initiate a quantitative study of Hilbert-Schmidt stability for infinitely presented groups, through the notion of stability radius growth, and exhibit an uncountable family of Hilbert-Schmidt stable amenable groups with arbitrarily large such growth. Some applications to local Hilbert-Schmidt stability are also provided.</description>

      <title>Fixed subgroups in Artin groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study fixed subgroups of automorphisms of any large-type Artin group $A_{\Gamma}$. We define a natural subgroup $\mathrm{Aut}_\Gamma(A_\Gamma)$ of $\mathrm{Aut}(A_{\Gamma})$, and for every $\gamma \in \mathrm{Aut}_\Gamma(A_\Gamma)$ we find the isomorphism type of $\mathrm{Fix}(\gamma)$ and a generating set for a finite index subgroup. We show that $\mathrm{Fix}(\gamma)$ is a finitely generated Artin group, with a uniform bound on the rank in terms of the number of vertices of $\Gamma$. Finally, we provide a natural geometric characterisation of the subgroup $\mathrm{Aut}_\Gamma(A_\Gamma)$, which informally is the maximal subgroup of $\mathrm{Aut}(A_\Gamma)$ leaving the Deligne complex of $A_{\Gamma}$ invariant.</description>

      <title>A Pride-Guba-Sapir exact sequence for the relation bimodule of an associative algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a presentation of a monoid $M$, combined work of Pride and of Guba and Sapir provides an exact sequence connecting the relation bimodule of the presentation (in the sense of Ivanov) with the first homology of the Squier complex of the presentation, which is naturally a $\mathbb ZM$-bimodule. This exact sequence was used by Kobayashi and Otto to prove the equivalence of Pride's finite homological type (FHT) property with the homological finiteness condition bi-$\mathrm{FP}_3$. Guba and Sapir used this exact sequence to describe the abelianization of a diagram group. We prove here a generalization of this exact sequence of bimodules for presentations of associative algebras. Our proof is more elementary than the original proof for the special case of monoids.</description>

      <title>Horofunctions on the Heisenberg and Cartan groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the horofunction boundary of finitely generated nilpotent groups, and the natural group action on it. More specifically, we prove the followings results: For discrete Heisenberg groups, we classify the orbits of Busemann points. As a byproduct, we observe that the set of orbits is finite and the set of Busemann points is countable. Furthermore, using the approximation with Lie groups, we observe that the entire horoboundary is uncountable. For the discrete Cartan group, we exhibit an continuum of Busemann points, disproving a conjecture of Tointon and Yadin. As a byproduct, we prove that the group acts non-trivially on its reduced horoboundary, disproving a conjecture of Bader and Finkelshtein.</description>

      <title>Basic Tetravalent Oriented Graphs of Independent-Cycle Type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The family $\mathcal{OG}(4)$ consisting of graph-group pairs $(\Gamma, G)$, where $\Gamma$ is a finite, connected, 4-valent graph admitting a $G$-vertex-, and $G$-edge-transitive, but not $G$-arc-transitive action, has recently been examined using a normal quotient methodology. A subfamily of $\mathcal{OG}(4)$ has been identified as `basic', due to the fact that all members of $\mathcal{OG}(4)$ are normal covers of at least one basic pair. We provide an explicit classification of those basic pairs $(\Gamma, G)$ which have at least two independent cyclic $G$-normal quotients (these are $G$-normal quotients which are not extendable to a common cyclic normal quotient).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A characterization of the finite-dimensional Leibniz algebras with an abelian subalgebra of codimension two over a field $\mathbb{F}$ of characteristic $p\neq2$ is given. In short, a finite-dimensional Leibniz algebra of dimension $n$ with an abelian subalgebra of codimension two is solvable and contains an abelian ideal of codimension at most two or it is a direct sum of a Lie one-dimensional solvable extension of the Heisenberg algebra $\mathfrak{h}(\mathbb{F})$ and $\mathbb{F}^{n-4}$ or a direct sum of a $3$-dimensional simple Lie algebra and $\mathbb{F}^{n-3}$ or a Leibniz one-dimensional solvable extension of the algebra $\mathfrak{h}(\mathbb{F}) \oplus \mathbb{F}^{n-4}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2009.01045v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a group $G$, a {\it normalizer covering} of $G$ is a finite set of proper normalizers of some subgroups of $G$ whose union is $G$. We study $p$-groups ($p$ a prime) without a normalizer covering. As an application, we determine some non-nilpotent groups having a nilpotent normalizer covering.</description>

      <title>Smooth cuboids in group theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.03941v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A smooth cuboid can be identified with a $3\times 3$ matrix of linear forms, with coefficients in a field $K$, whose determinant describes a smooth cubic in the projective plane. To each such matrix one can associate a group scheme over $K$. We produce isomorphism invariants of these groups in terms of their adjoint algebras, which also give information on the number of their maximal abelian subgroups. Moreover, we give a characterization of the isomorphism types of the groups in terms of isomorphisms of elliptic curves and also give a description of the automorphism group. We conclude by applying our results to the determination of the automorphism groups and isomorphism testing of finite $p$-groups of class $2$ and exponent $p$ arising in this way.</description>

Moreover, we also obtain sharp bounds for the second cohomology group $H^2(G,\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z})$ of a $p$-group with coefficients in $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}.$</description>

      <title>Invariable generation of certain branch groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14022v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate invariable generation among key examples of branch groups. In particular, we prove that all generating sets of the torsion Grigorchuk groups, of the branch Grigorchuk-Gupta-Sidki groups and of the torsion multi-EGS groups (which are natural generalisations of the Grigorchuk-Gupta-Sidki groups) are invariable generating sets. Furthermore, for the first Grigorchuk group and the torsion Grigorchuk-Gupta-Sidki groups, every finitely generated subgroup has a finite invariable generating set. We also show that a branch Grigorchuk-Gupta-Sidki group is almost $\frac32$-generated, that the diameter of its generating subgraph $\Delta(G)$ is 2 and its total domination number is 2. Some of our results apply to groups for which every maximal subgroup is normal. This class, known as $\mathcal{MN}$, includes all nilpotent groups.</description>

      <title>A Hodge filtration of logarithmic vector fields for well-generated complex reflection groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.05026</link>
      <description>arXiv:1809.05026v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given an irreducible well-generated complex reflection group, we construct an explicit basis for the module of vector fields with logarithmic poles along its reflection arrangement. This construction yields in particular a Hodge filtration of that module. Our approach is based on a detailed analysis of a flat connection applied to the primitive vector field. This generalizes and unifies analogous results for real reflection groups.</description>

      <title>Birational maps of Severi-Brauer surfaces, with applications to Cremona groups of higher rank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.17123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.17123v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that any group of cardinality at most the one of $\mathbb{C}$ is a quotient of any Cremona group of rank at least $4$. This provides a definitive answer to the question of what the quotients of Cremona groups can be. As a consequence, this gives a negative answer to the question of I. Dolgachev of whether Cremona groups of all ranks are generated by involutions. As another application, we show that higher Cremona groups do not enjoy some classical group-theoretic properties (namely, the Hopfian property) which are satisfied by Cremona groups of rank $2$. Finally, we discover that the $3$-torsion of the Cremona group of rank at least $4$ is not countable.
  To deduce these properties of higher Cremona groups, we first describe the group of birational transformations of a non-trivial Severi-Brauer surface $S$ over a perfect field, proving in particular that if $S$ contains a point of degree $6$, then its group of birational self-maps is not generated by elements of finite order as it admits a surjective group homomorphism to~$\mathbb{Z}$. We then use this result to study Mori fibre spaces over the field of complex numbers, for which the generic fibre is a non-trivial Severi-Brauer surface.</description>
