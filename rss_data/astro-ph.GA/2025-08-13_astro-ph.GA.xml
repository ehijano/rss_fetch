      <title>JWST Discovery of Strong Lensing from a Galaxy Cluster at Cosmic Noon: Giant Arcs and a Highly Concentrated Core of XLSSC 122</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our observations with the James Webb Space Telescope have made the remarkable discovery of strong gravitational lensing arcs from XLSSC 122 ($z=1.98$) - setting the record for the most distant galaxy cluster that exhibits strong lensing. The discovery of giant arcs enables a strong-lensing analysis and a measurement of the concentration of the dark matter halo. We perform a strong-lensing analysis of the cluster and measure the radial projected mass density profile. Our measurements reveal an exceptionally high concentration in the core of XLSSC 122. A Navarro--Frenk--White profile fit to the inner 100 kpc estimates the concentration to be $6.3\pm0.5$. The high concentration of XLSSC 122 contributes to the emerging picture that massive structure formation in the early universe may proceed more rapidly than standard models suggest. We estimate the mass within 100 kpc to be $M$($R&lt;$100 kpc) = $6.5\pm0.7\times10^{13}$ M$_\odot$. Our mosaic images are made public at https://kylefinner.github.io/xlssc122 .</description>

      <title>Milky Way's Metal-Poor Stars display Chemical Transition near the Solar Radius</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The metal-poor stars of a galaxy offer insights into that galaxy's early formation processes and accretion history. Here, we investigate whether the metal-poor stars of our Milky Way galaxy exhibit any characteristic trends in Galactocentric distance versus chemical abundances -- i.e. in the space of $r_{\rm GC}$ vs. [Fe/H] and $r_{\rm GC}$ vs. [X/Fe] -- and if yes, then what is their implication for Galaxy formation. We combine the datasets of APOGEE DR17 and $\textit{Gaia}$ DR3, where the former provides stellar abundances and the latter provides stellar parallaxes. We analyze bright ($G&lt;13$) and metal-poor ([Fe/H]$&lt;-1.2$) stars located far from the disk ($|z|\geq1$ kpc), and explore a total of $19$ abundances. We find that $9$ different abundances exhibit a drastic transition in their distribution near the Solar radius $r_{\rm GC}=8$ kpc. This trend is very unlikely to be related to radial migration, as our metal-poor sample does not contain any disk star. We also analyze the Gaia-Sausage/Enceladus stars, which is a dominant metal-poor population of the Galaxy, and find that it alone cannot account for this trend. This suggests that the Milky Way's metal-poor populations inside and outside the Solar radius likely originated from distinct chemical enrichment scenarios and formation processes.</description>

      <title>On bursty star formation during cosmological reionization -- influence on the metal and dust content of low-mass galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations indicate that high-redshift galaxies undergo episodic star formation bursts, driving strong outflows that expel gas and suppress accretion. We investigate the consequences for metal and dust content of galaxies at $z\geq\!5$ using our semi-analytical model, ASHVINI. We track gas-phase and stellar metallicities $(Z_\text{g}, Z_\star)$ and dust mass $(M_{\rm d})$ in dark matter haloes spanning $M_{\rm h} = 10^6 - 10^{11}\,M_\odot$, comparing continuous and bursty star formation scenarios, which reflect underlying assumptions of instantaneous and delayed feedback, and we allow for metallicity-dependent feedback efficiency. Delayed feedback induces oscillations in $Z_{\rm g}$ and $Z_\star$, with $Z_{\rm g}$ declining sharply at low stellar and halo masses. This decline shifts to higher stellar and halo masses as the redshift decreases. Reionization introduces significant scatter, producing an upturn followed by rapid $Z_{\rm g}$ decline. Metallicity-dependent feedback moderates this decline at $z=7-10$, flattening the $Z_{\rm g}$-mass relation to $\simeq 0.03 - 0.04\,Z_\odot$. Dust production tracks $Z_{\rm g}$ but is sensitive to burst history, causing delayed enrichment. Our results show that burst-driven feedback decouples $Z_{\rm g}$ and $Z_\star$, imprints intrinsic scatter in mass-metallicity relations, and delays dust growth. These effects are strongest in low-mass halos $(M_{\rm h}\sim 10^7\,M_\odot)$, where shallow potentials amplify the impact of feedback. Our results are consistent with recent hydrodynamical and semi-analytical simulations and provides context for interpreting JWST metallicity and dust measurements, highlighting the importance of episodic star formation in early galaxy chemical evolution.</description>

      <title>An Image-Plane Approach to Gravitational Lens Modeling of Interferometric Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong gravitational lensing acts as a cosmic telescope, enabling the study of the high-redshift universe. Astronomical interferometers, such as the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), have provided high-resolution images of strongly lensed sources at millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths. To model the mass and light distributions of lensing and source galaxies from strongly lensed images, strong lens modeling for interferometric observations is conventionally performed in the visibility space, which is computationally expensive. In this paper, we implement an image-plane lens modeling methodology for interferometric dirty images by accounting for noise correlations. We show that the image-plane likelihood function produces accurate model values when tested on simulated ALMA observations with an ensemble of noise realizations. We also apply our technique to ALMA observations of two sources selected from the South Pole Telescope survey, comparing our results with previous visibility-based models. Our model results are consistent with previous models for both parametric and pixelated source-plane reconstructions. We implement this methodology for interferometric lens modeling in the open-source software package lenstronomy.</description>

      <title>Quantification of The Age Dependence of Mid-Infrared Star Formation Rate Indicators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We combine James Webb Space Telescope images of the nearby galaxy NGC 5194 in the hydrogen recombination line Pa-alpha (lambda=1.8756 micron) from the Cycle 1 program JWST-FEAST with 21 micron dust continuum images from the Cycle 2 Treasury program JWGT to quantify the difference in the calibration of mid-infrared star formation rates (SFR) between HII regions and galaxies. We use the archival HST H-alpha image to correct the Pa-alpha emission for the effects of dust attenuation. Our data confirm previous results that the dust-corrected Pa-alpha flux is tightly correlated with the 21 micron emission at the scales of HII regions. When combined with published JWST data for the HII regions of the galaxy NGC 628 and Spitzer 24 micron data for whole galaxies and for kpc-size galaxy regions, we show that the L(24)-L(Pa-alpha) correlation has exponent &gt;1 across six decades in luminosity. In addition, the hybrid 24 micron+H-alpha SFR indicator has a scaling constant about 4.4 times higher for HII regions than for whole galaxies, also in agreement with previous results. Models of stellar populations with a range of star formation histories reveal that the observed trends can be entirely ascribed to and quantified with the contribution to the IR emission by stellar populations older than ~5-6 Myr. Based on the models' results, we provide: (1) a calibration for the infrared SFR across six orders of magnitude in L(24), from HII regions to luminous galaxies, and (2) a prescription for the scaling constant of the hybrid infrared SFR indicators as a function of the star formation timescale.</description>

      <title>Kinematic patterns of the enriched gas phase in the Local Group {\sc Hestia} simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations of intergalactic absorbers in the Local Group suggest the existence of a velocity dipole in the general barycentre--antibarycentre direction which can be interpreted as evidence of a general flow of material towards the group's centre of mass. In this work, we study the kinematics of gas in the Local Group using one of the high-resolution realisations of the {\sc Hestia} simulations with a particular focus on the evidence left by different ionic species. Our simulation includes the correct cosmography for a region similar to the Local Group and a relative radial velocity between the candidate Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies consistent with the observed one. We examine the distribution and kinematics of six ionic species (H\,{\sc i}, C\,{\sc iv}, Si\,{\sc iii}, O\,{\sc vi}, O\,{\sc vii} and O\,{\sc viii}) and their imprints on synthetic sky maps constructed from the reference frames commonly used by observers. Our results indicate the presence of such a dipole for gas outside the Milky Way halo, favouring a paradigm in which the Milky Way is moving against the gas in the direction of the barycentre, while moving away from it in the opposite direction. This pattern is clearer for the higher oxygen ions, which preferentially trace hot gas. On the other hand, we observe a slight asymmetry in the pressure profiles in both directions, indicating higher pressures in the inner regions of the Local Group.</description>

      <title>MAGAZ3NE: Far-IR and Radio Insights into the Nature and Properties of Ultramassive Galaxies at $z\gtrsim3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep and wide-field near-infrared (NIR) surveys have recently discovered and confirmed ultramassive galaxies (UMGs; $\log (M_{\star}/M_{\odot})&gt;11$) spectroscopically at high redshift. However, most are characterized using only ultraviolet (UV)-to-NIR photometry, offering limited insight into obscured star formation and active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity. In this work, we add ten far-infrared (FIR)-to-radio passbands to the existing UV-to-NIR catalogs for two spectroscopically confirmed UMGs from the MAGAZ3NE survey, COS-DR3-195616 ($z_{\rm spec} = 3.255$) and COS-DR1-209435 ($z_{\rm spec} = 2.481$). Utilizing the full UV-to-radio photometry, we revise our earlier UV-NIR-based interpretation of the nature of these galaxies. While both were previously identified as quiescent, our analysis reveals that 195616 is an unobscured galaxy undergoing quenching, and 209435 is a heavily obscured, actively star-forming UMG. We find that 195616 has already depleted most of its molecular gas and is expected to experience minimal future stellar mass growth. In contrast, 209435 contains a substantial molecular gas reservoir and has a prolonged depletion timescale. It is anticipated to increase 0.34 dex in stellar mass, reaching a stellar mass of $\log (M_{\star}/M_{\odot})$ = 11.72 over the next 0.72 Gyr. We present multi-pronged evidence for AGN activity in both UMGs. Our findings support a scenario where AGN feedback in 195616 may have contributed to gas depletion during quenching, while 209435 continues to form stars despite hosting an obscured AGN, suggesting feedback has not yet suppressed star formation. Our work shows the importance of FIR-to-radio observations for accurately inferring the nature and properties of galaxies at $z\gtrsim3$.</description>

      <title>RUBIES spectroscopically confirms the high number density of quiescent galaxies from $\mathbf{2&lt;z&lt;5}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the number density of massive ($ \mathrm{ log (M_{*}/M_{\odot}) &gt; 10.3} $) quiescent galaxies at $2&lt;z&lt;5$ using JWST NIRSpec PRISM spectra. This work relies on spectra from RUBIES, which provides excellent data quality and an unparalleled, well-defined targeting strategy to robustly infer physical properties and number densities. We identify quiescent galaxy candidates within RUBIES through principal component analysis and construct a final sample using star formation histories derived from spectro-photometric fitting of the NIRSpec PRISM spectra and NIRCam photometry. By inverting the RUBIES selection function, we correct for survey incompleteness and calculate the number density of massive quiescent galaxies at these redshifts, providing the most complete spectroscopic estimates prior to cosmic noon to date. We find that early massive quiescent galaxies are surprisingly common ($\gtrsim 10^{-5}$ Mpc$^{-3}$ by $4&lt;z&lt;5$), which is consistent with previous studies based on JWST photometry alone and/or in smaller survey areas. We compare our number densities with predictions from six state-of-the-art cosmological galaxy formation simulations. At $z&gt;3$, most simulations fail to produce enough massive quiescent galaxies, suggesting the treatment of feedback and/or the channels for early efficient formation are incomplete in most galaxy evolution models.</description>

      <title>Infrared and Optical Emission-line Diagnostics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a catalogue of over 130 emission-line galaxies with matched near infra-red (NIR) and optical spectra, where we examine the relationship between the respective nuclear activity classifications, diagnosed by the flux ratios of emission lines. We match the standard NIR classification with four different optical classifications. While there is a broad agreement between the two regimes, there are mismatches and overlaps caused either by aperture effects and/or NIR radiation penetrating obscuring dust and "seeing deeper" into the nuclear region, thus exposing AGN activity. We examine the relationship between the equivalent widths (EW) of H$\alpha$ and Pa$\beta$, as well as the ratios [N II]/H$\alpha$ vs. [Fe II]/Pa$\beta$, and find reasonable correlations. We thus propose a new diagnostic (EW of Pa$\beta$ with Fe - WPF) in the NIR (analogous to the WHaN classification), using the [Fe II]/Pa$\beta$ flux ratio and the EW of the Pa$\beta$ line. We show, within the limitations of the catalogue size, that the regions of the standard NIR diagram can be reasonably replicated in this new scheme. This diagnostic has the advantage that only one wavelength range needs to be observed, thus being economical with telescope time.</description>

      <title>Search for Slow Bars in Two Barred Galaxies with Nuclear Structures: NGC 6951 and NGC 7716</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate two barred galaxies with nuclear structures, NGC 6951 and NGC 7716, to examine whether they host slow bars. Using Gemini/GMOS long-slit spectroscopy, we calculate the bar pattern speed with the Tremaine-Weinberg method and detect kinematically decoupled nuclear disks in both galaxies. We also measure the bar length and strength using Pan-STARRs images and identify a nuclear ring in NGC 6951 and a nuclear bar in NGC 7716 from HST/PC images. Our results indicate that NGC 6951 hosts a slow, long, and strong bar, which likely evolved through interactions with the dark matter halo and contributed to the formation of both the nuclear disk and ring. We also find hints of a rapidly rotating oval structure within the primary bar, although it is not clearly seen in the imaging data. In contrast, the primary bar in NGC 7716 is too weak to be classified as a barred galaxy, while its nuclear disk and nuclear bar are unusually large, possibly due to tidal interactions or the weakness of the primary bar. These findings suggest that slow bars may be more observed in galaxies with nuclear structures and highlight the often underappreciated role of galaxy interactions in bar evolution.</description>

      <title>Departures from Standard Disk Predictions in Intensive Ground-Based Monitoring of Three AGN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present ground-based, multi-band light curves of the AGN Mrk~509, NGC\,4151, and NGC\,4593 obtained contemporaneously with \sw\, monitoring. We measure cross-correlation lags relative to \sw\, UVW2 (1928~\AA) and test the standard prediction for disk reprocessing, which assumes a geometrically thin, optically thick accretion disk where continuum interband delays follow the relation \( \tau(\lambda) \propto \lambda^{4/3} \). For Mrk~509 the 273-d \sw\, campaign gives well-defined lags that increase with wavelength as $\tau(\lambda)\propto\lambda^{2.17\pm0.2}$, steeper than the thin-disk prediction, and the optical lags are a factor of $\sim5$ longer than expected for a simple disk-reprocessing model. This ``disk-size discrepancy'' as well as excess lags in the $u$ and $r$ bands (which include the Balmer continuum and H$\alpha$, respectively) suggest a mix of short lags from the disk and longer lags from nebular continuum originating in the broad-line region. The shorter \sw\, campaigns, 69~d on NGC\,4151 and 22~d on NGC\,4593, yield less well-defined, shorter lags $&lt;2$~d. The NGC\,4593 lags are consistent with $\tau(\lambda) \propto \lambda^{4/3}$ but with uncertainties too large for a strong test. For NGC\,4151 the \sw\, lags match $\tau(\lambda) \propto \lambda^{4/3}$, with a small $U$-band excess, but the ground-based lags in the $r$, $i$, and $z$ bands are significantly shorter than the $B$ and $g$ lags, and also shorter than expected from the thin-disk prediction. The interpretation of this unusual lag spectrum is unclear. Overall these results indicate significant diversity in the $\tau-\lambda$ relation across the optical/UV/NIR, which differs from the more homogeneous behavior seen in the \sw\, bands.</description>

      <title>Relation between colour gradient and central asymmetric features for post-starburst galaxies at $z \sim 0.8$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated colour gradients of photometrically selected post-starburst galaxies (PSBs) at $0.7 &lt; z &lt; 0.9$ in the COSMOS field as a function of central concentration of asymmetric features, $C_{A}$, in order to understand their origins. We measured the colour gradients for 33 PSBs, 332 quiescent galaxies (QGs), and 1136 star-forming gaaxies (SFGs) by using COSMOS $HST$/ACS $I_{F814W}$-band and COSMOS-DASH $HST$/WFC3 $H_{F160W}$-band data. We found that the colour gradient, $\Delta (I-H) = (I-H)_{in} - (I-H)_{out}$, decreases with increasing $C_{A}$ for all the three populations. Only PSBs with $\log{C_{A}} &gt; 0.6$ show positive gradients, which suggests that their central asymmetric features are caused by disturbed distribution of relatively young stars near the centre. The colour gradients are also closely related with half-light radius rather than stellar mass for all the populations. The positive colour gradients and very small sizes of those PSBs with high $C_A$ suggest that a nuclear starburst caused by gas-rich major merger occurred in the recent past. On the other hand, similarly massive PSBs with $\log C_A &lt; 0.6$ show the negative colour gradients, heavier dust extinction, and larger sizes, and their origins may be different from those PSBs with high $C_A$.</description>

      <title>Impact of Resonance, Raman, and Thomson Scattering on Hydrogen Line Formation in Little Red Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Little Red Dots (LRDs) are compact sources at $z&gt;5$ discovered through JWST spectroscopy. Their spectra exhibit broad Balmer emission lines ($\gtrsim1000\rm~km~s^{-1}$), alongside absorption features and a pronounced Balmer break -- evidence for a dense, neutral hydrogen medium with the $n=2$ state. When interpreted as arising from AGN broad-line regions, inferred black hole masses from local scaling relations exceed expectations given their stellar masses, challenging models of early black hole-galaxy co-evolution. However, radiative transfer effects in dense media may also impact the formation of hydrogen emission lines. We model three scattering processes shaping hydrogen line profiles: resonance scattering by hydrogen in the $n=2$ state, Raman scattering of UV radiation by ground-state hydrogen, and Thomson scattering by free electrons. Using 3D Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations with multi-branching resonance transitions, we examine their imprint on line shapes and ratios. Resonance scattering produces strong deviations from Case B flux ratios, clear differences between H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$, and encodes gas kinematics in line profiles but cannot broaden H$\beta$ due to conversion to Pa$\alpha$. While Raman scattering can yield broad wings, scattering of UV continuum is disfavored given the absence of strong FWHM variations across transitions. Raman scattering of higher Lyman-series emission can produce H$\alpha$/H$\beta$ wing width ratios of $\gtrsim1.28$, agreeing with observations. Thomson scattering can reproduce the observed $\gtrsim1000~\rm km\, s^{-1}$ wings under plausible conditions, e.g., $T_{\rm e} \sim 10^4\rm \, K$ and $N_{\rm e}\sim10^{24}\rm~cm^{-2}$ -- and lead to black hole mass overestimates by factors $\gtrsim10$. Our results provide a framework for interpreting hydrogen lines in LRDs and similar systems.</description>

      <title>Mapping the Milky Way with Gaia Bp/Rp spectra II: The inner stellar halo traced by a large sample of blue horizontal branch stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We selected BHB stars based on synthetic photometry and stellar atmosphere parameters inferred from Gaia Bp/Rp spectra. We generated the synthetic SDSS broad-band $ugr$ and Pristine narrow-band CaHK magnitudes from Gaia Bp/Rp data. A photometric selection of BHB candidates was made in the $(u-g, g-r)$ and $(u-\mathrm{CaHK},g-r)$ color-color spaces. A spectroscopic selection in $T_\mathrm{eff}-\log g$ space was applied to remove stars with high surface gravity. The selection function of BHB stars was obtained by using the Gaia DR3 photometry. A non-parametric method that allows the variation in the vertical flattening $q$ with the Galactic radius, was adopted to explore the density shape of the stellar halo. We present a catalog of 44,552 high latitude ($|b|&gt;20^\circ$) BHB candidates chosen with a well-characterized selection function. The stellar halo traced by these BHB stars is more flattened at smaller radii ($q=0.4$ at $r\sim8$ kpc), and becomes nearly spherical at larger radii ($q=0.8$ at $r\sim25$ kpc). Assuming a variable flattening and excluding several obvious outliers that might be related to the halo substructures or contaminants, we obtain a smooth and consistent relationship between $r$ and $q$, and the density profile is best fit with by a single power law with an index $\alpha=-4.65\pm0.04$.</description>

      <title>Multi-resolution kinematic modelling of nearby galaxies: a demonstration using MHONGOOSE observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel method of combining kinematic models obtained at multiple spatial resolution levels in a physically self-consistent manner. The MHONGOOSE survey has mapped atomic hydrogen emission in $30$ nearby dwarf and spiral galaxies. Each galaxy is imaged at multiple resolution levels with unprecedented dynamic range in spatial resolution (from $\sim 10''$ to $ 90''$) and HI sensitivity, with the latter varying by almost a factor of $30$ across all resolution scales. We use radial weighting functions to combine kinematic models from all resolution levels. The weights are derived from the residuals of model fits to a set of simulated galaxy observations with known rotation curves and geometries. We obtain combined (weighted and smoothed) inclination and position angle profiles for each galaxy. These suppress the sharp, often unphysical radial fluctuations arising in single-resolution profiles. We then fit the rotation speed and velocity dispersion profiles at each resolution level with the geometric profiles fixed to the combined profiles, finally combining these using the same weighting and smoothing approach. The combined rotation curves utilise all of the available information and have smaller typical errors compared to those obtained using a single resolution level, particularly near the centres and outer edges of models. This initial demonstration is promising; there is scope to further refine the process to use such information-rich observations to their full potential.</description>

      <title>Dynamical properties of high-[Mg/Fe] stars in the Milky Way bar region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of the high-alpha component of the Galactic bulge remains debated, unlike the bar-driven origin of the low-alpha bulge. We examine the metallicity-dependent dynamical properties of high-[Mg/Fe] stars in the bar region, using samples of low- and high-[Mg/Fe] stars from APOGEE DR17, complemented by the PIGS catalogue of [Fe/H] $ &lt; -1 $ stars. The mean Galactocentric rotational velocity $ \overline V_\phi(R) $ is nearly cylindrical for both low- and high-[Mg/Fe] stars across the bulge and outer bar. $\overline V_\phi(R)$ of high-[Mg/Fe] stars with [Fe/H] $ \ge -0.6 $ is similar within errors to low-[Mg/Fe] stars in the bulge, and $ 10-20\% $ lower in the outer bar. The mean radial velocity field of these stars exhibits a quadrupole pattern similar to low-[Mg/Fe] stars. Orbit integrations in realistic barred Galactic potentials show that these model-independent properties correspond to a peanut bulge in the orbital density distributions for high-[Mg/Fe] stars with [Fe/H] $ \ge -0.6 $, transitioning toward a more spheroidal structure at lower metallicities. Additionally, $ \overline V_\phi$ ([Fe/H]) increases steeply as metallicity rises from about [Fe/H] $ \sim -1.3 $, resembling the spin-up observed at larger Galactic radii. This is accompanied by a transition in the dominant orbit families, from co- and counter-rotating cloud A and $ \rm x_4 $ orbits at low metallicities to co-rotating bar-supporting $ \rm x_1 $ family tree, box, and cloud A orbits at solar metallicity. Our results strengthen the case that the bulk of the high-[Mg/Fe] component in the bar region evolved from an alpha-enhanced disc, while metal-poor stars with [Fe/H] $ &lt; -1 $ trace a more turbulent origin.</description>

      <title>Binary clusters in the Galactic disk I: Systematic identification and classification using Gaia DR3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims. We aim to identify and classify BCs using high-precision astrometric and kinematic data, and to investigate their physical properties, mutual gravitational interactions, and formation rates. Methods. We used a comprehensive star cluster catalog that contains 4,084 high-quality clusters. Based on spatial and kinematic proximity, we identified 400 cluster pairs involving 686 unique clusters. These pairs were classified into three types: primordial BCs, systems formed through tidal capture or resonant trapping, and hyperbolic encounter pairs. For each system, we calculated the tidal factor to quantify the strength of mutual tidal interaction. Additionally, we constructed multi-cluster systems by identifying transitive connections among cluster pairs. Results. Among the 400 identified cluster pairs, nearly 60.8% (243 pairs) are probably primordial BCs, exhibiting both similar ages and motions. This supports a scenario where they formed together in the same giant molecular cloud. We find that 82.5% of the cluster pairs have strong mutual tidal forces. In addition, 278 star clusters are identified as members of 82 multi-cluster systems, including 27 newly reported groups. Cross-matching with the literature confirms the recovery of previously reported systems and leads to the discovery of 268 new cluster pairs. In our sample, about 16.8% of star clusters are involved in some type of interaction with another cluster, and 9.94% of star clusters are likely born in primordial BCs. Conclusions. Our results provide a comprehensive, homogeneously identified sample of Galactic BCs. The high fraction of primordial BCs and their mutual tidal interaction suggest that cluster formation in pairs is a main outcome of star formation. This work offers new observational constraints on the formation and dynamical evolution of multiple star cluster systems.</description>

      <title>Modeling Non-Gaussianities in Pulsar Timing Array data analysis using Gaussian Mixture Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) data analysis, noise is typically assumed to be Gaussian, and the marginalized likelihood has a well-established analytical form derived within the framework of Gaussian processes. However, this Gaussianity assumption may break down for certain classes of astrophysical and cosmological signals, particularly for a gravitational wave background (GWB) generated by a population of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs). In this work, we present a new method for testing the presence of non-Gaussian features in PTA data. We go beyond the Gaussian assumption by modeling the noise or signal statistics using a Gaussian mixture model (GMM). An advantage of this approach is that the marginalization of the likelihood remains fully analytical, expressed as a linear combination of Gaussian PTA likelihoods. This makes the method straightforward to implement within existing data analysis tools. Moreover, this method extends beyond the free spectrum analysis by producing posterior probability distributions of higher-order moments inferred from the data, which can be incorporated into spectral refitting techniques. We validate the model using simulations and demonstrate the sensitivity of PTAs to non-Gaussianity by computing the Bayes factor in favor of the GMM as a function of the injected excess moments. We apply the method to a more astrophysically motivated scenario where a single SMBHB is resolved on top of a Gaussian GWB and show that significant non-Gaussianities are introduced by the individual source. Finally, we test our model on a realistic GWB generated from a simulated population of SMBHBs.</description>

      <title>Orbits and Masses for 156 Companions from Combined Astrometry and Radial Velocities, and A Validation of Gaia Non-Single Star Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We combine absolute astrometry from Hipparcos and Gaia with archival radial velocities from the Keck/HIRES and ESO/HARPS spectrographs, as well as relative astrometry (when available), to derive masses and orbits for 156 companions around main-sequence stars, including 111 stellar companions, 12 brown dwarfs, and 33 planets. Although this sample is not compiled for occurrence-rate statistics due to systematic biases in non-uniform target selection and varied observing strategies, we nonetheless clearly detect the Brown Dwarf desert in the distribution of companion masses (as well as in mass ratio), out to separations of more than 10 AU. This work also enables a validation of Gaia DR3 non-single-star solutions by predicting Gaia's measured Right Ascension and Declination acceleration terms. For stars with Gaia astrometric acceleration solutions, we find qualitative agreement with Gaia DR3 results. Our predicted accelerations agree with the Gaia DR3 values overall, showing a median offset of 1.85 sigma, with a tail extending to about 10 sigma. These residuals suggest modestly underestimated uncertainties, broadly consistent with previous results for parallaxes and proper motions. Three of our systems have full Gaia orbital fits; however, their true orbital periods are long and all three Gaia solutions are spurious. Gaia DR4 will provide individual astrometric measurements and enable more detailed and extensive investigations of accelerating and orbital fits.</description>

      <title>Hot Jupiter formation in dense stellar clusters: A Monte Carlo model applied to 47 Tucanae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the efficiency of high-e migration as a pathway for Hot Jupiter formation in the dense globular cluster 47 Tuc. Gravitational N-body simulations are performed to investigate the orbital evolution of star-planet systems due to dynamical stellar perturbations. Planetary systems that have been scattered into orbits of sufficiently high eccentricity can undergo tidal circularisation, with Hot Jupiter formation being one possible stopping condition. We also account for the possibility of (i) ionisation due to high-energy encounters, (ii) tidal disruption of the planet by tidal forces inside the Roche limit and (iii) Warm Jupiter formation. The orbital evolution of a population of cold Jupiter progenitors, with initial semi-major axes between 1-30 au, is simulated over 12 Gyr using a simplified dynamical model of 47 Tuc. Our computational treatment of dynamical encounters yields an overall HJ occurrence rate of F_HJ = 5.9 x 10^-4 per cluster star (a 51 per cent enhancement relative to the analytic baseline). The probability of Hot Jupiter formation is highest in the core and falls off steeply beyond a few parsecs from the centre of the cluster, where the stellar density is too low to drive efficient eccentricity diffusion. The code can be found here: https://github.com/James-Wirth/HotJupiter.</description>

      <title>Optimized smoothing kernels for SPH</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a set of new smoothing kernels for smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) that improve the convergence of the method without any additional computational cost. These kernels are generated through a linear combination of other SPH kernels, combined with an optimization strategy to minimize the error in the Gresho-Chan vortex test case. To facilitate the different choices in gradient operators for SPH in the literature, we perform this optimization for both geometric density average force SPH (GDSPH) and linear-corrected gradient SPH (ISPH). In addition to the Gresho-Chan vortex, we also perform simulations of the hydrostatic glass, Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, and the Sod shocktube case. At low neighbour numbers (&lt; 128), there is a significant improvement across the different tests, with the greatest impact shown for GDSPH. Apart from the popular Wendland kernels, we also explore other positive-definite kernels in this paper, which include the "missing" Wendland kernels, Wu kernels, and Buhmann kernels. In addition, we also present a method for producing arbitrary non-biased initial conditions in SPH. This method uses the SPH momentum equation together with an artificial pressure, combined with a global and local relaxation stage to minimize local and global errors.</description>

      <title>Formation process of young stellar population in Messier 16 from a kinematic perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a kinematic study of young stars in Messier 16 (M16) using the Gaia Data Release 3 and high-resolution spectra. A total of 345 stars are selected as genuine members using the published lists of X-ray, infrared sources, and early-type stars as well as the Gaia data. There is severe differential reddening across this region and the reddening law of the intracluster medium appears abnormal. The distance to M16, derived from the parallaxes of the members, is about 1.7 kpc. The ages of members, estimated by comparing their color-magnitude diagram with theoretical isochrones, range from 1 Myr to 4 Myr. This star-forming region is composed of an open cluster (NGC 6611) and a distributed population. This cluster shows a clear pattern of expansion and rotation. Some of the distributed population are spatially associated with the gas pillars located at the ridge of H II bubble. In particular, several stars moving away from the cluster are physically associated with the northeastern pillar. In addition, their younger ages support the idea that the formation of these stars was triggered by the feedback from massive stars in NGC 6611. On the other hand, the other stars do not show systematic radial or stream motions; therefore, they likely formed through spontaneous star formation events. We discuss the formation of young stars in the context of cluster expansion, spontaneous star formation, and feedback-driven star formation, and suggest that all of these mechanisms possibly contributed to their formation.</description>

      <title>C3PO V: Comoving stellar pairs indicate rotational spin-down drives the main-sequence Li-Dip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08671v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The lithium-dip observed in mid-F dwarfs remains a long-standing challenge for stellar evolution models. We present high-precision stellar parameters and A(Li) for 22 new comoving pairs, primarily located on the hotter side of the Li-Dip. Combined with pairs from the C3PO catalog, our sample includes 124 stars with Teff between 6000 and 7300 K, encompassing and extending slightly beyond the Li-Dip. Among them, 49 comoving pairs (98 stars) have both components within the temperature range of interest. Using this expanded set of comoving pairs observed with high-resolution spectroscopy, we show that rotational spin-down is the dominant process responsible for Li depletion in the Li-Dip. First, within comoving pairs, the star with v sin i &gt; 12 km/s shows higher A(Li) than its more slowly rotating companion within the Li-Dip, indicating that rotation-dependent mixing drives lithium depletion. Second, we observe a correlation between A(Li) and v sin i: fast rotators retain higher A(Li) with less scatter, while slow rotators show lower A(Li) and greater dispersion. Third, among slow rotators, A(Li) varies widely, suggesting that differences in initial rotation rates and spin-down histories influence how much Li is depleted. Some stars may have formed as fast rotators and spun down rapidly, leading to more Li depletion, while others may have started as slow rotators and retained more of their initial Li. These results demonstrate that rotational induced mixing plays an important role in shaping the Li-Dip beyond the effects of stellar age and mass.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous visible spectrophotometry of interstellar object 3I/ATLAS with Seimei/TriCCS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 3I/ATLAS, also known as C/2025 N$_1$ (ATLAS), is the third interstellar object (ISO) discovered in July 2025. ISOs are particularly interesting because characterizing their physical properties helps us understand and test our knowledge of Solar System formation. Several quick response observations of 3I/ATLAS were performed during the first few days after the discovery, and various results, such as reflectance spectra, have been reported. We performed simultaneous visible spectrophotometry of 3I/ATLAS from data taken using the TriColor CMOS Camera and Spectrograph (TriCCS) on the Seimei 3.8 m telescope. The Seimei/TriCCS observations of 3I/ALTAS were obtained in the $g$, $r$, $i$, and $z$ bands in the Pan-STARRS system on UTC July 15, 2025. Our lightcurves show no significant variations during the 2.3 h observation, which is in good agreement with previous studies. Visible color indices of 3I/ATLAS, $g-r=0.603\pm0.031$, $r-i=0.210\pm0.031$, $i-z=0.117\pm0.046$, and $r-z=0.327\pm0.035$ suggest it has a red surface similar to, or slightly redder than, that of D-type asteroids. Continuous observations of 3I/ATLAS before and after its perihelion passage in October 2025 are desired to investigate its physical properties.</description>

      <title>Halo Occupation Distribution of Quasars: Dependence on Luminosity, Redshift, Black Hole Mass and Feedback Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08851v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use cosmological hydrodynamic simulations (IllustrisTNG and SIMBA) to explore the redshift, luminosity, and black hole mass dependence of the quasar halo occupation distribution (HOD). In both simulations, we find that the quasar activity is quenched at a characteristic halo mass ($\sim 10^{13} M_{\odot}$) scale affecting the nature of its occupation distribution function. We note that the quenching is more pronounced at low redshifts for quasars selected through a luminosity threshold. We show that a very significant bias (a factor of $\sim 10-50$ in the central occupation and $\sim 10-70\%$ in the satellite occupation fraction) is introduced in the reconstruction of quasar host halo mass distributions from the observed two-point-correlation function, if the HOD modeling does not account for the quenching effect in the central occupation function. While there is strong suppression of the occupation fraction of central quasars, the satellite occupation still follows a power-law like behavior. Our results show that the global satellite fraction of quasars increases monotonically from high to low redshifts, with $20-40 \%$ of the quasars being satellite at intermediate redshifts, consistent with previous clustering based estimates. In addition, our study reveals that while the occupation function of quasars depends on redshift, luminosity, and feedback modes, there is hardly any evolution in the supermassive black hole (SMBH; mass-selected sample) occupation. The SMBH HOD over the entire parameter space is well-modeled by a power-law and a step function similar to what has been found for galaxies and low-luminosity active galactic nuclei.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gaia has recently revealed a population of over 20 compact objects in wide astrometric binaries, while LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) have observed around 100 compact object binaries as gravitational-wave (GW) mergers. Despite belonging to different systems, the compact objects discovered by both Gaia and the LVK follow a multimodal mass distribution, with a global maximum at neutron star (NS) masses ($\sim 1$-$2\,M_\odot$) and a secondary local maximum at black hole (BH) masses $\sim10\,M_\odot$. However, the relative dearth of objects, or ``mass gap," between these modes is more pronounced among the wide binaries observed by Gaia compared to the GW population, with $9^{+10}_{-6}\%$ of GW component masses falling between $2.5$--$5\,M_\odot$ compared to $\lesssim5\%$ of Gaia compact objects. We explore whether this discrepancy can be explained by the natal kicks received by low-mass BHs. GW progenitor binaries may be more likely to survive natal kicks, because the newborn BH has a more massive companion and/or is in a tighter binary than Gaia progenitor binaries. We compare the survival probabilities of Gaia and GW progenitor binaries as a function of natal kick strength and pre-supernova binary parameters, and map out the parameter space and kick strength required to disrupt the progenitor binaries leading to low-mass BHs in Gaia systems more frequently than those in GW systems.</description>

      <title>Tracing Large Scale Structure Morphology with Multiwavelength Line Intensity Maps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Line intensity mapping (LIM) is an emerging technique for probing the large scale structure (LSS) in the post-reionisation era. This captures the integrated flux of a particular spectral line emission from multiple sources within a patch of the sky without resolving them. Mapping different galaxy line emissions, such as the HI $21$-cm and CO rotational lines via LIM, can reveal complementary information about the bias with which the line emitters trace the underlying matter distribution and how different astrophysical phenomena affect the clustering pattern of these signals. The stage where the structures in the cosmic web merge to form a single connected structure is known as the percolation transition. Using mock HI $21$-cm and CO($1-0$) LIM signals in the post-reionisation universe, we explore the connectivity of structures through percolation analysis and compare it with that of the underlying galaxy distribution. We probe the relative contributions of voids, filaments, and sheets to the galaxy density and line intensity maps using a morphological measure known as the local dimension. The CO($1-0$) map exhibits an increased filamentary behaviour and larger contribution from sheets than the $21$-cm map. We attempt to explain such an emission of the CO($1-0$) line from biased environments. The upcoming SKA-Mid will produce tomographic intensity maps of the $21$-cm signal at $z \lesssim 3$ in Band-1. CO maps can be produced at these redshifts in phase 2 of SKA-Mid, where the frequency coverage is expected to increase up to $\sim 50$ GHz. We present forecasts for the recovery of the local dimensions of these intensity maps contaminated by instrumental noise, considering SKA-Mid observations.</description>

      <title>Application of the FRADO model of BLR formation to the Seyfert galaxy NGC 5548 and the first step toward determining the Hubble constant</title>

Abstract: The dynamical and geometric structures of the Broad Line Region (BLR), along with the origins of continuum time delays in active galaxies, remain topics of ongoing debate. In this study, we aim to reproduce the observed broadband spectrum, the H$\beta$ line delay, and the continuum time delays using our newly developed model for the source NGC 5548. We adopt the standard accretion disk model, with the option of an inner hot flow, and employ the lamp-post model to account for disk irradiation. Additionally, we model the BLR structure based on radiation pressure acting on dust. The model is parameterized by the black hole mass, $M_{\text{BH}}$ (which is fixed), the accretion rate, the viewing angle, the height of the lamp-post, the cloud density, and the cloud covering factor. The resulting continuum time delays arise from a combination of disk reprocessing and the reprocessing of a fraction of radiation by the BLR. Our model reasonably reproduces the observed broad-band continuum, the H$\beta$ time delay, and the continuum inter-band time delays measured during the observational campaign. When the accretion rate is not constrained by the known distance to the source, our approach allows for a direct estimation of the distance. The resulting Hubble constant, $H_0$ = $66.9^{+10.6}_{-2.1}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, represents a significant improvement over previously reported values derived from continuum time delays in the literature. This pilot study demonstrates that, with sufficient data coverage, it is possible to disentangle the time delays originating from the accretion disk and the BLR. This paves the way for effectively using inter-band continuum time delays as a method for determining the Hubble constant. Additionally, the findings provide strong support for the adopted model for the formation of the H$\beta$ line.</description>

      <title>BayeSN and SALT: A Comparison of Dust Inference Across SN Ia Light-curve Models with DES5YR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13747v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years there has been significant debate around the impact of dust on SNe Ia, a major source of uncertainty in cosmological analyses. We perform the first validation of the probabilistic hierarchical SN Ia SED model BayeSN on the conventional SALT model, an important test given the history of conflicting conclusions regarding the distributions of host galaxy dust properties between the two. Applying BayeSN to SALT-based simulations, we find that BayeSN is able to accurately recover our simulated inputs and successfully disentangle differences in dust extinction from an intrinsic mass step. This validates BayeSN as a method to identify the relative contributions of dust and intrinsic differences in explaining the mass step. When inferring dust parameters with simulated samples including non-Ia contamination, we find that our choice of photometric classifier causes a bias in the inferred dust distribution; this arises because SNe Ia heavily impacted by dust are misclassified as contaminants and excluded. We then apply BayeSN to the sample of SNe from DES5YR to jointly infer host galaxy dust distributions and intrinsic differences on either side of the `mass step' at $10^{10}$ M$\odot$. We find evidence in favour of an intrinsic contribution to the mass step and differing $R_V$ distributions. We also build on recent results supporting an environmental-dependence on the secondary maximum of SNe Ia in $i$-band. Twenty days post-peak, we find an offset in intrinsic $i$-band light curve between each mass bin at a significance in excess of $3\sigma$.</description>

      <title>So long Kolmogorov: the forward and backward turbulence cascades in a supernovae-driven, multiphase interstellar medium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09855v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interstellar medium (ISM) of disk galaxies is turbulent, and yet the fundamental nature of ISM turbulence, the energy cascade, is not understood in detail. In this study, we use high-resolution simulations of a hydrodynamical, gravitationally stratified, supernova (SNe)-driven, multiphase ISM to probe the nature of a galactic turbulence cascade. Through the use of velocity flux transfer functions split into interactions between compressible $\mathbf{u}_c$ and incompressible $\mathbf{u}_s$ modes, we show that there exists a large-to-small-scale cascade in both $\mathbf{u}_c$ and $\mathbf{u}_s$ when mediated by an additional $\mathbf{u}_s$ mode. But the $\mathbf{u}_s$ cascade is highly non-local. Moreover, there is a $\mathbf{u}_c$ mediated component of the $\mathbf{u}_s$ cascade that proceeds in the opposite direction -- an inverse cascade from small-to-large scales. The cascade feeds flux into scales well beyond the scale height, energizing the winds and fueling the direct cascades. Both the strongly non-local and the inverse $\mathbf{u}_s$ cascades happen on scales that have a power law $\mathbf{u}_s$ energy spectrum, highlighting how degenerate the spectrum is to the true underlying physical processes. We directly show that the inverse cascade comes from $\mathbf{u}_s$ modes interacting with expanding SNe remnants (SNRs) and that $\mathbf{u}_s$ modes are generated to leading order via baroclinic, highly corrugated cooling layers between warm $(T\lesssim 10^4\,\rm{K})$ and hot $(T\gg10^4\,\rm{K})$ gas in these SNRs. Finally, we outline a complete phenomenology for SNe-driven turbulence in a galactic disk, estimate a $10^{-16}\,\rm{G}$ Biermann field generated from SNR cooling layers, and highlight the strong deviations that SNe-driven turbulence has from the conventional Kolmogorov model.</description>

      <title>Structure and Dynamics of the Young Massive Star Cluster Westerlund 1</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16755v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a structural analysis of the young massive star cluster Westerlund 1 (Wd 1). With multi-epoch Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations, we measure the proper motions of $10346$ stars and determine their kinematic memberships by fitting a Gaussian mixture model to their proper motions. After correcting for extinction and completeness, we model the stellar density distribution and confirm the presence of an elongation with an eccentricity of $0.71$. The eccentricity decreases slightly with increasing mass. We fit the radial profile with the Elson, Fall, and Freeman model, observing a decrease in the core radius with increasing mass, indicative of weak but detectable mass segregation. This finding is further supported by a measured mass segregation ratio of $\Lambda_\mathrm{\rm MSR}=1.11\pm0.11$, only above $1$ by $1\sigma$, and slightly shorter minimum spanning tree length for higher mass bins. The cluster has a 1D velocity dispersion of $3.42 \pm 0.10~\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, suggesting it is subvirial. The subvirial state implies either exceptionally high star formation efficiency or inefficient stellar feedback caused by local gas expulsion before stars reach the cluster. The crossing time is $0.30$ Myr and the relaxation time is $0.26$ Gyr. Given the age of Wd 1 of $10.7$ Myr, we expect evident mass segregation for stars more massive than $10~M_\odot$, which accounts for the minor mass segregation found in the mass range of $1.00\unicode{x2013}12.14~M_\odot$ in this work. This suggests the overall mass segregation in Wd 1 is not primordial.</description>

      <title>Euclid Quick Data Release (Q1). Active galactic nuclei identification using diffusion-based inpainting of Euclid VIS images</title>

Abstract: Light emission from galaxies exhibit diverse brightness profiles, influenced by factors such as galaxy type, structural features and interactions with other galaxies. Elliptical galaxies feature more uniform light distributions, while spiral and irregular galaxies have complex, varied light profiles due to their structural heterogeneity and star-forming activity. In addition, galaxies with an active galactic nucleus (AGN) feature intense, concentrated emission from gas accretion around supermassive black holes, superimposed on regular galactic light, while quasi-stellar objects (QSO) are the extreme case of the AGN emission dominating the galaxy. The challenge of identifying AGN and QSO has been discussed many times in the literature, often requiring multi-wavelength observations. This paper introduces a novel approach to identify AGN and QSO from a single image. Diffusion models have been recently developed in the machine-learning literature to generate realistic-looking images of everyday objects. Utilising the spatial resolving power of the Euclid VIS images, we created a diffusion model trained on one million sources, without using any source pre-selection or labels. The model learns to reconstruct light distributions of normal galaxies, since the population is dominated by them. We condition the prediction of the central light distribution by masking the central few pixels of each source and reconstruct the light according to the diffusion model. We further use this prediction to identify sources that deviate from this profile by examining the reconstruction error of the few central pixels regenerated in each source's core. Our approach, solely using VIS imaging, features high completeness compared to traditional methods of AGN and QSO selection, including optical, near-infrared, mid-infrared, and X-rays.</description>

Abstract: The kinematics of star-forming galaxy populations at high redshifts are integral to our understanding of disk properties, merger rates, and other defining characteristics. Nebular gas emission is a common tracer of galaxies' gravitational potentials and angular momenta, but is sensitive to non-gravitational forces as well as galactic outflows, and thus might not accurately trace the host galaxy dynamics. We present kinematic maps of young stars from rest-ultraviolet photospheric absorption in the star-forming galaxy CASSOWARY 13 (a.k.a. SDSS J1237+5533) at $z=1.87$ using the Keck Cosmic Web Imager, alongside nebular emission measurements from the same observations. Gravitational lensing magnification of the galaxy enables good spatial sampling of multiple independent lensed images. We find close agreement between the stellar and nebular velocity fields. We measure a mean local velocity dispersion of $\sigma = 64\pm12$ km$\,$s$^{-1}$ for the young stars, consistent with that of the H II regions traced by nebular C III] emission ($52\pm9$ km$\,$s$^{-1}$). The $\sim20$ km$\,$s$^{-1}$ average difference in line-of-sight velocity is much smaller than the local velocity width and the velocity gradient ($\gtrsim 100$ km$\,$s$^{-1}$). We find no evidence of asymmetric drift nor evidence that outflows bias the nebular kinematics, and thus conclude that nebular emission appears to be a reasonable dynamical tracer of young stars in the galaxy. These results support the picture of star formation in thick disks with high velocity dispersion at $z\sim2$, and represent an important step towards establishing robust kinematics of early galaxies using collisionless tracers.</description>

      <title>The galaxy-IGM connection in THESAN: the physics connecting the IGM Lyman-$\alpha$ opacity and galaxy density in the reionization epoch</title>

Abstract: The relation between the Lyman-$\alpha$ effective optical depth of quasar sightlines ($\tau_\mathrm{los}$) and the distribution of galaxies around them is an emerging probe of the connection between the first collapsed structures and the IGM properties at the tail end of cosmic reionization. We employ the THESAN simulations to demonstrate that $\tau_\mathrm{los}$ is most sensitive to galaxies at a redshift-dependent distance, reflecting the growth of ionized regions around sources of photons and in agreement with studies of the galaxy--Lyman-$\alpha$ cross correlation. This is $d \sim 15 \, h^{-1} \, \mathrm{Mpc}$ at the tail end of reionization. The flagship THESAN run struggles to reproduce the most opaque sightlines as well as those with large galaxy densities, likely as a consequence of its limited volume. We identify a promising region of parameter space to probe with future observations in order to distinguish both the timing and sources of reionization. We present an investigation of the IGM physical conditions around opaque and transparent spectra, revealing that they probe regions that reionized inside-out and outside-in, respectively, and demonstrate that residual neutral islands at the end of reionization are not required to produce optical depths of $\tau_\mathrm{los} &gt; 4$, although they facilitate the task. Finally, we investigate the sensitivity of the aforementioned results to the nature of ionizing sources and dark matter.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Infrared Background Tomography and a Census of Cosmic Dust and Star Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05384v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The cosmic far-infrared background (CIB) encodes dust emission from all galaxies and carries valuable information on structure formation, star formation, and chemical enrichment across cosmic time. However, its redshift-dependent spectrum remains poorly constrained due to line-of-sight projection effects. We address this by cross-correlating 11 far-infrared intensity maps spanning a 50-fold frequency range from Planck, Herschel, and IRAS, with spectroscopic galaxies and quasars from SDSS I-IV tomographically. We mitigate foregrounds using CSFD, a CIB-free Milky Way dust map. These cross-correlation amplitudes on two-halo scales trace bias-weighted CIB redshift distributions and collectively yield a $60\sigma$ detection of the evolving CIB spectrum, sampled across hundreds of rest-frame frequencies over $0 &lt; z &lt; 4$. We break the bias-intensity degeneracy by adding monopole information from FIRAS+Planck. The recovered spectrum reveals a dust temperature distribution that is broad, spanning the full range of host environments, and moderately evolving. Using low-frequency CIB amplitudes, we constrain cosmic dust density, $\Omega_{\rm dust}$, which peaks at $z = 1$-$1.5$ and declines threefold to the present. Our broad spectral coverage enables a determination of the total infrared luminosity density to 0.04 dex statistical precision, tracing star-formation history with negligible cosmic variance across 90% of cosmic time. We find that cosmic star formation is 80% dust-obscured at $z = 0$ and 60% at $z = 4$. Our results, based on intensity mapping, are complete, requiring no extrapolation to faint galaxies or low-surface-brightness components. We release our tomographic CIB spectrum and redshift distributions as a public resource for future studies of the CIB, both as a cosmological matter tracer and CMB foreground.</description>
