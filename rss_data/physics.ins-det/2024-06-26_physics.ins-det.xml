      <title>Modeling Frequency Shifts in Small-Scale Beams with Multiple Eccentric Masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studying the dynamics of small-scale beams with attached particles is crucial for sensing applications in various fields, such as bioscience, material science, energy storage devices, and environmental monitoring. Here, a stress-driven nonlocal model is presented for the free transverse vibration of small-scale beams carrying multiple masses taking into account the eccentricity of the masses relative to the beam axis. The results show excellent agreement with the experimental and numerical data in the literature. New insights into the frequency shifts and mode shapes of the first four vibrational modes of stress-driven nonlocal beams with up to three attached particles are presented. The study investigates the inverse problem of detecting the location and mass of an attached particle based on natural frequency shifts. The knowledge acquired from the present study provides valuable guidance for the design and analysis of ultrasensitive mechanical mass sensors.</description>

      <title>UV hybrid photon detector based on GaN photocathodes and Si low gain avalanche diode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photon detectors featuring single-photon sensitivity play a crucial role in various scientific domains, including high-energy physics, astronomy, and quantum optics. Fast response time, high quantum efficiency, and minimal dark counts are the characteristics that render them ideal candidates for detecting individual photons with exceptional signal-to-noise ratios, at frequencies in the the range of hundreds of MHz. Here, we report on our first design and operational results on a Hybrid Photon Detector (HPD) that combines the high quantum efficiency of a Gallium Nitride (GaN) photocathode and the low noise characteristics of a Si-based Low-Gain Avalanche Diode (LGAD). This hybrid detection scheme has the potential to reach single-photon detection sensitivity with high quantum efficiency, low noise levels and capable of operating at hundreds of MHz repetition rates.</description>

      <title>Studying single-electron traps in newly fabricated Skipper-CCDs for the Oscura experiment using the pocket-pumping technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding and characterizing very low-energy ($\sim$eV) background sources is a must in rare-event searches. Oscura, an experiment aiming to probe electron recoils from sub-GeV dark matter using a 10-kg skipper-CCD detector, has recently fabricated its first two batches of sensors. In this work, we present the characterization of defects/contaminants identified in the buried-channel region of these newly fabricated skipper-CCDs. These defects/contaminants produce deferred charge from trap emission in the images next to particle tracks, which can be spatially resolved due to the sub-electron resolution achieved with these sensors. Using the trap-pumping technique, we measured the energy and cross section associated to these traps in three Oscura prototype sensors from different fabrication batches which underwent different gettering methods during fabrication. Results suggest that the type of defects/contaminants is more closely linked to the fabrication batch rather than to the gettering method used. The exposure-dependent single-electron rate (SER) of one of these sensors was measured $\sim$100~m underground, yielding $(1.8\pm 0.3)\times10^{-3}~e^-$/pix/day at 131K. The impact of the identified traps on the measured exposure-dependent SER is evaluated via a Monte Carlo simulation. Results suggest that the exposure-dependent SER of Oscura prototype sensors would be lower in lower background environments as expected.</description>

      <title>Multi-heterodyne differential absorption lidar based on dual-comb spectroscopy for simultaneous greenhouse gas and wind speed measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a recent study [1], we demonstrated a multi-heterodyne differential absorption lidar (DIAL) for greenhouse gas monitoring utilizing solid targets. The multi-frequency absorption measurement was achieved using electro-optic dual-comb spectroscopy (DCS) with a minimal number of comb teeth to maximize the optical power per tooth. In this work, we examine the lidar's working principle and architecture. Additionally, we present measurements of atmospheric CO2 at 1572 nm over a 1.4 km optical path conducted in summer 2023. Furthermore, we show that, due to the high power per comb tooth, multi-frequency Doppler wind speed measurements can be performed using the DCS signal from aerosol backscattering. This enables simultaneous radial wind speed and path-average gas concentration measurements, offering promising prospects for novel concepts of tunable multi-frequency lidar systems capable of simultaneously monitoring wind speed and gas concentrations.

      <title>Autoencoder-based Anomaly Detection System for Online Data Quality Monitoring of the CMS Electromagnetic Calorimeter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10157v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The CMS detector is a general-purpose apparatus that detects high-energy collisions produced at the LHC. Online Data Quality Monitoring of the CMS electromagnetic calorimeter is a vital operational tool that allows detector experts to quickly identify, localize, and diagnose a broad range of detector issues that could affect the quality of physics data. A real-time autoencoder-based anomaly detection system using semi-supervised machine learning is presented enabling the detection of anomalies in the CMS electromagnetic calorimeter data. A novel method is introduced which maximizes the anomaly detection performance by exploiting the time-dependent evolution of anomalies as well as spatial variations in the detector response. The autoencoder-based system is able to efficiently detect anomalies, while maintaining a very low false discovery rate. The performance of the system is validated with anomalies found in 2018 and 2022 LHC collision data. Additionally, the first results from deploying the autoencoder-based system in the CMS online Data Quality Monitoring workflow during the beginning of Run 3 of the LHC are presented, showing its ability to detect issues missed by the existing system.</description>

      <title>Comparison of Methods to Determine the Fluence of Monoenergetic Neutrons in the Energy Range from 30 keV to 14.8 MeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18694v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The primary reference instruments for neutron fluence measurements used at the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) are based on the primary standard for neutron measurements which is the differential neutron-proton scattering cross section. Such instruments require considerable effort for their operation and analysis. Therefore, routine measurements are carried out using a transfer instrument to facilitate the efficient provision of services to customers. A series of measurements was conducted to compare the transfer device to the primary reference instruments and ensure the traceability of neutron fluence measurements. This resulted in an improved characterization of the instrument and new analysis procedures.</description>

      <title>Design Space Exploration for Particle Detector Read-out Implementations in Matlab and Simulink on the Example of the SHiP SBT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03122v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: On a very fundamental level, particle detectors share similar requirements for their read-out chain. This is reflected in the way that typical read-out solutions are developed, where a previous design is taken and modified to fit some changes in requirements. One of the two common approaches is the current-based read-out, where the waveform of the sensor output is sampled in order to later extract information from there. This approach is used in many detector applications using scintillation based detectors, including PET. With this contribution, we will introduce how we use Matlab in order to simulate the read-out electronics of particle detectors. We developed this simulation approach as a base for our ongoing development of software-defined read-out ASICs that cover the requirements of a variety of particle detector types. Simulink was chosen as a base for our developments as it allows simulation of mixed-signal systems and comes with built-in toolkits to aid in developments of such systems. With our approach, we want to take a new look at how we approach designing such a read-out, with a focus on digital signal processing close to the sensor, making use of known signal characteristics and modern methods of communications engineering. We are taking into account the time profile of an event, the bandwidth-limiting properties of the sensor and attached electronics, digitization stages and finally the parameterization of approaches for digital processing of the signal. We will show how we are applying the design approach to the development of a read-out for the proposed SHiP SBT detector, which is a scintillation based detector relying on SiPMs sensors, using this as an example for our modelling approach and show preliminary results.</description>

      <title>Water-based Quantum Dots Liquid Scintillator for Particle Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10122v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Liquid scintillators are typically composed from organic compounds dissolved in organic solvents. However, usage of such material is often restricted due to fire safety and environmental reasons. Because of this, R\&amp;D of water-based liquid scintillators is of extreme relevance; yet, no such scintillators have been made commercially available as yet. Here, we investigate an alternative, water-based quantum dots liquid scintillator. Pre-determined and controllable optical properties of the quantum dots, as well as the existence of large libraries of established protocols for their dispersion in aqueous solutions, make them an attractive option for nuclear and particle physics applications. We characterize the optical properties of water-based quantum dots liquid scintillator and find that most of its optical properties are preserved upon quantum dots' phase transfer into water, through the addition of an oleic acid hydrophilic layer. Using the developed scintillator, the time and charge responses from atmospheric muons are measured, highlighting the practical viability of water-based quantum dots liquid scintillators for nuclear and particle physics, special interest on neutrino physics.</description>

      <title>Evidence for polyimide redeposition and possible correlation with sparks in Gas Electron Multipliers working in CF$_4$ mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12873v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Research on aging processes of Gas Electron Multipliers (GEMs) is important to obtain insights on how to increase the detector's longevity, stability, and performance, as highlighted in the latest developments roadmap by the European Council of Future Accelerators (ECFA). One key aspect of the aging process is the deposit formation on the electrodes surfaces. In this work, through the analysis of the molecular content on the surface of a used GEM, we provide evidence for polyimide redeposition as a source of organic material contributing to the formation of insulating layers on the electrodes, which eventually lead to sparks and detector failure. Furthermore, we show that chromium, used to promote adhesion between copper and polyimide, in the device undergoes a diffusion process, effectively blurring the layered structure. We demonstrate the significance of surface-sensitive chemical analysis to investigate the surface deposits on electrodes of gaseous detectors and our results reveal the necessity of standardization and more stringent study protocols.</description>
