      <title>Galois theory of differential schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since 1883, Picard-Vessiot theory had been developed as the Galois theory of differential field extensions associated to linear differential equations. Inspired by categorical Galois theory of Janelidze, and by using novel methods of precategorical descent applied to algebraic-geometric situations, we develop a Galois theory that applies to morphisms of differential schemes, and vastly generalises the linear Picard-Vessiot theory, as well as the strongly normal theory of Kolchin.</description>

      <title>Singular symplectic surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we classify all singular irreducible symplectic surfaces, i.e., compact, connected complex surfaces with canonical singularities that have a holomorphic symplectic form $\sigma$ on the smooth locus, and for which every finite quasi-\'etale covering has the algebra of reflexive forms spanned by the reflexive pull-back of $\sigma$. We moreover prove that the Hilbert scheme of two points on such a surface $X$ is an irreducible symplectic variety, at least in the case where the smooth locus of $X$ is simply connected.</description>

      <title>Enumerating Finite Braid Group Orbits on $SL_2(\C)$-Character Varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze finite orbits of the natural braid group action on the character variety of the $n$ times punctured sphere. Building on recent results relating middle convolution and finite complex reflection groups, our work implements Katz's middle convolution to explicitly classify finite orbits in the $SL_2(\C)$-character variety of the punctured sphere. We provide theoretical results on the existence of finite orbits arising from the imprimitive finite complex reflection groups and formulas for constructing such examples when they exist. In the primitive finite complex reflection groups, we perform an exhaustive search and provide computational results. Our contributions also include Magma computer code for middle convolution and for computing the orbit under this action when it is known to be finite.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Classical McKay Correspondence, Derived Equivalences and the Spectrum of Kleinian Surface Singularities: A Look Through the Mirror</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we revisit the classical McKay correspondence via homological mirror symmetry. Specifically, we demonstrate how this correspondence can be articulated as a derived equivalence between the category of vanishing cycles associated with a Kleinian surface singularity and the category of perfect complexes on the corresponding quotient orbifold. We further illustrate how this equivalence allows for the interpretation of the spectrum of a Kleinian surface singularity solely in terms of the representation-theoretic data of the associated binary polyhedral group.</description>

      <title>Towards refined curve counting on the Enriques surface I: K-theoretic refinements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conjecture an explicit formula for the $K$-theoretically refined Vafa-Witten invariants of the Enriques surface. By a wall-crossing argument the conjecture is equivalent to a new conjectural formula for the K-theoretically refined Pandharipande-Thomas invariants of the local Enriques surface. Evidence for the conjecture is given in several cases. We also comment on the case of K3 surfaces previously studied by Thomas.</description>

      <title>On odd powers of nonnegative polynomials that are not sums of squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We initiate a systematic study of nonnegative polynomials $P$ such that $P^k$ is not a sum of squares for any odd $k\geq 1$, calling such $P$ \emph{stubborn}. We develop a new invariant of a real isolated zero of a nonnegative polynomial in the plane, that we call \emph{the SOS-invariant}, and relate it to the well-known delta invariant of a plane curve singularity. Using the SOS-invariant we show that any polynomial that spans an extreme ray of the convex cone of nonnegative ternary forms of degree 6 is stubborn. We also show how to use the SOS-invariant to prove stubbornness of ternary forms in higher degree. Furthermore, we prove that in a given degree and number of variables, nonnegative polynomials that are not stubborn form a convex cone, whose interior consists of all strictly positive polynomials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Hodge bundle $\omega$ over a modular curve is a square-root of the canonical bundle twisted by the cuspidal divisor, or a theta characteristic, due to the Kodaira--Spencer isomorphism. We prove that, in most cases, a section of a theta characteristic $\nu$ (or any odd power of it) different from $\omega$ is a noncongruence modular form. On the other hand, we show how $\nu\ne\omega$ gives rise to a ``twisted'' analogue of the diagonal period map to a Siegel threefold, whose difference attributes to the stackiness of the moduli of abelian surfaces $\mathcal{A}_{2}$. Some questions on the Brill--Noether theory of the modular curves are answered.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20154v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We characterize the families of bialgebras or Hopf algebras over fields for which the product in the corresponding category is finite-dimensional, answering a question of M. Lorenz: if the ground field is infinite then bialgebra or Hopf products are finite-dimensional precisely when the factors are, with at most one of dimension $&gt;1$; over finite fields the necessary and sufficient condition is instead that factors be finite-dimensional with at most finitely many of dimension $&gt;1$; finally, these statements hold for coalgebras as well, provided the family is finite. We also characterize (a) finite field extensions as precisely those whose underlying scalar extension functor preserves coalgebra, or bialgebra, or Hopf algebra products (correcting an error in the literature); (b) algebraic field extensions as those along which finite coalgebra (bialgebra, Hopf algebra) products are preserved; and (c) again algebraic field extensions as precisely those which intertwine cofree coalgebras on vector spaces, or cofree bialgebras (Hopf algebras) on algebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give several formulas for how Iwasawa $\mu$-invariants of abelian varieties over unramified $\mathbb{Z}_{p}$-extensions of function fields change under isogeny. These are analogues of Schneider's formula in the number field setting. We also prove that the validity of the Birch--Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture (including the leading coefficient formula) over function fields is invariant under isogeny, without using the result of Kato--Trihan.</description>

Abstract: We prove a splitting formula that reconstructs the logarithmic Gromov- Witten invariants of simple normal crossing varieties from the punctured Gromov- Witten invariants of their irreducible components, under the assumption of the gluing strata being toric varieties. The formula is based on the punctured Gromov-Witten theory developed in arXiv:2009.07720.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.17938v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let X be the blow-up of the projective plane in a finite set of very general points. We deduce from the work of Uehara that X has only standard autoequivalences, no nontrivial Fourier-Mukai partners, and admits no spherical objects. If X is the blow-up of the projective plane in 9 very general points, we provide an alternate and direct proof of the corresponding statement. Further, we show that the same result holds if X is a blow-up of finitely many points in a minimal surface of nonnegative Kodaira dimension which contains no (-2)-curves. Independently, we characterize spherical objects on blow-ups of minimal surfaces of positive Kodaira dimension.</description>

Abstract: We compute the integral Grothendieck rings of the moduli stacks, $\mathcal{M}_2$, $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_2$ of smooth and stable curves of genus two respectively. We compute $K_0(\mathcal{M}_2)$ by using the presentation of $\mathcal{M}_2$ as a global quotient stack given by Vistoli. To compute the Grothendieck ring $K_0(\overline{\mathcal{M}}_2)$ we decompose $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_2$ as $\Delta_1$ and its complement $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_2 \setminus \Delta_1$ and use their presentations as quotient stacks given by Larson to compute their Grothendieck rings. We show that they are torsion-free and this, together with the Riemann-Roch isomorphism allows to ultimately give a presentation for the integral Grothendieck ring $K_0(\overline{\mathcal{M}}_2)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1904.10491v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let G be a split semi-simple adjoint group, and S a colored decorated surface, given by an oriented surface with punctures, special boundary points, and a specified collection of boundary intervals.
  We introduce a moduli space P(G,S) parametrizing G-local system on S with some boundary data, and prove that it carries a cluster Poisson structure, equivariant under the action of the cluster modular group M(G,S), containing the mapping class group of S, the group of outer automorphisms of G, and the product of Weyl / braid groups over punctures / boundary components. We prove that the dual moduli space A(G,S) carries a M(G,S)-equivariant cluster structure, and the pair (A(G,S), P(G,S)) is a cluster ensemble. These results generalize the works of V. Fock &amp; the first author, and of I. Le.
  We quantize cluster Poisson varieties X for any Planck constant h s.t. h&gt;0 or |h|=1. First, we define a *-algebra structure on the Langlands modular double A(h; X) of the algebra of functions on X. We construct a principal series of representations of the *-algebra A(h; X), equivariant under a unitary projective representation of the cluster modular group M(X). This extends works of V. Fock and the first author when h&gt;0.
  Combining this, we get a M(G,S)-equivariant quantization of the moduli space P(G,S), given by the *-algebra A(h; P(G,S)) and its principal series representations. We construct realizations of the principal series *-representations. In particular, when S is punctured disc with two special points, we get a principal series *-representations of the Langlands modular double of the quantum group Uq(g).
  We conjecture that there is a nondegenerate pairing between the local system of coinvariants of oscillatory representations of the W-algebra and the one provided by the projective representation of the mapping class group of S.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.11739v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We call a non-trivial homology sphere a Kirby-Ramanujam sphere if it bounds both a homology plane and a Mazur or Po\'enaru manifold. In 1980, Kirby found the first example by proving that the boundary of the Ramanujam surface bounds a Mazur manifold and it has remained a single example since then. By tracing their initial step, we provide the first additional examples and we present three infinite families of Kirby-Ramanujam spheres. Also, we show that one of our families of Kirby-Ramanujam spheres is diffeomorphic to the splice of two certain families of Brieskorn spheres. Since this family of Kirby-Ramanujam spheres bound contractible $4$-manifolds, they lie in the class of the trivial element in the homology cobordism group; however, both splice components are separately linearly independent in that group.</description>

Abstract: We first prove Bosch-L\"utkebohmert-Raynaud's conjectures on existence of global N\'eron models of not necessarily semi-abelian algebraic groups in the perfect residue fields case. We then give a counterexample to the existence in the imperfect residue fields case. Finally, as a complement to the conjectures, we classify unirational wound unipotent groups "up to relative perfection", again in the perfect residue fields case. The key ingredient for all these is the duality for relatively perfect unipotent groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06610v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that, over an arbitrary commutative ring, the localizations of the categories of dg categories, of cohomologically unital, of unital and of strictly unital $A_\infty$ categories with respect to the corresponding classes of quasi-equivalences are all equivalent. The result is proven at the $\infty$-categorical level by considering the natural $\infty$-categorical models of the categories above. As an application, we provide a new proof of the existence of internal Homs for the homotopy category of dg categories in terms of the category of unital $A_\infty$ functors, thus yielding a complete proof of a claim by Kontsevich and Keller.</description>

Abstract: The generic link of an unmixed radical ideal is radical (in fact, prime). We show that the squarefreeness of the initial ideal and $F$-purity are, however, not preserved along generic links. On the flip side, for several important cases in liaison theory, including generic height three Gorenstein ideals and the maximal minors of a generic matrix, we show that the squarefreeness of the initial ideal, $F$-purity, and the $F$-pure threshold are each preserved along generic links by identifying a property of such ideals which propagates along generic links. We use this property to establish the $F$-regularity of the generic links of such ideals. Finally, we study the $F$-pure threshold of the generic residual intersections of a complete intersection ideal and answer a related question of Kim--Miller--Niu.</description>

      <title>The syzygy distinguisher</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15740v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new distinguisher for alternant and Goppa codes, whose complexity is subexponential in the error-correcting capability, hence better than that of generic decoding algorithms. Moreover it does not suffer from the strong regime limitations of the previous distinguishers or structure recovery algorithms: in particular, it applies to the codes used in the Classic McEliece candidate for postquantum cryptography standardization. The invariants that allow us to distinguish are graded Betti numbers of the homogeneous coordinate ring of a shortening of the dual code.
  Since its introduction in 1978, this is the first time an analysis of the McEliece cryptosystem breaks the exponential barrier.</description>
