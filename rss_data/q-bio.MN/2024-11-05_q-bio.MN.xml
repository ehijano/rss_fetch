      <title>LLaMo: Large Language Model-based Molecular Graph Assistant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable generalization and instruction-following capabilities with instruction tuning. The advancements in LLMs and instruction tuning have led to the development of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). However, the competency of the LLMs and instruction tuning have been less explored in the molecular domain. Thus, we propose LLaMo: Large Language Model-based Molecular graph assistant, which is an end-to-end trained large molecular graph-language model. To bridge the discrepancy between the language and graph modalities, we present the multi-level graph projector that transforms graph representations into graph tokens by abstracting the output representations of each GNN layer and motif representations with the cross-attention mechanism. We also introduce machine-generated molecular graph instruction data to instruction-tune the large molecular graph-language model for general-purpose molecule and language understanding. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that LLaMo shows the best performance on diverse tasks, such as molecular description generation, property prediction, and IUPAC name prediction. The code of LLaMo is available at https://github.com/mlvlab/LLaMo.</description>

      <title>Multiplex Imaging Analysis in Pathology: a Comprehensive Review on Analytical Approaches and Digital Toolkits</title>

Abstract: Conventional histopathology has long been essential for disease diagnosis, relying on visual inspection of tissue sections. Immunohistochemistry aids in detecting specific biomarkers but is limited by its single-marker approach, restricting its ability to capture the full tissue environment. The advent of multiplexed imaging technologies, like multiplexed immunofluorescence and spatial transcriptomics, allows for simultaneous visualization of multiple biomarkers in a single section, enhancing morphological data with molecular and spatial information. This provides a more comprehensive view of the tissue microenvironment, cellular interactions, and disease mechanisms - crucial for understanding disease progression, prognosis, and treatment response. However, the extensive data from multiplexed imaging necessitates sophisticated computational methods for preprocessing, segmentation, feature extraction, and spatial analysis. These tools are vital for managing large, multidimensional datasets, converting raw imaging data into actionable insights. By automating labor-intensive tasks and enhancing reproducibility and accuracy, computational tools are pivotal in diagnostics and research. This review explores the current landscape of multiplexed imaging in pathology, detailing workflows and key technologies like PathML, an AI-powered platform that streamlines image analysis, making complex dataset interpretation accessible for clinical and research settings.</description>

      <title>Pin-Tuning: Parameter-Efficient In-Context Tuning for Few-Shot Molecular Property Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular property prediction (MPP) is integral to drug discovery and material science, but often faces the challenge of data scarcity in real-world scenarios. Addressing this, few-shot molecular property prediction (FSMPP) has been developed. Unlike other few-shot tasks, FSMPP typically employs a pre-trained molecular encoder and a context-aware classifier, benefiting from molecular pre-training and molecular context information. Despite these advancements, existing methods struggle with the ineffective fine-tuning of pre-trained encoders. We attribute this issue to the imbalance between the abundance of tunable parameters and the scarcity of labeled molecules, and the lack of contextual perceptiveness in the encoders. To overcome this hurdle, we propose a parameter-efficient in-context tuning method, named Pin-Tuning. Specifically, we propose a lightweight adapter for pre-trained message passing layers (MP-Adapter) and Bayesian weight consolidation for pre-trained atom/bond embedding layers (Emb-BWC), to achieve parameter-efficient tuning while preventing over-fitting and catastrophic forgetting. Additionally, we enhance the MP-Adapters with contextual perceptiveness. This innovation allows for in-context tuning of the pre-trained encoder, thereby improving its adaptability for specific FSMPP tasks. When evaluated on public datasets, our method demonstrates superior tuning with fewer trainable parameters, improving few-shot predictive performance.</description>

      <title>Graph Frequency Features of Cancer Gene Co-Expression Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06747v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Complex gene interactions play a significant role in cancer progression, driving cellular behaviors that contribute to tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis. Gene co-expression networks model the functional connectivity between genes under various biological conditions. Understanding the system-level evolution of these networks in cancer is critical for elucidating disease mechanisms and informing the development of targeted therapies. While previous studies have primarily focused on structural differences between cancer and normal cell co-expression networks, this study applies graph frequency analysis to cancer transcriptomic signals defined on gene co-expression networks, highlighting the graph spectral characteristics of cancer systems. Using a range of graph frequency filters, we showed that cancer cells display distinctive patterns in the graph frequency content of their gene transcriptomic signals, effectively distinguishing between cancer types and stages. The transformation of the original gene feature space into the graph spectral space captured more intricate cancer properties, as validated by significantly higher F-statistic scores for graph frequency-filtered gene features compared to those in the original space.</description>

      <title>Modular control of Boolean network models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12477v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The concept of control is crucial for effectively understanding and applying biological network models. Key structural features relate to control functions through gene regulation, signaling, or metabolic mechanisms, and computational models need to encode these. Applications often focus on model-based control, such as in biomedicine or metabolic engineering. In a recent paper, the authors developed a theoretical framework of modularity in Boolean networks, which lead to a canonical semidirect product decomposition of these systems. In this paper, we present an approach to model-based control that exploits this modular structure, as well as the canalizing features of the regulatory mechanisms. We show how to identify control strategies from the individual modules, and we present a criterion based on canalizing features of the regulatory rules to identify modules that do not contribute to network control and can be excluded. For even moderately sized networks, finding global control inputs is computationally challenging. Our modular approach leads to an efficient approach to solving this problem. We apply it to a published Boolean network model of blood cancer large granular lymphocyte (T-LGL) leukemia to identify a minimal control set that achieves a desired control objective.</description>
