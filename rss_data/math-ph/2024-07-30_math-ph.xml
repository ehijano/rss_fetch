      <title>Cauchy's invariants revisited. An alternative variational proof</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is two-fold. First, to provide a straightforward proof of the Cauchy's invariants (CIs) from the particle relabeling symmetry of the action functional for rotational barotropic flows, using pure geometric relabeling. Second, to emphasize the central role of CIs in the study of rotational flows. The first goal is achieved by introducing a new variational approach for derivivg invariants from symmetries, which, when applied to the Lagrangian action of rotational flows, leads to a simple and natural proof of CIs. The second goal is clarified by showing that all important conservation theorems of rotational flows, either local or integral, are simple consequences of CIs.</description>

      <title>Dynamical localization for random scattering zippers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article establishes a proof of dynamical localization for a random scattering zipper model. The scattering zipper operator is the product of two unitary by blocks operators, multiplicatively perturbed on the left and right by random unitary phases. One of the operator is shifted so that this configuration produces a random 5-diagonal unitary operator per blocks. To prove the dynamical localization for this operator, we use the method of fractional moments. We first prove the continuity and strict positivity of the Lyapunov exponents in an annulus around the unit circle, which leads to the exponential decay of a power of the norm of the products of transfer matrices. We then establish an explicit formulation of the coefficients of the finite resolvent from the coefficients of the transfer matrices using Schur's complement. From this we deduce, through two reduction results, the exponential decay of the resolvent, from which we get the dynamical localization after proving that it also implies the exponential decay of moments of order $2$ of the resolvent.</description>

      <title>GUE via Frobenius Manifolds. II. Loop Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A theorem of Dubrovin establishes the relationship between the GUE partition function and the partition function of Gromov-Witten invariants of the complex projective line. Based on this theorem we derive loop equations for the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE) partition function. We show that the GUE partition function is equal to part of the topological partition function of the non-linear Schr\"odinger (NLS) Frobenius manifold.</description>

      <title>Dimers and M-Curves: Limit Shapes from Riemann Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a general approach for the study of dimer model limit shape problems via variational and integrable systems techniques. In particular we deduce the limit shape of the Aztec diamond and the hexagon for quasi-periodic weights through purely variational techniques.
  Putting an M-curve at the center of the construction allows one to define weights and algebro-geometric structures describing the behavior of the corresponding dimer model. We extend the quasi-periodic setup of our previous paper [7] to include a diffeomorphism from the spectral data to the liquid region of the dimer.
  Our novel method of proof is purely variational and exploits a duality between the dimer height function and its dual magnetic tension minimizer and applies to dimers with gas regions. We apply this to the Aztec diamond and hexagon domains to obtain explicit expressions for the complex structure of the liquid region of the dimer as well as the height function and its dual.
  We compute the weights and the limit shapes numerically using the Schottky uniformization technique. Simulations and predicted results match completely.</description>

      <title>Gelfand-Dickey Realizations of the supersymmetric classical W-algebras for $\mathfrak{gl}(n+1|n)$ and $\mathfrak{gl}(n|n)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we realize the supersymmetric classical $W$-algebras $\mathcal{W}(\overline{\mathfrak{gl}}(n+1|n))$ and $\mathcal{W}(\overline{\mathfrak{gl}}(n|n))$ as differential algebras generated by the coefficients of a monic superdifferential operator $L$. In the case of $\mathcal{W}(\overline{\mathfrak{gl}}(n|n))$ (resp. $\mathcal{W}(\overline{\mathfrak{gl}}(n+1|n))$) this operator is even (resp. odd). We show that the supersymmetric Poisson vertex algebra bracket on these supersymmetric W-algebras is the supersymmetric analogue of the quadratic Gelfand-Dickey bracket associated to the operator $L$. Finally, we construct integrable hierarchies of evolutionary Hamiltonian PDEs on both W-algebras. A key observation is that to construct these hierarchies on the algebra $\mathcal{W}(\overline{\mathfrak{gl}}(n+1|n))$ one needs to introduce a new concept of even supersymmetric Poisson vertex algebras.</description>

      <title>Graded colour Lie superalgebras for solving L\'evy-Leblond equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The L\'evy-Leblond equation with free potential admits a symmetry algebra that is a $ \mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_2 $-graded colour Lie superalgebra (see arXiv:1609.08224). We extend this result in two directions by considering a time-independent version of the L\'evy-Leblond equation. First, we construct a $ \mathbb{Z}_2^3 $-graded colour Lie superalgebra containing operators that leave the eigenspaces invariant and demonstrate the utility of this algebra in constructing general solutions for the free equation. Second, we find that the ladder operators for the harmonic oscillator generate a $ \mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_2 $-graded colour Lie superalgebra and we use the operators from this algebra to compute the spectrum. These results illustrate two points: the L\'evy-Leblond equation admits colour Lie superalgebras with gradings higher than $ \mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_2 $ and colour Lie superalgebras appear for potentials besides the free potential.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08945v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We survey on-shell and off-shell higher derivative supergravities in dimensions $1\le D\le 11$. Various approaches to their construction, including the Noether procedure, (harmonic) superspace, superform method, superconformal tensor calculus, $S$-matrix and dimensional reduction, are summarized. Primarily the bosonic parts of the invariants and the supertransformations of the fermionic fields are provided. The process of going on-shell, solutions to the Killing spinor equations, typical supersymmetric solutions, and the role of duality symmetries in the context of $R^4, D^4 R^4$ and $D^6 R^4$ invariants are reviewed.</description>

      <title>Freeness for tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We pursue the current developments in random tensor theory by laying the foundations of a free probability theory for tensors and establish its relevance in the study of random tensors of high dimension. We give a definition of freeness associated to a collection of tensors of possibly different orders. Our definition reduces to the usual freeness when only tensors of order 2 are concerned. We define the free cumulants which are associated to this notion of tensor freeness. We prove that the basic models of random tensors are asymptotically free as the dimension goes to infinity. On the way, we establish Schwinger-Dyson loop equations associated to random tensors.</description>

      <title>Classical Solutions of Higher Dimensional Einstein-Maxwell-Higgs System With Nontrivial Potential: Global Existence and Completeness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Cauchy problem of higher dimensional Einstein-Maxwell-Higgs system in the framework of Bondi coordinates. As a first step, the problem is reduced to a single first-order integro-differential equation by defining a generalized ansatz function. Then, we employ contraction mapping to show that there exists the unique fixed point of the problem. For a given small initial data, we prove the existence of a global classical solution. Finally, by introducing local mass and local charge functions in higher dimensions, we also show the completeness property of the spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Quantum Hall Edges Beyond the Plasma Analogy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the plasma analogy is generally unreliable at predicting the edge properties of quantum Hall (QH) states, as it fails to account for the local edge velocity. This discrepancy arises from a fundamental difference between QH droplets and Coulomb gases (CGs): the former are incompressible liquids subject to area-preserving deformations, while the latter are governed by electrostatics and thus involve conformal transformations. We illustrate this QH/CG mismatch across various examples and show its impact on physical quantities, measurable in both solid-state samples and quantum simulators. Specifically, we discuss fluctuations of local observables and their connection to state-of-the-art microwave absorption experiments.</description>

      <title>A Relationship Between Nonphysical Quasi-probabilities and Nonlocality Objectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19061v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Density matrices are the most general descriptions of quantum states, covering both pure and mixed states. Positive semidefiniteness is a physical requirement of density matrices, imposing nonnegative probabilities of measuring physical values. Separately, nonlocality is a property shared by some bipartite quantum systems, indicating a correlation of the component parts that cannot be described by local classical variables. In this work, we show that breaking the positive-semidefinite requirement and allowing states with a negative minimal eigenvalue arbitrarily close to zero, allows for the construction of states that are nonlocal under one component labelling but local when the labelling is interchanged. This is an observer-dependent nonlocality, showing the connection between nonlocal objectivism and negative quasi-probabilities.</description>

      <title>On orthogonal decompositions of hermitian Higgs bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An hermitian Higgs bundle is a triple $({\mathfrak E},h) = (E,\Phi, h)$, where ${\mathfrak E}=(E,\Phi)$ is a Higgs bundle \cite{Simpson} and $(E,h)$ is a holomorphic hermitian vector bundle \cite{Kobayashi}. As it is well known, several results on holomorphic vector bundles can be extended to the Higgs bundles setting. In this article we show that some classical propositions, involving orthogonal decompositions of holomorphic hermitian vector bundles and the second fundamental form of its holomorphic subbundles, can be extended to hermitian Higgs bundles. The extended results concerning orthogonal decompositions have immediate applications in Higgs bundles, and we include them in the form of two corollaries. The extended results concerning the second fundamental form are previously known in literature \cite{Bruzzo-Granha}. Here we revisit these results and include alternative proofs without using local computations.</description>

      <title>Exchangeable arrays and integrable systems for characteristic polynomials of random matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The joint moments of the derivatives of the characteristic polynomial of a random unitary matrix, and also a variant of the characteristic polynomial that is real on the unit circle, in the large matrix size limit, have been studied intensively in the past twenty five years, partly in relation to conjectural connections to the Riemann zeta-function and Hardy's function. We completely settle the most general version of the problem of convergence of these joint moments, after they are suitably rescaled, for an arbitrary number of derivatives and with arbitrary positive real exponents. Our approach relies on a hidden, higher-order exchangeable structure, that of an exchangeable array. Using these probabilistic techniques, we then give a combinatorial formula for the leading order coefficient in the asymptotics of the joint moments, when the power on the characteristic polynomial itself is a positive real number and the exponents of the derivatives are integers, in terms of a finite number of finite-dimensional integrals which are explicitly computable. Finally, we develop a method, based on a class of Hankel determinants shifted by partitions, that allows us to give an exact representation of all these joint moments, for finite matrix size, in terms of derivatives of Painlev\'e V transcendents, and then for the leading order coefficient in the large-matrix limit in terms of derivatives of the $\sigma$-Painlev\'e III' equation. This gives an efficient way to compute all these moments and coefficients explicitly. Our methods can be used to obtain analogous results for a number of other models sharing the same features.</description>

      <title>Solutions of Friedmann's Equations and Cosmological Consequences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Einstein equations of general relativity reduce, when the spacetime metric is of the Friedmann--Lemaitre--Robertson--Walker type governing an isotropic and homogeneous universe, to the Friedmann equations, which is a set of nonlinear ordinary differential equations, determining the law of evolution of the spatial scale factor, in terms of the Hubble ``constant''.
  It is a challenging task, not always possible, to solve these equations. In this talk, we present some insights from solving and analyzing the Friedmann equations and their implications to evolutionary cosmology. In particular, in the Chaplygin fluid universe, we derive a universal formula for the asymptotic exponential growth rate of the scale factor which indicates that, as far as there is a tiny presence of nonlinear (exotic) matter, linear (conventional) matter makes contribution to the dark energy, which becomes significant near the phantom divide line.

      <description>arXiv:2407.19268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we explore the effects of a Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) on Schwarzschild black hole. In particular, we incorporate the effects of GUP into the Parikh-Wilczek tunneling process for Hawking radiation. To this effect, we observe that results obtained due to GUP correction resemble that of the Reissner-Nordstr\"{om} black hole, showing similarities to the nature of an electric charge. We also find that, within this framework, the emission is not purely thermal, thus addressing the information loss problem through the correlation function.</description>

Abstract: Employing the spin-wave formalism within and beyond the harmonic-oscillator approximation, we study the dynamic structure factors of spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ nearest-neighbor quantum Heisenberg antiferromagnets on two-dimensional quasiperiodic lattices with particular emphasis on a magnetic analog to the well-known confined states of a hopping Hamiltonian for independent electrons on a two-dimensional Penrose lattice. We present comprehensive calculations on the $\mathbf{C}_{5\mathrm{v}}$ Penrose tiling in comparison with the $\mathbf{C}_{8\mathrm{v}}$ Ammann-Beenker tiling, revealing their decagonal and octagonal antiferromagnetic microstructures. Their dynamic spin structure factors both exhibit linear soft modes emergent at magnetic Bragg wavevectors and have nearly or fairly flat scattering bands, signifying magnetic excitations localized in some way, at several different energies in a self-similar manner. In particular, the lowest-lying highly flat mode is distinctive of the Penrose lattice, which is mediated by its unique antiferromagnons confined within tricoordinated sites only, unlike their itinerant electron counterparts involving pentacoordinated as well as tricoordinated sites. Bringing harmonic antiferromagnons into higher-order quantum interaction splits the lowest-lying nearly flat scattering band in two, each mediated by further confined antiferromagnons, which is fully demonstrated and throughly visualized in the perpendicular as well as real spaces. We disclose superconfined antiferromagnons on the two-dimensional Penrose lattice.</description>

      <title>Contraction of unitary operators, quantum graphs and quantum channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a unitary operator in a finite dimensional complex Hilbert space, its unitary contraction to a subspace is defined. The application to quantum graphs is discussed. It is shown how the contraction allows to generate the scattering matrices of new quantum graphs from assembling of simpler graphs. The contraction of quantum channels is also defined. The implementation of the quantum gates corresponding to the contracted unitary operator is investigated, although no explicit construction is presented. The situation is different for the contraction of quantum channels for which explicit implementations are given.</description>

      <title>Bridging Classical and Quantum: Group-Theoretic Approach to Quantum Circuit Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficiently simulating quantum circuits on classical computers is a fundamental challenge in quantum computing. This paper presents a novel theoretical approach that achieves exponential speedups (polynomial runtime) over existing simulators for a wide class of quantum circuits. The technique leverages advanced group theory and symmetry considerations to map quantum circuits to equivalent forms amenable to efficient classical simulation. Several fundamental theorems are proven that establish the mathematical foundations of this approach, including a generalized Gottesman-Knill theorem. The potential of this method is demonstrated through theoretical analysis and preliminary benchmarks. This work contributes to the understanding of the boundary between classical and quantum computation, provides new tools for quantum circuit analysis and optimization, and opens up avenues for further research at the intersection of group theory and quantum computation. The findings may have implications for quantum algorithm design, error correction, and the development of more efficient quantum simulators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note, the idea of finite dimensional $L^p$ spaces is transferred to Lorentzian length spaces to provide an example that is locally nowhere Minkowskian. Looking at the sectional curvature bounds of this example leads to the more general statement that normed spaces in which the norm does not come from an inner product, have no sectional curvature bounds. This statement holds in the Riemannian and Lorentzian cases. In addition, the Lorentzian $L^p$ space can be used as an example in the context of Lorentzian Gromov-Hausdorff convergence, to show that unbounded sectional curvature or geodesic regularity is in general not preserved in the GH limit, and as an example of a sequence of uniform bounded length spaces which are not GH pre-compact.</description>

Abstract: The Maxwell-Bloch system of equations with inhomogeneous broadening is studied, and the local and global well-posedness of the corresponding initial-boundary value problem is established by taking advantage of the integrability of the system and making use of the corresponding inverse scattering transform. A key ingredient in the analysis is the $L^2$-Sobolev bijectivity of the direct and inverse scattering transform established by Xin Zhou for the focusing Zakharov-Shabat problem.</description>

Abstract: In this work, exact solutions of the nonlinear cubic-quintic Duffing-van der Pol oscillator with variable coefficients are obtained. Two approaches have been applied, one based on the factorization method combined with the Field Method, and a second one relying on Painlev\'e analysis. Both procedures allow us to find the same exact solutions to the problem. The Lagrangian formalism for this system is also derived. Moreover, some examples for particular choices of the time-dependent coefficients, and their corresponding general and particular exact solutions are presented.</description>

      <title>Localized excitation on the Jacobi elliptic periodic background for the (n+1)-dimensional generalized Kadomtsev-Petviashvili equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, the linear spectral problem, which associated with the (n+1)-dimensional generalized Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (gKP) equation, with the Jacobi elliptic function as the external potential is investigated based on the Lame function, from which some novel local nonlinear wave solutions on the Jacobi elliptic function have been obtained by Darboux transformation, and the corresponding dynamics have also been discussed. At the same time, the degenerate solutions of the nonlinear wave solutions on the Jacobi function background for the gKP equation are constructed by taking the modulus of the Jacobi function to be 0 and 1. The findings indicate that there can be various types of nonlinear wave solutions with different ranges of spectral parameters, including soliton and breather waves. These results will be useful for elucidating and predicting nonlinear phenomena in related physical fields, such as physical ocean and Bose-Einstein condensates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the existence and the properties of normalized ground states of a nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation on a quantum hybrid formed by two planes connected at a point. The nonlinearities are of power type and $L^2$-subcritical, while the matching condition between the two planes generates two point interactions of different strengths on each plane, together with a coupling condition between the two planes. We prove that ground states exist for every value of the mass and two different qualitative situations are possible depending on the matching condition: either ground states concentrate on one of the plane only, or ground states distribute on both the planes and are positive, radially symmetric, decreasing and present a logarithmic singularity at the origin of each plane. Moreover, we discuss how the mass distributes on the two planes and compare the strengths of the logarithmic singularities on the two planes when the parameters of the matching condition and the powers of the nonlinear terms vary.</description>

      <title>Reverse Map Projections as Equivariant Quantum Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the novel class $(E_\alpha)_{\alpha \in [-\infty,1)}$ of reverse map projection embeddings, each one defining a unique new method of encoding classical data into quantum states. Inspired by well-known map projections from the unit sphere onto its tangent planes, used in practice in cartography, these embeddings address the common drawback of the amplitude embedding method, wherein scalar multiples of data points are identified and information about the norm of data is lost.
  We show how reverse map projections can be utilised as equivariant embeddings for quantum machine learning. Using these methods, we can leverage symmetries in classical datasets to significantly strengthen performance on quantum machine learning tasks.
  Finally, we select four values of $\alpha$ with which to perform a simple classification task, taking $E_\alpha$ as the embedding and experimenting with both equivariant and non-equivariant setups. We compare their results alongside those of standard amplitude embedding.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial and Algebraic Mutations of Toric Fano 3-folds and Mass Deformations of 2d (0,2) Quiver Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We argue that algebraic and combinatorial polytope mutations of Fano 3-folds can be identified with mass deformations of associated 2d (0,2) supersymmetric gauge theories realized by brane brick models. These are Type IIA brane configurations that realize a large family of 2d worldvolume theories on probe D1-branes at toric Calabi-Yau 4-folds. We show that brane brick models that are related by mass deformations associated to algebraic and combinatorial polytope mutations of Fano 3-folds have mesonic moduli spaces with the same number of generators. We show that mesonic flavor charges of these generators form convex reflexive lattice polytopes that are dual to the toric diagrams of the Fano 3-folds. The generating function of mesonic gauge invariant operators, also known as the Hilbert series of the mesonic moduli space, appears to be identical for such brane brick models under a particular refinement originating from the U(1)_R charges in the brane brick model following the mass deformation.</description>

      <title>Eigenstate Correlations in Dual-Unitary Quantum Circuits: Partial Spectral Form Factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While the notion of quantum chaos is tied to random matrix spectral correlations, also eigenstate properties in chaotic systems are often assumed to be described by random matrix theory. Analytic insights into eigenstate correlations can be obtained by the recently introduced partial spectral form factor. Here, we study the partial spectral form factor in chaotic dual-unitary quantum circuits in the thermodynamic limit. We compute the latter for a finite subsystem in a brickwork circuit coupled to an infinite complement. For initial times, shorter than the subsystem's size, spatial locality and (dual) unitarity implies a constant partial spectral form factor, clearly deviating from the linear ramp of the random matrix prediction. In contrast, for larger times we prove, that the partial spectral form factor follows the random matrix result up to exponentially suppressed corrections. We supplement our exact analytical results by semi-analytic computations performed in the thermodynamic limit as well as with numerics for finite-size systems.</description>

Abstract: We study some kinds of generalizations of Schr\"oder paths below a line with rational slope and derive the $q$-difference equations that are satisfied by their generating functions. As a result, we establish a relation between the generating function of generalized Schr\"oder paths with backwards and the wave function corresponding to colored HOMFLY-PT polynomials of torus knot $T_{1,f}$. We also give a combinatorial proof of a recent result by Sto\v{s}i\'c and Su{\l}kowski, in which the standard generalized Schr\"oder paths are related to the superpolynomial of reduced colored HOMFLY-PT homology of $T_{1,f}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the past few decades, numerous $N$-phase incompressible diffuse-interface flow models with non-matching densities have been proposed. Despite aiming to describe the same physics, these models are generally distinct, and an overarching modeling framework is absent. This paper provides a unified framework for $N$-phase incompressible Navier-Stokes Cahn-Hilliard Allen-Cahn mixture models with a single momentum equation. The framework naturally emerges from continuum mixture theory, exhibits an energy-dissipative structure, and is invariant to the choice of fundamental variables. This opens the door to exploring connections between existing $N$-phase models and facilitates the computation of $N$-phase flow models rooted in continuum mixture theory.</description>

We then give a general class of ALF spaces such that each of them contains a non-holomorphic minimal sphere. Together with Foscolo's construction this gives a large class of $K3$ surfaces containing non-holomorphic minimal spheres.</description>

      <title>Castelnuovo bound for curves in projective 3-folds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Castelnuovo bound conjecture, which is proposed by physicists, predicts an effective vanishing result for Gopakumar-Vafa invariants of Calabi-Yau 3-folds of Picard number one. Previously, it is only known for a few cases and all the proofs rely on the Bogomolov-Gieseker conjecture of Bayer-Macr\`i-Toda.
  In this paper, we prove the Castelnuovo bound conjecture for any Calabi-Yau 3-folds of Picard number one, up to a linear term and finitely many degree, without assuming the conjecture of Bayer-Macr\`i-Toda. Furthermore, we prove an effective vanishing theorem for surface-counting invariants of Calabi-Yau 4-folds of Picard number one. We also apply our techniques to study low-degree curves on some explicit Calabi-Yau 3-folds.
  Our approach is based on a general iterative method to obtain upper bounds for the genus of one-dimensional closed subschemes in a fixed 3-fold, which is a combination of classical techniques and the wall-crossing of weak stability conditions on derived categories, and works for any projective 3-fold with at worst isolated singularities over any algebraically closed field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The forward acoustic scattering problem that we deal with, is to find $u=u^f(x,t)$ satisfying \begin{align*} &amp;u_{tt}-\Delta u+qu=0, &amp;&amp; (x,t) \in {\mathbb R}^3 \times (-\infty,\infty); \\ &amp;u \mid_{|x|&lt;-t} =0 , &amp;&amp; t&lt;0;\\ &amp;\lim_{s \to -\infty} s\,u((-s+\tau)\,\omega,s)=f(\tau,\omega), &amp;&amp; (\tau,\omega) \in \Sigma:=[0,\infty)\times S^2; \end{align*} for a real valued compactly supported potential $q=q(x)$ and a control $f \in L_2(\Sigma)$. The map $R: L_2(\Sigma)\to L_2(\Sigma)$, \begin{align*} &amp; (Rf)(\tau ,\omega )\,:= \lim_{s \to +\infty} s\, u^f((s+\tau )\,\omega ,s), \quad (\tau ,\omega ) \in \Sigma \end{align*} is a response operator.
  The inverse problem is to determine $q$ from $R$. It is solved by a relevant version of the boundary control method. The procedure that recovers the potential is local: for any fixed $\xi&gt;0$, given $R\upharpoonright\{f\in L_2(\Sigma)\,|\,\,f\mid_{0\leqslant \tau&lt;\xi}=0\}$ it determines $q\big|_{|x|\geqslant\xi}$.</description>

      <title>Diffraction measures and patterns of the complex dimensions of self-similar fractal strings. I. The lattice case</title>

Abstract: We give a generalization of Lagarias' formula for diffraction by ideal crystals, and we apply it to the lattice case, in preparation for addressing the problem of quasicrystals and complex dimensions posed by Lapidus and van Frankenhuijsen concerning the quasiperiodic properties of the set of complex dimensions of any nonlattice self-similar fractal string. More specifically, in this paper, we consider the case of the complex dimensions of a lattice (rather than of a nonlattice) self-similar string and show that the corresponding diffraction measure exists, is unique, and is given by a suitable $\textit{continuous}$ analogue of a discrete Dirac comb. We also obtain more general results concerning the autocorrelation measures and diffraction measures of generalized idealized fractals associated to possibly degenerate lattices and the corresponding extension of the Poisson Summation Formula.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.06686v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Different from the usual harmonic oscillator, the time-decaying harmonic oscillator accelerates particles and generates scattering states. We study one of the multidimensional inverse scatterings in this two-body quantum system perturbed by short-range potential functions that have a bounded part and a locally singular part. Applying the Enss--Weder time-dependent method, we prove that the scattering operator determines the potential functions uniquely.</description>

Abstract: According to the Bogoliubov theory the low energy behaviour of the Bose gas at zero temperature can be described by non-interacting bosonic quasiparticles called phonons. In this work the damping rate of phonons at low momenta, the so-called Beliaev damping, is explained and computed with simple arguments involving the Fermi Golden Rule and Bogoliubov's quasiparticles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13144v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interacting particle systems in a finite-volume in equilibrium are often described by a grand-canonical ensemble induced by the corresponding Hamiltonian, i.e. a finite-volume Gibbs measure. However, in practice, directly measuring this Hamiltonian is not possible, as such, methods need to be developed to calculate the Hamiltonian potentials from measurable data. In this work, we give an expansion of the chemical potential in terms of the correlation functions of such a system in the thermodynamic limit. This is a justification of a formal approach of Nettleton and Green from the 50's, that can be seen as an inverse cluster expansion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02479v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the T-system of type $A_\infty$, also known as the octahedron recurrence/equation, viewed as a 2+1-dimensional discrete evolution equation. Generalizing the study of [P. Di Francesco and R. Soto-Garrido. Arctic curves of the octahedron equation. J. Phys. A, 47(28):285204, 34, 2014], we consider initial data along parallel ``slanted" planes perpendicular to an arbitrary admissible direction $(r,s,t)\in {\mathbb Z}_+^3$. The solution of the T-system is interpreted as the partition function of a dimer model on some suitable ``pinecone" graph introduced in [M. Bousquet-M\'elou, J. Propp, and J. West. Perfect matchings for the three-term Gale-Robinson sequences. Electron. J. Combin., 16(1):Research Paper 125, 37, 2009]. The T-system formulation and some exact solutions in uniform or periodic cases allow us to explore the thermodynamic limit of the corresponding dimer models and to derive exact arctic curves separating the various phases of the system.</description>

      <title>Refining the grading of irreducible Lie colour algebra representations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02855v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply the loop module construction of arXiv:1504.05114 in the context of Lie colour algebras. We construct a bijection between the equivalence classes of all finite-dimensional graded irreducible Lie colour algebra representations from the irreducible representations for Lie superalgebras. This bijection is obtained by applying the loop module construction iteratively to simple groups in the Jordan--H\"older decomposition of the grading group. Restricting to simple groups in this way greatly simplifies the construction. Despite the bijection between Lie colour algebra representations and Lie superalgebra representations, Lie colour algebras maintain a non-trivial representation theory distinct from that of Lie superalgebras. We demonstrate the applicability of the loop module construction to Lie colour algebras in two examples: a Hilbert space for a quantum mechanical model and representations of a colour version of $ \mathfrak{sl}_2 $.</description>

Abstract: We show that supersymmetric(SUSY) W-algebra of generic level can be realized as an intersection of the kernels of the screening operators. Applying this result to principal SUSY W-algebras, we get their free field realization inside the SUSY Heisenberg vertex algebras. Furthermore, the screening operators for principal SUSY W-algebras allow us to present them as intersections of the principal SUSY W-algebras associated with $\mathfrak{osp}(1|2)$, $\mathfrak{osp}(2|2)$, $\mathfrak{osp}(3|2)$ and $\mathfrak{osp}(4|2)$, tensored with SUSY Heisenberg vertex algebras.</description>

      <title>Fock space of local fields of the discrete GFF and its scaling limit bosonic CFT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15490v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To connect conformal field theories (CFT) to probabilistic lattice models, recent works [HKV22, Ada23] have introduced a novel definition of local fields of the lattice models. Local fields in this picture are probabilistically concrete: they are built from random variables in the model. The key insight is that discrete complex analysis ideas allow to equip the space of local fields with the main structure of a CFT: a representation of the Virasoro algebra.
  In this article, for the first time, we fully analyze the structure of the space of local fields of a lattice model as a representation, and use this to establish a one-to-one correspondence between the local fields of a lattice model and those of a conformal field theory. The CFT we consider is probabilistically realized in terms of the gradient of the Gaussian Free Field (GFF). Its space of local fields is just a bosonic Fock space for two chiral symmetry algebras. The corresponding lattice model is the discrete Gaussian Free Field. Our first main result is that the space of local fields of polynomials in the gradient of the discrete GFF is isomorphic to the Fock space. These local fields make sense with both Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions. Our second main result is that with the appropriate renormalization, correlation functions of local fields of the discrete GFF converge in the scaling limit to the correlation functions of the CFT. The renormalization needed is, conceptually correctly, according to the eigenvalue of the Virasoro generator $L_0 + \bar{L}_0$ on the local field.</description>

Abstract: In a previous work of 2014 on a quantum system governed by the repulsive Hamiltonian, the author proved uniqueness for short-range interactions described by a scattering operator consisting of regular and singular parts. In this paper, the singular part is assumed to have much stronger singularities and the same uniqueness theorem is proved. By applying the time-dependent method invented by Enss and Weder in 1995, the high-velocity limit for a wider class of the scattering operator with stronger singularities also uniquely determines uniquely the interactions of a multi-dimensional system.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonians for Quantum Systems with Contact Interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06876v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the problem of constructing self-adjoint and lower bounded Hamiltonians for a system of $n&gt;2$ non-relativistic quantum particles in dimension three with contact (or zero-range or $\delta$) interactions. Such interactions are described by (singular) boundary conditions satisfied at the coincidence hyperplanes, i.e., when the coordinates of two particles coincide. Following the line of recent works appeared in the literature, we introduce a boundary condition slightly modified with respect to usual boundary condition one has in the one-body problem. With such new boundary condition we can show that the instability property due to the fall to the center phenomenon described by Minlos and Faddeev in 1962 is avoided. Then one obtains a physically reasonable Hamiltonian for the system. We apply the method to the case of a gas of $N$ interacting bosons and to the case of $N$ distinguishable particles of equal mass $M$ interacting with a different particle. In the latter case we also discuss the limit of the model for $M \longrightarrow +\infty$. We show that in the limit one obtains the one-body Hamiltonian for the light particle subject to $N$ (non-local) point interactions placed at fixed positions. We will verify that such non-local point interactions do not exhibit the ultraviolet pathologies that are present in the case of standard local point interactions.</description>

Abstract: Topological field theories and holomorphic field theories naturally appear in both mathematics and physics. However, there exist intriguing hybrid theories that are topological in some directions and holomorphic in others, such as twists of supersymmetric field theories or Costello's 4-dimensional Chern-Simons theory. In this paper, we rigorously prove the ultraviolet (UV) finiteness for such hybrid theories on flat space, and present two significant vanishing results regarding anomalies.</description>

Abstract: We consider the tasks of learning quantum states, measurements and channels generated by continuous-variable (CV) quantum circuits. This family of circuits is suited to describe optical quantum technologies and in particular it includes state-of-the-art photonic processors capable of showing quantum advantage. We define classes of functions that map classical variables, encoded into the CV circuit parameters, to outcome probabilities evaluated on those circuits. We then establish efficient learnability guarantees for such classes, by computing bounds on their pseudo-dimension or covering numbers, showing that CV quantum circuits can be learned with a sample complexity that scales polynomially with the circuit's size, i.e., the number of modes. Our results show that CV circuits can be trained efficiently using a number of training samples that, unlike their finite-dimensional counterpart, does not scale with the circuit depth.</description>

Abstract: The affine Grassmannian associated to a reductive group $\mathbf{G}$ is an affine analogue of the usual flag varieties. It is a rich source of Poisson varieties and their symplectic resolutions. These spaces are examples of conical symplectic resolutions dual to the Nakajima quiver varieties. We study the cohomological stable envelopes of D. Maulik and A. Okounkov [arXiv:1211.1287] in this family. We construct an explicit recursive relation for the stable envelopes in the $\mathbf{G} = \mathbf{PSL}_2$ case and compute the first-order correction in the general case. This allows us to write an exact formula for multiplication by a divisor.</description>

Abstract: This work deals with the scattering entropy of quantum graphs in many different circumstances. We first consider the case of the Shannon entropy and then the R\'enyi and Tsallis entropies, which are more adequate to study distinct quantitative behavior such as entanglement and nonextensive behavior, respectively. We describe many results associated with different types of quantum graphs in the presence of several vertices, edges, and leads. In particular, we think the results may be used as quantifiers in models related to the transport in quantum graphs.</description>

      <title>Estimate distillable entanglement and quantum capacity by squeezing useless entanglement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.07228v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum Internet relies on quantum entanglement as a fundamental resource for secure and efficient quantum communication, reshaping data transmission. In this context, entanglement distillation emerges as a crucial process that plays a pivotal role in realizing the full potential of the quantum internet. Nevertheless, it remains challenging to accurately estimate the distillable entanglement and its closely related essential quantity, the quantum capacity. In this work, we consider a general resource measure known as the reverse divergence of resources which quantifies the minimum divergence between a target state and the set of free states. Leveraging this measure, we propose efficiently computable upper bounds for both quantities based on the idea that the useless entanglement within a state or a quantum channel does not contribute to the distillable entanglement or the quantum capacity, respectively. Our bounds can be computed via semidefinite programming and have practical applications for purifying maximally entangled states under practical noises, such as depolarizing and amplitude damping noises, leading to improvements in estimating the one-way distillable entanglement. Furthermore, we provide valuable benchmarks for evaluating the quantum capacities of qubit quantum channels, including the Pauli channels and the random mixed unitary channels, which are of great interest for the development of a quantum internet.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.17538v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate circuit complexity of unitaries generated by time evolution of randomly chosen strongly interacting Hamiltonians in finite dimensional Hilbert spaces. Specifically, we focus on two ensembles of random generators -- the so called Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE) and the ensemble of diagonal Gaussian matrices conjugated by Haar random unitary transformations. In both scenarios we prove that the complexity of $\exp(-it H)$ exhibits a surprising behaviour -- with high probability it reaches the maximal allowed value on the same time scale as needed to escape the neighborhood of the identity consisting of unitaries with trivial (zero) complexity. We furthermore observe similar behaviour for quantum states originating from time evolutions generated by above ensembles and for diagonal unitaries generated from the ensemble of diagonal Gaussian Hamiltonians. To establish these results we rely heavily on structural properties of the above ensembles (such as unitary invariance) and concentration of measure techniques. This gives us a much finer control over the time evolution of complexity compared to techniques previously employed in this context: high-degree moments and frame potentials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.09335v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a framework that allows us to clearly identify the geometric features underlying the phenomenon of superconductivity in two dimensional materials. In particular, we show that any such medium whose response to an externally applied electromagnetic field is a geodesically flowing induced current, must be a superconductor. In this manner, we conclude that the underlying geometry of this type of media is that of a Lorentzian contact manifold. Moreover, we show that the macroscopic hallmark of their superconducting state is a purely topological condition equivalent to the geodesic nature of the induced current: the non-vanishing of its helicity.</description>

      <title>On Strong Zero-Dispersion Asymptotics for Benjamin-Ono Soliton Ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05785v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A soliton ensemble is a particular kind of approximation of the solution of an initial-value problem for an integrable equation by a reflectionless potential that is well adapted to singular asymptotics like the small-dispersion limit. We study soliton ensembles for the Benjamin-Ono equation by using reasonable hypotheses to develop local approximations that capture highly oscillatory features of the solution and hence provide more information than weak convergence results that are easier to obtain. These local approximations are deduced independently from empirically-observed but unproven distributions of eigenvalues of two related matrices, one Hermitian and another non-Hermitian. We perform careful numerical experiments to study the asymptotic behavior of the eigenvalues of these matrices in the small-dispersion limit, and formulate conjectures reflecting our observations. Then we apply the conjectures to construct the local approximations of slowly varying profiles and rapidly oscillating profiles as well. We show that the latter profiles are consistent with the predictions of Whitham modulation theory as originally developed for the Benjamin-Ono equation by Dobrokhotov and Krichever.</description>

      <title>Directed polymers in a random environment: a review of the phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01757v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The model of directed polymer in a random environment is a fundamental model of interaction between a simple random walk and ambient disorder. This interaction gives rise to complex phenomena and transitions from a central limit theory to novel statistical behaviours. Despite its intense study, there are still many aspects and phases which have not yet been identified. In this review we focus on the current status of our understanding of the transition between weak and strong disorder phases, give an account of some of the methods that the study of the model has motivated and highlight some open questions.</description>

      <title>A sufficient condition for inviscid shear instability: Hurdle theorem and its application to alternating jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08027v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a simple method to identify unstable parameter regions in general inviscid unidirectional shear flow stability problems. The theory is applicable to a wide range of basic flows, including those that are non-monotonic. We illustrate the method using a model of Jupiter's alternating jet streams based on the quasi-geostrophic equation. The main result is that the flow is unstable if there is an interval in the flow domain for which the reciprocal Rossby Mach number (a quantity defined in terms of the zonal flow and potential vorticity distribution), surpasses a certain threshold or `hurdle'. The hurdle height approaches unity when we can take the hurdle width to greatly exceeds the atmosphere's intrinsic deformation length, as holds on gas giants. In this case, the Kelvin-Arnol'd sufficient condition of stability accurately detects instability. These results improve the theoretical framework for explaining the stable maintenance of Jupiter and Saturn's jets over decadal timescales.</description>

      <title>Presymplectic minimal models of local gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03240v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We elaborate on the recently proposed notion of a weak presymplectic gauge PDE. It is a $\mathbb{Z}$-graded bundle over the space-time manifold, equipped with a degree $1$ vector field and a compatible graded presymplectic structure. This geometrical data naturally defines a Lagrangian gauge field theory. Moreover, it encodes not only the Lagrangian of the theory but also its full-scale Batalin-Vilkovisky (BV) formulation. In particular, the respective field-antifield space arises as a symplectic quotient of the super-jet bundle of the initial fiber bundle. A remarkable property of this approach is that among the variety of presymplectic gauge PDEs encoding a given gauge theory we can pick a minimal one that usually turns out to be finite-dimensional, and unique in a certain sense. The approach can be considered as an extension of the familiar AKSZ construction to not necessarily topological and diffeomorphism-invariant theories. We present a variety of examples including $p$-forms, chiral Yang-Mills theory, Holst gravity, and conformal gravity. We also explain the explicit relation to the non-BV-BRST version of the formalism, which happens to be closely related to the covariant phase space and the multisymplectic approaches.</description>

      <title>Absence of local conserved quantity in the Heisenberg model with next-nearest-neighbor interaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04522v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We rigorously prove that the Heisenberg chain with next-nearest-neighbor interaction, which is anticipated to be non-integrable, is indeed non-integrable in the sense that this system has no nontrivial local conserved quantity. Our result covers two important models, the Majundhar-Ghosh model and the Shastry-Sutherland model, as special cases. These models are shown to be non-integrable while have some solvable energy eigenstates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14096v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By using the coproduct and evaluation map for the affine Yangian and the Miura map for non-rectangular $W$-algebras, we construct a homomorphism from the affine Yangian associated with $\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}(n)$ to the universal enveloping algebra of a non-rectangular $W$-algebra of type $A$, which is an affine analogue of the one given in De Sole-Kac-Valeri. As a consequence, we find that the coproduct for the affine Yangian is compatible with some of the parabolic induction for non-rectangular $W$-algebras via this homomorphism. We also show that the image of this homomorphism is contained in the affine coset of the $W$-algebra in the special case that the $W$-algebra is associated with a nilpotent element of type $(1^{m-n},2^n)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06179v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce operator-valued twisted Araki-Woods algebras. These are operator-valued versions of a class of second quantization algebras that includes $q$-Gaussian and $q$-Araki-Woods algebras and also generalize Shlyakhtenko's von Neumann algebras generated by operator-valued semicircular variables. We develop a disintegration theory that reduces the isomorphism type of operator-valued twisted Araki-Woods algebras over type I factors to the scalar-valued case. Moreover, these algebras come with a natural weight, and we characterize its modular theory. We also give sufficient criteria that guarantee that factoriality of these algebras.</description>

      <title>Structural analysis of Gibbs states and metastates in short-range classical spin glasses: indecomposable metastates, dynamically-frozen states, and metasymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13071v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider short-range classical spin glasses, or other disordered systems, consisting of Ising spins. For a low-temperature Gibbs state in infinite size in such a system, for given random bonds, it is controversial whether its decomposition into pure states will be trivial or non-trivial. We undertake a general study of the overall structure of this problem, based on metastates, which are essential to prove the existence of a thermodynamic limit. A metastate is a probability distribution on Gibbs states, for given disorder, that satisfies certain covariance properties. First, we prove that any metastate can be decomposed as a mixture of indecomposable metastates, and that all Gibbs states drawn from an indecomposable metastate are alike macroscopically. Next, we consider stochastic stability of a metastate under random perturbations of the disorder, and prove that any metastate is stochastically stable. Using related methods and older results, we prove that if the pure-state decomposition of any Gibbs states drawn from an indecomposable metastate is countably infinite, then the weights in the decomposition follow a Poisson-Dirichlet distribution with a fixed value of the single parameter describing such distributions, and also that if the overlap takes a finite number of values, then the pure states are organized as an ultrametric space, as in $k$-RSB. Dynamically-frozen states play a role in the analysis of Gibbs states drawn from a metastate, either as states or as parts of states. Using a mapping into real Hilbert space, we prove further results about Gibbs states, and classify them into six types. Metastate-average states are studied, and can be related to states arising dynamically at long times after a quench from high temperature, under some conditions.</description>

      <title>Exactly solvable non-unitary time evolution in quantum critical systems I: Effect of complex spacetime metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17059v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this series of works, we study exactly solvable non-unitary time evolutions in one-dimensional quantum critical systems ranging from quantum quenches to time-dependent drivings. In this part I, we are motivated by the recent works of Kontsevich and Segal [1] and Witten [2] on allowable complex spacetime metrics in quantum field theories. In general, such complex spacetime metrics will lead to non-unitary time evolutions. In this work, we study the universal features of such non-unitary time evolutions based on exactly solvable setups. Various physical quantities including entanglement Hamiltonian and entanglement spectrum, entanglement entropy, and energy density at an arbitrary time can be exactly solved. Due to the damping effect introduced by the complex time, the excitations in the initial state are gradually damped out in time. The non-equilibrium dynamics exhibits universal features that are qualitatively different from the case of real-time evolutions. For instance, for an infinite system after a global quench, the entanglement entropy of the semi-infinite subsystem will grow logarithmically in time, in contrast to the linear growth in a real-time evolution. Moreover, we study numerically the time-dependent driven quantum critical systems with allowable complex spacetime metrics. It is found that the competition between driving and damping leads to a steady state with an interesting entanglement structure.</description>

      <title>3d Gravity as a random ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02649v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give further evidence that the matrix-tensor model studied in \cite{belin2023} is dual to AdS$_{3}$ gravity including the sum over topologies. This provides a 3D version of the duality between JT gravity and an ensemble of random Hamiltonians, in which the matrix and tensor provide random CFT$_2$ data subject to a potential that incorporates the bootstrap constraints. We show how the Feynman rules of the ensemble produce a sum over all three-manifolds and how surgery is implemented by the matrix integral. The partition functions of the resulting 3d gravity theory agree with Virasoro TQFT (VTQFT) on a fixed, hyperbolic manifold. However, on non-hyperbolic geometries, our 3d gravity theory differs from VTQFT, leading to a difference in the eigenvalue statistics of the associated ensemble. As explained in \cite{belin2023}, the Schwinger-Dyson (SD) equations of the matrix-tensor integral play a crucial role in understanding how gravity emerges in the limit that the ensemble localizes to exact CFT's. We show how the SD equations can be translated into a combinatorial problem about three-manifolds.</description>

Abstract: We study composite assemblages of dielectrics and metamaterials with respectively positive and negative material parameters. In the continuum case, for a scalar equation, such media may exhibit so-called plasmonic resonances for certain values of the (negative) conductivity in the metamaterial. This work investigates such resonances, and the associated eigenfunctions, in the case of composite conducting networks. Unlike the continuous media, we show a surprising specific dependence on the geometry of the network of the resonant values. We also study how the problem is affected by the choice of boundary conditions on the external nodes of the structure.</description>

      <title>Some Lower Dimensional Quantum Field Theories Reduced from Chern-Simons Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17943v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study symmetry reductions in the context of Euclidean Chern-Simons gauge theories to obtain lower dimensional field theories. Symmetry reduction in certain gauge theories is a common tool for obtaining explicit soliton solutions. Although pure Chern-Simons theories do not admit solitonic solutions, symmetry reduction still leads to interesting results. We establish relations at the semiclassical regime between pure Chern-Simons theories on $S^3$ and the reduced Quantum Field Theories, based on actions obtained by the symmetry reduction of the Chern-Simons action, spherical symmetry being the prominent one. We also discuss symmetry reductions of Chern-Simons theories on the disk, yielding $BF$-theory in two dimensions, which signals a curious relationship between symmetry reductions and the boundary conformal field theories. Finally, we study the Chern-Simons-Higgs instantons and show that under certain circumstances, the reduced action can formally be viewed as the action of a supersymmetric quantum mechanical model. We discuss the extent to which the reduced actions have a fermionic nature at the level of the partition function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18356v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 2015, Codesido-Grassi-Marino laid the foundation of a connection between local CY 3-folds and the spectra of operators attached to their mirror curves in the context of Topological String Theory. In a 2024 paper with C. Doran and M. Kerr, the author previously deduced two consequences of this conjecture; one relating zeroes of higher normal function to the spectra of operators of genus one curves, the other connecting integral regulators of $K_2$-classes on mirror curves to dilogarithm values at algebraic arguments. We now show that the latter continues to hold in the presence of a mass parameter, thus expanding the range of the conjecture.</description>
