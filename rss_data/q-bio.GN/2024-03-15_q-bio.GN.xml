      <title>scVGAE: A Novel Approach using ZINB-Based Variational Graph Autoencoder for Single-Cell RNA-Seq Imputation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has revolutionized our ability to study individual cellular distinctions and uncover unique cell characteristics. However, a significant technical challenge in scRNA-seq analysis is the occurrence of "dropout" events, where certain gene expressions cannot be detected. This issue is particularly pronounced in genes with low or sparse expression levels, impacting the precision and interpretability of the obtained data. To address this challenge, various imputation methods have been implemented to predict such missing values, aiming to enhance the analysis's accuracy and usefulness. A prevailing hypothesis posits that scRNA-seq data conforms to a zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) distribution. Consequently, methods have been developed to model the data according to this distribution. Recent trends in scRNA-seq analysis have seen the emergence of deep learning approaches. Some techniques, such as the variational autoencoder, incorporate the ZINB distribution as a model loss function. Graph-based methods like Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and Graph Attention Networks (GAT) have also gained attention as deep learning methodologies for scRNA-seq analysis. This study introduces scVGAE, an innovative approach integrating GCN into a variational autoencoder framework while utilizing a ZINB loss function. This integration presents a promising avenue for effectively addressing dropout events in scRNA-seq data, thereby enhancing the accuracy and reliability of downstream analyses. scVGAE outperforms other methods in cell clustering, with the best performance in 11 out of 14 datasets. Ablation study shows all components of scVGAE are necessary. scVGAE is implemented in Python and downloadable at https://github.com/inoue0426/scVGAE.</description>

      <title>Lightning-fast adaptive immune receptor similarity search by symmetric deletion lookup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An individual's adaptive immune receptor (AIR) repertoire records immune history due to the exquisite antigen specificity of AIRs. Reading this record requires computational approaches for inferring receptor function from sequence, as the diversity of possible receptor-antigen pairs vastly outstrips experimental knowledge. Identification of AIRs with similar sequence and thus putatively similar function is a common performance bottleneck in these approaches. Here, we benchmark the time complexity of five different algorithmic approaches to radius-based search for Levenshtein neighbors. We show that a symmetric deletion lookup approach, originally proposed for spell-checking, is particularly scalable. We then introduce XTNeighbor, a variant of this algorithm that can be massively parallelized on GPUs. For one million input sequences, XTNeighbor identifies all sequence neighbors that differ by up to two edits in seconds on commodity hardware, orders of magnitude faster than existing approaches. We also demonstrate how symmetric deletion lookup can speed up search with more complex sequence-similarity metrics such as TCRdist. Our contribution is poised to greatly speed up existing analysis pipelines and enable processing of large-scale immunosequencing data without downsampling.</description>

      <title>Optimal transport distances for directed, weighted graphs: a case study with cell-cell communication networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07030v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Comparing graphs by means of optimal transport has recently gained significant attention, as the distances induced by optimal transport provide both a principled metric between graphs as well as an interpretable description of the associated changes between graphs in terms of a transport plan. As the lack of symmetry introduces challenges in the typically considered formulations, optimal transport distances for graphs have mostly been developed for undirected graphs. Here, we propose two distance measures to compare directed graphs based on variants of optimal transport: (i) an earth movers distance (Wasserstein) and (ii) a Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) distance. We evaluate these two distances and discuss their relative performance for both simulated graph data and real-world directed cell-cell communication graphs, inferred from single-cell RNA-seq data.</description>
