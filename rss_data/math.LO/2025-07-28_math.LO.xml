      <title>Interpolation in model theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We bring an abstract model theory perspective to interpolation. We ask, what is the role of interpolation in the study of extensions of first order logic, such as infinitary logics, generalized quantifiers and higher order logics? The abstract model theory approach reveals the basic connections between various interpolation properties in isolation, on their own, as well as with respect to other model theoretic properties, such as compactness.</description>

      <title>Higher Solovay Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an axiomatisation of when a model of the form $L(V_{\kappa+1})^M$ can be considered a ``$\kappa$-Solovay model''; we show a characterisation of $\kappa$-Solovay models; and we prove elementary equivalences between $\kappa$-Solovay models.</description>

      <title>On Definably Compact Semigroups in o-Minimal Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study definably compact semigroups in o-minimal structures, aiming to extend the theory of definable groups to a broader algebraic setting. We show that any definably compact semigroup contains idempotents and admits a unique minimal ideal as well as minimal left and right ideals, all of which are definable and definably compact. We prove that cancellativity characterizes definable groups among definably compact semigroups, and that any definably compact subsemigroup of a definable group is itself a subgroup. In the completely simple case, we classify definable subsemigroups via a definable Rees matrix decomposition and analyse when results from the theory of definable groups extend to this setting.</description>

      <title>Boolean basis, formula size, and number of modal operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11651v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Is it possible to write significantly smaller formulae when using Boolean operators other than those of the De Morgan basis (and, or, not, and the constants)? For propositional logic, a negative answer was given by Pratt: formulae over one set of operators can always be translated into an equivalent formula over any other complete set of operators with only polynomial increase in size. Surprisingly, for modal logic the picture is different: we show that elimination of bi-implication is only possible at the cost of an exponential number of occurrences of the modal operator $\lozenge$ and therefore of an exponential increase in formula size, i.e., the De Morgan basis and its extension by bi-implication differ in succinctness. Moreover, we prove that any complete set of Boolean operators agrees in succinctness with the De Morgan basis or with its extension by bi-implication. More precisely, these results are shown for the modal logic $\mathrm{T}$ (and therefore for $\mathrm{K}$). We complement them showing that the modal logic $\mathrm{S5}$ behaves as propositional logic: the choice of Boolean operators has no significant impact on the size of formulae.</description>

      <title>The Flat Cover Conjecture for Monoid Acts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04155v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the Flat Cover Conjecture holds for the category of (right) acts over any right-reversible monoid $S$, provided that the flat $S$-acts are closed under stable Rees extensions. The argument shows that the class $\mathcal{F}$-Mono ($S$-act monomorphisms with flat Rees quotient) is cofibrantly generated in such categories, answering a question of Bailey and Renshaw. But cofibrant generation of $\mathcal{SF}$-Mono ($S$-act monomorphisms with \emph{strongly} flat Rees quotient) appears much stronger, since we show it implies that there is a bound on the size of the indecomposable strongly flat acts. Similarly, cofibrant generation of $\mathcal{U}_{\mathcal{F}}$ (unitary monomorphisms with flat complement) implies a bound on the size of indecomposable flat acts. The key tool is a new characterization of cofibrant generation of a class of monomorphisms in terms of ``almost everywhere" effectiveness of the class.</description>
