      <title>Model-Independent Reconstruction of $f(T)$ Gravity Using Genetic Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we use genetic algorithms, a specific machine learning technique, to achieve a model-independent reconstruction of $f(T)$ gravity. By using $H(z)$ data derived from cosmic chronometers and radial Baryon Acoustic Oscillation method, including the latest Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) data, we reconstruct the Hubble rate which is the basis parameter for reconstructing $f(T)$ gravity without any assumptions. In this reconstruction process, we use the current value of the Hubble rate, $H_0$, derived by genetic algorithms. The reconstructed $f(T)$ function is consistent with the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology within the 1$\sigma$ confidence level across a broad temporal range. The mean $f(T)$ curve, adopting a quadratic form, prompts us to parametrize it using a second degree polynomial. This quadratic deviation from the $\Lambda$CDM scenario is mildly favored by the data.</description>

      <title>The cusp-halo relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Every halo of collisionless dark matter contains a $\rho = A r^{-1.5}$ density cusp at its center. This prompt cusp is a relic of the halo's earliest moments and has a mass comparable to the cutoff scale in the spectrum of initial density perturbations. In this work, we provide a framework to predict for each halo the coefficient $A$ of its central cusp. We also present a "cusp-NFW" functional form that accurately describes the density profile of a halo with a prompt cusp at its center. Accurate characterization of each halo's central cusp is of particular importance in the study of warm dark matter models, for which the spectral cutoff is on an astrophysically relevant mass scale. To facilitate easy incorporation of prompt cusps into any halo modeling approach, we provide a code package that implements the cusp-halo relation and the cusp-NFW density profile.</description>

      <title>Exploring selection biases in FRB dispersion-galaxy cross-correlations with magnetohydrodynamical simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dispersion of fast radio bursts (FRBs) in conjunction with their redshifts can be used as powerful probes of the distribution of extragalactic plasma, and with a large enough sample, the free-electron--galaxy power spectrum $P_{eg}$ can be measured by cross-correlating FRB dispersions with galaxy positions. However, a precise measurement of $P_{eg}$ requires a careful investigation of the selection effects -- the fact that the probability of both observing the FRB dispersion measure and obtaining a host galaxy redshift depends on observed properties of the FRB and its host. We use ray tracing simulations with IllustrisTNG300-1 to investigate the impact of expected observational selection effects on FRB dispersion-galaxy angular cross-correlations with a sample of 3000 FRBs at redshift range of $0.3 \leq z \leq 0.4$ . Our results show that cross-correlations with such an FRB sample are robust to properties of the FRB host galaxy: this includes DM contributions from the FRB host and optical followup selection effects biased against FRBs with dim galaxy hosts. We also find that such cross-correlations are robust to DM dependent and scattering selection effects specific to the CHIME/FRB survey. However, a DM dependent selection effect that cuts off the 10\% most dispersed FRB at a fixed redshift shell can bias the amplitude of the cross-correlation signal by over 50\% at angular scales of $\sim 0.1^\circ$ (corresponding to Mpc physical scales). Our findings highlight the importance of both measuring and accounting for selection effects present in existing FRB surveys as well as mitigating DM dependent selection effects in the design of upcoming FRB surveys aiming to use FRBs as probes for large-scale structure.</description>

      <title>The Onset of Feedback in Abell 1885: Evidence for Large-Scale Quenching Despite a Young Central AGN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new 8.5 ks Chandra observation of Abell 1885, obtained as part of the Cluster Evolution Reference Ensemble At Low-z (CEREAL) survey of ~200 low-z galaxy groups and clusters. These data reveal that Abell 1885 is a strong cool core, with a central cooling time of 0.43 Gyr, and that the central galaxy hosts an X-ray luminous point source at its center (L=2.3x10^42 erg/s), indicative of a rapidly accreting supermassive black hole. In the context of the larger CEREAL sample, we constrain the fraction of clusters at z~0.15 with X-ray bright central AGN to be no more than 4.1%. Including radio data from LOFAR, GMRT, ASKAP, and the VLA and optical integral field unit data from SDSS MaNGA, we probe the details of cooling, feeding, and feedback in this system. These data reveal that cooling of the intracluster medium is highly suppressed on large (&gt;10 kpc) scales despite a central supermassive black hole that is in the early stages of the self-regulation cycle (characterized by rapid accretion, physically small jets, and no large-scale low-frequency radio emission). To reconcile the large-scale quenching with a lack of visible large-scale feedback, we propose that the timescale on which energy is dissipated on large scales is significantly longer than the timescale on which black hole feeding operates on small (~pc) scales. These observations suggest that there are two separate timescales characterizing AGN feedback in clusters: the short timescale of small-scale feeding and feedback processes and a longer timescale by which energy is dissipated on large physical scales in the intracluster medium. This interpretation disfavors a model in which the energy is rapidly dissipated (e.g. shocks), which would synchronize the feeding and feedback timescales, and favors a model in which the heating effects of AGN feedback can linger long after the outburst has passed (e.g. turbulent mixing).</description>

      <title>The Roman View of Strong Gravitational Lenses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy-galaxy strong gravitational lenses can constrain dark matter models and the Lambda Cold Dark Matter cosmological paradigm at sub-galactic scales. Currently, there is a dearth of images of these rare systems with high signal-to-noise and angular resolution. The Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (hereafter, Roman), scheduled for launch in late 2026, will play a transformative role in strong lensing science with its planned wide-field surveys. With its remarkable 0.281 square degree field of view and diffraction-limited angular resolution of ~0.1 arcsec, Roman is uniquely suited to characterizing dark matter substructure from a robust population of strong lenses. We present a yield simulation of detectable strong lenses in Roman's planned High Latitude Wide Area Survey (HLWAS). We simulate a population of galaxy-galaxy strong lenses across cosmic time with Cold Dark Matter subhalo populations, select those detectable in the HLWAS, and generate simulated images accounting for realistic Wide Field Instrument detector effects. For a fiducial case of single 146-second exposures, we predict around 160,000 detectable strong lenses in the HLWAS, of which about 500 will have sufficient signal-to-noise to be amenable to detailed substructure characterization. We investigate the effect of the variation of the point-spread function across Roman's field of view on detecting individual subhalos and the suppression of the subhalo mass function at low masses. Our simulation products are available to support strong lens science with Roman, such as training neural networks and validating dark matter substructure analysis pipelines.</description>

      <title>Constraining the Baryon Fraction in the Intergalactic Medium with 92 localized Fast Radio Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are emerging as powerful cosmological probes for constraining the baryon fraction in the intergalactic medium (IGM), offering a promising avenue to address the missing baryon problem. In this paper, we analyze constraints on the IGM baryon fraction ($f_\mathrm{IGM}$) using 92 localized FRBs, incorporating a corrected probability distribution function for the IGM dispersion measure within three different cosmological models. We find that variations in the underlying cosmological model have a negligible impact on the inferred values of $f_\mathrm{IGM}$. While the NE2001 Galactic electron density model yields slightly higher $f_\mathrm{IGM}$ values compared to the YMW16 model, the results are consistent within the 1$\sigma$ confidence level. Additionally, there is no statistically significant evidence for redshift evolution in $f_\mathrm{IGM}$. Our analysis constrains $f_\mathrm{IGM}$ to the range $0.8 \sim 0.9$, providing strong support for the idea in which the majority of the missing baryons reside in the diffuse IGM.</description>

      <title>An independent estimate of H(z) at z = 0.5 from the stellar ages of brightest cluster galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several cosmological observations (e.g., Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), Supernovae Type Ia, and local distance ladder measurements such as Cepheids) have been used to measure the global expansion rate of the Universe, i.e., the Hubble constant, $H_{0}$. However, these precision measurements have revealed tensions between different probes that are proving difficult to solve. Independent, robust techniques must be exploited to validate results or mitigate systematic effects. We use the Cosmic Chronometer (CC) method, which leverages the differential age evolution of passive galaxies, to measure $H(z)$, without any assumption of the underlying cosmology. Unlike previous CC studies, we used only brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs), the oldest and most massive galaxies in the Universe, to construct a pure and homogeneous sample. In this work we used a sample of 53 BCGs in massive, Sunyaev-Zel'dovich selected galaxy clusters (0.3 $&lt; z &lt;$ 0.7) with Southern African Large Telescope (SALT) spectroscopic observations. We used optical spectra to measure D4000$_{\rm n}$ of the BCGs to obtain a new direct measurement of $H(z) = 72.1 \pm 33.9(\rm stat) \pm 7.3$(syst) km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ at $z=0.5$. By using BCGs, we significantly reduced the systematic errors to 10% by minimising the stellar mass and metallicity dependence of the method. The dominant uncertainty, and limitation for our study, is statistical, and we need larger, homogeneous samples of the oldest, most massive galaxies. By using the $Planck$+BAO prior of $\Omega_{m}$ and $\Omega_{\Lambda}$, the projected Hubble constant is $H_{0}$ = $54.6 \pm 25.7(\rm stat) \pm 5.5$(syst) km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, consistent with both CMB and Cepheid measurements.</description>

      <title>Differentiable Fuzzy Cosmic-Web for Field Level Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A comprehensive analysis of the cosmological large-scale structure derived from galaxy surveys involves field-level inference, which requires a forward modelling framework that simultaneously accounts for structure formation and tracer bias. While structure formation models are well-understood, the development of an effective field-level bias model remains imprecise, particularly in the context of tracer perturbation theory within Bayesian reconstruction methods, which we address in this work. To bridge this gap, we have developed a differentiable model that integrates augmented Lagrangian perturbation theory, nonlinear, nonlocal, and stochastic biasing. At the core of our approach is the Hierarchical Cosmic-Web Biasing Nonlocal (HICOBIAN) model, which provides a positive definite description of tracer bias while incorporating a long- and short-range nonlocal framework via cosmic-web regions and deviations from Poissonity in the likelihood. A key insight of our model is that transitions between cosmic-web regions are inherently smooth, which we implement using sigmoid-based gradient operations. This enables a fuzzy, and, hence, differentiable hierarchical cosmic-web description, making the model well-suited for machine learning frameworks. Our approach accurately reproduces the primordial density field within associated error bars, as validated by two- and three-point statistics in Fourier space. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the methodology approaches the maximum encoded information consistent with Poisson noise. We introduce a Bayesian field-level inference algorithm that leverages the same forward modelling framework used in galaxy, quasar, and Lyman alpha forest mock catalog generation -- including nonlinear, nonlocal and stochastic bias with redshift space distortions -- providing a unified and consistent approach to the analysis of large-scale cosmic structure.</description>

      <title>The effective running Hubble constant in SNe Ia as a marker for the dark energy nature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new method that reveal the nature of dark energy (DE) evolution. Specifically, the method consists of studying the evolving trend regarding the effective running Hubble constant: when it increases, it indicates a quintessence nature, and when it decreases, it reveals a phantom behavior. Within the framework of the dark energy models we analyze three parameterizations: the $w$CDM model, a reduced Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) model and a new theoretical model based on the possible creation of dark energy by the time-varying gravitational field of the expanding Universe. For each DE model, we construct a theoretical effective running Hubble constant, i.e. a function of the redshift, which highlights the difference between modified dynamics and the $\Lambda$CDM-one. Furthermore, these dark energy models are compared to the phenomenological model of a decreasing trend of the Hubble constant as a function of the redshift, called the power-law model (PL) and the $\Lambda$CDM one. These three theoretical functions are fitted against the binned SNe Ia data samples, i.e. the Pantheon and the Master samples, the latter being a collection of SNe Ia from 4 catalogs: Dark Energy Survey (DES), PantheonPlus, Pantheon and Joint Lightcurve Analysis (JLA), without duplicated SNe Ia, called the Master sample. The main result of our study is that the phenomenological PL model is statistically favored compared to the other proposed scenarios, both for the Pantheon and the Master samples. At this stage, the SNe Ia data do not indicate that the evolution of dark energy models among the studied ones is favored respect to the $\Lambda$CDM. Nevertheless, the binned Pantheon sample allows for a discrimination of the nature of dark energy at least at the $1\,\sigma$ level via the fit of the effective running Hubble constant.</description>

      <title>A Correlation Between FRB Dispersion Measure and Foreground Large-Scale Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The distribution of baryons in the Universe remains a fundamental open question in astronomy, and the dispersion measure (DM) of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) serves as a valuable tool for probing this cosmic gas. We investigate the impact of the foreground cosmic web on FRB DMs using 61 localized FRBs and public galaxy catalogs. We test for the large-scale structure's impact on cosmological DM using two methods. First, we searched for a correlation between galaxy number density along the line of sight and extragalactic DM, and found a statistically significant positive correlation ($p$ = $1.76 \times 10^{-5}$). The shape of this correlation contains information about the cosmic baryon distribution, and can also be used to better constrain host galaxy DM by providing an estimate of the cosmic contribution on a per-source basis. We observe similar correlations in a mock FRB survey based on the IllustrisTNG cosmological simulation, where the DM is dominated by filaments in the IGM and not by halos. Next, we performed a stacking analysis that measures the average excess DM as a function of impact parameter of foreground galaxies to obtain spatial information about how ionized gas is distributed around galaxy halos. We report excess DM in the stacked signal for impact parameters up to Mpc scales ($\sim$3$\sigma$). Finally, we identified FRBs that do not appear to intersect intervening halos within $r_{vir}$, allowing us to estimate the fraction of baryons that reside in the IGM. We find $f_{\mathrm{IGM}} \geq 0.69$ at 95$\%$ confidence, indicating significant astrophysical feedback.</description>

      <title>Analyzing Line-of-sight selection biases in galaxy-scale strong lensing with external convergence and shear</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The upcoming Vera Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will dramatically increase the number of strong gravitational lensing systems, requiring precise modeling of line-of-sight (LOS) effects to mitigate biases in lensing observations and cosmological inferences. We develop a method to construct joint distributions of external convergence ($\kappa_{\mathrm{ext}}$) and shear ($\gamma_{\mathrm{ext}}$) for strong lensing LOS by aggregating large-scale structure simulations with high-resolution halo renderings and non-linear correction. Our approach captures both smooth background matter and perturbations from halos, enabling accurate modeling of LOS effects. We apply non-linear LOS corrections to $\kappa_{\mathrm{ext}}$ and $\gamma_{\mathrm{ext}}$ that address the non-additive lensing effects caused by objects along the LOS in strong lensing. We find that, with a minimum image separation of $1.0^{\prime\prime}$, non-linear LOS correction due to the presence of a dominant deflector slightly increases the ratio of quadruple to double lenses; this non-linear LOS correction also introduces systematic biases of $\sim 0.1\%$ for galaxy-AGN lenses in the inferred Hubble constant ($H_0$) if not accounted for. We also observe a $0.66\%$ bias for galaxy-galaxy lenses on $H_0$, and even larger biases up to $1.02\%$ for galaxy-AGN systems if LOS effects are not accounted for. These results highlight the importance of LOS for precision cosmology. The publicly available code and datasets provide tools for incorporating LOS effects in future analyses.</description>

      <title>Bulk/boundary Modular Quintessence and DESI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The latest DESI DR2 results, when combined with other independent cosmological data on the Cosmic Microwave Background and supernovas, suggest a preference for dynamical dark energy.
  We propose a novel cosmological scenario, which features two distinct scalar fields. One governs the magnitude of the present-day dark energy density and is related to the size of extra-dimensions. Accounting for the observed smallness of this energy density requires the scalar to reside near the boundary of field space.
  The second field, responsible for the time evolution of dark energy and associated with the string coupling, must instead lie in the bulk to remain consistent with the non-observation of light string states. We show that a natural candidate for such dark energy dynamics is a quintessence modular-invariant potential, in which the second scalar field rolls down a negatively curved slope, starting from a self-dual critical point. We find that this scenario is in good agreement with the latest findings by DESI.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Outliers: Low-Spin Halos Explain the Abundance, Compactness, and Redshift Evolution of the Little Red Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Little Red Dots (LRDs) are high-redshift galaxies uncovered by JWST, characterized by small effective radii ($R_{\rm eff} \sim 80-300$ pc), number densities intermediate between typical galaxies and quasars, and a redshift distribution peaked at $z \sim 5$. We present a theoretical model in which the LRDs descend from dark matter halos in the extreme low-spin tail of the angular momentum distribution. Within this framework, we explain their three key observational signatures: (i) abundance, (ii) compactness, and (iii) redshift distribution. Our model focuses on observed, not modeled, properties; it is thus independent of whether they are powered primarily by a black hole or stars. We find that the assumption that the prototypical LRD at $z \sim 5$ originates from halos in the lowest $\sim 1\%$ of the spin distribution is sufficient to reproduce both their observed number densities and physical sizes. The redshift evolution of their observability is driven by the interplay between the evolving compact disk fraction and cosmological surface brightness dimming. This effect leads to a well-defined "LRDs Era" at $4&lt;z&lt;8$, during which the LRDs are common and detectable; at $z&lt;4$, they are bright but rare, while at $z&gt;8$, they are common but faint. Finally, we test the predicted redshift trend against observational data, finding excellent agreement. Additional observational support comes from their excess small-scale clustering and spectral signatures of extreme core densities, both of which are expected outcomes of galaxy formation in low-spin halos. These findings suggest that the LRDs are not a fundamentally distinct population but the natural manifestation of galaxies forming in the rarest, lowest angular momentum environments.</description>

      <title>The Pandora project. II: how non-thermal physics drives bursty star formation and temperate mass-loaded outflows in dwarf galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dwarf galaxies provide powerful laboratories for studying galaxy formation physics. Their early assembly, shallow gravitational potentials, and bursty, clustered star formation histories make them especially sensitive to the processes that regulate baryons through multi-phase outflows. Using high-resolution, cosmological zoom-in simulations of a dwarf galaxy from \textit{the Pandora suite}, we explore the impact of stellar radiation, magnetic fields, and cosmic ray feedback on star formation, outflows, and metal retention. We find that our purely hydrodynamical model without non-thermal physics - in which supernova feedback is boosted to reproduce realistic stellar mass assembly - drives violent, overly enriched outflows that suppress the metal content of the host galaxy. Including radiation reduces the clustering of star formation and weakens feedback. However, the additional incorporation of cosmic rays produces fast, mass-loaded, multi-phase outflows consisting of both ionized and neutral gas components, in better agreement with observations. These outflows, which entrain a denser, more temperate ISM, exhibit broad metallicity distributions while preserving metals within the galaxy. Furthermore, the star formation history becomes more bursty, in agreement with recent JWST findings. These results highlight the essential role of non-thermal physics in galaxy evolution and the need to incorporate it in future galaxy formation models.</description>

      <title>Could Planck Star Remnants be Dark Matter?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the end state of gravitational collapse under quantum gravity effects and propose that Planck Star Remnants (PSR), formed via nonsingular bounces, could serve as viable dark matter candidates. Within the framework of Loop Quantum Cosmology, we model the collapse of a homogeneous matter distribution and show that the classical singularity is replaced by a quantum bounce at the Planck density. By analytically matching the Friedmann Lemaitre Robertson Walker (FLRW) interior to an exterior Schwarzschild spacetime using the Israel junction conditions, we demonstrate that the bounce remains causally hidden from external observers, avoiding any observable re-expansion. This naturally leads to the formation of stable, non-radiating PSR, whose radius coincides with the Schwarzschild radius when the black hole mass approaches the Planck mass as a result of Hawking evaporation. We suggest that such remnants may originate from evaporating primordial black holes in the early universe, and estimate the relic abundance needed for PSR to account for the observed dark matter density. We also discuss some crucial differences between PSR and previous proposals of Planck mass relics. The scenario is shown to be consistent with existing astrophysical and cosmological constraints, offering a unified framework connecting quantum gravitational collapse, and the nature of dark matter.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Isocurvature Bounds on the Minimal QCD Axion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The QCD axion has important connections to early universe cosmology. For example, it is often said that isocurvature limits rule out a combination of high axion decay constant, $f_a$, and high inflationary Hubble scale, $H_I$. High scales are theoretically motivated, so it is important to ask how robust this constraint is. We demonstrate that this constraint is naturally evaded when the quartic coupling of the complex $U(1)_\mathrm{PQ}$-breaking field is small. In this case, $f_a$ changes from a larger value during inflation to a smaller value in the later universe, suppressing isocurvature perturbations. Importantly, we show that in large parts of parameter space this solution is not jeopardised by overproduction of the axion through parametric resonance. The isocurvature bounds are thus dependent on UV physics. We have found that, even for the minimal QCD axion, large parts of UV parameter space at both high $f_a$ and high $H_I$ are in fact allowed, not ruled out by isocurvature constraints.</description>

      <title>Quantum entanglement in cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss recent progress in the study of entanglement within cosmological frameworks, focusing on both momentum and position-space approaches and also reviewing the possibility to directly extract entanglement from quantum fields. Entanglement generation in expanding spacetimes can be traced back to the phenomenon of gravitational particle production, according to which the background gravitational field may transfer energy and momentum to quantum fields. The corresponding entanglement amount and its mode dependence are both sensitive to the field statistics and to the details of spacetime expansion, thus encoding information about the background. Gravitational production processes also play a key role in addressing the quantum-to-classical transition of cosmological perturbations. In order to directly extract entanglement from quantum fields, local interactions with additional quantum systems, working as detectors, have been suggested, leading to the formulation of the entanglement harvesting protocol. Despite harvesting procedures are currently unfeasible from an experimental point of view, various proposals for implementation exist and a proper modeling of detectors and local interactions is crucial to address entanglement extraction via realistic setups. In the final part of the work, we address entanglement characterization in position space, primarily focusing on black hole spacetimes. We first investigate a possible interpretation of Bekenstein-Hawking black hole entropy in terms of the entanglement entropy arising in discrete quantum field theories, on account of the area law. Then, we discuss the resolution of the black hole information paradox via the gravitational fine-grained entropy formula, which provides a new way to compute the entropy of Hawking radiation and allows to preserve unitarity in black hole evaporation processes.</description>

      <title>Stochastic inflation as a superfluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We point out that inflationary superhorizon fluctuations can be effectively described by a set of equations analogous to those governing a superfluid. This is achieved through a functional Schr\"odinger approach to the evolution of the inflationary wavefunction, combined with a suitable coarse-graining procedure to capture large-scale dynamics. The irrotational fluid velocity is proportional to the gradient of the wavefunction phase. Marginalizing over short superhorizon modes introduces an external force acting on the fluid velocity. The quantum pressure characteristic of the superfluid plays a role in scenarios involving an ultra-slow-roll phase of inflation. Our superfluid framework is consistent with the standard Starobinsky approach to stochastic inflation while offering complementary insights, particularly by providing more precise information on the phase of the inflationary wavefunction. We also discuss a heuristic approach to include dissipative effects in this description.</description>

Abstract: L-BASS is an instrument designed to make radiometric temperature measurements of the sky with an absolute accuracy of better than 0.1 K at 1.4 GHz. This will be achieved in two steps: first by measuring the sky temperature relative to that of the North Celestial Pole, using two horn-based antennas, and second with the sky antenna replaced with a calibrated cryogenic load to measure the absolute brightness temperature of the North Celesial Pole. Here we describe the design of the L-BASS two-antenna system and report on laboratory measurements to establish its performance at component and sub-system level.</description>

      <title>Deep Neural Networks Hunting Ultra-Light Dark Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultra-light dark matter (ULDM) is a compelling candidate for cosmological dark matter. If ULDM interacts with ordinary matter, it can induce measurable, characteristic signals in pulsar-timing data because it causes the orbits of pulsars in binary systems to osculate. In this work, we investigate the potential of machine learning (ML) techniques to detect such ULDM signals. To this end, we construct three types of neural networks: an autoencoder, a binary classifier, and a multiclass classifier. We apply these methods to four theoretically well-motivated ULDM models: a linearly coupled scalar field, a quadratically coupled scalar field, a vector field and a tensor field. We show that the sensitivity achieved using ML methods is comparable to that of a semi-analytical Bayesian approach, which to date has only been applied to the linear scalar case. The ML approach is readily applicable to all four ULDM models and, in the case of the multiclass classifier, can distinguish between them. Our results, derived from simulated data, lay the foundation for future applications to real pulsar-timing observations.</description>

      <title>Exploring over 700 massive quiescent galaxies at z = 2-7: Demographics and stellar mass functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04119v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-redshift ($z&gt;2$) massive quiescent galaxies are crucial tests of early galaxy formation and evolutionary mechanisms through their cosmic number densities and stellar mass functions (SMFs). We explore a sample of 745 massive ($\rm M_*&gt; 10^{9.5}M_\odot$) quiescent galaxies from $z=2-7$ in over 800 arcmin$^2$ of NIRCam imaging from a compilation of public JWST fields (with a total area $&gt;$ 5 $\times$ previous JWST studies). We compute and report their cosmic number densities, stellar mass functions, and cosmic stellar mass density. We confirm a significant overabundance of massive quiescent galaxies relative to a range of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations and semi-analytic models (SAMs). We find that one SAM, SHARK is able to reproduce our observed number density with the addition of mock observational errors, but that it is still unable to produce quiescent galaxies of the same masses. We find that no simulations or SAMs accurately reproduce the SMF for massive quiescent galaxies at any redshift within the interval $z=2-5$. This shows that none of these models' feedback prescriptions are fully capturing high-z galaxy quenching, challenging the standard formation scenarios. We find a greater abundance of lower-mass ($\rm M_*&lt;10^{10}M_\odot$) quiescent galaxies than previously found, highlighting the importance of sSFR cuts rather than simple colour selection. We show the importance of this selection bias, alongside individual field-to-field variations caused by cosmic variance, in varying the observed quiescent galaxy SMF, especially at higher-z. We also find a steeper increase in the cosmic stellar mass density for massive quiescent galaxies than has been seen previously, with an increase of around a factor of 60 from $z=4.5$ to $z=2$, indicating the increasing importance of galaxy quenching within these epochs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09964v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $\delta N$ formalism is a powerful approach to compute non-linearly the large-scale evolution of the comoving curvature perturbation $\zeta$. It assumes a set of FLRW patches that evolve independently, but in doing so, all the gradient terms are discarded, which are not negligibly small in models beyond slow-roll. In this Letter, we extend the formalism to capture these gradient corrections by encoding them in a homogeneous-spatial-curvature contribution assigned to each FLRW patch. For a concrete example, we apply this formalism to the ultra-slow-roll inflation, and find that it can correctly describe the large-scale evolution of the comoving curvature perturbation from the horizon exit. We also briefly discuss non-Gaussianities in this context.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03612v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the presence of primordial gravitational vector modes (V-modes) and their sourcing of primordial magnetic fields (PMF), i.e. magnetogenesis. As the adiabatic vector mode generically decays with expansion, we consider exotic initial conditions which circumvent this issue and lead to observational imprints. The first initial condition is an isocurvature mode between photons and neutrinos vorticities, and the second one is a non-trivial initial condition on the neutrino octupole. Both types of conditions sustain a constant vector mode on super Hubble scales at early times. We also consider a third scenario in which the adiabatic vector modes are rapidly sourced, at a given early but finite time, by an exotic component which develops an anisotropic stress. We find the best fitting parameters in these three cases to CMB and BAO data. We compare the resulting $B$-mode spectra of the CMB to data from BICEP/Keck and SPTpol. We find that none of the proposed initial conditions can produce large enough PMFs to seed every type of magnetic fields observed. However, V-modes are still consistent with the data and ought to be constrained for a better understanding of the primordial Universe before its hot big-bang phase.</description>

      <title>A New Master Supernovae Ia sample and the investigation of the $H_0$ tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11772v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern cosmological research still thoroughly debates the discrepancy between local probes and the Cosmic Microwave Background observations in the Hubble constant (\texorpdfstring{$H_0$}{H0}) measurements, ranging from 4 to 6$\sigma$. In the current study, we examine this tension using the Supernovae Ia (SNe Ia) data from the Pantheon, Pantheon+ (P+), Joint Lightcurve Analysis (JLA), and Dark Energy Survey, (DES) catalogs combined together into the so-called Master Sample. The sample contains 3714 SNe Ia, and is divided all of them into redshift-ordered bins. Three binning techniques are presented: the equi-population, the moving window (MW), and the equi-spacing in the \texorpdfstring{$\log-z$}{log-z}. We perform a Markov-Chain Monte Carlo analysis (MCMC) for each bin to determine the $H_0$ value, estimating it within the standard flat \texorpdfstring{$\Lambda$CDM}{LCDM} and the \texorpdfstring{$w_{0}w_{a}$CDM}{w0waCDM} models. These \texorpdfstring{$H_0$}{H0} values are then fitted with the following phenomenological function: \texorpdfstring{$\mathcal{H}_0(z) = \tilde{H}_0 / (1 + z)^\alpha$}{H0(z) = H0tilde / (1 + z)^alpha}, where \texorpdfstring{$\tilde{H}_0$}{H0tilde} is a free parameter representing \texorpdfstring{$\mathcal{H}_0(z)$}{H0(z)} fitted in \texorpdfstring{$z=0$}{z=0}, and \texorpdfstring{$\alpha$}{alpha} is the evolutionary parameter. Our results indicate a decreasing trend characterized by \texorpdfstring{$\alpha \sim 0.01$}{alpha ~ 0.01}, whose consistency with zero ranges from $1 \sigma$ in 5 cases to 1 case at 3 $\sigma$ and 11 cases at $&gt; 3 \sigma$ in several samples and configurations. Such a trend in the SNe Ia catalogs could be due to evolution with redshift for the astrophysical variables or unveiled selection biases. Alternatively, intrinsic physics, possibly the \texorpdfstring{$f(R)$}{f(R)} theory of gravity, could be responsible for this trend.</description>

      <title>Expansion-history preferences of DESI DR2 and external data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07185v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the origin of the preference of DESI DR2 baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements and external data from cosmic microwave background (CMB) and type Ia supernovae (SNIa) that dark energy behavior departs from that expected in the standard cosmological model with vacuum energy ($\Lambda$CDM). In our analysis, we allow a flexible scaling of the expansion rate with redshift that nevertheless allows reasonably tight constraints on the quantities of interest, and adopt and validate a simple yet accurate compression of the CMB data that allows us to constrain our phenomenological model of the expansion history. We find that data consistently show a preference for a 3-4 % increase in the expansion rate at $z\simeq 0.7$ relative to that predicted by the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, in excellent agreement with results from the less flexible $(w_0, w_a)$ parameterization which was used in previous analyses. Even though our model allows a departure from the best-fit $\Lambda$CDM model at zero redshift, we find no evidence for such a signal. We also find no evidence (at greater than 1$\sigma$ significance) for a departure of the expansion rate from the $\Lambda$CDM predictions at higher redshifts for any of the data combinations that we consider. Overall, our results strengthen the robustness of the findings using the combination of DESI, CMB, and SNIa data to dark-energy modeling assumptions.</description>

Abstract: We show that the null geodesic equation for photons is modified in the presence of a charged scalar field, with quantum fluctuations acting as an effective mass term that changes the null paths to timelike curves. This effect can be interpreted as a vacuum polarization phenomenon in curved spacetime. The resulting contribution to the Sachs-Wolfe effect varies with photon frequency, leading to frequency-dependent corrections to the cosmic microwave background (CMB) blackbody spectrum in the form of a $\mu$-distortion, as well as modifications to the CMB power spectrum. We estimate these within a standard inflationary scenario and find that while the correction to the CMB power spectrum is significant when the scalar field is light, the magnitude of the $\mu$-distortion depends strongly on the regularization prescription.</description>

      <title>Power Suppression and Lensing Anomaly -- A phenomenological investigation</title>

Abstract: Primordial power spectra with low power at long wavelengths can alleviate lensing anomaly. However the extent to which data favours such a primordial spectra is not clear. In this work, we investigate power suppression and related mitigation of lensing anomaly with the help of phenomenological models which are valid over scales of interest. We consider simple extensions to nearly scale invariant power spectra such as those which includes running and running of running of spectral index. We perform Bayesian analysis of these models, which are agnostic about power suppression, with Planck legacy data and show that data tend to choose parameters which leads to power suppression at low multipoles. We then investigate the connection between power suppression and alleviation of lensing anomaly and show that lensing anomaly is mitigated the most in models with maximum suppression of power at low multipoles. We also analyse the significance of these findings using information criteria. These results are further analyzed in the light of Planck Release 4 data using \texttt{CamSpec}, \texttt{HiLLiPoP} and \texttt{LoLLiPoP} likelihoods in which departure of lensing parameter from one is significantly reduced. Furthermore, we investigate the ability of near-ultimate future CMB missions such as ECHO to put tighter constraints on these models and to settle the issue. We conclude that we can make stronger conclusions about the presence of power suppression in the future by studying such simple phenomenological models.</description>

      <title>Probing Time-Varying Dark Energy with DESI: The Crucial Role of Precision Matter Density ($\Omega_{m0}$) Measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19052v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate measurements of fundamental cosmological parameters, especially the Hubble constant ($H_0$) and present-day matter density ($\Omega_{m0}$), are crucial for constraining dark energy (DE) evolution. We analyze the sensitivities of cosmological observables ($H(z)$, $D_L(z)$, $\EG$) to $\Omega_{m0}$, $\omega_0$, and $\omega_a$ under different parametrizations. Our results show observables are far more sensitive to $\Omega_{m0}$ than to DE equation of state parameters (e.g., at $z \sim 0.5$, $H(z)$'s $\Omega_{m0}$ sensitivity is $\sim 0.7$ vs. $\omega_a$'s $\sim 0.04$). This hierarchy mandates high-precision $\Omega_{m0}$ measurements to accurately constrain time-varying DE. We also find DE parameter sensitivity highly depends on parametrization; the standard CPL form shows low sensitivity to $\omega_a$, but $\omega(z) = \omega_0 + \omega_a \ln(1+z)$ significantly enhances it. Our analysis of DESI DR1/DR2 data confirms these theoretical limits: standalone DESI data primarily provides only upper limits for $\omega_a$, underscoring insufficient constraining power for a definitive time-varying DE detection. While combined datasets offer tighter constraints, interpretation requires caution due to parametrization influence. In conclusion, improving $\Omega_{m0}$ precision and adopting optimized parametrizations are imperative for future surveys like DESI to fully probe dark energy's nature.</description>

      <title>TDCOSMO 2025: Cosmological constraints from strong lensing time delays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03023v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present cosmological constraints from 8 strongly lensed quasars (hereafter, the TDCOSMO-2025 sample). Building on previous work, our analysis incorporated new deflector stellar velocity dispersions measured from spectra obtained with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), the Keck Telescopes, and the Very Large Telescope (VLT), utilizing improved methods. We used integrated JWST stellar kinematics for 5 lenses, VLT-MUSE for 2, and resolved kinematics from Keck and JWST for RX J1131-1231. We also considered two samples of non-time-delay lenses: 11 from the Sloan Lens ACS (SLACS) sample with Keck-KCWI resolved kinematics; and 4 from the Strong Lenses in the Legacy Survey (SL2S) sample. We improved our analysis of line-of-sight effects, the surface brightness profile of the lens galaxies, and orbital anisotropy, and corrected for projection effects in the dynamics. Our uncertainties are maximally conservative by accounting for the mass-sheet degeneracy in the deflectors' mass density profiles. The analysis was blinded to prevent experimenter bias. Our primary result is based on the TDCOSMO-2025 sample, in combination with $\Omega_{\rm m}$ constraints from the Pantheon+ Type Ia supernovae (SN) dataset. In the flat $\Lambda$ Cold Dark Matter (CDM), we find $H_0=72.1^{+4.0}_{-3.7}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. The SLACS and SL2S samples are in excellent agreement with the TDCOSMO-2025 sample, improving the precision on $H_0$ in flat $\Lambda$CDM to 4.4%. Using the Dark Energy Survey SN Year-5 dataset (DES-SN5YR) or DESI-DR2 baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO) likelihoods instead of Pantheon+ yields very similar results. We also present constraints in the open $\Lambda$CDM, $w$CDM, $w_0w_a$CDM, and $w_{\phi}$CDM cosmologies. The TDCOSMO $H_0$ inference is robust and consistent across all presented cosmological models, and our cosmological constraints in them agree with those from the BAO and SN.</description>

      <title>Stability of domain walls with inflationary fluctuations under potential bias, and gravitational wave signatures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14590v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A recent study has shown that domain walls with inflationary initial fluctuations exhibit remarkable stability against population bias due to long-range correlations, challenging the claims of prior research. In this paper, we study the dynamics of these domain walls in the presence of potential bias and show that they collapse with a lifetime several times longer than that due to thermal fluctuations. This is interpreted as a difference in the average distance between domain walls, leading us to derive a new formula for the domain wall lifetime which depends on the area parameter in a qualitatively different way from previous studies. In addition, we compute the spectrum of gravitational waves generated by such domain walls and find that both the peak frequency and the peak abundance are lowered in a manner that depends on the area parameter. Based on these findings, we also determine the necessary degree of vacuum degeneracy for axion domain walls to explain the isotropic cosmic birefringence.</description>

      <title>Quantum gravity from Weyl conformal geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07160v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We review recent developments in physical implications of Weyl conformal geometry. The associated Weyl quadratic gravity action is a gauge theory of the Weyl group of dilatations and Poincar\'e symmetry. Weyl conformal geometry is defined by equivalence classes of the metric and Weyl gauge field ($\omega_\mu$), related by Weyl gauge transformations. Weyl geometry can be seen as a covariantised version of Riemannian geometry with respect to Weyl gauge symmetry (of dilatations). This Weyl gauge-covariant formulation of Weyl geometry is metric, which avoids century-old criticisms on the physical relevance of this geometry, that ignored its gauge symmetry. Weyl quadratic gravity and its geometry have interesting properties: a) Weyl gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken and Einstein-Hilbert gravity and Riemannian geometry are recovered, with $\Lambda&gt;0$; b) this is the only true gauge theory of a space-time symmetry i.e. with a physical (Weyl) gauge boson ($\omega_\mu$); c) all fields and masses have geometric origin (with no added scalar fields); d) the theory has a Weyl gauge invariant geometric regularisation (by $\hat R$) in $d$ dimensions and it is Weyl-anomaly free; this anomaly is recovered in the broken phase after massive $\omega_\mu$ decouples; e) the theory is the leading order of the general Weyl gauge invariant Dirac-Born-Infeld (WDBI) action of Weyl conformal geometry in $d$ dimensions; f) in the limit of vanishing Weyl gauge current, one obtains conformal gravity; g) finally, Standard Model (SM) has a natural embedding in conformal geometry with no new degrees of freedom, with successful Starobinsky-Higgs inflation. Briefly, Weyl conformal geometry generates a (quantum) gauge theory of gravity, given by Weyl quadratic gravity, and leads to a unified description, by the gauge principle, of Einstein-Hilbert gravity and SM interactions.</description>

      <title>Modular domain walls and gravitational waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04900v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss modular domain walls and gravitational waves in a class of supersymmetric models where quark and lepton flavour symmetry emerges from modular symmetry. In such models a single modulus field $\tau$ is often assumed to be stabilised at or near certain fixed point values such as $\tau = {\rm i}$ and $\tau = \omega$ (the cube root of unity), in its fundamental domain. We show that, in the global supersymmetry limit of certain classes of potentials, the vacua at these fixed points may be degenerate, leading to the formation of modular domain walls in the early Universe. Taking supergravity effects into account, in the background of a fixed dilaton field $S$, the degeneracy may be lifted, leading to a bias term in the potential allowing the domain walls to collapse. We study the resulting gravitational wave spectra arising from the dynamics of such modular domain walls, and assess their observability by current and future experiments, as a window into modular flavour symmetry.</description>

      <title>The COSMOS-Web deep galaxy group catalog up to $z=3.7$</title>

Abstract: Galaxy groups with $M_{tot} \lesssim 10^{14}$ $M_\odot$ and up to a few tens of members are the most common galaxy environment, marking the transition between field and massive clusters. Identifying groups plays a crucial role in understanding structure formation and galaxy evolution. Modern deep surveys allow us to build well-characterized samples of groups up to the regime where structures were taking shape. We aimed to build the largest deep catalog of galaxy groups to date over the COSMOS-Web field effective area of 0.45 deg$^2$, leveraging the deep high quality data of the new COSMOS-Web photometric catalog resulted from the James Webb Space Telescope observations of the COSMOS-Web field. We performed the group search with the AMICO algorithm, a linear matched filter based on an analytical model for the group signal. AMICO has already been tested in wide and deep field surveys, including COSMOS data up to $z=2$. In this work, we tested the algorithm performances at even higher redshift and searched for protocluster cores at $z&gt;2$. We compiled a list of known protoclusters in COSMOS at $2 \leq z \leq 3.7$, matched them with our detections and studied the clustering of the detected cores. We estimated purity and completeness of our sample by creating data-driven mocks with the SinFoniA code and linked signal-to-noise to purity. We detected 1678 groups in the COSMOS-Web field up to $z=3.7$, including lists of members extending nearly two magnitudes deeper than the previous AMICO-COSMOS catalog. 756 groups were detected with purity of 80\%. More than 500 groups have their redshift confirmed by assigning spectroscopic counterparts. This group catalog offers a unique opportunity to explore galaxy evolution in different environments spanning $\sim$12 Gyr and to study groups, from the least rich population to the formation of the most massive clusters.</description>

      <title>Galaxy infall models for arbitrary velocity directions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13149v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For most galaxies in the cosmos, our knowledge of their motion is limited to line-of-sight velocities from redshift observations. To determine the radial velocity between two galaxies the minor and major infall models were established by Karachentsev &amp; Kashibadze (2006). Regardless of the background cosmology, our derivations reveal that these infall models approximate the total radial velocity between two galaxies by two different projections employing different information about the system. For galaxies having small angular separations $\theta$, all infall models agree that the radial velocity is the difference of their line-of-sight components. Applying these models to ca. $500$ halos of the Illustris-3 simulation, we find the perpendicular and tangential velocity parts to be non-negligible for more than 90% of all, more than 5000 infalling subhalos. Thus, even for $\theta &lt; 10$ deg, the infall-model velocities deviate from the true radial velocity. Only for 30% we found the true one lay between the minor and major infall velocity. However, the infall models yield robust upper and lower bounds to the true radial velocity dispersion. Observed under $\theta &lt; 10$ deg the velocity dispersion inferred from the sole difference of line-of-sight velocity components even coincides with the true one, justifying this approach for high-redshift groups and clusters. Based on these findings, we predict the radial velocity dispersion of the M81-group from the minor infall model (upper bound) $\sigma_{\mathrm{r,min}} = (180 \pm 42)~\mbox{km}/\mbox{s}$, from the major infall model (lower bound) $\sigma_{\mathrm{r,maj}} = (142 \pm 64) ~\mbox{km}/\mbox{s}$ and $\sigma_\mathrm{r,\Delta v} = (99 \pm 36)~\mbox{km}/\mbox{s}$ from the line-of-sight-velocity difference.</description>

      <title>Inverting no-hair theorems: How requiring General Relativity solutions restricts scalar-tensor theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05651v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Black hole solutions in general scalar-tensor theories are known to permit hair, i.e. non-trivial scalar profiles and/or metric solutions different from the ones of General Relativity (GR). Imposing that some such solutions$\unicode{x2013}$e.g. Schwarzschild or de Sitter solutions motivated in the context of black hole physics or cosmology$\unicode{x2013}$should exist, the space of scalar-tensor theories is strongly restricted. Here we investigate precisely what these restrictions are within general quadratic/cubic higher-order scalar-tensor theories for stealth solutions, whose metric is given by that in GR, supporting time-dependent scalar hair with a constant kinetic term. We derive, in a fully covariant approach, the conditions under which the Euler-Lagrange equations admit all (or a specific set of) exact GR solutions, as the first step toward our understanding of a wider class of theories that admit approximately stealth solutions. Focusing on static and spherically symmetric black hole spacetimes, we study the dynamics of linear odd-parity perturbations and discuss possible deviations from GR. Importantly, we find that requiring the existence of all stealth solutions prevents any deviations from GR in the odd-parity sector. In less restrictive scenarios, in particular for theories only requiring the existence of Schwarzschild(-de Sitter) black holes, we identify allowed deviations from GR, derive the stability conditions for the odd modes, and investigate the generic deviation of a non-trivial speed of gravitational waves. All calculations performed in this paper are reproducible via companion $\texttt {Mathematica}$ notebooks.</description>

      <title>The galaxy-halo connection of disc galaxies over six orders of magnitude in stellar mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22727v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: (Abridged) The relations between stellar ($M_\ast$), gas ($M_{\rm gas}$), baryonic ($M_{\rm bar} = M_\ast + M_{\rm gas}$), and dark matter halo mass ($M_{200}$) provide unique constraints on galaxy formation and cosmology. The shape of the relations constrains how galaxies regulate their growth through gas accretion, star formation, and feedback; their scatter probes the stochasticity of galaxy assembly.
  Here, we assemble a sample of 49 nearby gas-rich dwarf and massive disc galaxies with unmatched ancillary data. We obtain their gas kinematics and derive their dark matter properties through rotation curve decomposition. Our sample allows us to study the galaxy-halo connection across nearly six orders of magnitude in $M_\ast$. We find that the $M_{\rm gas}-M_{200}$ relation rises monotonically, with galaxies having around 4 per cent of the average cosmological baryon fraction in cold gas. Contrastingly, the $M_\ast-M_{200}$ relation shows a more complex behaviour. A particularly interesting finding is that of a population of baryon-deficient' dwarfs (BDDs) with stellar masses $\sim 1-1.5$ orders of magnitude lower than expected from current models. Yet, baryon-rich galaxies also exist, and we find a large spread in the baryon retention fraction across our galaxies. We compare our findings with semi-analytic and hydrodynamical galaxy formation simulations. While the simulations broadly reproduce most observed features, they struggle to match the BDDs and do not capture the diversity in baryon fractions. Understanding these differences will shed new light on how feedback regulates galaxy formation. Finally, we study the dark matter halo concentration-mass relation. We find that below $M_{200} \sim 10^{11}\,M_\odot$, the concentrations are systematically lower than expected. We discuss whether these results stem from the influence of baryonic physics or the environment.</description>
