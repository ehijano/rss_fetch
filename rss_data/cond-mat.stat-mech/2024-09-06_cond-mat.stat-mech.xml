      <title>Generative artificial intelligence for computational chemistry: a roadmap to predicting emergent phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent surge in Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has introduced exciting possibilities for computational chemistry. Generative AI methods have made significant progress in sampling molecular structures across chemical species, developing force fields, and speeding up simulations. This Perspective offers a structured overview, beginning with the fundamental theoretical concepts in both Generative AI and computational chemistry. It then covers widely used Generative AI methods, including autoencoders, generative adversarial networks, reinforcement learning, flow models and language models, and highlights their selected applications in diverse areas including force field development, and protein/RNA structure prediction. A key focus is on the challenges these methods face before they become truly predictive, particularly in predicting emergent chemical phenomena. We believe that the ultimate goal of a simulation method or theory is to predict phenomena not seen before, and that Generative AI should be subject to these same standards before it is deemed useful for chemistry. We suggest that to overcome these challenges, future AI models need to integrate core chemical principles, especially from statistical mechanics.</description>

      <title>Boundary dissipative spin chains with partial solvability inherited from system Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Partial solvability plays an important role in the context of statistical mechanics, since it has turned out to be closely related to the emergence of quantum many-body scar states, i.e., exceptional energy eigenstates which do not obey the strong version of the eigenstate themalization hypothesis. We show that partial solvability of a quantum many-body system can be maintained even when the system is coupled to boundary dissipators under certain conditions. We propose two mechanisms that support partially solvable structures in boundary dissipative systems: The first one is based on the restricted spectrum generating algebra, while the second one is based on the Hilbert space fragmentation. From these structures, we derive exact eigenmodes of the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad equation for a family of quantum spin chain models with boundary dissipators, where we find various intriguing phenomena arising from the partial solvability of the open quantum systems, including persistent oscillations (quantum synchronization) and the existence of the matrix product operator symmetry. We discuss how the presence of solvable eigenmodes affects long-time behaviors of observables in boundary dissipative spin chains based on numerical simulations using the quantum trajectory method.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Enumeration of Flat-Foldings : Study on Random Single Vertex Origami</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper deals with themes such as approximate counting/evaluation of the total number of flat-foldings for random origami diagrams, evaluation of the values averaged over various instances, obtaining forcing sets for general origami diagrams, and evaluation of average computational complexity. An approach to the above problems using a physical model and an efficient size reduction method for them is proposed. Using a statistical mechanics model and a numerical method of approximate enumeration based on it, we give the result of approximate enumeration of the total number of flat-foldings of single-vertex origami diagram with random width of angles gathering around the central vertex, and obtain its size dependence for an asymptotic prediction towards the limit of infinite size. In addition, an outlook with respect to the chained determination of local stacking orders of facets caused by the constraint that prohibits the penetration of them is also provided from the viewpoint of organizing the terms included in the physical model. A method to efficiently solve the problem of the determination or enumeration of flat-foldings is discussed based on the above perspectives. This is thought to be closely related to forcing sets.</description>

      <title>Absorbing state transitions with long-range annihilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a family of classical stochastic processes describing diffusive particles undergoing branching and long-range annihilation in the presence of a parity constraint. The probability for a pair-annihilation event decays as a power-law in the distance between particles, with a tunable exponent. Such long-range processes arise naturally in various classical settings, such as chemical reactions involving reagents with long-range electromagnetic interactions. They also increasingly play a role in the study of quantum dynamics, in which certain quantum protocols can be mapped to classical stochastic processes with long-range interactions: for example, state preparation or error correction processes aim to prepare ordered ground states, which requires removing point-like excitations in pairs via non-local feedback operations conditioned on a global set of measurement outcomes. We analytically and numerically describe features of absorbing phases and phase transitions in this family of classical models as pairwise annihilation is performed at larger and larger distances. Notably, we find that the two canonical absorbing-state universality classes -- directed-percolation and parity-conserving -- are endpoints of a line of universality classes with continuously interpolating critical exponents.</description>

      <title>Dynamics and kinetic theory of hard spheres under strong confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The kinetic theory description of a low density gas of hard spheres or disks, confined between two parallel plates separated a distance smaller than twice the diameter of the particles, is addressed starting from the Liouville equation of the system. The associated BBGKY hierarchy of equations for the reduced distribution functions is expanded in powers of a parameter measuring the density of the system in the appropriate dimensionless units. The Boltzmann level of description is obtained by keeping only the two lowest orders in the parameter. In particular, the one-particle distribution function obeys a couple of equations. Contrary to what happens with a Boltzmann-like kinetic equation that has been proposed for the same system on a heuristic basis, the kinetic theory formulated here admits stationary solutions that are consistent with equilibrium statistical mechanics, both in absence and presence of external fields. In the latter case, the density profile is rather complex due to the coupling between the inhomogeneities generated by the confinement and by the external fields. The general theory formulated provides a solid basis for the study of the properties of strongly confined dilute gases.</description>

      <title>Bayesian inference of wall torques for active Brownian particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The motility of living things and synthetic self-propelled objects is often described using Active Brownian particles. To capture the interaction of these particles with their often complex environment, this model can be augmented with empirical forces or torques, for example, to describe their alignment with an obstacle or wall after a collision. Here, we assess the quality of these empirical models by comparing their output predictions with trajectories of rod-shaped active particles that scatter sterically at a flat wall. We employ a classical least-squares method to evaluate the instantaneous torque. In addition, we lay out a Bayesian inference procedure to construct the posterior distribution of plausible model parameters. In contrast to the least squares fit, the Bayesian approach does not require orientational data of the active particle and can readily be applied to experimental tracking data.</description>

      <title>A visual proof of entropy production during thermalization with a heat reservoir</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, the equilibrium curve of a thermodynamic system is used to depict entropy production in the process of thermalization with a reservoir. For the given initial and final equilibrium states of the system, the entropy production is reduced when work is also extracted during thermalization. The case of maximum work extraction corresponds to a reversible process. For less than optimal work extraction, the lost available work is shown to be directly proportional to the entropy produced.</description>

      <title>Mean field lattice Boltzmann model for reactive mixtures in porous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new lattice Boltzmann model (LBM) is presented to describe chemically reacting multicomponent fluid flow in homogenised porous media. In this work, towards further generalizing the multicomponent reactive lattice Boltzmann model, we propose a formulation which is capable of performing reactive multicomponent flow computation in porous media at the representative elementary volume (REV) scale. To that end, the submodel responsible for interspecies diffusion has been upgraded to include Knudsen diffusion, whereas the kinetic equations for the species, the momentum and the energy have been rewritten to accommodate the effects of volume fraction of a porous media though careful choice of the equilibrium distribution functions. Verification of the mesoscale kinetic system of equations by a Chapman--Enskog analysis reveals that at the macroscopic scale, the homogenized Navier--Stokes equations for compressible multicomponent reactive flows are recovered. The Dusty Gas Model (DGM) capability hence formulated is validated over a wide pressure range by comparison of experimental flow rates of component species counter diffusing through capillary tubes. Next, for developing a capability to compute heterogeneous reactions, source terms for maintaining energy and mass balance across the fluid phase species and the surface adsorbed phase species are proposed. The complete model is then used to perform detailed chemistry simulations in porous electrodes of a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC), thereby predicting polarization curves which are of practical interest.</description>

      <title>Constructing the Infrared Conformal Generators on the Fuzzy Sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the conformal algebra on the fuzzy sphere, and in particular the generators of translations and special conformal transformations which are emergent symmetries in the infinite IR but are broken along the RG flow. We show how to extract these generators using the energy momentum tensor, which is complicated by the fact that one does not have a priori access to the energy momentum tensor of the CFT limit but rather must construct it numerically. We discuss and quantitatively analyze the main sources of corrections to the conformal generators due to the breaking of scale-invariance at finite energy, and develop efficient methods for removing these corrections. The resulting generators have matrix elements that match CFT predictions with accuracy varying from sub-percent level for the lowest-lying states up to several percent accuracy for states with dimension $\sim 5$ with $N=16$ fermions. We show that the generators can be used to accurately identify primary operators vs descendant operators in energy ranges where the spectrum is too dense to do the identification solely based on the approximate integer spacing within conformal multiplets.</description>

      <title>Fluctuating Hydrodynamics Describes Transport in Cellular Aggregates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biological functionality of cellular aggregates is largely influenced by the activity and displacements of individual constituent cells. From a theoretical perspective this activity can be characterized by hydrodynamic transport coefficients of diffusivity and conductivity. Motivated by the clustering dynamics of bacterial microcolonies we propose a model of active multicellular aggregates and use recently developed macroscopic fluctuation theory to derive a fluctuating hydrodynamics for this model system. Both semi-analytic theory and microscopic simulations show that the hydrodynamic transport coefficients are affected by non-equilibrium microscopic parameters and significantly decrease inside of the clusters. We further find that the Einstein relation connecting the transport coefficients and fluctuations breaks down in the parameter regime where the detailed balance is not satisfied. This study offers valuable tools for experimental investigation of hydrodynamic transport in other systems of cellular aggregates such as tumor spheroids and organoids.</description>

      <title>Non-Uniform Noise Rates and Griffiths Phases in Topological Quantum Error Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The performance of quantum error correcting (QEC) codes are often studied under the assumption of spatio-temporally uniform error rates. On the other hand, experimental implementations almost always produce heterogeneous error rates, in either space or time, as a result of effects such as imperfect fabrication and/or cosmic rays. It is therefore important to understand if and how their presence can affect the performance of QEC in qualitative ways. In this work, we study effects of non-uniform error rates in the representative examples of the 1D repetition code and the 2D toric code, focusing on when they have extended spatio-temporal correlations; these may arise, for instance, from rare events (such as cosmic rays) that temporarily elevate error rates over the entire code patch. These effects can be described in the corresponding statistical mechanics models for decoding, where long-range correlations in the error rates lead to extended rare regions of weaker coupling. For the 1D repetition code where the rare regions are linear, we find two distinct decodable phases: a conventional ordered phase in which logical failure rates decay exponentially with the code distance, and a rare-region dominated Griffiths phase in which failure rates are parametrically larger and decay as a stretched exponential. In particular, the latter phase is present when the error rates in the rare regions are above the bulk threshold. For the 2D toric code where the rare regions are planar, we find no decodable Griffiths phase: rare events which boost error rates above the bulk threshold lead to an asymptotic loss of threshold and failure to decode. Unpacking the failure mechanism implies that techniques for suppressing extended sequences of repeated rare events (which, without intervention, will be statistically present with high probability) will be crucial for QEC with the toric code.</description>

      <title>Charged critical behavior and nonperturbative continuum limit of three-dimensional lattice SU($N_c$) gauge Higgs models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the three-dimensional (3D) lattice SU($N_c$) gauge Higgs theories with multicomponent ($N_f&gt;1$) degenerate scalar fields and U($N_f$) global symmetry, focusing on systems with $N_c=2$, to identify critical behaviors that can be effectively described by the corresponding 3D SU($N_c$) gauge Higgs field theory. The field-theoretical analysis of the RG flow allows one to identify a stable charged fixed point for large values of $N_f$, that would control transitions characterized by the global symmetry-breaking pattern ${\rm U}(N_f)\rightarrow \mathrm{SU}(2)\otimes \mathrm{U}(N_f-2)$. Continuous transitions with the same symmetry-breaking pattern are observed in the SU(2) lattice gauge model for $N_f \ge 30$. Here we present a detailed finite-size scaling analysis of the Monte Carlo data for several large values of $N_f$. The results are in substantial agreement with the field-theoretical predictions obtained in the large-$N_f$ limit. This provides evidence that the SU($N_c$) gauge Higgs field theories provide the correct effective description of the 3D large-$N_f$ continuous transitions between the disordered and the Higgs phase, where the flavor symmetry breaks to $\mathrm{SU}(2)\otimes \mathrm{U}(N_f-2)$. Therefore, at least for large enough $N_f$, the 3D SU($N_c$) gauge Higgs field theories with multicomponent scalar fields can be nonperturbatively defined by the continuum limit of lattice discretizatized models with the same local and global symmetries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum complexity has emerged as a central concept in diverse areas of physics, ranging from quantum computing to the theory of black holes. We perform a systematic study of complexity in random quantum circuits with and without measurements. We observe that complexity grows linearly before saturating to a constant value. For $N$ qubits without measurements, the saturation value scales as $2^{N-1}$, and the saturation time scales as $2^N$. This behaviour remains identical in the presence of random measurements with different probabilities, indicating that this notion of complexity is insensitive to the rate of measurement. We also study the behaviour of complexity in two variants of the random unitary floquet circuit, where we observe that complexity acts as a novel probe of Anderson localization and many-body localization.</description>

      <title>Loop corrections for hard spheres in Hamming space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We begin with an exact expression for the entropy of a system of hard spheres within the Hamming space. This entropy relies on probability marginals, which are determined by an extended set of Belief Propagation (BP) equations. The BP probability marginals are functions of auxiliary variables which are introduced to model the effects of loopy interactions on a tree-structured interaction graph. We explore various reasonable and approximate probability distributions, ensuring they align with the exact solutions of the BP equations. Our approach is based on an ansatz of (in)homogeneous cavity marginals respecting the permutation symmetry of the problem. Through thorough analysis, we aim to minimize errors in the BP equations. Our findings support the conjecture that the maximum packing density asymptotically conforms to the lower bound proposed by Gilbert and Varshamov, further validated by the solution of the loopy BP equations.</description>

Abstract: The classical Landau--Lifshitz equation -- the simplest model of a ferromagnet -- provides an archetypal example for studying transport phenomena. In one-spatial dimension, integrability enables the classification of the spectrum of linear and nonlinear modes. An exact characterization of finite-temperature thermodynamics and transport has nonetheless remained elusive. We present an exact description of thermodynamic equilibrium states in terms of interacting modes. This is achieved by retrieving the classical Landau--Lifschitz model through the semiclassical limit of the integrable quantum spin-$S$ anisotropic Heisenberg chain at the level of the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz description. In the axial regime, the mode spectrum comprises solitons with unconventional statistics, whereas in the planar regime we additionally find two special types of modes of radiative and solitonic type. The obtained framework paves the way for analytical study of unconventional transport properties: as an example we study the finite-temperature spin Drude weight, finding excellent agreement with Monte Carlo simulations.</description>

      <title>Multiple quantum harmonic oscillators in the Tsallis statistics</title>

Abstract: We studied multiple quantum harmonic oscillators in the Tsallis statistics of entropic parameter $q$ in the cases that the distributions are power-like, separately applying the conventional expectation value, the unnormalized $q$-expectation value, and the normalized $q$-expectation value  (escort average). We obtained the expressions of the energy and the Tsallis entropy, using the Barnes zeta function. For the same oscillators, we obtained the expressions of the energy, the Tsallis entropy, the average level of the oscillators, and the heat capacity. Numerically, we calculated the energy, the Tsallis entropy, and the heat capacity for various $N$ and $q$, using the expansion of the Barnes zeta function with the Hurwitz zeta function, where $N$ is the number of independent oscillators. The parameter $q$ is less than one in the Tsallis statistics with the conventional expectation value. The parameter $q$ is greater than one in both sets of the Tsallis statistics, each of which is defined with a different $q$-expectation value. These limitations of $q$ arise from the requirements that the distributions are power-like. It was shown from the requirements for the Barnes zeta function that $q$ is greater than $N/(N+1)$ for the conventional expectation value and that $q$ is less than $(N+1)/N$ for both of the $q$-expectation values. In the Tsallis statistics with the conventional expectation value, the energy, the Tsallis entropy, and the heat capacity decrease with $q$. These quantities per oscillator increase with $N$. The quantities are affected by zero point energy. In the Tsallis statistics with the unnormalized $q$-expectation value, the energy, the Tsallis entropy, and the heat capacity increase with $q$ at low temperature, while decrease with $q$ at high temperature. These quantities per oscillator increase with $N$ at low temperature, while decrease with $N$ at high temperature. The heat capacity is the Schottky-type. The quantities are affected by zero point energy. In the Tsallis statistics with the normalized $q$-expectation value, the $N$ dependence of the energy per oscillator and that of the heat capacity per oscillator are quite weak, and the $q$ dependence of the energy and that of the heat capacity are also weak, when the equilibrium temperature, which is often called the physical temperature, is adopted. The $N$ dependence of the Tsallis entropy per oscillator and the $q$ dependence of the Tsallis entropy are clearly seen. The quantities do not depend on zero point energy except for the energy.</description>

      <title>Generalized hydrodynamics of integrable quantum circuits</title>

Abstract: Quantum circuits make it possible to simulate the continuous-time dynamics of a many-body Hamiltonian by implementing discrete Trotter steps of duration $\tau$. However, when $\tau$ is sufficiently large, the discrete dynamics exhibit qualitative differences compared to the original evolution, potentially displaying novel features and many-body effects. We study an interesting example of this phenomenon, by considering the integrable Trotterization of a prototypical integrable model, the XXZ Heisenberg spin chain. We focus on the well-known bipartition protocol, where two halves of a large system are prepared in different macrostates and suddenly joined together, yielding non-trivial nonequilibrium dynamics. Building upon recent results and adapting the generalized hydrodynamics (GHD) of integrable models, we develop an exact large-scale description of an explicit one-dimensional quantum-circuit setting, where the input left and right qubits are initialized in two distinct product states. We explore the phenomenology predicted by the GHD equations, which depend on the Trotter step and the gate parameters. In some phases of the parameter space, we show that the quantum-circuit large-scale dynamics is qualitatively different compared to the continuous-time evolution. In particular, we find that a single microscopic defect at the junction, such as the addition of a single qubit, may change the nonequilibrium macrostate appearing at late time.</description>

      <title>Generalised BBGKY hierarchy for near-integrable dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00593v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider quantum or classical many-body Hamiltonian systems, whose dynamics is given by an integrable, contact interactions, plus another, possibly long-range, generic two-body potential. We show how the dynamics of local observables is given in terms of a generalised version of Bogoliubov-Born-Green-Kirkwood-Yvon hierarchy, which we denote as gBBGKY, which is built for the densities, and their correlations, of the quasiparticles of the underlying integrable model. Unlike the usual cases of perturbation theory from free gases, the presence of local interactions in the integrable model "lifts" the so-called kinetic blocking, and the second layer of the hierarchy reproduces the dynamics at all time-scales. The latter consists of a fast pre-equilibration to a non-thermal steady state, and its subsequent thermalisation to a Gibbs ensemble. We show how the final relaxation is encoded into a Boltzmann scattering integral involving three or higher body-scatterings, and which, remarkably, is entirely determined by the diffusion constants of the underlying integrable model. We check our results with exact molecular dynamics simulations, finding perfect agreement. Our results show how gBBGKY can be successfully employed in quantum systems to compute scattering integrals and Fermi's golden rule transition rates.</description>

      <title>Time-cost-error trade-off relation in thermodynamics: The third law and beyond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04576v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Elucidating fundamental limitations inherent in physical systems is a central subject in physics. For important thermodynamic operations such as information erasure, cooling, and copying, resources like time and energetic cost must be expended to achieve the desired outcome within a predetermined error margin. In this study, we introduce the concept of separated states, which consist of fully unoccupied and occupied states. This concept generalizes many critical states involved in relevant thermodynamic operations. We then uncover a three-way trade-off relation between time, cost, and error for a general class of thermodynamic operations aimed at creating separated states, simply expressed as $\tau\mathcal{C}\varepsilon_{\tau}\ge 1-\eta$. This fundamental relation is applicable to diverse thermodynamic operations, including information erasure, cooling, and copying. It provides a profound quantification of the unattainability principle in the third law of thermodynamics in a general form. Building upon this relation, we explore the quantitative limitations governing cooling operations, the preparation of separated states, and a no-go theorem for exact classical copying. Furthermore, we extend these findings to the quantum regime, encompassing both Markovian and non-Markovian dynamics. Specifically, within Lindblad dynamics, we derive a similar three-way trade-off relation that quantifies the cost of achieving a pure state with a given error. The generalization to general quantum dynamics involving a system coupled to a finite bath implies that heat dissipation becomes infinite as the quantum system is exactly cooled down to the ground state or perfectly reset to a pure state, thereby resolving an open question regarding the thermodynamic cost of information erasure.</description>

      <title>Metastable Photo-Induced Superconductivity far above $T_{\textrm{c}}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.15355v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the striking discovery of metastable superconductivity in $\mathrm{K}_3\mathrm{C}_{60}$ at 100K, far above $T_{\textrm{c}}=20K$, we discuss possible mechanisms for long-lived, photo-induced superconductivity. Starting from a model of optically-driven Raman phonons coupled to inter-band electronic transitions, we develop a microscopic mechanism for photo-controlling the pairing interaction. Leveraging this mechanism, we first investigate long-lived superconductivity arising from the thermodynamic metastable trapping of the driven phonon. We then propose an alternative route, where the superconducting gap created by an optical drive leads to a dynamical bottleneck in the equilibration of quasi-particles. We conclude by discussing implications of both scenarios for experiments that can be used to discriminate between them. Our work provides falsifiable explanations for the nanosecond-scale photo-induced superconductivity found in $\mathrm{K}_3\mathrm{C}_{60}$, while simultaneously offering a theoretical basis for exploring metastable superconductivity in other quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Quantum Monte Carlo simulations in the restricted Hilbert space of Rydberg atom arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.00482v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rydberg atom arrays have emerged as a powerful platform to simulate a number of exotic quantum ground states and phase transitions. To verify these capabilities numerically, we develop a versatile quantum Monte Carlo sampling technique which operates in the reduced Hilbert space generated by enforcing the constraint of a Rydberg blockade. We use the framework of stochastic series expansion and show that in the restricted space, the configuration space of operator strings can be understood as a hard rod gas in $d+1$ dimensions. We use this mapping to develop cluster algorithms which can be visualized as various non-local movements of rods. We study the efficiency of each of our updates individually and collectively. To elucidate the utility of the algorithm, we show that it can efficiently generate the phase diagram of a Rydberg atom array, to temperatures much smaller than all energy scales involved, on a Kagom\'e link lattice. This is of broad interest as the presence of a $Z_2$ spin liquid has been hypothesized recently.</description>

      <title>Confinement and Kink Entanglement Asymmetry on a Quantum Ising Chain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08601v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the interplay of confinement, string breaking and entanglement asymmetry on a 1D quantum Ising chain. We consider the evolution of an initial domain wall and show that, surprisingly, while the introduction of confinement through a longitudinal field typically suppresses entanglement, it can also serve to increase it beyond a bound set for free particles. Our model can be tuned to conserve the number of domain walls, which gives an opportunity to explore entanglement asymmetry associated with link variables. We study two approaches to deal with the non-locality of the link variables, either directly or following a Kramers-Wannier transformation that maps bond variables (kinks) to site variables (spins). We develop a numerical procedure for computing the asymmetry using tensor network methods and use it to demonstrate the different types of entanglement and entanglement asymmetry.</description>

      <title>Exact results on finite size corrections for surface codes tailored to biased noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04008v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The code-capacity threshold of a scalable quantum error correcting stabilizer code can be expressed as a thermodynamic phase transition of a corresponding random-bond Ising model. Here we study the XY and XZZX surface codes under phase-biased noise, $p_x=p_y=p_z/(2\eta)$, with $\eta\geq 1/2$, and total error rate $p=p_x+p_y+p_z$. By appropriately formulating the boundary conditions, in the rotated code geometry, we find exact solutions at a special disordered point, $p=\frac{1+\eta^{-1}}{2+\eta^{-1}}\gtrsim 0.5$, for arbitrary odd code distance $d$, where the codes reduce to one-dimensional Ising models. The total logical failure rate is given by $P_{f}=\frac{3}{4}-\frac{1}{4}e^{-2d_Z\,\text{artanh}(1/2\eta)}$, where $d_{Z}=d^2$ and $d$ for the two codes respectively, is the effective code distance for pure phase-flip noise. As a consequence, for code distances $d\ll \eta$, and error rates near the threshold, the XZZX code is effectively equivalent to the phase-flip correcting repetition code over $d$ qubits. The large finite size corrections for $d_Z&lt;\eta$ also make threshold extractions, from numerical calculations at moderate code distances, unreliable. We show that calculating thresholds based not only on the total logical failure rate, but also independently on the phase- and bit-flip logical failure rates, gives a more confident estimate. Using this method for the XZZX code with a tensor-network based decoder and code distances up to $d\approx 100$, we find that the thresholds converge to a single value at moderate bias ($\eta=30, 100$), at an error rate above the hashing bound.</description>

      <title>Spectral Projections for Density Matrices in Quantum Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08031v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the spectral projection of density matrices in quantum field theory. With appropriate regularization, the spectral projectors of density matrices are expected to be well-defined. These projectors can be obtained using the Riesz projection formula, which allows us to compute both the density of eigenvalues and the expectation values of local operators in the projected states. We find that there are universal divergent terms in the expectation value of the stress energy tensor, where the coefficients depend universally on the density of eigenvalues and a function that describes the dependence of eigenvalues on boundary location. Using projection states, we can construct a series of new states in quantum field theories and discuss their general properties, focusing on the holographic aspects. We observe that quantum fluctuations are suppressed in the semiclassical limit. We also demonstrate that the fixed area state, previously constructed using gravitational path integrals, can be constructed by suitably superposition of appromiate amount of projection states. Additionally, we apply spectral projection to non-Hermitian operators, such as transition matrices, to obtain their eigenvalues and densities. Finally, we highlight potential applications of spectral projections, including the construction of new density and transition matrices and the understanding of superpositions of geometric states.</description>

      <title>Phase diagram of a spin-1/2 Heisenberg ladder with a chirality-chirality interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11731v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A spin-1/2 Heisenberg model with a chirality-chirality interaction (CCI) on a two-leg ladder offers a minimal setup to study an interplay between spin and chirality degrees of freedom. This model is potentially relevant to understanding the effects of a four-spin ring exchange and a phonon-mediated interaction on a ladder. By applying the Abelian bosonization and two types of spin-chirality duality, we derive a rich phase diagram of this model that includes previously unexplored cases of a ferromagnetic rung exchange $J_\perp&lt;0$ or a negative CCI $K_{\rm ch}&lt;0$. The phase diagram consists of the rung singlet (RS) phase, the Haldane phase, and three non-magnetic ordered phases. Furthermore, the RS and Haldane phases consist of several regions with different dominant correlations in terms of spin, dimer, or chirality. We perform numerical simulations to confirm the predicted phase structure and critical properties.</description>

      <title>Dualization of ingappabilities through Hilbert-space extensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01972v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Typical dualities in arbitrary dimensions are understood through a Hilbert-space extension method. By these results, we rigorously dualize the quantum ingappabilities to discrete height model in one dimension which is inaccessible by earlier work such as flux-insertion arguments. It turns out that the ingappabilities of quantum discrete height model is protected by an exotic "modulating" translation symmetry, which is a combination of modulating internal symmetry transformation and the conventional lattice translation. It can be also generalize to higher-form gauge fields in arbitrary dimensions, e.g., $\mathbb{Z}$-gauge theory in two dimensions with $\mathbb{Z}$ one-form symmetry and a modulating translation symmetry.</description>
