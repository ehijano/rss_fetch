      <title>Upper Comonotonicity and Risk Aggregation under Dependence Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study dependence uncertainty and the resulting effects on tail risk measures, which play a fundamental role in modern risk management. We introduce the notion of a regular dependence measure, defined on multi-marginal couplings, as a generalization of well-known correlation statistics such as the Pearson correlation. The first main result states that even an arbitrarily small positive dependence between losses can result in perfectly correlated tails beyond a certain threshold and seemingly complete independence before this threshold. In a second step, we focus on the aggregation of individual risks with known marginal distributions by means of arbitrary nondecreasing left-continuous aggregation functions. In this context, we show that under an arbitrarily small positive dependence, the tail risk of the aggregate loss might coincide with the one of perfectly correlated losses. A similar result is derived for expectiles under mild conditions. In a last step, we discuss our results in the context of credit risk, analyzing the potential effects on the value at risk for weighted sums of Bernoulli distributed losses.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking M6 Competitors: An Analysis of Financial Metrics and Discussion of Incentives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The M6 Competition assessed the performance of competitors using a ranked probability score and an information ratio (IR). While these metrics do well at picking the winners in the competition, crucial questions remain for investors with longer-term incentives. To address these questions, we compare the competitors' performance to a number of conventional (long-only) and alternative indices using standard industry metrics. We apply factor models to the competitors' returns and show the difficulty for any competitor to demonstrate a statistically significant value-add above industry-standard benchmarks within the short timeframe of the competition. We also uncover that most competitors generated lower risk-adjusted returns and lower maximum drawdowns than randomly selected portfolios, and that most competitors could not generate significant out-performance in raw returns. We further introduce two new strategies by picking the competitors with the best (Superstars) and worst (Superlosers) recent performance and show that it is challenging to identify skill amongst investment managers. Overall, our findings highlight the difference in incentives for competitors over professional investors, where the upside of winning the competition dwarfs the potential downside of not winning to maximize fees over an extended period of time.</description>

      <title>Forecasting and Backtesting Gradient Allocations of Expected Shortfall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11701v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Capital allocation is a procedure for quantifying the contribution of each source of risk to aggregated risk. The gradient allocation rule, also known as the Euler principle, is a prevalent rule of capital allocation under which the allocated capital captures the diversification benefit of the marginal risk as a component of overall risk. This research concentrates on Expected Shortfall (ES) as a regulatory standard and focuses on the gradient allocations of ES, also called ES contributions (ESCs). We present the comprehensive treatment of backtesting the tuple of ESCs in the framework of the traditional and comparative backtests based on the concepts of joint identifiability and multi-objective elicitability. For robust forecast evaluation against the choice of scoring function, we also extend the Murphy diagram, a graphical tool to check whether one forecast dominates another under a class of scoring functions, to the case of ESCs. Finally, leveraging the recent concept of multi-objective elicitability, we propose a novel semiparametric model for forecasting dynamic ESCs based on a compositional regression model. In an empirical analysis of stock returns we evaluate and compare a variety of models for forecasting dynamic ESCs and demonstrate the outstanding performance of the proposed model.</description>
