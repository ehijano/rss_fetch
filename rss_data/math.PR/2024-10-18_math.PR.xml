      <title>On the positivity of the density of stochastic delay differential equations driven by a fractional Brownian motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a Stochastic Delay Differential Equation with constant delay $r&gt;0$ and, under the same conditions on the coefficients needed to ensure the smoothness of the density plus an ellipticity condition on the diffusion term, we prove that the density function of the solution is strictly positive in its support. In order to prove it, we give a Gaussian-type lower bound for the density of the solution combining the Nourdin and Viens' density bounding method together with Kohatsu-Higa's method.</description>

      <title>Wright-Fisher kernels: scaling limits, non-linear extensions and related McKean-Vlasov diffusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a two-parameter family of Markov kernels on $[0,1]$ which, under appropriate scaling, are shown to converge in distribution to Wright-Fisher diffusions with drift; a large class of models with mutation and/or selection can be recovered by playing around with the scaling. Moment dualities are obtained at the discrete level for some combinations of parameters, giving rise to discrete-time line-counting processes. This unified derivation of some well-known population genetic processes allows one to extend the dynamics to the case where mutation and/or selection rates may depend on the instantaneous distribution of the process. In this setting, we prove both, the propagation of chaos for the associated particle system in the mean-field regime, and the convergence of the rescaled discrete-time non-linear Wright-Fisher conglomerate to McKean-Vlasov-type diffusions. To illustrate our results, we consider a population that is affected by mutation rates depending on the instantaneous distribution across multiple hosts. For this example, we study the uniform-in-time propagation of chaos and the ergodicity of the limiting McKean-Vlasov SDE.</description>

      <title>Scaling limits of random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work will appear as a chapter in a forthcoming volume titled "Topics in Probabilistic Graph Theory". A theory of scaling limits for random graphs has been developed in recent years. This theory gives access to the large-scale geometric structure of these random objects in the limit as their size goes to infinity, with distances appropriately rescaled. We start with the simplest setting of random trees, before turning to various examples of random graphs, including the critical Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi random graph.</description>

      <title>Driven by Brownian motion Cox-Ingersoll-Ross and squared Bessel processes: interaction and phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies two related stochastic processes driven by Brownian motion: the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) process and the Bessel process. We investigate their shared and distinct properties, focusing on time-asymptotic growth rates, distance between the processes in integral norms, and parameter estimation. The squared Bessel process is shown to be a phase transition of the CIR process and can be approximated by a sequence of CIR processes. Differences in stochastic stability are also highlighted, with the Bessel process displaying instability, while the CIR process remains ergodic and stable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we propose a tamed theta Euler-Maruyama (EM) scheme for superlinearly growing neutral McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential delay equations driven by fractional Brownian motion with Hurst exponent $H\in(1/2,1)$. The analytical properties including uniqueness and existence, boundedness of moment and propagation of chaos are investigated. Moreover, the convergence rate of the numerical scheme is established.</description>

      <title>Robustness in the Poisson Boolean model with convex grains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Poisson Boolean model where the grains are random convex bodies with a rotation-invariant distribution. We say that a grain distribution is dense if the union of the grains covers the entire space and robust if the union of the grains has an unbounded connected component irrespective of the intensity of the underlying Poisson process. If the grains are balls of random radius, then density and robustness are equivalent, but in general this is not the case. We show that in any dimension $d\ge2$ there are grain distributions that are robust but not dense, and give general criteria for density, robustness and non-robustness of a grain distribution. We give examples which show that our criteria are sharp in many instances.</description>

      <title>Strong regularization by noise for a class of kinetic SDEs driven by symmetric {\alpha}-stable processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish strong well-posedness for a class of degenerate SDEs of kinetic type with autonomous diffusion driven by a symmetric {\alpha}-stable process under H\"older regularity conditions for the drift term. We partially recover the thresholds for the H\"older regularity that are optimal for weak uniqueness. In general dimension, we only consider {\alpha} = 2 and need an additional integrability assumption for the gradient of the drift: this condition is satisfied by Peano-type functions. In the one-dimensional case we do not need any additional assumption. In the multi-dimensional case, the proof is based on a first-order Zvonkin transform/PDE, while for the one-dimensional case we use a second-order Zvonkin/PDE transform together with a Watanabe-Yamada technique.</description>

      <title>An It\^o-type formula for some measure-valued processes and its application on controlled superprocesses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive an It\^o-type formula for a measure-valued process that has a decomposition analogous to a classical semimartingale. The derivation begins with a time partitioning approach similar to the classical proof of It\^o's formula. To address the new challenges arising from the measure-valued setting, we employ symmetric polynomials to approximate the second-order linear derivative of the functional on finite measures, alongside certain localization techniques.
  A controlled superprocess with a binary branching mechanism can be interpreted as a weak solution to a controlled stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE), which naturally leads to such a decomposition. Consequently, this It\^o-type formula makes it possible to derive the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation and the verification theorem for controlled superprocesses with a binary branching mechanism. Additionally, we propose a heuristic definition for the viscosity solution of an equation involving derivatives on finite measures. We prove that a continuous value function is a viscosity solution in this sense and demonstrate the uniqueness of the viscosity solution when the second-order derivative term on the measure vanishes.</description>

      <title>Wetting Transition on Trees I: Percolation With Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new ``Percolation with Clustering'' (PWC) model is introduced, where (the probabilities of) site percolation configurations on the leaf set of a binary tree are rewarded exponentially according to a generic function, which measures the degree of clustering in the configuration. Conditions on such ``clustering function'' are given for the existence of a limiting free energy and a wetting transition, namely the existence of a non-trivial percolation parameter threshold above and only above which the set of ``dry'' (open) sites have an asymptotic density. Several examples of clustering functions are given and studied using the general theory. The results here will be used in a sequel paper to study the wetting transition for the discrete Gaussian free field on the tree subject to a hard wall constraint.</description>

      <title>Construction of distorted Brownian motion with permeable sticky behaviour on sets with Lebesgue measure zero</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The starting point is a gradient Dirichlet form with respect to $\varrho\lambda^d$ on $L^2({\mathbb{R}}^d, \varrho\mu)$. Here $\lambda^d$ is the Lebesgue measure on ${\mathbb R}^d$, $\varrho$ a strictly positive density and $\mu$ puts weight on a set $A\subset {\mathbb R}^d$ with Lebesgue measure zero. We show that the Dirichlet form admits an associated stochastic process $X$.
  We derive an explicit representation of the corresponding generator if $A$ is a Lipschitz boundary. This representation together with the Fukushima decomposition identifies $X$ as a distorted Brownian motion with drift given by the logarithmic derivative of $\varrho$ in ${\mathbb R}^d \setminus A$. Furthermore, we prove $X$ to be irreducible and recurrent. Finally, via ergodicity we prove positive s\'ejour time of $X$ on $A$. Hence we obtain a stochastic process $X$ with permeable sticky behaviour on $A$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider random walks on $\mathbb{Z}^8$ indexed by the infinite invariant tree, which consists of an infinite spine and finite random trees attached to it on both sides. We establish the precise order of the non-intersection probability between one walk indexed by one side of the tree, and an independent one indexed by both sides of an independent tree. This is analogous to the result by Lawler from the '90s for two independent simple random walks on $\mathbb{Z}^4$. We also prove a weak law of large numbers for the branching capacity of the range of a branching random walk.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Originally motivated by the morphogenesis of bacterial microcolonies, the aim of this article is to explore models through different scales for a spatial population of interacting, growing and dividing particles. We start from a microscopic stochastic model, write the corresponding stochastic differential equation satisfied by the empirical measure, and rigorously derive its mesoscopic (mean-field) limit. Under smoothness and symmetry assumptions for the interaction kernel, we then obtain entropy estimates, which provide us with a localization limit at the macroscopic level. Finally, we perform a thorough numerical study in order to compare the three modeling scales.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Models of random phylogenetic networks have been used since the inception of the field, but the introduction and rigorous study of mathematically tractable models is a much more recent topic that has gained momentum in the last 5~years. This manuscript discusses some recent developments in the field through a selection of examples. The emphasis is on the techniques rather than on the results themselves, and on probabilistic tools rather than on combinatorial ones.</description>

      <title>Fluctuations of Schensted row insertion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.03762v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate asymptotic probabilistic phenomena arising from the application of the Schensted row insertion algorithm, a key component of the Robinson-Schensted-Knuth (RSK) correspondence, to random inputs. Our analysis centers on a random tableau $T$ with a given shape $\lambda$, which may itself be random or deterministic. We examine the stochastic properties of the position of the new box created when inserting a deterministic entry into $T$. Specifically, we focus on the fluctuations of this position around its expected value as the size of the Young diagram $\lambda$ approaches infinity. Our findings reveal that these fluctuations are asymptotically Gaussian, with the mean and variance expressed in terms of Kerov's transition measure of the diagram $\lambda$. An important application of this analysis is the RSK algorithm applied to a finite, long sequence of independent, identically distributed random variables. While there remains a gap in the reasoning for this case, we present an explicit conjecture regarding its behavior.</description>

      <title>Cluster-size decay in supercritical kernel-based spatial random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.00724v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a large class of spatially-embedded random graphs that includes among others long-range percolation, continuum scale-free percolation and the age-dependent random connection model. We assume that the model is supercritical: there is an infinite component. We identify the stretch-exponent $\zeta\in(0,1)$ of the decay of the cluster-size distribution. That is, with $|\mathcal{C}(0)|$ denoting the number of vertices in the component of the vertex at $0\in \mathbb{R}^d$, we prove \[
  \mathbb{P}(k&lt; |\mathcal{C}(0)|&lt;\infty)=\exp\big(-\Theta(k^{\zeta})\big), \qquad \text{as }k\to\infty.
  \] The value of $\zeta$ undergoes several phase transitions with respect to three main model parameters: the Euclidean dimension $d$, the power-law tail exponent $\tau$ of the degree distribution and a long-range parameter $\alpha$ governing the presence of long edges in Euclidean space. In this paper we present the proof for the region in the phase diagram where the model is a generalization of continuum scale-free percolation and/or hyperbolic random graphs: $\zeta$ in this regime depends both on $\tau,\alpha$. We also prove that the second-largest component in a box of volume $n$ is of size $\Theta((\log n)^{1/\zeta})$ with high probability. We develop a deterministic algorithm, the cover expansion, as new methodology. This algorithm enables us to prevent too large components that may be de-localized or locally dense in space.</description>

Abstract: Let $h$ be a log-correlated Gaussian field on $\R^d$, let $\gamma \in (0,\sqrt{2d}),$ let $\mu_h$ be the $\gamma$-Gaussian multiplicative chaos measure, and let $D_h$ be an exponential metric associated with $h$ satisfying certain natural axioms. In the special case when $d=2$, this corresponds to the Liouville quantum gravity (LQG) measure and metric. We show that the closed support of the law of $(D_h,\mu_h)$ includes all length metrics and probability measures on $\R^d$. That is, if $\mathfrak d$ is any length metric on $\R^d$ and $\mathfrak m$ is any probability measure on $\R^d$, then with positive probability $(D_h , \mu_h)$ is close to $(\mathfrak d , \mathfrak m)$ with respect to the uniform distance and the Prokhorov distance. Key ingredients include a scaling limit theorem for a first passage percolation type model associated with $h$, a special version of the white noise decomposition of $h$ in arbitrary dimension, and an approximation property by conformally flat Riemannian metrics in the uniform sense. Our results provide a robust tool to show that the LQG measure and metric, and its higher dimensional analogs, satisfy certain properties with positive probability.</description>

      <title>Scaling limits of planar maps under the Smith embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.02988v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Smith embedding of a finite planar map with two marked vertices, possibly with conductances on the edges, is a way of representing the map as a tiling of a finite cylinder by rectangles. In this embedding, each edge of the planar map corresponds to a rectangle, and each vertex corresponds to a horizontal segment. Given a sequence of finite planar maps embedded in an infinite cylinder, such that the random walk on both the map and its planar dual converges to Brownian motion modulo time change, we prove that the a priori embedding is close to an affine transformation of the Smith embedding at large scales. By applying this result, we prove that the Smith embeddings of mated-CRT maps with the sphere topology converge to $\gamma$-Liouville quantum gravity ($\gamma$-LQG).</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Optimality of the Speed-Aware Join-the-Shortest-Queue in the Halfin-Whitt Regime for Heterogeneous Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10497v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Join-the-Shortest-Queue (JSQ) load balancing scheme is known to minimise the average response time of jobs in homogeneous systems with identical servers. However, for {\em heterogeneous} systems with servers having different processing speeds, finding an optimal load balancing scheme remains an open problem for finite system sizes. Recently, for systems with heterogeneous servers, a variant of JSQ called the {\em Speed-Aware-Join-the-Shortest-Queue (SA-JSQ)} scheme has been shown to achieve asymptotic optimality as the number of servers $n$ tends to infinity and the arrival rate in the system normalised by the number of servers remains constant. Motivated by this result, in this paper, we investigate the performance of the SA-JSQ scheme for heterogeneous systems in the {\em Halfin-Whitt} traffic regime. Our analysis begins by establishing that appropriately scaled and centered version of the Markov process describing system dynamics weakly converges to a two-dimensional reflected {\em Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process}. We then show using {\em Stein's method} that the stationary distribution of the underlying Markov process converges to that of the OU process as the system size increases by establishing the validity of interchange of limits. Finally, through coupling with a suitably constructed system, we show that SA-JSQ asymptotically minimises the diffusion-scaled total number of jobs and the diffusion-scaled number of waiting jobs in the steady-state in the Halfin-Whitt regime among all policies which dispatch jobs based on queue lengths and server speeds.</description>

      <title>Steady-State Convergence of the Continuous-Time Routing System with General Distributions in Heavy Traffic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10876v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper examines a continuous-time routing system with general interarrival and service time distributions, operating under the join-the-shortest-queue and power-of-two-choices policies. Under a weaker set of assumptions than those commonly found in the literature, we prove that the scaled steady-state queue length at each station converges weakly to an identical exponential random variable in heavy traffic. Specifically, our results hold under the assumption of the $(2 + \delta_0)$th moment for the interarrival and service distributions with some $\delta_0 &gt; 0$. The proof leverages the Palm version of the basic adjoint relationship (BAR) as a key technique.</description>

      <title>Largest eigenvalue of positive mean Gaussian matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05858v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This short note studies the fluctuations of the largest eigenvalue of symmetric random matrices with correlated Gaussian entries having positive mean. Under the assumption that the covariance kernel is absolutely summable, it is proved that the largest eigenvalue, after centering, converges in distribution to normal with an explicitly defined mean and variance. This result generalizes known findings for Wigner matrices with independent entries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10513v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive the KPZ equation as a continuum limit of height functions in asymmetric simple exclusion processes with a hyperbolic-scale drift that depends on the local particle configuration. To our knowledge, it is a first such result for a general class of particle systems with neither duality nor explicit invariant measures. The new tools to handle the lack of an invariant measure are estimates for Kolmogorov equations that produce a more robust proof of the Kipnis-Varadhan inequality. These tools are not exclusive to KPZ.</description>

      <title>Equivalence of fluctuations of discretized SHE and KPZ equations in the subcritical weak disorder regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06801v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the fluctuations of discretized versions of the stochastic heat equation (SHE) and the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation in spatial dimensions $d&gt;2$ in the weak disorder regime. The discretization is defined using the directed polymer model. Previous research has identified the scaling limit of both equations under a suboptimal moment condition and, in particular, it was established that both converge to the same limit in law. We extend this result by showing that the fluctuations of both equations are close in probability in the subcritical weak disorder regime, indicating that they share the same scaling limit (the existence of which remains open). Our result applies under a moment condition that is expected to be valid throughout the interior of the weak disorder phase, which is currently only known under a technical assumption on the environment. We also prove a lower tail concentration of the partition functions.</description>

      <title>On the Impact of Approximation Errors on Extreme Quantile Estimation with Applications to Functional Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.03581v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the effect of approximation errors in assessing the extreme behavior of heavy-tailed random objects. We give conditions for the approximation error such that the standard asymptotic results hold for the classical Hill estimator and the corresponding extreme quantile estimator. As an application, we consider the effect of discretization errors in the computation of the $L^p$-norms related to functional data. We approximate the norms both with Riemann sums and with Monte Carlo integration. We quantify connections between the number of observed functions, the number of discretization points, and the regularity of the underlying functions. In addition, we derive a new concentration inequality for order statistics. This, to the best of our knowledge, is the first Chernoff-type concentration inequality for order statistics presented in the literature that provides an explicit rate at which the ratio between order statistics and tail quantile function converges to one. In our application, the bound is used to provide concentration inequalities measuring the distance between the Hill estimator based on approximated norms and the one based on the true ones.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05094v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the existence of weak solutions of a class of multi-species cross-diffusion systems as well as the propagation of chaos result by means of nonlocal approximation of the nonlinear diffusion terms, coupling methods and compactness arguments. We also prove the uniqueness under further structural assumption on the mobilities by combining the uniqueness argument for viscous porous medium equations and linear Fokker-Planck equations. We show that these equations capture the macroscopic behavior of stochastic interacting particle systems if the localisation parameter is chosen logarithmically with respect to the number of particles.</description>

      <title>A pure dual approach for hedging Bermudan options</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18761v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a new dual approach to compute the hedging portfolio of a Bermudan option and its initial value. It gives a "purely dual" algorithm following the spirit of Rogers (2010) in the sense that it only relies on the dual pricing formula. The key is to rewrite the dual formula as an excess reward representation and to combine it with a strict convexification technique. The hedging strategy is then obtained by using a Monte Carlo method, solving backward a sequence of least square problems. We show convergence results for our algorithm and test it on many different Bermudan options. Beyond giving directly the hedging portfolio, the strength of the algorithm is to assess both the relevance of including financial instruments in the hedging portfolio and the effect of the rebalancing frequency.</description>

      <title>Achieving Exponential Asymptotic Optimality in Average-Reward Restless Bandits without Global Attractor Assumption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17882v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the infinite-horizon average-reward restless bandit problem. We propose a novel \emph{two-set policy} that maintains two dynamic subsets of arms: one subset of arms has a nearly optimal state distribution and takes actions according to an Optimal Local Control routine; the other subset of arms is driven towards the optimal state distribution and gradually merged into the first subset. We show that our two-set policy is asymptotically optimal with an $O(\exp(-C N))$ optimality gap for an $N$-armed problem, under the mild assumptions of aperiodic-unichain, non-degeneracy, and local stability. Our policy is the first to achieve \emph{exponential asymptotic optimality} under the above set of easy-to-verify assumptions, whereas prior work either requires a strong \emph{global attractor} assumption or only achieves an $O(1/\sqrt{N})$ optimality gap. We further discuss obstacles in weakening the assumptions by demonstrating examples where exponential asymptotic optimality is not achievable when any of the three assumptions is violated. Notably, we prove a lower bound for a large class of locally unstable restless bandits, showing that local stability is particularly fundamental for exponential asymptotic optimality. Finally, we use simulations to demonstrate that the two-set policy outperforms previous policies on certain RB problems and performs competitively overall.</description>

      <title>Additivity of quantum capacities in simple non-degradable quantum channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03927v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum channel capacities give the fundamental performance limits for information flow over a communication channel. However, the prevalence of superadditivity is a major obstacle to understanding capacities, both quantitatively and conceptually. Examples of additivity, while rare, provide key insight into the origins of nonadditivity and enable our best upper bounds on capacities. Degradable channels, which have additive coherent information, are some of the only channels for which we can calculate the quantum capacity. In this paper we construct non-degradable quantum channels that nevertheless have additive coherent information and therefore easily calculated quantum capacity. The first class of examples is constructed by generalizing the Platypus channel, as introduced by Leditzky et al., which demonstrates interesting properties of additivity and non-additivity. The second class of examples, whose additivity follows from a conjectured reverse-type data processing inequality, is based on probabilistic mixture of degradable and anti-degradable channels. As a byproduct, we provide some possible examples of quantum channels with zero quantum capacity, which are neither anti-degradable nor PPT.</description>

      <title>A Data-driven Contact Estimation Method for Wheeled-Biped Robots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12345v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Contact estimation is a key ability for limbed robots, where making and breaking contacts has a direct impact on state estimation and balance control. Existing approaches typically rely on gate-cycle priors or designated contact sensors. We design a contact estimator that is suitable for the emerging wheeled-biped robot types that do not have these features. To this end, we propose a Bayes filter in which update steps are learned from real-robot torque measurements while prediction steps rely on inertial measurements. We evaluate this approach in extensive real-robot and simulation experiments. Our method achieves better performance while being considerably more sample efficient than a comparable deep-learning baseline.</description>
