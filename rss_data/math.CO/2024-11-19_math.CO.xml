      <title>The prime grid contains arbitrarily large empty polygons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proves a 2017 conjecture of De Loera, La Haye, Oliveros, and Rold\'an-Pensado that the "prime grid" $\big\{(p,q) \in \mathbb{Z}^2 : \text{$p$ and $q$ are prime}\big\} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2$ contains empty polygons with arbitrarily many vertices. This implies that no Helly-type theorem is true for the prime grid.</description>

      <title>A characterization of unimodular hypergraphs with disjoint hyperedges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grossman et al. show that the subdeterminants of the incidence matrix of a graph can be characterized using the graph's odd cycle packing number. In particular, a graph's incidence matrix is totally unimodular if and only if the graph is bipartite. We extend the characterization of total unimodularity to disjoint hypergraphs, i.e., hypergraphs whose hyperedges of size at least four are pairwise disjoint. Disjoint hypergraphs interpolate between graphs and hypergraphs, which correspond to arbitrary {0,1}-matrices. We prove that total unimodularity for disjoint hypergraphs is equivalent to forbidding both odd cycles and a structure we call an ''odd tree house''. Our result extends to disjoint directed hypergraphs, i.e., those whose incidence matrices allow for {-1,0, 1}-entries. As a corollary, we resolve a conjecture on almost totally unimodular matrices, formulated by Padberg (1988) and Cornu\'ejols &amp; Zuluaga (2000), in the special case where columns with at least four non-zero elements have pairwise disjoint supports.</description>

      <title>Finding Permutiples of a Known Base and Multiplier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Natural numbers which are nontrivial multiples of some permutation of their base-$b$ digit representations are called permutiples. Specific cases include numbers which are multiples of cyclic permutations (cyclic numbers) and reversals of their digits (palintiples). Previous efforts have produced methods which construct new examples of permutiples with the same set of digits as a known example. Using simple graph-theoretical and finite-state machine constructions, we advance previous work by describing two methods for finding permutiples of a known base and multiplier with no need for known examples or prior knowledge of digits.</description>

      <title>Zero-one dual characters of flagged Weyl modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a criterion of when the dual character $\chi_{D}(x)$ of the flagged Weyl module associated to a diagram $D$ in the grid $[n]\times [n]$ is zero-one, that is, the coefficients of monomials in $\chi_{D}(x)$ are either 0 or 1. This settles a conjecture proposed by M{\'e}sz{\'a}ros--St. Dizier--Tanjaya. Since Schubert polynomials and key polynomials occur as special cases of dual flagged Weyl characters, our approach provides a new and unified proof of known criteria for zero-one Schubert/key polynomials due to Fink--M{\'e}sz{\'a}ros--St. Dizier and Hodges--Yong, respectively.</description>

      <title>Bounding the Chromatic Number via High Dimensional Embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a necessary and sufficient condition for determining whether a hypergraph can be embedded in a high-dimensional space, and establish an upper bound for the chromatic number of such hypergraph, which can be viewed as the high-dimensional extension of the Heawood conjecture and Wagner's Theorem, respectively. Based on them, for a graph of order $n$, there exists accordingly an algorithm with a complexity of $O(n\log^2 n)$ that can determine the upper bound for the chromatic number. Specifically, we prove: (i) The graph-closure of a $d$-uniform-topological hypergraph is a closed-$R^d$-graph if and only if its minors include neither $K_{d+3}^d$ nor $K_{3,d+1}^d$; (ii) Let $G$ be a special triangulated $R^d$-graph, $G^v$ be the vertex-hypergraph of $G$, then $G^v$ is $3\cdot 2^{d-1}$-choosable.</description>

      <title>Max-Bisections of graphs without perfect matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A bisection of a graph is a bipartition of its vertex set such that the two resulting parts differ in size by at most 1, and its size is the number of edges that connect vertices in the two parts. The perfect matching condition and forbidden even cycles subgraphs are essential in finding large bisections of graphs. In this paper, we show that the perfect matching condition can be replaced by the minimum degree condition. Let $C_{\ell}$ be a cycle of length $\ell$ for $\ell\ge 3$, and let $G$ be a $\{C_4, C_6\}$-free graph with $m$ edges and minimum degree at least 2. We prove that $G$ has a bisection of size at least $m/2+\Omega\left(\sum_{v\in V(G)}\sqrt{d(v)}\right)$. As a corollary, if $G$ is also $C_{2k}$-free for $k\ge3$, then $G$ has a bisection of size at least $m / 2+\Omega\left(m^{(2 k+1) /(2 k+2)}\right)$, thereby confirming a conjecture proposed by Lin and Zeng [J. Comb. Theory A, 180 (2021), 105404].</description>

      <title>Equivalent spectral theory for fundamental graph cut problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and develop equivalent spectral graph theory for several fundamental graph cut problems including maxcut, mincut, Cheeger cut, anti-Cheeger cut, dual Cheeger problem and their useful variants. The finer structure of the eigenvectors, the Courant nodal domain theorem and the graphic feature of eigenvalues are studied systematically in the setting of these new nonlinear eigenproblems. A specified strategy for achieving an equivalent eigenproblem is proposed for a general graph cut problem via the Dinkelbach scheme. We also establish several multi-way inequalities relating the variational eigenvalues and min-max $k$-cut problems, which closely resembles the higher-order Cheeger inequality on graph 1-Laplacian.</description>

      <title>Strong parity edge-colorings of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An edge-coloring of a graph $G$ assigns a color to each edge of $G$. An edge-coloring is a parity edge-coloring if for each path $P$ in $G$, it uses some color on an odd number of edges in $P$. It is a strong parity edge-coloring if for every open walk $W$ in $G$, it uses some color an odd number of times along $W$. The minimum numbers of colors in parity and strong parity edge-colorings of $G$ are denoted $p(G)$ and $\hat{p}(G)$, respectively.
  We characterize strong parity edge-colorings and use this characterization to prove lower bounds on $\hat{p}(G)$ and answer several questions of Bunde, Milans, West, and Wu. The applications are as follows. (1) We prove the conjecture that $\hat{p}(K_{s,t})=s \circ t$, where $s \circ t$ is the Hopf-Stiefel function. (2) We show that $\hat{p}(G)$ for a connected $n$-vertex graph $G$ equals the known lower bound $\lceil \log_2 n \rceil$ if and only if $G$ is a subgraph of the hypercube $Q_{\lceil \log_2 n \rceil }$. (3) We asymptotically compute $\hat{p}(G)$ when $G$ is the $\ell$th distance-power of a path, proving $\hat{p}(P_n^\ell)\sim\ell \lceil {\log_2 n} \rceil$. (4) We disprove the conjecture that $\hat{p}(G)=p(G)$ when $G$ is bipartite by constructing bipartite graphs $G$ such that $\hat{p}(G)/p(G)$ is arbitrarily large; in particular, with $\hat{p}(G)\ge\frac{1-o(1)}3 k\ln k$ and $p(G)\le2k+k^{1/3}$.</description>

      <title>Two-count interval representation of a permutation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interval count problem, a classical question in the study of interval orders, was introduced by Ronald Graham in the 1980s. This problem asks: given an interval order $P$, what is the minimum number of distinct interval lengths required to construct an interval representation of $P$? Interval orders that can be represented with just one interval length are known as semiorders, and their characterizations are well known. However, the characterization of interval orders that require at most $k$ interval lengths -- termed $k$-count interval orders -- remains an open and challenging problem for $k\geq 2$.
  Our investigation into $2$-count interval orders led us naturally to consider a related problem, interval representations of permutations, which we introduce in this paper. Specifically, we characterize permutations that have a $2$-count interval representation. We prove that a permutation admits a $2$-count interval representation if and only if its longest decreasing subsequences have length at most $2$. For larger values of $k$, however, a similar characterization does not hold. There are permutations that do not permit a $3$-count interval representation despite having decreasing subsequences of length at most $3$. Characterizing $k$-count permutations remains open for $k \geq 3$.
  The $k$-count permutation representation problem appears to capture essential aspects of the broader problem of characterizing $k$-count interval orders. To support this connection, we apply our findings on interval representations of permutations to demonstrate that a height-$3$ interval order is $2$-count if and only if it has depth at most $2$, where the depth of an interval order refers to the length of the longest nested chain of intervals required in any interval representation of the order.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a sharp upper bound on the number of boundary lattice points of a rational polygon in terms of its denominator and the number of interior lattice points, generalizing Scott's inequality. We then give sharp lower and upper bounds on the area in terms of the denominator, the number of interior lattice points, and the number of boundary lattice points, which can be seen as a generalization of Pick's formula. Minimizers and maximizers are described in detail. As an application, we derive bounds for the coefficients of Ehrhart quasipolymials of half-integral polygons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We recall the lower-upper varieties from [Knutson '05] and give a formula for their equivariant cohomology classes, as a sum over generic pipe dreams. We recover as limits the classic and bumpless pipe dream formulae for double Schubert polynomials. As a byproduct, we obtain a formula for the degree of the $n$th commuting variety as a sum of powers of 2. Generic pipe dreams also appear in the Segre-Schwarz-MacPherson analogue of the AJS/Billey formula, and when computing the Chern-Schwarz-MacPherson class of the orbit $B_- w B_+ \subseteq Mat_{k\times n}$ or of a double Bruhat cell $B_-u B_+ \cap B_+ v B_-$.</description>

      <title>Murnaghan--Nakayama rules for symplectic, orthogonal and orthosymplectic Schur functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish new Murnaghan--Nakayama rules for symplectic, orthogonal and orthosymplectic Schur functions. The classical Murnaghan--Nakayama rule expresses the product of a power sum symmetric function with a Schur function as a linear combination of Schur functions. Symplectic and orthogonal Schur functions correspond to characters of irreducible representations of symplectic and orthogonal groups. Orthosymplectic Schur functions arise as characters of orthosymplectic Lie superalgebras and are hybrids of symplectic and ordinary Schur functions. We derive explicit formulas for the product of the relevant power-sum function with each of these functions, which can partly be described combinatorially using border strip manipulations. Our Murnaghan--Nakayama rules each include three distinct terms: a classical term corresponding to the addition of border strips to the relevant Young diagram, a term involving the removal of border strips, and a third term, which we describe both algebraically and combinatorially.</description>

      <title>Longest subsequence for certain repeated up/down patterns in random permutations avoiding a pattern of length three</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $S_n$ denote the set of permutations of $[n]$ and let $\sigma=\sigma_1\cdots\sigma_n\in S_n$. For a subsequence $\{\sigma_{i_j}\}_{j=1}^k$ of $\{\sigma_i\}_{i=1}^n$ of length $k\ge2$, construct
  the ``up/down'' sequence $V_1\cdots V_{k-1}$ defined by $$ V_j=\begin{cases} U,\ \text{if}\ \sigma_{i_j+1}-\sigma_{i_j}&gt;0;\\ D,\ \text{if}\ \sigma_{i_j+1}-\sigma_{i_j}&lt;0.\end{cases} $$ Consider now a fixed up/down pattern: $V_1\cdots V_l$, where $l\in\mathbb{N}$ and $V_j\in\{U, D\},\ j\in[l]$. Given a permutation $\sigma\in S_n$, consider the length of the longest subsequence of $\sigma$ that repeats this pattern.
  For example, consider $l=3$ and $V_1V_2V_3=UUD$. Then for the permutation $342617985\in S_9$, the length of the longest subsequence that repeats the pattern $UUD$ is 7; it is obtained by 3461798 and 3461785.
  The above framework includes two well-known cases. The pattern $U$ is the celebrated case of the longest increasing subsequence. The pattern $UD$ (or $DU$) is the case of the longest alternating subsequence. These have been studied both under the uniform distribution on $S_n$ as well as under the uniform distribution on those permutations in $S_n$ which avoid a particular pattern of length three.
  In this paper, we consider the patterns $UUD$ and $UUUD$ under the uniform distribution on those permutations in $S_n$ which avoid the pattern $132$. We prove that the expected value of the longest increasing subsequence following the pattern $UUD$ is asymptotic to $\frac37n$ and the expected value of the longest increasing subsequence following the pattern $UUUD$ is asymptotic to $\frac4{11}n$. (For $UD$ (alternating subsequences) it is known to be $\frac12n$.) This leads directly to appropriate corresponding results for permutations avoiding any particular pattern of length three.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the principal minors of the distance matrix of a tree satisfy a combinatorial expression involving counts of rooted spanning forests of the underlying tree. This generalizes a result of Graham and Pollak. We also give such an expression for the case of trees with edge lengths. We use arguments motivated by potential theory on graphs. Our formulas can be expressed in terms of evaluations of Symanzik polynomials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a universal weight system (a function on chord diagrams satisfying the $4$-term relation) taking values in the ring of polynomials in infinitely many variables whose particular specializations are weight systems associated with the Lie algebras $\mathfrak{so}(N)$, $\mathfrak{sp}(2M)$, as well as Lie superalgebras $\mathfrak{osp}(N|2M)$. We extend this weight system to permutations and provide an efficient recursion for its computation.
  The construction for this weight system extends a similar construction for the universal polynomial weight system responsible for the Lie algebras $\mathfrak{gl}(N)$ and superalgebras $\mathfrak{gl}(N|M)$ introduced earlier by the second named author.</description>

      <title>Maxima of the $Q$-index of 2 leaves-free graphs with given size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $Q$-index of graph $G$ is the largest eigenvalue of the signless Laplacian matrix of $G$. Wang [Discrete Appl. Math. 356(2024)] proved the sharp upper bounds on the $Q$-index of leaf-free graphs with given size and characterized the corresponding extremal graphs. A graph is $2$ leaves-free if it has no two pendent vertices. In this paper, we give sharp upper bounds on the $Q$-index of 2 leaves-free graphs with given size and characterize the corresponding extremal graphs.</description>

      <title>Explicit Two-Sided Vertex Expanders Beyond the Spectral Barrier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct the first explicit two-sided vertex expanders that bypass the spectral barrier.
  Previously, the strongest known explicit vertex expanders were given by $d$-regular Ramanujan graphs, whose spectral properties imply that every small subset of vertices $S$ has at least $0.5d|S|$ distinct neighbors. However, it is possible to construct Ramanujan graphs containing a small set $S$ with no more than $0.5d|S|$ neighbors. In fact, no explicit construction was known to break the $0.5 d$-barrier.
  In this work, we give an explicit construction of an infinite family of $d$-regular graphs (for large enough $d$) where every small set expands by a factor of $\approx 0.6d$. More generally, for large enough $d_1,d_2$, we give an infinite family of $(d_1,d_2)$-biregular graphs where small sets on the left expand by a factor of $\approx 0.6d_1$, and small sets on the right expand by a factor of $\approx 0.6d_2$. In fact, our construction satisfies an even stronger property: small sets on the left and right have unique-neighbor expansion $0.6d_1$ and $0.6d_2$ respectively.
  Our construction follows the tripartite line product framework of Hsieh, McKenzie, Mohanty &amp; Paredes, and instantiates it using the face-vertex incidence of the $4$-dimensional Ramanujan clique complex as its base component. As a key part of our analysis, we derive new bounds on the triangle density of small sets in the Ramanujan clique complex.</description>

      <title>Bounds on the realizations of zero-nonzero patterns and sign conditions of polynomials restricted to varieties and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove upper bounds which are independent of the dimension of the ambient space, on the number of realizable zero-nonzero patterns as well as sign conditions (when the field of coefficients is ordered) of a finite set of polynomials $\mathcal{P}$ restricted to some algebraic subset $V$.Our bounds (which are tight) depend on the number and the degrees of the polynomials in $\mathcal{P}$, as well as the degree (of the embedding) of $V$ and the dimension of $V$, but are independent of the dimension of the space in which $V$ is embedded. This last feature of our bounds is useful in situations where the ambient dimension could be much larger than $\dim V$.
  We give several applications of our results. We generalize existing results on bounding the speeds of algebraically defined classes of graphs, as well as lower bounds in terms of the number of connected components for testing membership in semi-algebraic sets using algebraic computation trees. Motivated by quantum complexity theory we introduce a notion of relative rank (additive as well as multiplicative) in finite dimensional vector spaces and algebras relative to a fixed algebraic subset in the vector space or algebra -- which generalizes the classical definition of ranks of tensors. We prove a very general lower bound on the maximum relative rank of finite subsets relative to algebraic subsets of bounded degree and dimension which is independent of the dimension of the vector space or algebra. We show how our lower bound implies a quantum analog of a classical lower bound result of Shannon for Boolean circuits -- that almost all Boolean functions require (classical) circuits of size at least $\Omega(2^n/n)$.</description>

      <title>Regular subgraphs at every density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1975, Erd\H{o}s and Sauer asked to estimate, for any constant $r$, the maximum number of edges an $n$-vertex graph can have without containing an $r$-regular subgraph. In a recent breakthrough, Janzer and Sudakov proved that any $n$-vertex graph with no $r$-regular subgraph has at most $C_r n \log \log n$ edges, matching an earlier lower bound by Pyber, R\"odl and Szemer\'edi and thereby resolving the Erd\H{o}s-Sauer problem up to a constant depending on $r$. We prove that every $n$-vertex graph without an $r$-regular subgraph has at most $Cr^2 n \log \log n$ edges. This bound is tight up to the value of $C$ for $n\geq n_0(r)$ and hence resolves the Erd\H{o}s-Sauer problem up to an absolute constant.
  Moreover, we obtain similarly tight results for the whole range of possible values of $r$ (i.e., not just when $r$ is a constant), apart from a small error term at a transition point near $r\approx \log n$, where, perhaps surprisingly, the answer changes. More specifically, we show that every $n$-vertex graph with average degree at least $\min(Cr\log(n/r),Cr^2 \log\log n)$ contains an $r$-regular subgraph. The bound $Cr\log(n/r)$ is tight for $r\geq \log n$, while the bound $Cr^2 \log \log n$ is tight for $r&lt;(\log n)^{1-\Omega(1)}$. These results resolve a problem of R\"odl and Wysocka from 1997 for almost all values of $r$.
  Among other tools, we develop a novel random process that efficiently finds a very nearly regular subgraph in any almost-regular graph. A key step in our proof uses this novel random process to show that every $K$-almost-regular graph with average degree $d$ contains an $r$-regular subgraph for some $r=\Omega_K(d)$, which is of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Induced subgraphs and tree decompositions XVII. Anticomplete sets of large treewidth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two sets $X, Y$ of vertices in a graph $G$ are "anticomplete" if $X\cap Y=\varnothing$ and there is no edge in $G$ with an end in $X$ and an end in $Y$. We prove that every graph $G$ of sufficiently large treewidth contains two anticomplete sets of vertices each inducing a subgraph of large treewidth unless $G$ contains, as an induced subgraph, a highly structured graph of large treewidth that is an obvious counterexample to this statement. These are: complete graphs, complete bipartite graphs and "interrupted $s$-constellations." The latter is a slightly adjusted version of a well-known construction by Bonamy et al.</description>

      <title>Forbidden Subgraphs of co-prime Graphs of finite Groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.10422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a finite group $G$ the co-prime graph $\Gamma(G)$ is defined as a graph with vertex set $G$ in which two distinct vertices $x$ and $y$ are adjacent if and only if $gcd(o(x),o(y))=1$ where $o(x)$ and $o(y)$ denote the orders of the elements $x$ and $y$ respectively. In this paper we find properties of groups whose co-prime graphs forbid graphs such as $C_4,K_{1,3},P_4$ and asteroidal triples.</description>

      <title>Strategies in a mis\`ere two-player guessing game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyse an extension of the children's higher-or-lower number guessing game with two guessing players, where players alternate guessing a secret integer between 1 and n, and it is revealed whether these guesses are higher or lower than the secret number, with the first player to guess the number being the loser. We describe and prove the solution when both players are rational, which involves different guessing strategies dependent on the value of n modulo 4. We then consider the case where one player is not rational but instead makes all their guesses uniformly at random, while the other player plays to exploit this. We show that, in this case, the probability that the exploitative player wins approaches a constant (approximately 0.599) as n increases, and that the numbers 2 and n-1 are always optimal guesses for them.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a tropical cycle $X$, one can talk about a notion of tropical vector bundles on $X$ having real or tropical fibers. By restricting our attention to bounded rational sections of these bundles, one can develop a good notion of characteristic classes that behave as expected classically. We present further results on these characteristic classes and use it to notably prove the analogue of the splitting principle, which allows us to establish the foundations for Porteous' formula in this setting which provides a determinantal expression for the fundamental class of degeneracy loci in terms of Chern classes.</description>

Abstract: We study certain generic systems of real polynomial equations associated with triangulations of convex polytopes and investigate their number of real solutions. Our main focus is set on pairs of plane algebraic curves which form a so-called Wronski system. The computational tasks arising in the analysis of such Wronski pairs lead us to the frontiers of current computer algebra algorithms and their implementations, both via Gr\"obner bases and numerical algebraic geometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The product sides of the Rogers--Ramanujan identities and alike often appear to be "transparently modular" (functions). The old work by Rogers (1894) and recent work by Rosengren make use (somewhat implicitly) of this fact for proving the identities with the help of underlying modular equations$-$the main challenge is verifying the latter for the sum sides. Here we speculate on the potentials of using the asymptotics of such $q$-identities for proving them, in particular, when a product side is "asymmetric", hence not modular.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the componentwise linearity of symbolic powers of edge ideals. We propose the conjecture that all symbolic powers of the edge ideal of a cochordal graph are componentwise linear. This conjecture is verified for some families of cochordal graphs, including complements of block graphs and complements of proper interval graphs. As a corollary, Minh's conjecture is established for such families. Moreover, we show that $I(G)^{(2)}$ is componentwise linear, for any cochordal graph $G$.</description>

      <title>Surface sums for lattice Yang-Mills in the large-$N$ limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a sum over weighted planar surfaces formula for Wilson loop expectations in the large-$N$ limit of strongly coupled lattice Yang-Mills theory, in any dimension. The weights of each surface are simple and expressed in terms of products of signed Catalan numbers.
  In establishing our results, the main novelty is to convert a recursive relation for Wilson loop expectations, known as the master loop equation, into a new peeling exploration of the planar surfaces. This exploration reveals hidden cancellations within the sums, enabling a deeper understanding of the structure of the planar surfaces.
  We view our results as a continuation of the program initiated in [CPS23] to understand Yang-Mills theories via surfaces and as a refinement of the string trajectories point-of-view developed in [Cha19a].</description>

Abstract: We prove new instances of \emph{Halin's end degree conjecture} within $\mathrm{ZFC}$. In particular, we prove that there is a proper class of cardinals $\kappa$ for which Haliln's end-degree conjecture holds. This answers two questions posed by Geschke, Kurkofka, Melcher and Pitz in 2023. Furthermore, we comment on the relationship between Halin's conjecture and the \emph{Singular Cardinal Hypothesis}, deriving consistency strength from failures of the former. We also show that Halin's conjecture fails on finite intervals of successors of singular cardinals in Meremovich's model.</description>

Abstract: A long-standing question of the mutual relation between the stack and queue numbers of a graph, explicitly emphasized by Dujmovi\'c and Wood in 2005, was "half-answered" by Dujmovi\'c, Eppstein, Hickingbotham, Morin and Wood in 2022; they proved the existence of a graph family with the queue number at most 4 but unbounded stack number. We give an alternative very short, and still elementary, proof of the same fact.</description>

For example, the majority colouring conjecture of Kreutzer, Oum, Seymour, van der Zypen and Wood states that every directed graph has a 3-colouring such that for every vertex $v$, at most half of the out-neighbours of $v$ have the same colour as $v$. As another example, the internal partition conjecture, due to DeVos and to Ban and Linial, states that for every $d$, all but finitely many $d$-regular graphs have a partition into two nonempty parts such that for every vertex $v$, at least half of the neighbours of $v$ lie in the same part as $v$.
  We prove several results in this spirit: in particular, two of our results are that the majority colouring conjecture holds for Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random directed graphs (of any density), and that the internal partition conjecture holds if we permit a tiny number of "exceptional vertices".
  Our proofs involve a variety of techniques, including several different methods to analyse random recolouring processes. One highlight is a "personality-changing" scheme: we "forget" certain information based on the state of a Markov chain, giving us more independence to work with.</description>

Abstract: We prove that for any $\ell_p$-norm in the plane with $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$ and for every infinite $\mathcal{M} \subset \mathbb{R}^2$, there exists a two-colouring of the plane such that no isometric copy of $\mathcal{M}$ is monochromatic. On the contrary, we show that for every polygonal norm (that is, the unit ball is a polygon) in the plane, there exists an infinite $\mathcal{M} \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ such that for every two-colouring of the plane there exists a monochromatic isometric copy of $\mathcal{M}$.</description>

Abstract: We observe that an old theorem of Graham implies that for any positive integer $s$, there exists some positive integer $T(s)$ such that every $s$-colouring of $\mathbb{Z}^2$ contains a monochromatic pair of points $(x,y),(x',y')$ with $(x-x')^2 - (y-y')^2 = (T(s))^2$. By scaling, this implies that every finite colouring of $\mathbb{Q}^2$ contains a monochromatic pair of points $(x,y),(x',y')$ with $(x-x')^2 - (y-y')^2 = 1$, which answers in a strong sense a problem of Kosheleva and Kreinovich on a pseudo-Euclidean analogue of the Hadwiger-Nelson problem.
  The proof of Graham's theorem relies on repeated applications of van der Waerden's theorem, and so the resulting function $T(s)$ grows extremely quickly. We give an alternative proof in the weaker setting of having a second spacial dimension that results in a significantly improved bound. To be more precise, we prove that for every positive integer $s$ with $r\equiv 2 \pmod{4}$, every $s$-colouring of $\mathbb{Z}^3$ contains a monochromatic pair of points $(x,y,z),(x',y',z')$ such that $(x-x')^2 + (y-y')^2 - (z-z')^2 = (5^{(s-2)/4}(8\cdot 5^{(s-2)/2})!)^2$. In fact, we prove a stronger density version. The density version in $\mathbb{Z}^2$ remains open.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05526v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a game played between two players, Maker and Breaker, on a countably infinite complete graph where the vertices are the rational numbers. The players alternately claim unclaimed edges. It is Maker's goal to have after countably many turns a complete infinite graph contained in her coloured edges where the vertex set of the subgraph is order-isomorphic to the rationals. It is Breaker's goal to prevent Maker from achieving this. We prove that there is a winning strategy for Maker in this game. We also prove that there is a winning strategy for Breaker in the game where Maker must additionally make the vertex set of her complete graph dense in the rational numbers.</description>

      <title>Exponentially many graphs are determined by their spectrum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.09788v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As a discrete analogue of Kac's celebrated question on "hearing the shape of a drum", and towards a practical graph isomorphism test, it is of interest to understand which graphs are determined up to isomorphism by their spectrum (of their adjacency matrix). A striking conjecture in this area, due to van Dam and Haemers, is that "almost all graphs are determined by their spectrum", meaning that the fraction of unlabelled $n$-vertex graphs which are determined by their spectrum converges to $1$ as $n\to\infty$.
  In this paper we make a step towards this conjecture, showing that there are exponentially many $n$-vertex graphs which are determined by their spectrum. This improves on previous bounds (of shape $e^{c\sqrt{n}}$). We also propose a number of further directions of research.</description>

      <title>Integer diagonal forms for subset intersection relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09227v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For integers $0 \leq \ell \leq k_{r} \leq k_{c} \leq n$, we give a description for the Smith group of the incidence matrix with rows (columns) indexed by the size $k_r$ ($k_c$, respectively) subsets of an $n$-element set, where incidence means intersection in a set of size $\ell$. This generalizes work of Wilson and Bier from the 1990s which dealt only with the case where incidence meant inclusion. Our approach also describes the Smith group of any matrix in the $\mathbb{Z}$-linear span of these matrices so includes all integer matrices in the Bose-Mesner algebra of the Johnson association scheme: for example, the association matrices themselves as well as the Laplacian, signless Laplacian, Seidel adjacency matrix, etc. of the associated graphs. In particular, we describe the critical (also known as sandpile) groups of these graphs. The complexity of our formula grows with the parameters $k_{r}$ and $k_{c}$, but is independent of $n$ and $\ell$, which often leads to an efficient algorithm for computing these groups. We illustrate our techniques to give diagonal forms of matrices attached to the Kneser and Johnson graphs for subsets of size $3$, whose invariants have never before been described, and recover results from a variety of papers in the literature in a unified way.</description>

      <title>A concentration phenomenon for $h$-extra edge-connectivity reliability analysis of enhanced hypercubes $Q_{n,2}$ with exponentially many faulty links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17150v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reliability assessment of interconnection networks is critical to the design and maintenance of multiprocessor systems. The $(n, k)$-enhanced hypercube $Q_{n,k}$, as a variation of the hypercube $Q_{n}$, was proposed by Tzeng and Wei in 1991. As an extension of traditional edge-connectivity, $h$-extra edge-connectivity of a connected graph $G,$ $\lambda_h(G),$ is an essential parameter for evaluating the reliability of interconnection networks. This article intends to study the $h$-extra edge-connectivity of the $(n,2)$-enhanced hypercube $Q_{n,2}$. Suppose that the link malfunction of an interconnection network $Q_{n,2}$ does not isolate any subnetwork with no more than $h-1$ processors, the minimum number of these possible faulty links concentrates on a constant $2^{n-1}$ for each integer $\lceil\frac{11\times2^{n-1}}{48}\rceil \leq h \leq 2^{n-1}$ and $n\geq 9$. That is, for about $77.083\%$ of values where $h\leq2^{n-1},$ the corresponding $h$-extra edge-connectivity of $Q_{n,2}$, $\lambda_h(Q_{n,2})$, presents a concentration phenomenon. Moreover, the lower and upper bounds of $h$ mentioned above are both tight.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08913v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For an ordered point set in a Euclidean space or, more generally, in an abstract metric space, the ordered Nearest Neighbor Graph is obtained by connecting each of the points to its closest predecessor by a directed edge. We show that for every set of $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^d$, there exists an order such that the corresponding ordered Nearest Neighbor Graph has maximum degree at least $\log{n}/(4d)$. Apart from the $1/(4d)$ factor, this bound is the best possible. As for the abstract setting, we show that for every $n$-element metric space, there exists an order such that the corresponding ordered Nearest Neighbor Graph has maximum degree $\Omega(\sqrt{\log{n}/\log\log{n}})$.</description>

Abstract: In this short note, we establish an edge-isoperimetric inequality for arbitrary product graphs. Our inequality is sharp for subsets of many different sizes in every product graph. In particular, it implies that the $2^d$-element sets with smallest edge-boundary in the hypercube are subcubes and is only marginally weaker than the Bollob\'as$\unicode{x2013}$Leader edge-isoperimetric inequalities for grids and tori. Additionally, it improves two edge-isoperimetric inequalities for products of regular graphs proved by Erde, Kang, Krivelevich, and the first author and answers two questions about edge-isoperimetry in powers of regular graphs raised in their work.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01385v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We find a positive $e_I$-expansion for the chromatic symmetric function of KPKP graphs, which are graphs obtained by connecting a vertex in a complete graph with a vertex in the maximal clique of a lollipop graph by a path. This generalizes the positive $e_I$-expansion for the chromatic symmetric function of lollipops obtained by Tom, for that of KPK graphs obtained by Wang and Zhou, and as well for those of KKP graphs and PKP graphs obtained by Qi, Tang and Wang. As an application, we confirm the $e$-positivity of twinned lollipops. We also discover the first positive $e_I$-expansion for the chromatic symmetric function of kayak paddle graphs which are formed by connecting a vertex on a cycle and a vertex on another cycle with a path. This refines the $e$-positivity of kayak paddle graphs which was obtained by Aliniaeifard, Wang, and van Willigenburg.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08982v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Erd\H{o}s-Rado canonization theorem generalizes Ramsey's theorem to edge-colorings with an unbounded number of colors, in the sense that for $n = ER(m)$ sufficiently large, any edge-coloring of $E(K_n) \to \mathbb{N}$ will yield some copy of $K_m$ which is colored according to one of four canonical patterns. In this paper, we show that in the bipartite setting, the bipartite Erd\H{o}s-Rado number $ER_B(m)$ satisfies \[ \log ER_B(m) = \Theta(m \log m). \] Comparing this to the non-bipartite setting, the best known lower and upper bounds on $\log ER(m)$ are still separated by a factor of $\log m$.</description>

      <title>Level of Regions for Deformed Braid Arrangements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02971v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper primarily investigates a specific type of deformation of the braid arrangement $\mathcal{B}_n$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$, denoted by $\mathcal{B}_n^A$ and defined in (1.2). Let $r_l(\mathcal{B}_n^A)$ be the number of regions of level $l$ in $\mathcal{B}_n^A$ with the corresponding exponential generating function $R_l(A;x)$. Using the weighted digraph model introduced by Hetyei [11], we establish a bijection between regions of level $l$ in $\mathcal{B}_n^A$ and valid $m$-acyclic weighted digraphs on the vertex set $[n]$ with exactly $l$ strong components. Based on this bijection, we obtain a property analogous to a polynomial sequence of binomial type, that is, $R_l(A;x)$ satisfies the relation
  \[
  R_l(A;x)=\big(R_1(A;x)\big)^l=R_k(A;x)R_{l-k}(A;x).
  \]
  Furthermore, the values $r_l(\mathcal{B}_n^A)$ yield a combinatorial interpretation for the coefficients in the expansion of the characteristic polynomial $\chi_{\mathcal{B}_n^A}(t)$ in the basis elements $\binom{t}{l}$, that is, \[\chi_{\mathcal{B}_n^A}(t)=\sum_{l=0}^n(-1)^{n-l}r_l(\mathcal{B}_n^A)\binom{t}{l}.\] If $n$, $a$ and $b$ are non-negative integers with $n\ge 2$ and $b-a\ge n-1$, for the deformation $\mathcal{B}_n^{[-a,b]}$ defined in (1.3), its characteristic polynomial has a single real root $0$ of multiplicity one when $n$ is odd, and has one more real root $\frac{n(a+b+1)}{2}$ of multiplicity one when $n$ is even.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09396v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is a continuation of my paper "Lattices of flats for symplectic matroids". We explore geometric constructions originating from the lattice of flats of ranked symplectic matroids. We observe that a ranked symplectic matroid always sits between two ordinary matroids and use this fact to prove that it has many of the same properties of ordinary matroids. We compute the dimension of its order complex using its M\"obius function, We show that its matroid polytope is geometrically defined using its flats and connected to its Bergman fan. We finish by highlighting differences between its toric verity and the toric verity of an ordinary matroid, and give a partial proof of Mason's conjecture for ranked symplectic matroids.</description>

      <title>Tur\'an Densities for Small Hypercubes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09445v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How small can a set of vertices in the $n$-dimensional hypercube $Q_n$ be if it meets every copy of $Q_d$? The asymptotic density of such a set (for $d$ fixed and $n$ large) is denoted by $\gamma_d$. It is easy to see that $\gamma_d \leq 1/(d+1)$, and it is known that $\gamma_d=1/(d+1)$ for $d \leq 2$, but it was recently shown that $\gamma_d &lt; 1/(d+1)$ for $d \geq 8$. In this paper we show that the latter phenomenon also holds for $d=7$ and $d=6$.</description>

      <title>Barriers for recent methods in geodesic optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.06652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2102.06652v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a class of optimization problems including matrix scaling, matrix balancing, multidimensional array scaling, operator scaling, and tensor scaling that arise frequently in theory and in practice. Some of these problems, such as matrix and array scaling, are convex in the Euclidean sense, but others such as operator scaling and tensor scaling are geodesically convex on a different Riemannian manifold. Trust region methods, which include box-constrained Newton's method, are known to produce high precision solutions very quickly for matrix scaling and matrix balancing (Cohen et. al., FOCS 2017, Allen-Zhu et. al. FOCS 2017), and result in polynomial time algorithms for some geodesically convex problems like operator scaling (Garg et. al. STOC 2018, B\"urgisser et. al. FOCS 2019). One is led to ask whether these guarantees also hold for multidimensional array scaling and tensor scaling.
  We show that this is not the case by exhibiting instances with exponential diameter bound: we construct polynomial-size instances of 3-dimensional array scaling and 3-tensor scaling whose approximate solutions all have doubly exponential condition number. Moreover, we study convex-geometric notions of complexity known as margin and gap, which are used to bound the running times of all existing optimization algorithms for such problems. We show that margin and gap are exponentially small for several problems including array scaling, tensor scaling and polynomial scaling. Our results suggest that it is impossible to prove polynomial running time bounds for tensor scaling based on diameter bounds alone. Therefore, our work motivates the search for analogues of more sophisticated algorithms, such as interior point methods, for geodesically convex optimization that do not rely on polynomial diameter bounds.</description>

      <title>Structured Decompositions: Structural and Algorithmic Compositionality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.06091v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce structured decompositions. These are category-theoretic data structures which simlutaneously generalize notions from graph theory (including tree-width, layered tree-width, co-tree-width and graph decomposition width) geometric group theory (specifically Bass-Serre theory) and dynamical systems (e.g. hybrid dynamical systems). Furthermore, structured decompositions allow us to generalize these aforementioned combinatorial invariants, which have played a central role in the study of structural and algorithmic compositionality in both graph theory and parameterized complexity, to new settings. For example, in any category with enough colimits they describe algorithmically useful structural compositionality: as an application of our theory we prove an algorithmic meta-theorem for the Sub_P-composition problem. In concrete terms, when instantiated in the category of graphs, this meta-theorem yields compositional algorithms for NP-hard problems such as: Maximum Bipartite Subgraph, Maximum Planar Subgraph and Longest Path.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.01571v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a combinatorial theory of horospherical stacks which is motivated by the work of Geraschenko and Satriano on toric stacks. A horospherical stack corresponds to a combinatorial object called a stacky coloured fan. We give many concrete examples, including a class of easy-to-draw examples called coloured fantastacks. The main results in this paper are combinatorial descriptions of horospherical stacks, the morphisms between them, their decolourations, and their good moduli spaces.</description>

      <title>The complexity of solving a random polynomial system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.03855v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A multivariate cryptograpic instance in practice is a multivariate polynomial system. So the security of a protocol rely on the complexity of solving a multivariate polynomial system. In this paper there is an overview on a general algorithm used to solve a multivariate system and the quantity to which the complexity of this algorithm depends on: the solving degree. Unfortunately, it is hard to compute. For this reason, it is introduced an invariant: the degree of regularity. This invariant, under certain condition, give us an upper bound on the solving degree. Then we speak about random polynomial systems and in particular what "random" means to us. Finally, we give an upper bound on both the degree of regularity and the solving degree of such random systems.</description>

      <title>Metallic mean Wang tiles I: self-similarity, aperiodicity and minimality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03652v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For every positive integer $n$, we introduce a set $\mathcal{T}_n$ made of $(n+3)^2$ Wang tiles (unit squares with labeled edges). We represent a tiling by translates of these tiles as a configuration $\mathbb{Z}^2\to\mathcal{T}_n$. A configuration is valid if the common edge of adjacent tiles has the same label. For every $n\geq1$, we show that the Wang shift $\Omega_n$, defined as the set of valid configurations over the tiles $\mathcal{T}_n$, is self-similar, aperiodic and minimal for the shift action. We say that $\{\Omega_n\}_{n\geq1}$ is a family of metallic mean Wang shifts, since the inflation factor of the self-similarity of $\Omega_n$ is the positive root of the polynomial $x^2-nx-1$. This root is sometimes called the $n$-th metallic mean, and in particular, the golden mean when $n=1$, and the silver mean when $n=2$. When $n=1$, the set of Wang tiles $\mathcal{T}_1$ is equivalent to the Ammann aperiodic set of 16 Wang tiles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04631v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{F}$ be a field and let $E$ be the natural representation of $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{F})$. Given a vector space $V$, let $\Delta^{(2,1^{N-1})}V$ be the kernel of the multiplication map $\bigwedge^N V \otimes V \rightarrow \bigwedge^{N+1}V$. We construct an explicit $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{F})$-isomorphism $\mathrm{Sym}^{N-1}E \otimes \bigwedge^{N+1} \mathrm{Sym}^{d+1}E \cong \Delta^{(2,1^{N-1})} \mathrm{Sym}^d E$. This $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{F})$-isomorphism is a modular lift of the $q$-binomial identity $q^{\frac{N(N-1)}{2}}[N]_q \binom{d+1}{N+1}_q = s_{(2,1^{N-1})}(1,q,\ldots, q^d)$, where $s_{(2,1^{N-1})}$ is the Schur function for the partition $(2,1^{N-1})$. This identity, which follows from our main theorem, implies the existence of an isomorphism when $\mathbb{F}$ is the field of complex numbers but it is notable, and not typical of the general case, that there is an explicit isomorphism defined in a uniform way for any field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10914v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We continue our investigation on denominator conjecture of Fomin and Zelevinsky for cluster algebras via geometric models initialed in \cite{FG22}. In this paper, we confirm the denominator conjecture for cluster algebras of finite type. The new contribution is a proof of this conjecture for cluster algebras of type $\mathbb{D}$ and an algorithm for the exceptional types. For the type $\mathbb{D}$ cases, our approach involves geometric model provided by discs with a puncture. By removing the puncture or changing the puncture to an unmarked boundary component, this also yields an alternative proof for the denominator conjecture of cluster algebras of type $\mathbb{A}$ and $\mathbb{C}$ respectively.</description>

      <title>On the longest increasing subsequence and number of cycles of butterfly permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20952v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One method to generate random permutations involves using Gaussian elimination with partial pivoting (GEPP) on a random matrix $A$ and storing the permutation matrix factor $P$ from the resulting GEPP factorization $PA=LU$. We are interested in exploring properties of random butterfly permutations, which are generated using GEPP on specific random butterfly matrices. Our paper highlights new connections among random matrix theory, numerical linear algebra, group actions of rooted trees, and random permutations. We address the questions of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) and number of cycles for particular uniform butterfly permutations, with full distributional descriptions and limit theorems for simple butterfly permutations. We also establish scaling limit results and limit theorems for nonsimple butterfly permutations, which include certain $p$-Sylow subgroups of the symmetric group of $N=p^n$ elements for prime $p$. For the LIS, we establish power law bounds on the expected LIS of the form $N^{\alpha_p}$ and $N^{\beta_p}$ where $\frac12 &lt; \alpha_p &lt; \beta_p &lt; 1$ for each $p$ with $\alpha_p = 1 - o_p(1)$, showing distinction from the typical $O(N^{1/2})$ expected LIS frequently encountered in the study of random permutations (e.g., uniform permutations). For the number of cycles scaled by $(2-1/p)^n$, we establish a full CLT to a new limiting distribution depending on $p$ with positive support we introduce that is uniquely determined by its positive moments that satisfy explicit recursive formulas; this thus determines a CLT for the number of cycles for any uniform $p$-Sylow subgroup of $S_{p^n}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21055v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a weaker version of a conjecture proposed by Qiao, Park and Koolen on diameter bounds of amply regular graphs and make new progress on Terwilliger's conjecture on finiteness of amply regular graphs. We achieve these results by a significantly improved Lin--Lu--Yau curvature estimate and new Bakry--\'Emery curvature estimates. We further discuss applications of our curvature estimates to bounding eigenvalues, isoperimetric constants, and volume growth. In particular, we obtain a volume estimate of amply regular graphs which is sharp for hypercubes.</description>

Abstract: The shuffle of a non-empty countable set $ S $ of linear orders is the (unique up to isomorphism) linear order $ \Xi(S) $ obtained by fixing a coloring function $ \chi: \mathbb{Q} \to S $ having fibers dense in $ \mathbb{Q} $ and replacing each rational $ q $ in $ (\mathbb{Q}, &lt;) $ with an isomorphic copy of $ \chi(q) $. We prove that any two countable shuffles that embed as convex subsets into each other are order isomorphic.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04770v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a simple connected graph. If every pendant path in $G$ is at least $P_s$, we denote that $G\in \mathbb{G}_s$. For $G \in \mathbb{G}_s$, let $Q_s(G)$ be the set of vertices in $G$ that are distance $s$ from the pendant vertex, and let $|Q_s(G)| = q_s(G)$. For $G \in \mathbb{G}_s$, Li et al. (2024) proved that when $\lambda$ is not an eigenvalue of $P_s$ and $G$ is neither a cycle nor a starlike tree $T_k$, it holds that $m_G(\lambda) \leq 2c(G) + q_s(G) - 1$ and characterized the extremal graphs when $G$ is a tree. In this article, we characterize the extremal graphs for which $m_G(\lambda) = 2c(G) + q_s(G) - 1$ when $G \in \mathbb{G}_{s}$ and $\lambda\notin \sigma(P_s)$.</description>

We show that the density of $A$ relative to the first $N$ integers is $O_c(N^{1-\frac{6}{5c}})$. More generally, given a smooth and regular real valued function $h$ with "growth rate" $c \in (1,\frac{6}{5})$, we show that if $A$ lacks configurations of the form $x,x \pm \lfloor h(n) \rfloor$ then $\frac{|A|}{N} \ll_{h,\varepsilon} N^{1-\frac{6}{5c}+\varepsilon}$ for any $\varepsilon&gt;0$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09701v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given any positive integer $r$, Nahm's problem is to determine all $r\times r$ rational positive definite matrix $A$, $r$-dimensional rational vector $B$ and rational scalar $C$ such that the rank $r$ Nahm sum associated with $(A,B,C)$ is modular. Around 2007, Zagier conjectured that if the rank $r$ Nahm sum for $(A,B,C)$ is modular, then so is the dual Nahm sum associated with $(A^{-1},A^{-1}B,B^\mathrm{T} A^{-1}B/2-{r}/{24}-C)$. We construct some explicit rank four Nahm sums which are modular while their duals are not modular. This provides counterexamples to Zagier's duality conjecture.</description>

Abstract: The study of SAT and its variants has provided numerous NP-complete problems, from which most NP-hardness results were derived. Due to the NP-hardness of SAT, adding constraints to either specify a more precise NP-complete problem or to obtain a tractable one helps better understand the complexity class of several problems. In 1984, Tovey proved that bounded-degree SAT is also NP-complete, thereby providing a tool for performing NP-hardness reductions even with bounded parameters, when the size of the reduction gadget is a function of the variable degree. In this work, we initiate a similar study for QBF, the quantified version of SAT. We prove that, like SAT, the truth value of a maximum degree two quantified formula is polynomial-time computable. However, surprisingly, while the truth value of a 3-regular 3-SAT formula can be decided in polynomial time, it is PSPACE-complete for a 3-regular QBF formula. A direct consequence of these results is that Avoider-Enforcer and Client-Waiter positional games are PSPACE-complete when restricted to bounded-degree hypergraphs. To complete the study, we also show that Maker-Breaker and Maker-Maker positional games are PSPACE-complete for bounded-degree hypergraphs.</description>
