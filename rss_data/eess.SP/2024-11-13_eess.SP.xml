      <title>SPDIM: Source-Free Unsupervised Conditional and Label Shifts Adaptation in EEG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The non-stationary nature of electroencephalography (EEG) introduces distribution shifts across domains (e.g., days and subjects), posing a significant challenge to EEG-based neurotechnology generalization. Without labeled calibration data for target domains, the problem is a source-free unsupervised domain adaptation (SFUDA) problem. For scenarios with constant label distribution, Riemannian geometry-aware statistical alignment frameworks on the symmetric positive definite (SPD) manifold are considered state-of-the-art. However, many practical scenarios, including EEG-based sleep staging, exhibit label shifts. Here, we propose a geometric deep learning framework for SFUDA problems under specific distribution shifts, including label shifts. We introduce a novel, realistic generative model and show that prior Riemannian statistical alignment methods on the SPD manifold can compensate for specific marginal and conditional distribution shifts but hurt generalization under label shifts. As a remedy, we propose a parameter-efficient manifold optimization strategy termed SPDIM. SPDIM uses the information maximization principle to learn a single SPD-manifold-constrained parameter per target domain. In simulations, we demonstrate that SPDIM can compensate for the shifts under our generative model. Moreover, using public EEG-based brain-computer interface and sleep staging datasets, we show that SPDIM outperforms prior approaches.</description>

      <title>High quality ECG dataset based on MIT-BIH recordings for improved heartbeats classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) is a reliable tool for medical professionals to detect and diagnose abnormal heart waves that may cause cardiovascular diseases. This paper proposes a methodology to create a new high-quality heartbeat dataset from all 48 of the MIT-BIH recordings. The proposed approach computes an optimal heartbeat size, by eliminating outliers and calculating the mean value over 10-second windows. This results in independent QRS-centered heartbeats avoiding the mixing of successive heartbeats problem. The quality of the newly constructed dataset has been evaluated and compared with existing datasets. To this end, we built and trained a PyTorch 1-D Resnet architecture model that achieved 99.24\% accuracy with a 5.7\% improvement compared to other methods. Additionally, downsampling the dataset has improved the model's execution time by 33\% and reduced 3x memory usage.</description>

      <title>Double Media-Based Modulation Scheme for High-Rate Wireless Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current wireless communication technologies are insufficient in the face of ever-increasing demands. Therefore, novel and high-performance communication systems are needed. In this paper, a novel high data rate and high-performance index modulation scheme called double media-based modulation (DMBM) is proposed. The DMBM system doubles the number of mirror activation patterns (MAPs) and the number of transmitted symbols compared to the traditional MBM system during the same symbol period. In this way, the spectral efficiency of the DMBM is doubled and the error performance improves as the number of bits carried in the indices increases. Performance analysis of the DMBM scheme is evaluated for $M$-ary quadrature amplitude modulation ($M$-QAM) on Rayleigh fading channels. The error performance of the proposed DMBM system is compared with spatial modulation (SM), quadrature SM (QSM), MBM, and double SM (DSM) techniques. Also, the throughput, complexity, energy efficiency, spectral efficiency, and capacity analyses for the proposed DMBM system and SM, QSM, MBM, and DSM systems are presented. All analysis results show that the proposed DMBM system is superior to the compared systems.</description>

      <title>Reference Signal-Based Waveform Design for Integrated Sensing and Communications System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) as one of the key technologies is capable of supporting high-speed communication and high-precision sensing for the upcoming 6G. This paper studies a waveform strategy by designing the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)-based reference signal (RS) for sensing and communication in ISAC system. We derive the closed-form expressions of Cram\'er-Rao Bound (CRB) for the distance and velocity estimations, and obtain the communication rate under the mean square error of channel estimation. Then, a weighted sum CRB minimization problem on the distance and velocity estimations is formulated by considering communication rate requirement and RS intervals constraints, which is a mixed-integer problem due to the discrete RS interval values. To solve this problem, some numerical methods are typically adopted to obtain the optimal solutions, whose computational complexity grow exponentially with the number of symbols and subcarriers of OFDM. Therefore, we propose a relaxation and approximation method to transform the original discrete problem into a continuous convex one and obtain the sub-optimal solutions. Finally, our proposed scheme is compared with the exhaustive search method in numerical simulations, which show slight gap between the obtained sub-optimal and optimal solutions, and this gap further decreases with large weight factor.</description>

      <title>SoundSil-DS: Deep Denoising and Segmentation of Sound-field Images with Silhouettes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Development of optical technology has enabled imaging of two-dimensional (2D) sound fields. This acousto-optic sensing enables understanding of the interaction between sound and objects such as reflection and diffraction. Moreover, it is expected to be used an advanced measurement technology for sonars in self-driving vehicles and assistive robots. However, the low sound-pressure sensitivity of the acousto-optic sensing results in high intensity of noise on images. Therefore, denoising is an essential task to visualize and analyze the sound fields. In addition to denoising, segmentation of sound and object silhouette is also required to analyze interactions between them. In this paper, we propose sound-field-images-with-object-silhouette denoising and segmentation (SoundSil-DS) that jointly perform denoising and segmentation for sound fields and object silhouettes on a visualized image. We developed a new model based on the current state-of-the-art denoising network. We also created a dataset to train and evaluate the proposed method through acoustic simulation. The proposed method was evaluated using both simulated and measured data. We confirmed that our method can applied to experimentally measured data. These results suggest that the proposed method may improve the post-processing for sound fields, such as physical model-based three-dimensional reconstruction since it can remove unwanted noise and separate sound fields and other object silhouettes.

      <title>Discrete-Valued Signal Estimation via Low-Complexity Message Passing Algorithm for Highly Correlated Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers a discrete-valued signal estimation scheme based on a low-complexity Bayesian optimal message passing algorithm (MPA) for solving massive linear inverse problems under highly correlated measurements. Gaussian belief propagation (GaBP) can be derived by applying the central limit theorem (CLT)-based Gaussian approximation to the sum-product algorithm (SPA) operating on a dense factor graph (FG), while matched filter (MF)-expectation propagation (EP) can be obtained based on the EP framework tailored for the same FG. Generalized approximate message passing (GAMP) can be found by applying a rigorous approximation technique for both of them in the large-system limit, and these three MPAs perform signal detection using MF by assuming large-scale uncorrelated observations. However, each of them has a different inherent self-noise suppression mechanism, which makes a significant difference in the robustness against the correlation of the observations when we apply an annealed discrete denoiser (ADD) that adaptively controls its nonlinearity with the inverse temperature parameter corresponding to the number of iterations. In this paper, we unravel the mechanism of this interesting phenomenon, and further demonstrate the practical applicability of the low-complexity Bayesian optimal MPA with ADD under highly correlated measurements.</description>

      <title>Min-Max Framework for Majorization-Minimization Algorithms in Signal Processing Applications: An Overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This monograph presents a theoretical background and a broad introduction to the Min-Max Framework for Majorization-Minimization (MM4MM), an algorithmic methodology for solving minimization problems by formulating them as min-max problems and then employing majorization-minimization. The monograph lays out the mathematical basis of the approach used to reformulate a minimization problem as a min-max problem. With the prerequisites covered, including multiple illustrations of the formulations for convex and non-convex functions, this work serves as a guide for developing MM4MM-based algorithms for solving non-convex optimization problems in various areas of signal processing. As special cases, we discuss using the majorization-minimization technique to solve min-max problems encountered in signal processing applications and min-max problems formulated using the Lagrangian. Lastly, we present detailed examples of using MM4MM in ten signal processing applications such as phase retrieval, source localization, independent vector analysis, beamforming and optimal sensor placement in wireless sensor networks. The devised MM4MM algorithms are free of hyper-parameters and enjoy the advantages inherited from the use of the majorization-minimization technique such as monotonicity.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Channel Modeling and Environment Reconstruction for Terahertz Monostatic Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: THz ISAC aims to integrate novel functionalities, such as positioning and environmental sensing, into communication systems. Accurate channel modeling is crucial for the design and performance evaluation of future ISAC systems. In this paper, a THz measurement campaign for monostatic sensing is presented. VNA-based channel measurements are conducted in a laboratory scenario, where the transmitter and receiver are positioned together to mimic monostatic sensing. The centering frequency and measured bandwidth for these measurements are 300 GHz and 20 GHz, respectively. A DSS scheme is employed to capture spatial sensing channel profiles. Measurements are conducted across 28 transceiver locations arranged along an 'L'-shaped route. Then, an element-wise SAGE algorithm is used to estimate the MPC parameters, i.e., amplitude and delay. Specular and diffuse reflections are analyzed based on geometric principles and the estimated MPC parameters, where the effects from the radiation pattern are observed. A geometry-based MPC trajectory tracking algorithm is then proposed to classify the MPCs and de-embed the effects of the radiation pattern. Following this algorithm, a hybrid channel model is proposed based on the de-embedded MPC parameters. In this hybrid channel model for monostatic sensing, the MPCs are categorized into target-related and environment-related components. The target-related components are utilized for target detection and identification, while the environment-related ones focus on geometrical scenario reconstruction. A demonstration of geometrical environment reconstruction, along with an analysis of reflection loss for target identification, is subsequently presented. This work offers valuable insights into THz monostatic sensing channel modeling and the design of future THz ISAC systems.</description>

      <title>3-DUSSS: 3-Dimensional Ultrasonic Self Supervised Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces a novel self-supervised learning approach for volumetric segmentation of defect indications captured by phased array ultrasonic testing data from Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymers (CFRPs). By employing this self-supervised method, defect segmentation is achieved automatically without the need for labelled training data or examples of defects. The approach has been tested using artificially induced defects, including back-drilled holes and Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) inserts, to mimic different defect responses. Additionally, it has been evaluated on stepped geometries with varying thickness, demonstrating impressive generalization across various test scenarios. Minimal preprocessing requirements are needed, with no removal of geometric features or Time-Compensated Gain (TCG) necessary for applying the methodology. The model's performance was evaluated for defect detection, in-plane and through-thickness localisation, as well as defect sizing. All defects were consistently detected with thresholding and different processing steps able to remove false positive indications for a 100% detection accuracy. Defect sizing aligns with the industrial standard 6 dB amplitude drop method, with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 1.41 mm. In-plane and through-thickness localisation yielded comparable results, with MAEs of 0.37 and 0.26 mm, respectively. Visualisations are provided to illustrate how this approach can be utilised to generate digital twins of components.</description>

      <title>Decision Feedback In-Context Symbol Detection over Block-Fading Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pre-trained Transformers, through in-context learning (ICL), have demonstrated exceptional capabilities to adapt to new tasks using example prompts \textit{without model update}. Transformer-based wireless receivers, where prompts consist of the pilot data in the form of transmitted and received signal pairs, have shown high estimation accuracy when pilot data are abundant. However, pilot information is often costly and limited in practice. In this work, we propose the \underline{DE}cision \underline{F}eedback \underline{IN}-Cont\underline{E}xt \underline{D}etection (DEFINED) solution as a new wireless receiver design, which bypasses channel estimation and directly performs symbol detection using the (sometimes extremely) limited pilot data. The key innovation in DEFINED is the proposed decision feedback mechanism in ICL, where we sequentially incorporate the detected symbols into the prompts to improve the detections for subsequent symbols. Extensive experiments across a broad range of wireless communication settings demonstrate that DEFINED achieves significant performance improvements, in some cases only needing a single pilot pair.</description>

      <title>Federated Low-Rank Adaptation with Differential Privacy over Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fine-tuning large pre-trained foundation models (FMs) on distributed edge devices presents considerable computational and privacy challenges. Federated fine-tuning (FedFT) mitigates some privacy issues by facilitating collaborative model training without the need to share raw data. To lessen the computational burden on resource-limited devices, combining low-rank adaptation (LoRA) with federated learning enables parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Additionally, the split FedFT architecture partitions an FM between edge devices and a central server, reducing the necessity for complete model deployment on individual devices. However, the risk of privacy eavesdropping attacks in FedFT remains a concern, particularly in sensitive areas such as healthcare and finance. In this paper, we propose a split FedFT framework with differential privacy (DP) over wireless networks, where the inherent wireless channel noise in the uplink transmission is utilized to achieve DP guarantees without adding an extra artificial noise. We shall investigate the impact of the wireless noise on convergence performance of the proposed framework. We will also show that by updating only one of the low-rank matrices in the split FedFT with DP, the proposed method can mitigate the noise amplification effect. Simulation results will demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves higher accuracy under strict privacy budgets compared to baseline methods.</description>

      <title>Active Sensing for Multiuser Beam Tracking with Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03129v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies a beam tracking problem in which an access point (AP), in collaboration with a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), dynamically adjusts its downlink beamformers and the reflection pattern at the RIS in order to maintain reliable communications with multiple mobile user equipments (UEs). Specifically, the mobile UEs send uplink pilots to the AP periodically during the channel sensing intervals, the AP then adaptively configures the beamformers and the RIS reflection coefficients for subsequent data transmission based on the received pilots. This is an active sensing problem, because channel sensing involves configuring the RIS coefficients during the pilot stage and the optimal sensing strategy should exploit the trajectory of channel state information (CSI) from previously received pilots. Analytical solution to such an active sensing problem is very challenging. In this paper, we propose a deep learning framework utilizing a recurrent neural network (RNN) to automatically summarize the time-varying CSI obtained from the periodically received pilots into state vectors. These state vectors are then mapped to the AP beamformers and RIS reflection coefficients for subsequent downlink data transmissions, as well as the RIS reflection coefficients for the next round of uplink channel sensing. The mappings from the state vectors to the downlink beamformers and the RIS reflection coefficients for both channel sensing and downlink data transmission are performed using graph neural networks (GNNs) to account for the interference among the UEs. Simulations demonstrate significant and interpretable performance improvement of the proposed approach over the existing data-driven methods with nonadaptive channel sensing schemes.</description>

      <title>Inter-RIS Beam Focusing Codebook Design in Cooperative Distributed RIS Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05583v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores distributed Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) by introducing a cooperative dimension that enhances adaptability and performance. It focuses on strategically deploying multiple RISs to improve connectivity with the Base Station (BS) and among RISs, thereby aiding users in areas with weak BS coverage and enhancing spatial multiplexing gains. Each RIS can function as a primary surface to directly support users or as an intermediary surface to reflect signals to another primary surface. This dual functionality enables flexible responses to changing conditions. We implement an inter-RIS signal focusing design for phase shifts, creating a tailored codebook for precise control over signal direction. This design considers the interplay of incidence and reflection angles to maximize reflected signal power, based on the RIS response function and the physical properties of the RIS elements.</description>

Abstract: It is well known that the minimum $\ell_2$-norm solution of the convex LASSO model, say $\mathbf{x}_{\star}$, is a continuous piecewise linear function of the regularization parameter $\lambda$, and its signed sparsity pattern is constant within each linear piece. The current study is an extension of this classic result, proving that the aforementioned properties extend to the min-norm solution map $\mathbf{x}_{\star}(\mathbf{y},\lambda)$, where $\mathbf{y}$ is the observed signal, for a generalization of LASSO termed the scaled generalized minimax concave (sGMC) model. The sGMC model adopts a nonconvex debiased variant of the $\ell_1$-norm as sparse regularizer, but its objective function is overall-convex. Based on the geometric properties of $\mathbf{x}_{\star}(\mathbf{y},\lambda)$, we propose an extension of the least angle regression (LARS) algorithm, which iteratively computes the closed-form expression of $\mathbf{x}_{\star}(\mathbf{y},\lambda)$ in each linear zone. Under suitable conditions, the proposed algorithm provably obtains the whole solution map $\mathbf{x}_{\star}(\mathbf{y},\lambda)$ within finite iterations. Notably, our proof techniques for establishing continuity and piecewise linearity of $\mathbf{x}_{\star}(\mathbf{y},\lambda)$ are novel, and they lead to two side contributions: (a) our proofs establish continuity of the sGMC solution set as a set-valued mapping of $(\mathbf{y},\lambda)$; (b) to prove piecewise linearity and piecewise constant sparsity pattern of $\mathbf{x}_{\star}(\mathbf{y},\lambda)$, we do not require any assumption that previous work relies on (whereas to prove some additional properties of $\mathbf{x}_{\star}(\mathbf{y},\lambda)$, we use a different set of assumptions from previous work).</description>

      <title>A Survey on Integrated Sensing, Communication, and Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08074</link>

Abstract: The forthcoming generation of wireless technology, 6G, aims to usher in an era of ubiquitous intelligent services, where everything is interconnected and intelligent. This vision requires the seamless integration of three fundamental modules: Sensing for information acquisition, communication for information sharing, and computation for information processing and decision-making. These modules are intricately linked, especially in complex tasks such as edge learning and inference. However, the performance of these modules is interdependent, creating a resource competition for time, energy, and bandwidth. Existing techniques like integrated communication and computation (ICC), integrated sensing and computation (ISC), and integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) have made partial strides in addressing this challenge, but they fall short of meeting the extreme performance requirements. To overcome these limitations, it is essential to develop new techniques that comprehensively integrate sensing, communication, and computation. This integrated approach, known as Integrated Sensing, Communication, and Computation (ISCC), offers a systematic perspective for enhancing task performance. This paper begins with a comprehensive survey of historic and related techniques such as ICC, ISC, and ISAC, highlighting their strengths and limitations. It then discusses the benefits, functions, and challenges of ISCC. Subsequently, the state-of-the-art signal designs for ISCC, along with network resource management strategies specifically tailored for ISCC are explored. Furthermore, this paper discusses the exciting research opportunities that lie ahead for implementing ISCC in future advanced networks, and the unresolved issues requiring further investigation. ISCC is expected to unlock the full potential of intelligent connectivity, paving the way for groundbreaking applications and services.</description>

      <title>Self-supervised Multimodal Speech Representations for the Assessment of Schizophrenia Symptoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09733</link>

Abstract: Multimodal schizophrenia assessment systems have gained traction over the last few years. This work introduces a schizophrenia assessment system to discern between prominent symptom classes of schizophrenia and predict an overall schizophrenia severity score. We develop a Vector Quantized Variational Auto-Encoder (VQ-VAE) based Multimodal Representation Learning (MRL) model to produce task-agnostic speech representations from vocal Tract Variables (TVs) and Facial Action Units (FAUs). These representations are then used in a Multi-Task Learning (MTL) based downstream prediction model to obtain class labels and an overall severity score. The proposed framework outperforms the previous works on the multi-class classification task across all evaluation metrics (Weighted F1 score, AUC-ROC score, and Weighted Accuracy). Additionally, it estimates the schizophrenia severity score, a task not addressed by earlier approaches.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models and Artificial Intelligence Generated Content Technologies Meet Communication Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06193v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence generated content (AIGC) technologies, with a predominance of large language models (LLMs), have demonstrated remarkable performance improvements in various applications, which have attracted great interests from both academia and industry. Although some noteworthy advancements have been made in this area, a comprehensive exploration of the intricate relationship between AIGC and communication networks remains relatively limited. To address this issue, this paper conducts an exhaustive survey from dual standpoints: firstly, it scrutinizes the integration of LLMs and AIGC technologies within the domain of communication networks; secondly, it investigates how the communication networks can further bolster the capabilities of LLMs and AIGC. Additionally, this research explores the promising applications along with the challenges encountered during the incorporation of these AI technologies into communication networks. Through these detailed analyses, our work aims to deepen the understanding of how LLMs and AIGC can synergize with and enhance the development of advanced intelligent communication networks, contributing to a more profound comprehension of next-generation intelligent communication networks.</description>
