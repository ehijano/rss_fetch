      <title>Neurophotonics beyond the Surface: Unmasking the Brain's Complexity Exploiting Optical Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intricate nature of the brain necessitates the application of advanced probing techniques to comprehensively study and understand its working mechanisms. Neurophotonics offers minimally invasive methods to probe the brain using optics at cellular and even molecular levels. However, multiple challenges persist, especially concerning imaging depth, field of view, speed, and biocompatibility. A major hindrance to solving these challenges in optics is the scattering nature of the brain. This perspective highlights the potential of complex media optics, a specialized area of study focused on light propagation in materials with intricate heterogeneous optical properties, in advancing and improving neuronal readouts for structural imaging and optical recordings of neuronal activity. Key strategies include wavefront shaping techniques and computational imaging and sensing techniques that exploit scattering properties for enhanced performance. We discuss the potential merger of the two fields as well as potential challenges and perspectives toward longer term in vivo applications.</description>

      <title>Single-pixel edge enhancement of object via convolutional filtering with localized vortex phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microscopy is an essential tool in imaging research, and the edge-enhanced microscope by using the vortex filter is of particular interest as an optical information processing that highlights amplitude and phase edges of object in all directions. The application of this technique is not limited to the visible range, but edge enhancement of object in invisible wavelength is also crucial for near-infrared fluorescence and electronic circuit inspection through silicon semiconductors. One disadvantage of near-infrared imaging is that digital cameras such as CCD and CMOS become much more expensive than cameras for the visible spectrum. As an cost-effective method to implement invisible edge enhancement, the Fourier single-pixel imaging has already been proposed without using a camera, but using a single-pixel detector. However, this method requires 3 or 4 times more single-pixel measurements due to the three-phase or four-phase shift to detect optical complex amplitude in Fourier domain. In response, we propose a method for single-pixel edge enhancement of object via convolutional filtering with a localized vortex phase, eliminating the extra single-pixel measurements required by the phase-shifting method. Our simulation results show that the correlation coefficient between the ideal edges of an object and the edge enhanced by our proposed method is 0.95, indicating that our method is effective way to detect the edges. This novel and effective approach for enhancing and detecting the edges of object can be valuable in various invisible imaging applications.</description>

      <title>Two-photon polymerization of optical microresonators for precise pH sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In water monitoring, environmental analysis, cell culture stability, and biomedical applications, precise pH control is demanded. Traditional methods like pH strips and meters have limitations: pH strips lack precision, while electrochemical meters, though more accurate, are fragile, prone to drift, and unsuitable for small volumes. In this paper, we propose a method for optical detection of the pH value based on the multiplexed sensor with 4D microcavities fabricated with two-photon polymerization. This approach employs pH-triggered reversible variations in microresonator geometry and integrates hundreds of dual optically coupled 4D microcavities to achieve the detection limit of 0.003 pH units. The proposed solution is a clear instance for the use-case oriented application of the two-photon polymerized structures of high optical quality. With benefits of the multiplexed imaging platform, dual 4D microresonators can be integrated alongside other microresonator types for pH-corrected biochemical studies.</description>

      <title>Robust realization of electrically tunable spin-orbit locked vortex pairs in polariton condensates at room temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coupling of orbital and spin degrees of freedom gives rise to intriguing physical phenomena in bosonic condensates, such as formation of stripe phases and domains with vortex arrays. However, the robust locking of spin and orbital degrees of freedom of nonlinear topological objects such as vortices in bosonic condensates at room temperature remains challenging. In the present work, we realize a non-equilibrium room-temperature condensate in a liquid crystal (LC) planar photonic microcavity with the perovskite CsPbBr3 as optically active material. We use the interplay of TE-TM mode splitting and Rashba-Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling (RDSOC) to realize electrically tunable polariton vortex pairs with locked spin and orbital angular momentum. Our results are robust against sample imperfections and pave the way to investigate coupling and locking of vortex orbital and spin degrees of freedom in a quantum fluid of light at room temperature, offering potential for generation of complex states of light for optical information processing with optoelectronic chips.</description>

      <title>Electrostatic dipole polarizability and plasmon resonances of multilayer nanoshells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a generalized formula for calculating the dipole polarizability of spherical multilayer nanoshells (MNSs) within the long-wavelength approximation (LWA). Given a MNS with a finite number of concentric layers, radii, and dielectric properties, embedded in a dielectric medium, in the presence of a uniform electric field, we show that its frequency-dependent and complex dipole polarizability can be expressed in terms of the dipole polarizability of the preceding MNS. This approach is different from previous more involved methods where the LWA polarizability of a MNS is usually derived from scattering coefficients. Using both finite-element method- and Mie theory-based simulations, we show that our proposed formula reproduces the usual LWA results, when it is used to predict absorption spectra, by comparing the results to simulated spectra obtained from MNSs with $n$ number of layers up to $n = 6$ layers. An iterative algorithm for calculating the dipole polarizability of a MNS based on the generalized formula is presented. A Fr\"{o}hlich function whose zeroes correspond to the dipolar localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPRs) supported by the MNS is proposed. We identify a pairing behaviour by some LSPRs in the Fr\"{o}hlich function that might also be useful for mode characterization.</description>

      <title>Practical considerations for high-fidelity wavefront shaping experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wavefront shaping is a technique for directing light through turbid media. The theoretical aspects of wavefront shaping are well understood, and under near-ideal experimental conditions, accurate predictions for the expected signal enhancement can be given. In practice, however, there are many experimental factors that negatively affect the outcome of the experiment. Here, we present a comprehensive overview of these experimental factors, including the effect of sample scattering properties, noise, and response of the spatial light modulator. We present simple means to identify experimental imperfections and to minimize their negative effect on the outcome of the experiment. This paper is accompanied by Python code for automatically quantifying experimental problems using the OpenWFS framework for running and simulating wavefront shaping experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent decades, the demand for computational power has surged, particularly with the rapid expansion of artificial intelligence (AI). As we navigate the post-Moore's law era, the limitations of traditional electrical digital computing, including process bottlenecks and power consumption issue, are propelling the search for alternative computing paradigms. Among various emerging technologies, integrated photonics stands out as a promising solution for the next generation of high-performance computing due to the inherent advantages of light, such as low latency, high bandwidth, and unique multiplexing techniques. Furthermore, the progress in photonic integrated circuits (PICs), which are equipped with abundant photoelectronic components, positions photonic-electronic integrated circuits as a viable solution for high-performance computing and as hardware AI accelerators. In this review, we survey recent advancements in both PIC-based digital and analog computing for AI, exploring the principal benefits and obstacles of implementation. Additionally, we propose a comprehensive analysis of photonic AI from the perspectives of hardware implementation, accelerator architecture, and software-hardware co-design. In the end, acknowledging the existing challenges, we underscore potential strategies for overcoming these issues and offer insights into the future drivers for optical computing.</description>

      <title>Optimisation of photodetectors design: comparison between Montecarlo and Genetic Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Montecarlo and Genetic Algorithm optimisations applied to the design of photodetectors based on a transimpedance amplifier and a photodiode. The circuit performance is evaluated with a merit function and the systematic search method is used as a reference. The design parameters are the feedback network components and the photodiode bias voltage. To evaluate the optimisations, we define the relative difference between its merit and the optimum merit obtained by the systematic search. In both algorithms, the relative difference decreases with the number of evaluations, following a power law. The power-law exponent for the Genetic Algorithm is larger than that of Montecarlo (0.74 vs. 0.50). We conclude that both algorithms are advantageous compared to the systematic search method, and that the Genetic Algorithm shows a better performance than Montecarlo.</description>

      <title>Dipole-dipole interacting two-level emitters in a moderately intense laser field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the resonance fluorescence features of a small ensemble of closely packed and moderately laser pumped two-level emitters at resonance. The mean distance between any two-level radiators is smaller than the corresponding emission wavelength, such that the dipole-dipole interactions are not negligible. We have found that under the secular approximation, the collective resonance fluorescence spectrum consists of 2N+1 spectral lines, where N is the number of emitters from the sample. The 2N lateral spectral-bands, symmetrically located around the generalized Rabi frequency with respect to the central line at the laser frequency, are distinguishable if the dipole-dipole coupling strength is larger than the collective spontaneous decay rate. This way, one can extract the radiators number within the ensemble via measuring of the spontaneously scattered collective resonance fluorescence spectrum. Contrary, if the dipole-dipole coupling is of the order of or smaller than the cooperative spontaneous decay rate, but still non-negligible, the spectrum turns into a Mollow-like fluorescence spectrum, where the two lateral spectral lines broadens, proportional to the dipole-dipole coupling strength, respectively.</description>

      <title>Complete quantum control of orbital qubits by phase-controlled stimulated Raman transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complete quantum control of a stationary quantum bit embedded in a quantum emitter is crucial for photonic quantum information technologies. Recently, the orbital degree of freedom in optically active semiconductor quantum dots emerged as a promising candidate. However, the crucial ability to perform arbitrary rotation on orbital qubits remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate complete control of hole orbital states in a quantum dot. This is enabled by successfully inducing stimulated Raman transitions within $\Lambda$ systems connected via radiative Auger transitions. This new capability allows manipulations of polar and azimuth angles of the Bloch vector, as evidenced by Rabi oscillations and Ramsey interference, respectively. Simultaneous control of both parameters is achieved by concurrently varying the amplitude and phase of picosecond Raman pulses, enabling arbitrary unitary rotation of the Bloch vector. Our results establish the orbital states in solid-state quantum emitters as a potentially viable resource for applications in quantum information processing and quantum communication.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We observe non-perturbative high harmonic generation in solids pumped by a macroscopic quantum state of light, bright squeezed vacuum (BSV), which we generate in a single spatiotemporal mode. Due to its broad photon-number distribution, covering states from $0$ to $2 \times 10^{13}$ photons per pulse, and sub-cycle electric field fluctuations over $\pm1\hbox{V}/\hbox{\r{A}}$, BSV provides access to free carrier dynamics within a much broader range of peak intensities than accessible with coherent light. It is also considerably more efficient in the generation of high harmonics than coherent light of the same mean intensity.</description>

      <title>Electrically controlled photonic circuits of field-induced dipolaritons with huge nonlinearities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.08289v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electrically controlled photonic circuits hold promise for information technologies with greatly improved energy efficiency and quantum information processing capabilities. However, weak nonlinearity and electrical response of typical photonic materials have been two critical challenges. Therefore hybrid electronic-photonic systems, such as semiconductor exciton-polaritons, have been intensely investigated for their potential to allow higher nonlinearity and electrical control, with limited success so far. Here we demonstrate an electrically-gated waveguide architecture for dipolar-polaritons that allows enhanced and electrically-controllable polariton nonlinearities, enabling an electrically-tuned reflecting switch (mirror) and transistor of the dipolar-polaritons. The polariton transistor displays blockade and anti-blockade by compressing a dilute dipolar-polariton pulse exhibiting very strong dipolar interactions. The large nonlinearities are well explained using a simple density-dependent polarization field that very effectively screens the external electric field. Remarkably, we show that induced dipoles have an order of magnitude enhancement of the nonlinearities as compared to fixed dipoles. We project that a quantum blockade at the single polariton level is feasible in such a device.</description>

      <title>Isolation of phase edges using off-axis q-plate filters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.18044v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Edge-enhanced microscopes with q-plate have been attracted more attention to enhance the edges of phase-amplitude objects in biological sample due to their capability for all-directional edge enhancement, while differential interference-contrast microscopy enhances edges in only one-direction. However, the edge-enhanced microscopes cannot distinguish the edges of phase and amplitude objects, as both edges are equally enhanced. This study introduces a novel method for isolating the edge of a phase object from an amplitude object using an off-axis q-plate filter in a 4f system. Herein, we combined off-axis q-plates with four different displacements to isolate the phase object edge from the amplitude object. To demonstrate the proposed method, we conducted experiments using two distinct samples. The first sample comprised a phase test target surrounded by an aperture, and the second sample involved an overlap between the phase test target and a white hair with non-zero transmittance. In the samples, the isolated phase object edge is in good agreement with the theoretical expectations, and the amplitude object edge was reduced by approximately 93%. The proposed method is a novel and effective approach for isolating the edge of a phase object from an amplitude object and can be useful in various biological imaging applications.</description>

      <title>Quantitative phase microscopies: accuracy comparison</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11930v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article presents a thorough comparison of themain QPM techniques, focusing on their accuracy in terms of measurement precision and trueness. We focus on 8 techniques, namely digital holographic microscopy (DHM), cross-grating wavefront microscopy (CGM), which is based on QLSI (quadriwave lateral shearing interferometry), diffraction phase microscopy (DPM), differential phase-contrast (DPC) microscopy, phase-shifting interferometry (PSI) imaging, Fourier phase microscopy (FPM), spatial light interference microscopy (SLIM), and transport-of-intensity equation (TIE) imaging. For this purpose, we used a home-made numerical toolbox based on discrete dipole approximation (IF-DDA). This toolbox is designed to compute the electromagnetic field at the sample plane of a microscope, irrespective of the object's complexity or the illumination conditions. We upgraded this toolbox to enable it to model any type of QPM, and to take into account shot noise. In a nutshell, the results show that DHM and PSI are inherently free from artefacts and rather suffer from coherent noise; In CGM, DPC, DPM and TIE, there is a trade off between precision and trueness, which can be balanced by varying one experimental parameter; FPM and SLIM suffer from inherent artefacts that cannot be discarded experimentally in most cases, making the techniques not quantitative especially for large objects covering a large part of the field of view, such as eukaryotic cells.</description>

      <title>On the temporal tweezing of cavity solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.05925v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the work of J.K.~Jang et al., Nat.~Commun.~{\bf 6}, 7370 (2015), where the authors experimentally tweeze cavity solitons in a passive loop of optical fiber, we study the amenability to tweezing of cavity solitons as the properties of a localized tweezer are varied. The system is modeled by the Lugiato-Lefever equation, a variant of the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation. We produce an effective, localized, trapping tweezer potential by assuming a Gaussian phase-modulation of the holding beam. The potential for tweezing is then assessed as the total (temporal) displacement and speed of the tweezer are varied, and corresponding phase diagrams are presented. As the relative speed of the tweezer is increased we find two possible dynamical scenarios: successful tweezing and release of the cavity soliton. We also deploy a non-conservative variational approximation (NCVA) based on a Lagrangian description which reduces the original dissipative partial differential equation to a set of coupled ordinary differential equations for the cavity soliton parameters. We illustrate the ability of the NCVA to accurately predict the separatrix between successful and failed tweezing. This showcases the versatility of the NCVA to provide a low-dimensional description of the experimental realization of the temporal tweezing.</description>
