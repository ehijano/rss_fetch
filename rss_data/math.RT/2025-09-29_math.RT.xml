      <title>Spectral Equivalence of Solvable Lie Algebras with Nilradical I: General and Heisenberg Cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building on the work of Yang, Key, and Muller, we investigate the spectral theory of solvable Lie algebras through their characteristic polynomials and associated spectral invariants. We begin by studying the general case: we compare two notions of spectral equivalence, establish the first known lower bound for the spectral invariant $k(L)$ via the weight decomposition of the nilradical, and introduce a new notion of spectral rigidity to study spectral equivalence within parameterized families. Then, we apply this framework to the classification of solvable Lie algebras with Heisenberg nilradical by Rubin and Winternitz, as we compute $k(L)$ and characteristic polynomials for all low-dimensional solvable extensions, construct the first explicit examples of spectrally equivalent yet non-isomorphic non-nilpotent solvable Lie algebras, derive two upper bounds for $k(L)$, and conclude by applying our rigidity criterion to these families.</description>

      <title>On the global dimension and Koszul property for preprojective algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study preprojective algebras associated to either finite dimensional hereditary algebras, or locally finite hereditary tensor algebras, and in particular show that they have global dimension two in non-Dynkin type.
  Moreover, starting from a locally finite hereditary tensor algebra of non-Dynkin type, we show that the corresponding preprojective algebra is Koszul, and compute both its Hilbert polynomial and its Koszul dual.
  We finish by looking at preprojective algebras of Dynkin type, and show how certain properties of the Weyl group arise in the structure of the preprojective algebra.</description>

      <title>Invariants and representations of the $\Gamma$-graded general linear Lie $\omega$-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is considerable current interest in applications of generalised Lie algebras graded by an abelian group $\Gamma$ with a commutative factor $\omega$. This calls for a systematic development of the theory of such algebraic structures. We treat the representation theory and invariant theory of the $\Gamma$-graded general linear Lie $\omega$-algebra $\mathfrak{gl}(V(\Gamma, \omega))$, where $V(\Gamma, \omega)$ is any finite dimensional $\Gamma$-graded vector space. Generalised Howe dualities over symmetric $(\Gamma, \omega)$-algebras are established, from which we derive the first and second fundamental theorems of invariant theory, and a generalised Schur-Weyl duality. The unitarisable $\mathfrak{gl}(V(\Gamma, \omega))$-modules for two ``compact'' $\ast$-structures are classified, and it is shown that the tensor powers of $V(\Gamma, \omega)$ and their duals are unitarisable for the two compact $\ast$-structures respectively. A Hopf $(\Gamma, \omega)$-algebra is constructed, which gives rise to a group functor corresponding to the general linear group in the $\Gamma$-graded setting. Using this Hopf $(\Gamma, \omega)$-algebra, we realise simple tensor modules and their dual modules by mimicking the classic Borel-Weil theorem. We also analyse in some detail the case with $\Gamma={\mathbb Z}^{\dim{V(\Gamma, \omega)}}$ and $\omega$ depending on a complex parameter $q\ne 0$, where $\mathfrak{gl}(V(\Gamma, \omega))$ shares common features with the quantum general linear (super)group, but is better behaved especially when $q$ is a root of unity.</description>

      <title>Gorenstein-Projective Modules over the Ring of Dual Integers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ring of dual integers is the bounded polynomial ring $\mathbb Z[\epsilon]=\mathbb Z[T]/(T^2)$ with integer coefficients. We describe the (finitely generated) Gorenstein-projective $\mathbb Z[\epsilon]$-modules as the torsionless $\mathbb Z[\epsilon]$-modules, or equivalently, as the perfect differential structures of abelian groups. Moreover, the stable category of G-proj$\mathbb Z[\epsilon]$ modulo projectives is shown to be equivalent to the orbit category $\mathcal D^b(\mathbb Z)/[1]$ of the derived category of the integers and to the homotopy category of perfect differential structures.
  We note that the category G-proj$\mathbb Z[\epsilon]$ is related to the embeddings of a subgroup in a free abelian group and has a quotient which is equivalent to the category of finite abelian groups. In fact, we present a cube which has as vertices eight related categories and as edges functors which are such that the faces of the cube give rise to commutative diagrams. Among interesting properties in G-proj$\mathbb Z[\epsilon]$, we note that uniqueness of direct sum decomposition fails.</description>

      <title>Serre Duality and the Whitehead Link</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the action of the full twist is a Serre functor in the homotopy category of dihedral Soergel Bimodules. Our proof relies on the representability of a certain partial trace functor, which we prove using the diagrammatics for Hochschild cohomology of Soergel Bimodules. Leveraging these representability results, we then compute the triply-graded link homology of the Whitehead link.</description>

      <title>On sharpness in Local Converse Theorems for classical groups and $G_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove various results about the Local Converse Problem for split reductive groups $G$ over a non-archimedean local field~$F$ of characteristic $0$ and residual characteristic $p$. In particular, we prove that when $G$ is a symplectic or special orthogonal group, or the exceptional group $G_2$, and $p$ is large enough, then the optimal standard Local Converse Theorem for $G(F)$ requires twisting by representations of $GL_r(F)$ with $r$ up to half the dimension of the standard representation of the dual group of $G$. However, if we restrict to generic supercuspidal representations of $G(F)$ then it can be improved when $G=SO_{2N}$; we conjecture that the same is true for symplectic and odd special orthogonal groups. We also consider the possibility of using non-standard representations of the dual group to distinguish representations, giving counterexamples to possible improvements for general linear groups, $G_2$ and $SO_{2N}$.</description>

      <title>The Derived Auslander--Iyama Correspondence II: Bimodule Calabi--Yau Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $d$ be a positive integer. In a previous article we established a bijective correspondence between the following classes of objects, considered up to the appropriate notion of equivalence: differential graded algebras with finite-dimensional $0$-th cohomology such that the canonical generator of their perfect derived category is a basic $d\mathbb{Z}$-cluster tilting object, and basic Frobenius algebras that are twisted $(d+2)$-periodic as bimodules. For $d=1$ this correspondence specialises to previous work of the second-named author on algebraic triangulated categories of finite type. In this article, we prove a variant of our general correspondence for bimodule right Calabi--Yau dg algebras. A novel ingredient is a new cohomology theory which contains obstructions to the existence and uniqueness of minimal $A_\infty$-bimodule structures on a graded bimodule.</description>

      <title>Modular analogs of character formulas and minimal lifts of modular forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: If $f$ is a mod-$3$ eigenform of weight 2 and level $\Gamma_0(\ell^2)$ for a prime $\ell$ such that $\ell \equiv -1 \pmod{3}$, and $\ell$ is a vexing prime for $f$, we show that there is no obstruction to finding a minimal lift of $f$, but that there is an obstruction to finding a nonminimal lift. The key new ingredient that we prove is a modular analog of the standard character formula for a cuspidal representation of $\mathrm{GL}_2(\mathbb{F}_\ell)$, an enhancement that allows us to easily compute the group cohomology of a $3$-adic lattice in such a representation. In fact, we provide a general framework for proving such modular analogs for a broader class of representations using results of Brou\'e and Puig in modular representation theory. We show that this class includes certain Deligne--Lusztig representations and representations coming from higher-depth supercuspidal representations of $\mathrm{GL}_2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.21435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For general finite-dimensional self-injective algebra $A$ we construct a family of injective coassociative coproducts $A\to A\otimes A$, all $A$-bimodule morphisms. In particular such structures always exist, confirming a conjecture of Hernandez, Walton and Yadav. The coproducts are indexed by subsets of $\{1,\cdots,m(i)\}\times \{1,\cdots,m(\nu^{-1}i)\}$, where $A\cong \mathrm{End}_{\Lambda}(M)$ is the general form of a self-injective algebra in terms of a basic Frobenius $\Lambda$, the $m(i)$, $1\le i\le n$ are the multiplicities of the indecomposable projective $\Lambda$-modules in $M$, and $\nu$ is the Nakayama permutation of $\Lambda$. We also characterize those among the coproducts introduced in this fashion, in terms this combinatorial data, which are counital.</description>

      <title>Why High-rank Neural Networks Generalize?: An Algebraic Framework with RKHSs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive a new Rademacher complexity bound for deep neural networks using Koopman operators, group representations, and reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs). The proposed bound describes why the models with high-rank weight matrices generalize well. Although there are existing bounds that attempt to describe this phenomenon, these existing bounds can be applied to limited types of models. We introduce an algebraic representation of neural networks and a kernel function to construct an RKHS to derive a bound for a wider range of realistic models. This work paves the way for the Koopman-based theory for Rademacher complexity bounds to be valid for more practical situations.</description>

      <title>High-dimensional quantum Schur transforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum Schur transform has become a foundational quantum algorithm, yet even after two decades since the seminal 2005 paper by Bacon, Chuang, and Harrow (BCH), some aspects of the transform remain insufficiently understood. Moreover, an alternative approach proposed by Krovi in 2018 was recently found to contain a crucial error. In this paper, we present a corrected version of Krovi's algorithm along with a detailed treatment of the high-dimensional version of the BCH Schur transform. This high-dimensional focus makes the two versions of the transform practical for regimes where the number of qudits $n$ is smaller than the local dimension $d$, with Krovi's algorithm scaling as $\widetilde{O}(n^4)$ and BCH as $\widetilde{O}(\min(n^5,nd^4))$. Our work addresses a key gap in the literature, strengthening the algorithmic foundations of a wide range of results that rely on Schur--Weyl duality in quantum information theory and quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Existence of integral Hopf orders in twists of group algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.00097v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We find a group-theoretical condition under which a twist of a group algebra, in Movshev's way, admits an integral Hopf order. Let $K$ be a (large enough) number field with ring of integers $R$. Let $G$ be a finite group and $M$ an abelian subgroup of $G$ of central type. Consider the twist $J$ for $K\hspace{-0.8pt}G$ afforded by a non-degenerate $2$-cocycle on the character group $\widehat{M}$. We show that if there is a Lagrangian decomposition $\widehat{M} \simeq L \times \widehat{L}$ such that $L$ is contained in a normal abelian subgroup $N$ of $G$, then the twisted group algebra $(K\hspace{-0.8pt}G)_J$ admits a Hopf order $X$ over $R$. The Hopf order $X$ is constructed as the $R$-submodule generated by the primitive idempotents of $K\hspace{-1.1pt}N$ and the elements of $G$. It is indeed a Hopf order of $K\hspace{-0.8pt}G$ such that $J^{\pm 1} \in X \otimes_R X$. Furthermore, we give some criteria for this Hopf order to be unique. We illustrate this construction with several families of examples. As an application, we provide a further example of simple and semisimple complex Hopf algebra that does not admit integral Hopf orders.</description>

      <title>Representations of knot groups in $\textrm{AGL}_{1}(\mathbb{C})$ and Alexander invariants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23364v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper reinterprets Alexander-type invariants of knots via representation varieties of knot groups into the group $\textrm{AGL}_1(\mathbb{C})$ of affine transformations of the complex line. In particular, we prove that the coordinate ring of the $\textrm{AGL}_{1}(\mathbb{C})$-representation variety is isomorphic to the symmetric algebra of the Alexander module. This yields a natural interpretation of the Alexander polynomial as the singular locus of a coherent sheaf over $\mathbb{C}^*$, whose fibres correspond to quandle representation varieties of the knot quandle. As a by-product, we construct Topological Quantum Field Theories that provide effective computational methods and recover the Burau representations of braids. This theory offers a new geometric perspective on classical Alexander invariants and their functorial quantization.</description>

      <title>Braided symmetric algebras and a first fundamental theorem of invariant theory for ${\rm U}_q(G_2)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07211v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop invariant theory for the quantum group ${\rm U}_q$ of $G_2$ at generic $q$ in the setting of braided symmetric algebras. Let ${\mathcal A}_m$ be the braided symmetric algebra over $m$-copies of the $7$-dimensional simple ${\rm U}_q$-module. A set of ${\rm U}_q$-invariants in ${\mathcal A}_m$ attached to certain acyclic trivalent graphs is obtained, which spans the subalgebra ${\mathcal A}_m^{{\rm U}_q}$ of invariants as vector space. A finite set of homogeneous elements is constructed explicitly, which generates ${\mathcal A}_m^{{\rm U}_q}$ as algebra. Commutation relations among the algebraic generators are determined. These results may be regarded as a non-commutative first fundamental theorem of invariant theory for ${\rm U}_q$. The algebra ${\mathcal A}_m$ is a non-flat quantisation of the coordinate ring of ${\mathbb C}^7\otimes{\mathbb C}^m$. As ${\rm U}_q$-module, ${\mathcal A}_m={\mathcal A}_1^{\otimes m}$ and we decompose ${\mathcal A}_1$ into simple submodules. The affine scheme associated to the classical limit of ${\mathcal A}_m$ is described. This is a rare case where the structure of a non-flat quantisation is understood.</description>
