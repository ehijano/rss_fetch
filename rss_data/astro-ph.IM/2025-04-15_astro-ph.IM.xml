      <title>GWSurrogate: A Python package for gravitational wave surrogate models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast and accurate waveform models are fundamentally important to modern gravitational wave astrophysics, enabling the study of merging compact objects like black holes and neutron stars. However, generating high-fidelity gravitational waveforms through numerical relativity simulations is computationally intensive, often requiring days to months of computation time on supercomputers. Surrogate models provide a practical solution to dramatically accelerate waveform evaluations (typically tens of milliseconds per evaluation) while retaining the accuracy of computationally expensive simulations. The GWSurrogate Python package provides easy access to these gravitational wave surrogate models through a user-friendly interface. Currently, the package supports 16 surrogate models, each varying in duration, included physical effects (e.g., nonlinear memory, tidal forces, harmonic modes, eccentricity, mass ratio range, precession effects), and underlying solution methods (e.g., Effective One Body, numerical relativity, black hole perturbation theory). GWSurrogate models follow the waveform model conventions used by the LIGO-Virgo-Kagra collaboration, making the package immediately suitable for both theoretical studies and practical gravitational wave data analysis. By enabling rapid and precise waveform generation, GWSurrogate serves as a production-level tool for diverse applications, including parameter estimation, template bank generation, and tests of general relativity.</description>

      <title>Observability of Acausal and Uncorrelated Optical-Quasar Pairs for Quantum-Mechanical Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Viewing high-redshift sources at near-opposite directions on the sky can assure, by light-travel-time arguments, acausality between their emitted photons. One utility would be true random-number generation, by sensing these via two independent telescopes that each flip a switch based on those latest-arrived colours; for example, to autonomously control a quantum-mechanical (QM) experiment. Although demonstrated with distant quasars, those were not fully acausal pairs, which are restricted in simultaneous view from the ground at any single observatory. In optical light such faint sources also require large telescope aperture to avoid sampling assumptions when imaged at fast camera framerates: either unsensed intrinsic correlations between them or equivalently-correlated noise may ruin the expectation of pure randomness. One such case which could spoil a QM test is considered. Based on that, allowed geometries and instrumental limits are modelled for any two ground-based sites, and their data simulated. To compare, an analysis of photometry from the Gemini twin 8-m telescopes is presented, using archival data of well-separated bright stars, obtained with the instruments 'Alopeke (on Gemini-North in Hawai'i) and Zorro (on Gemini-South in Chile) simultaneously in two bands (centred at 562 nm and 832 nm) with 17 Hz framerate. No flux correlation is found, calibrating an analytic model, predicting where a search at signal-to-noise over 50 at 50 Hz with the same instrumentation can be made. Finally, the software PDQ (Predict Different Quasars) is presented which searches a large catalogue of known quasars, reporting those with brightness and visibility suitable to verify acausal, uncorrelated photons at those limits.</description>

      <title>Observational strategies for ultrahigh-energy neutrinos: the importance of deep sensitivity for detection and astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting ultrahigh-energy neutrinos can take two complementary approaches with different trade-offs. 1)~Wide and shallow: aim for the largest effective volume, and to be cost-effective, go for wide field-of-view but at the cost of a shallow instantaneous sensitivity -- this is less complex conceptually, and has strong discovery potential for serendipitous events. However, it is unclear if any source can be identified, following detection. And 2)~Deep and narrow: here one uses astrophysical and multi-messenger information to target the most likely sources and populations that could emit neutrinos -- these instruments have deep instantaneous sensitivity albeit a narrow field of view. Such an astrophysically-motivated approach provides higher chances for detection of known/observed source classes, and ensures multi-messenger astronomy. However, it has less potential for serendipitous discoveries. In light of the recent progress in multi-messenger and time-domain astronomy, we assess the power of the deep and narrow instruments, and contrast the strengths and complementarities of the two detection strategies. We update the science goals and associated instrumental performances that envisioned projects can include in their design in order to optimize discovery potential.</description>

      <title>Spectral Intruders: A Multi-Site Study of Radio Environment for Cosmology Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) presents a significant challenge for carrying out precision measurements in radio astronomy. In particular, RFI can be a show stopper when looking for faint cosmological signals such as the red-shifted 21-cm line from cosmic dawn (CD) and epoch of reionization (EoR). As wireless communications, satellite transmissions, and other RF technologies proliferate globally, understanding the RFI landscape has become essential for site selection and data integrity. We present findings from RFI surveys conducted at four distinct locations: three locations in India, the Gauribidanur Radio Observatory in Karnataka, Twin Lakes in Ladakh, Kalpong Dam in the Andaman Islands, and the Gruvebadet Atmosphere Laboratory in Ny-Alesund, Svalbard, Norway. These sites, selected based on their geographical diversity and varying levels of human activity, were studied to assess RFI presence in 30-300 MHz bands-critical for low-frequency observations and experiments targeting the 21-cm CD/EoR signal. Using an automated RFI detection approach via the Hampel filter and singular value decomposition, the surveys identified both persistent and transient interference, which varies with location and time. The results provide a comprehensive view of the RFI environment at each site, informing the feasibility of long-term cosmological observations and aiding in the mitigation of RFI in radio astronomical data. The methods developed to characterize RFI can be easily generalized to any location and experiment.</description>

      <title>Broadband Polarized Radio Emission Detected from Starlink Satellites Below 100 MHz with NenuFAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study evaluates the impact of Starlink satellites on low-frequency radio astronomy below 100 MHz, focusing on challenges on data processing and scientific goals. We conducted 40 hours of imaging observations using NenuFAR, in the 30.8-78.3 MHz range. Observations included both targeted tracking of specific satellites based on orbital predictions and untargeted searches focused on high-elevation regions of the sky. Images in total intensity and polarimetry were obtained, and full Stokes dynamic spectra were generated for several hundred directions within the Field of View. Detected signals were cross-matched with satellite orbital data to confirm satellite associations. Detailed analyses of the observed spectra, polarization, and temporal characteristics were performed to investigate the origin and properties of the detected emissions. We detected broadband emissions from Starlink satellites, predominantly between 54-66 MHz, with flux densities exceeding 500 Jy. These signals are highly polarized and unlikely to originate from ground-based RFI or reflected astronomical sources. Instead, they are likely intrinsic to the satellites, with distinct differences in emission properties observed between satellite generations. These findings highlight significant challenges to data processing and scientific discoveries at these low frequencies, emphasizing the need for effective mitigation strategies, particularly through collaboration between astronomers and satellite operators.</description>

      <title>Luminis Stellarum et Machina: Applications of Machine Learning in Light Curve Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of observational capabilities in astronomy has led to an exponential growth in the volume of light curve (LC) data, presenting both opportunities and challenges for time-domain astronomy. Traditional analytical methods often struggle to fully extract the scientific value of these vast datasets, especially as their complexity increases. Machine learning (ML) algorithms have become indispensable tools for analyzing light curves, offering the ability to classify, predict, discover patterns, and detect anomalies. Despite the growing adoption of ML techniques, challenges remain in LC classification, including class imbalance, noisy data, and interpretability of models. These challenges emphasize the importance of conducting a systematic review of ML algorithms specifically tailored for LC analysis. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of the latest ML techniques, summarizing their principles and applications in key astronomical tasks such as exoplanet detection, variable star classification, and supernova identification. It also discusses strategies to address the existing challenges and advance LC analysis in the near future. As astronomical datasets continue to grow, the integration of ML and deep learning (DL) techniques will be essential for unlocking the full scientific potential of LC data in the era of astronomical big data.</description>

      <title>Instrumenting a Lake as a Wide-Field Gamma-ray Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ground-level particle detection has recently emerged as an extremely powerful approach to TeV-PeV gamma-ray astronomy. The most successful observatories of this type, HAWC and LHAASO, utilise water-Cherenkov based detector units, housed in tanks or buildings. Here we explore the possibility of deploying water-Cherenkov detector units directly in to a natural or artificial lake. Possible advantages include reduced cost and improved performance due to better shielding. The lake concept has been developed as an option for the future Southern Wide-view Gamma-ray Observatory, and is now under consideration for a possible future extension of the observatory, beyond its recently selected land site. We present results from prototypes operated in a custom built facility, and concepts for full-scale array deployment and long-term operation.</description>

      <title>Long-term evolution of BH-ULX candidates: An `unusual' $L_{\rm disc}$-$T_{\rm col}$ correlation associated with spectral states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the long-term spectral evolution of eight black hole ultra-luminous X-ray sources (BH-ULXs), namely NGC1313 X-1, NGC5408 X-1, NGC6946 X-1, IC342 X-1, NGC55 ULX1, NGC4395 ULX1, NGC5204 X-1 and NGC4190 ULX1 using {\it XMM-Newton} monitoring data spanning over a decade or more. An in-depth spectral modeling with thermal Comptonization ({\it nthComp}) and standard disc ({\it diskbb}) components reveals NGC5204 X-1, IC342 X-1, NGC4190 ULX1 and NGC1313 X-1 exhibiting harder spectral characteristics with dominant effect of Comptonization ($F_{nth}&gt;F_{disc}$, $\Gamma_{nth}\lesssim2$). However, NGC6946 X-1 and NGC55 ULX1 remain in a disc-dominated state ($F_{disc}\sim2F_{nth}$, $\Gamma_{nth}\gtrsim2$), while NGC5408 X-1 shows intermediate spectral characteristics. The spectral analyses indicate an anti-correlation between disc luminosity ($L_{disc}$) and temperature ($T_{col}$) for all sources except NGC5204 X-1. These anti-correlations follow a relation $L_{disc}\propto T_{col}^{\alpha}$ with steeper exponents of $\alpha=-6.01\pm0.25$ (NGC55 ULX1), $-8.93\pm0.11$ (NGC6946 X-1), and $-10.31\pm0.10$ (NGC5408 X-1) for sources with softer or intermediate spectral characteristics. For harder sources, NGC1313 X-1 and IC342 X-1, the combined results provide $\alpha=-3.58\pm0.04$. However, for NGC5204 X-1, a positive correlation is found, yielding $\alpha=1.4\pm0.1$, suggesting that the emission mechanism is associated with the transition from the `standard disc' to the `slim disc' scenario. These findings suggest that the observed $L_{disc}-T_{col}$ correlations, along with the overall spectro-temporal properties of BH-ULXs, seems to be governed by disc-corona-wind driven accretion processes at various inclinations. Finally, we report a QPO-like feature ($\sim20$ mHz) with $rms\%\sim6.6$, Q-factor $\sim6.7$ and significant $2.8\sigma$ in NGC55 ULX1.</description>

      <title>Precise radial velocities of giant stars -- XVII. Distinguishing planets from intrinsically induced radial velocity signals in evolved stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: From a long-term Doppler monitoring campaign of 373 giant stars, we have identified ten giants with periodic radial velocity variations that are challenging to associate with planets. Similar cases in the literature are attributed to poorly understood intrinsic processes. Our goal is to confirm or refute the presence of planets around these ten evolved stars. Additionally, we evaluate the reliability and sensitivity of planet-confirmation metrics when applied to giant stars and present cases of intrinsically induced radial velocity variations, aiming to enhance the physical understanding of the phenomenon. We combined 25 years of radial velocity data from the Hamilton/Lick, SONG, and CARMENES spectrographs. To assess consistency with Keplerian models, we examined the residuals and tracked changes in statistical significance as new data were incorporated. Additionally, we compared radial velocity amplitudes across optical and infrared wavelengths, searched for periodic variations of activity indicators, and examined their correlations with radial velocities. Seven of the ten giants exhibit intrinsically induced radial velocity variations. The strongest arguments against planets orbiting the giants are guided by long-term radial velocity monitoring that detects changing periodicity on long timescales or detects systematics close to the original period in the radial velocity residuals. While activity indicators offer some support, their signals are generally weak. Comparing optical and infrared radial velocity amplitudes also proves insufficient for confirming or refuting planets. We find HIP 64823 remains a promising candidate for hosting a giant exoplanet with orbital period $P\sim$ 7.75 yr. For two stars, the evidence remains inconclusive. Long-term radial velocity monitoring is essential for distinguishing planetary companions from intrinsic variations in evolved stars.</description>

      <title>A Prototype Atom Interferometer to Detect Dark Matter and Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The AION project has built a tabletop prototype of a single-photon long-baseline atom interferometer using the 87Sr clock transition - a type of quantum sensor designed to search for dark matter and gravitational waves. Our prototype detector operates at the Standard Quantum Limit (SQL), producing a signal with no unexpected noise beyond atom shot noise. Importantly, the detector remains at the SQL even when additional laser phase noise is introduced, emulating conditions in a long-baseline detector such as AION or AEDGE where significant laser phase deviations will accumulate during long atom interrogation times. Our results mark a key milestone in extending atom interferometers to long baselines. Such interferometers can complement laser-interferometer gravitational wave detectors by accessing the mid-frequency gravitational wave band around 1 Hz, and can search for physics beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Semi-analytic Orbits: A Practical Implementation of Lynden-Bell's Planar Orbits and Extension to Vertical Oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a practical implementation of the perturbation theory derived by Lynden-Bell (2015) for describing, to arbitrary precision, the orbit of a particle in an arbitrary spherically-symmetric potential. Our implementation corrects minor but important errors in the initial derivation, and extends the formalism in two ways. First, a numerical method is developed to efficiently and precisely solve the analogue to the Kepler problem, and second, a method is introduced to track the particle's vertical oscillations about an axisymmetric disk, even when the vertical oscillation frequency varies with radius. While not as flexible as numerical integration, this method guarantees conservation of energy, angular momentum, and related quantities, and may be used to evaluate a particle's position and velocity in constant time. Our implementation is written in Python and is pip installable as the package lbparticles.</description>

      <title>Physical Parameters of Stars in NGC 6397 Using ANN-Based Interpolation and Full Spectrum Fitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09278</link>

Abstract: Stellar spectral interpolation is critical technique employed by fitting software to derive the physical parameters of stars. This approach is necessary because on-the-go generation of synthetic stellar spectra is not possible due to the complex and high cost of computation. The goal of this study is to develop a spectral interpolator for a synthetic spectral library using artificial neural networks (ANNs). The study aims to test the accuracy of the trained interpolator through self-inversion and, subsequently, to utilize the interpolator to derive the physical parameters of stars in the globular cluster NGC 6397 using spectra obtained from the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) on the Very Large Telescope (VLT). In this study, ANNs were trained to function as spectral interpolators. The ULySS full-spectrum fitting package, integrated with the trained interpolators, was then used to extract the physical parameters of 1587 spectra of 1063 stars in NGC 6397. The trained ANN interpolator achieved precise determination of stellar parameters with a mean difference of 31 K for $T_{\rm eff}$ and 0.01 dex for [Fe/H] compared to previous studies. This study demonstrates the efficacy of ANN-based spectral interpolation in stellar parameter determination, offering faster and more accurate analysis.</description>

      <title>aweSOM: a CPU/GPU-accelerated Self-organizing Map and Statistically Combined Ensemble Framework for Machine-learning Clustering Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce aweSOM, an open-source Python package for machine learning (ML) clustering and classification, using a Self-organizing Maps (SOM) algorithm that incorporates CPU/GPU acceleration to accommodate large ($N &gt; 10^6$, where $N$ is the number of data points), multidimensional datasets. aweSOM consists of two main modules, one that handles the initialization and training of the SOM, and another that stacks the results of multiple SOM realizations to obtain more statistically robust clusters. Existing Python-based SOM implementations (e.g., POPSOM, Yuan (2018); MiniSom, Vettigli (2018); sklearn-som) primarily serve as proof-of-concept demonstrations, optimized for smaller datasets, but lacking scalability for large, multidimensional data. aweSOM provides a solution for this gap in capability, with good performance scaling up to $\sim 10^8$ individual points, and capable of utilizing multiple features per point. We compare the code performance against the legacy implementations it is based on, and find a 10-100x speed up, as well as significantly improved memory efficiency, due to several built-in optimizations.</description>

      <title>Rapid and Late Cosmic Reionization Driven by Massive Galaxies: a Joint Analysis of Constraints from 21-cm, Lyman Line &amp; CMB Data Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observations of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) have the potential to answer long-standing questions of astrophysical interest regarding the nature of the first luminous sources and their effects on the intergalactic medium (IGM). We present astrophysical constraints from a Neural Density Estimation-Accelerated Bayesian joint analysis of constraints deriving from Cosmic Microwave Background power spectrum measurements from Planck and SPT, IGM neutral fraction measurements from Lyman-line-based data sets and 21-cm power spectrum upper limits from HERA, LOFAR and the MWA. In the context of the model employed, the data is found to be consistent with galaxies forming from predominantly atomic-cooled hydrogen gas in dark matter halos, with masses $M_\mathrm{min} \gtrsim 2.6 \times 10^{9}~M_{\odot} ((1+z)/10)^{\frac{1}{2}}$ at 95% credibility ($V_\mathrm{c} \gtrsim 50~\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}$) being the dominant galactic population driving reionization. These galaxies reionize the neutral hydrogen in the IGM over a narrow redshift interval ($\Delta z_\mathrm{re} &lt; 1.8$ at 95% credibility), with the midpoint of reionization (when the sky-averaged IGM neutral fraction is 50%) constrained to $z_{50} = 7.16^{+0.15}_{-0.12}$. Given the parameter posteriors from our joint analysis, we find that the posterior predictive distribution of the global 21-cm signal is reduced in amplitude and shifted to lower redshifts relative to the model prior. We caution, however, that our inferences are model-dependent. Future work incorporating updated, mass-dependent star formation efficiencies in atomic cooling halos, informed by the latest UV luminosity function constraints from the James Webb Space Telescope, promises to refine these inferences further and enhance our understanding of cosmic reionization.</description>

      <title>Advancing RFI-Detection in Radio Astronomy with Liquid State Machines</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) from anthropogenic radio sources poses significant challenges to current and future radio telescopes. Contemporary approaches to detecting RFI treat the task as a semantic segmentation problem on radio telescope spectrograms. Typically, complex heuristic algorithms handle this task of `flagging' in combination with manual labeling (in the most difficult cases). While recent machine-learning approaches have demonstrated high accuracy, they often fail to meet the stringent operational requirements of modern radio observatories. Owing to their inherently time-varying nature, spiking neural networks (SNNs) are a promising alternative method to RFI-detection by utilizing the time-varying nature of the spectrographic source data. In this work, we apply Liquid State Machines (LSMs), a class of spiking neural networks, to RFI-detection. We employ second-order Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LiF) neurons, marking the first use of this architecture and neuron type for RFI-detection. We test three encoding methods and three increasingly complex readout layers, including a transformer decoder head, providing a hybrid of SNN and ANN techniques. Our methods extend LSMs beyond conventional classification tasks to fine-grained spatio-temporal segmentation. We train LSMs on simulated data derived from the Hyrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA), a known benchmark for RFI-detection. Our model achieves a per-pixel accuracy of 98% and an F1-score of 0.743, demonstrating competitive performance on this highly challenging task. This work expands the sophistication of SNN techniques and architectures applied to RFI-detection, and highlights the effectiveness of LSMs in handling fine-grained, complex, spatio-temporal signal-processing tasks.</description>

      <title>Estimating the dense gas mass of molecular clouds using spatially unresolved 3 mm line observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We aim to develop a new method to infer the sub-beam probability density function (PDF) of H2 column densities and the dense gas mass within molecular clouds using spatially unresolved observations of molecular emission lines in the 3 mm band. We model spatially unresolved line integrated intensity measurements as the average of an emission function weighted by the sub-beam column density PDF. The emission function, which expresses the line integrated intensity as a function of the gas column density, is an empirical fit to high resolution (&lt; 0.05 pc) multi-line observations of the Orion B molecular cloud. The column density PDF is assumed to be parametric, composed of a lognormal distribution at moderate column densities and a power law distribution at higher column densities. To estimate the sub-beam column density PDF, the emission model is combined with a Bayesian inversion algorithm (the Beetroots code), which takes account of thermal noise and calibration errors. We validate our method by demonstrating that it recovers the true column density PDF of the Orion B cloud, reproducing the observed emission line integrated intensities. We apply the method to 12CO(J=1-0), 13CO(J=1-0), C18O(J=1-0), HCN(J=1-0), HCO+(J=1-0) and N2H+(J=1-0) observations of a 700 x 700 pc2 field of view (FoV) in the nearby galaxy M51. On average, the model reproduces the observed intensities within 30%. The column density PDFs obtained for the spiral arm region within our test FoV are dominated by a power-law tail at high column densities, with slopes that are consistent with gravitational collapse. Outside the spiral arm, the column density PDFs are predominantly lognormal, consistent with supersonic isothermal turbulence. We calculate the mass associated with the powerlaw tail of the column density PDFs and observe a strong, linear correlation between this mass and the 24$\mu$m surface brightness.</description>

      <title>Anchors no more: Using peculiar velocities to constrain $H_0$ and the primordial Universe without calibrators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a novel approach to constrain the Hubble parameter $H_0$ and the primordial power spectrum amplitude $A_\mathrm{s}$ using supernovae type Ia (SNIa) data. By considering SNIa as tracers of the peculiar velocity field, we can model their distance and their covariance as a function of cosmological parameters without the need of calibrators like Cepheids; this yields a new independent probe of the large-scale structure based on SNIa data without distance anchors. Crucially, we implement a differentiable pipeline in JAX, including efficient emulators and affine sampling, reducing inference time from years to hours on a single GPU. We first validate our method on mock datasets, demonstrating that we can constrain $H_0$ and $\log 10^{10}A_\mathrm{s}$ within $\sim10\%$ using $\sim10^3$ SNIa. We then test our pipeline with SNIa from an $N$-body simulation, obtaining $7\%$-level unbiased constraints on $H_0$ with a moderate noise level. We finally apply our method to Pantheon+ data, constraining $H_0$ at the $10\%$ level without Cepheids when fixing $A_\mathrm{s}$ to its $\it{Planck}$ value. On the other hand, we obtain $15\%$-level constraints on $\log 10^{10}A_\mathrm{s}$ in agreement with $\it{Planck}$ when including Cepheids in the analysis. In light of upcoming observations of low redshift SNIa from the Zwicky Transient Facility and the Vera Rubin Legacy Survey of Space and Time, surveys for which our method will develop its full potential, we make our code publicly available.</description>

      <title>DISPATCH methods: an approximate, entropy-based Riemann solver for ideal magnetohydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.02438v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the advance of supercomputers we can now afford simulations with very large ranges of scales. In astrophysical applications, e.g. simulating Solar, stellar and planetary atmospheres, interstellar medium, etc; physical quantities, like gas pressure, density, temperature, plasma $\beta$, Mach, Reynolds numbers can vary by orders of magnitude. This requires a robust solver, which can deal with a very wide range of conditions and be able to maintain hydrostatic equilibrium where it is applicable. We reformulate a Godunov-type HLLD Riemann solver that it would be suitable to maintain hydrostatic equilibrium in atmospheric applications in a range of Mach numbers, regimes where kinetic and magnetic energies dominate over thermal energy without any ad-hoc corrections. We change the solver to use entropy instead of total energy as the primary thermodynamic variable in the system of MHD equations. The entropy is not conserved, it increases when kinetic and magnetic energy is converted to heat, as it should. We propose using an approximate entropy - based Riemann solver as an alternative to already widely used Riemann solver formulations where it might be beneficial. We conduct a series of standard tests with varying conditions and show that the new formulation for the Godunov type Riemann solver works and is promising.</description>

      <title>Disentangling Joint Light Curves Using Photocenter Shifts: A Case Study Using NEOWISE Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05401v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The data collected by the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE, Wright et al. 2010) and its follow-up Near Earth Object (NEO) mission (NEOWISE, Mainzer et al. 2011) represent a treasure trove for variability studies. However, the angular resolution imposed by the primary mirror implies that close double stars are often unresolved. Then, variability of one or both stars leads to motion of the image centroid along the connecting line. Knowledge of the angular separation, derived from higher-resolution imaging which resolves both components, allows disentangling of the joint light curve into individual ones. This is illustrated by the case of SPICY 1474 which featured an outburst several years ago. Removal of the contribution of the nearby companion, which led to a dilution of the burst strength, revealed that it was ~0.5 mag brighter than in the joint light curve. A comparison with light curves from unTimely suggests that utilizing the photocenter shift may lead to more reliable results.</description>

      <title>An Informational-Entropic Approach to Exoplanet Characterization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.13344v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the past, measures of ``Earth-likeness'' of exoplanets have been qualitative, considered an abiotic Earth, or required discretionary choices of what parameters make a planet Earth-like. With the advent of high-resolution exoplanet spectroscopy, there is a growing need for a method of quantifying the Earth-likeness of a planet that addresses these issues while making use of the data available from modern telescope missions. In this work, we introduce an informational-entropic metric that makes use of the spectrum of an exoplanet to directly quantify how Earth-like the planet is. To illustrate our method, we generate simulated transmission spectra of a series of Earth-like and super-Earth exoplanets, as well as an exoJupiter and several gas giant exoplanets. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate the ability of the information metric to evaluate how similar a planet is to Earth, making it a powerful tool in the search for a candidate Earth 2.0.</description>

      <title>Direction-dependent effects on global 21-cm detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10756v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmic dawn represents critical juncture in cosmic history when the first population of stars emerged. The astrophysical processes that govern this transformation need to be better understood. The detection of redshifted 21-cm radiation emitted from neutral hydrogen during this era offers a direct window into the thermal and ionization state of the universe. This emission manifests as differential brightness between spin temperature and the cosmic microwave background (CMB). SARAS experiment aims to detect the sky-averaged signal in the frequency range 40-200 MHz. SARAS's unique design and operation strategy to float the antenna over a water body minimizes spectral features that may arise due to stratified ground beneath the antenna. However, the antenna environment can be prone to configuration changes due to variations in critical design parameters such as conductivity and antenna tilts. In this paper, we connect the variations in antenna properties to signal detection prospects. By using realistic simulations of a direction and frequency-dependent radiation pattern of the SARAS antenna and its transfer function, we establish critical parameters and estimate bias in the detectability of different models of the global 21-cm signal. We find a correlation between the nature of chromaticity in antenna properties and the bias in the recovered spectral profiles of 21-cm signals. We also find stringent requirements for transfer function corrections, which can otherwise make detection prospects prohibitive. We finally explore a range of critical parameters that allow robust signal detection.</description>

      <title>Differentiable Modeling of Planet and Substellar Atmosphere: High-Resolution Emission, Transmission, and Reflection Spectroscopy with ExoJAX2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06900v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modeling based on differentiable programming holds great promise for astronomy, enabling advanced techniques such as gradient-based posterior sampling and optimization. This paradigm motivated us to develop ExoJAX (Kawahara et al. 2022), the first auto-differentiable spectrum model of exoplanets and brown dwarfs. ExoJAX directly calculates cross-sections as functions of temperature and pressure to minimize interpolation errors in high-dispersion spectra, although initial work focused on narrowband emission spectroscopy. Here, we introduce a fast, memory-efficient opacity algorithm and differentiable radiative transfer for emission, transmission, and reflection spectroscopy. In the era of data-rich JWST observations, retrieval analyses are often forced to bin high-resolution spectra due to computational bottlenecks. The new algorithm efficiently handles native-resolution data, preserving the full information content and dynamic range. The advances proposed in this paper enable broader applications, demonstrated by retrievals of GL229 B's high-dispersion emission, WASP-39 b's JWST mid-resolution transmission at original resolution (R $\sim$ 2,700), and Jupiter's reflection spectrum. We derive a C/O ratio for GL229 B consistent with its host star, constrain WASP-39 b's radial velocity from molecular line structures, and infer Jupiter's metallicity in line with previous estimates.</description>

      <title>A simulation framework for SiPMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16710v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a Python module for simulating Silicon Photo-Multipliers, Avalanche Photo-Diodes, and Multi-Pixel Photon Counters. This module allows users to perform noise analyses: Dark Count Rate, crosstalk, and afterpulsing. Furthermore, the simulation framework novelty is the capability of simulating assemblies of SiPM arrays (MPPCa) for large area detectors like Ring Imaging Cherenkov detectors, Cherenkov Telescopes, Positron Emission Tomography, and any detector using SiPM arrays. Users can simulate ring- or shower-like-shaped signals based on the expected number of photons generated by the source. We validate the performance of the simulation module with data from four different SiPM: Broadcom AFBR-S4N66P024M, Hamamatsu S14160-636050HS, Onsemi MICROFC-60035, and FBK NUV-HD3.</description>

      <title>Parameter estimation of microlensed gravitational waves with Conditional Variational Autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00566v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational lensing of gravitational waves (GWs) provides a unique opportunity to study cosmology and astrophysics at multiple scales. Detecting microlensing signatures, in particular, requires efficient parameter estimation methods due to the high computational cost of traditional Bayesian inference. In this paper we explore the use of deep learning, namely Conditional Variational Autoencoders (CVAE), to estimate parameters of microlensed binary black hole (simulated) waveforms. We find that our CVAE model yields accurate parameter estimation and significant computational savings compared to Bayesian methods such as Bilby (up to five orders of magnitude faster inferences). Moreover, the incorporation of CVAE-generated priors into Bilby, based on the 95% confidence intervals of the CVAE posterior for the lensing parameters, reduces Bilby's average runtime by around 48% without any penalty on accuracy. Our results suggest that a CVAE model is a promising tool for future low-latency searches of lensed signals. Further applications to actual signals and integration with advanced pipelines could help extend the capabilities of GW observatories in detecting microlensing events.</description>

      <title>Time delay interferometry with minimal null frequencies and shortened time span</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03983v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In Paper I, we introduced the hybrid Relay, an alternative second-generation time-delay interferometry (TDI) configuration designed to minimize null frequencies and enhance gravitational wave (GW) analysis for massive binary black holes (MBBHs). In Paper II, we further improved its noise characterization performance by replacing its null stream with a more stable channel, $C^{12}_3$. In this work, we present a novel TDI scheme, PD4L, which features minimal null frequencies and a reduced time span. Unlike the hybrid Relay or the second-generation Michelson which require delays up to $7L$ (with $L$ denoting the light-travel time between spacecraft), the PD4L uses delays no longer than $3L$, corresponding to a total time span of $4L$. This compact structure yields several advantages: 1) reducing data margins at segment boundaries, 2) mitigating aliasing in the high frequency regime, and 3) shortening the signal tails caused by long span. To evaluate PD4L's performance, we perform parameter inference for chirping GW signals from coalescing MBBHs. Our results show that the PD4L outperforms the hybrid Relay in the high frequency band and performs comparably at low frequencies. Moreover, PD4L's null stream exhibits the same minimal null frequencies as its science channels and maintains a more stable noise spectrum than $C^{12}_3$. While the noise spectra of its science channels are slightly less stable than those of the hybrid Relay, PD4L can still reliably infer noise parameters for data durations of up to four months. These results suggest PD4L as a promising TDI scheme, particularly well-suited for analyzing GW signal in the higher-frequency domain.</description>

      <title>Sampling the full hierarchical population posterior distribution in gravitational-wave astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12156v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a full sampling of the hierarchical population posterior distribution of merging black holes using current gravitational-wave data. We directly tackle the the most relevant intrinsic parameter space made of the binary parameters (masses, spin magnitudes, spin directions, redshift) of all the events entering the GWTC-3 LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA catalog, as well as the hyperparameters of the underlying population of sources. This results in a parameter space of about 500 dimensions, in contrast with current investigations where the targeted dimensionality is drastically reduced by marginalizing over all single-event parameters. In particular, we have direct access to (i) population parameters, (ii) population-informed single-event parameters, and (iii) correlations between these two sets of parameters. We quantify the fractional contribution of each event to the constraints on the population hyperparameters. Our implementation relies on modern probabilistic programming languages and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, with a continuous interpolation of single-event posterior probabilities. Sampling the full hierarchical problem is feasible, as demonstrated here, and advantageous as it removes some (but not all) of the Monte Carlo integrations that enter the likelihood together with the related variances.</description>

      <title>Astrometric Parallax Measurements with JWST for Localization of Near-Earth Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04003v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose the use of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) in simultaneous observations with an Earth-based telescope for parallax measurements to tightly constrain the orbital trajectory of hazardous near-Earth objects (NEOs). We demonstrate the significant reduction in localization error with varying epochs of observation at the potential time-of-impact via a Monte Carlo simulated case study of 2024 YR4, an Apollo-type near-Earth asteroid. By leveraging the L2-Earth baseline and the considerable parallax angles formed, we highlight the unexplored potential for improved localization of NEOs through parallax observations with JWST.</description>
