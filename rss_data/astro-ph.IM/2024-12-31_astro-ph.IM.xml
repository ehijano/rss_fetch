      <title>Ten (or more!) reasons to register your software with the Astrophysics Source Code Library</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This presentation covered the benefits of registering astronomy research software with the Astrophysics Source Code Library (ASCL, ascl.net), a free online registry for software used in astronomy research. Indexed by ADS and Clarivate's Web of Science, the ASCL currently contains over 3600 codes, and its entries have been cited over 17,000 times. Registering your code with the ASCL is easy with our online submissions system. Making your software available for examination shows confidence in your research and makes your research more transparent, reproducible, and falsifiable. ASCL registration allows your software to be cited on its own merits and provides a citation method that is trackable and accepted by all astronomy journals, and by journals such as \textit{Science} and \textit{Nature}. Adding your code to the ASCL also allows others to find your code more easily, as it can then be found not only in the ASCL itself, but also in ADS, Web of Science, and Google Scholar.</description>

      <title>Robust Bayesian inference with gapped LISA data using all-in-one TDI-$\infty$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), an ESA L-class mission, is designed to detect gravitational waves in the millihertz frequency band, with operations expected to begin in the next decade. LISA will enable studies of astrophysical phenomena such as massive black hole mergers, extreme mass ratio inspirals, and compact binary systems. A key challenge in analyzing LISA's data is the significant laser frequency noise, which must be suppressed using time-delay interferometry (TDI). Classical TDI mitigates this noise by algebraically combining phase measurements taken at different times and spacecraft. However, data gaps caused by instrumental issues or operational interruptions complicate the process. These gaps affect multiple TDI samples due to the time delays inherent to the algorithm, rendering surrounding measurements unusable for parameter inference. In this paper, we apply the recently proposed variant of TDI known as TDI-$\infty$ to astrophysical parameter inference, focusing on the challenge posed by data gaps. TDI-$\infty$ frames the LISA likelihood numerically in terms of raw measurements, marginalizing over laser phase noises under the assumption of infinite noise variance. Additionally, TDI-$\infty$ is set up to incorporate and cancel other noise sources beyond laser noise, including optical bench motion, clock noise, and modulation noise, establishing it as an all-in-one TDI solution. The method gracefully handles measurement interruptions, removing the need to explicitly address discontinuities during template matching. We integrate TDI-$\infty$ into a Bayesian framework, demonstrating its superior performance in scenarios involving gaps. Compared to classical TDI, the method preserves signal integrity more effectively and is particularly interesting for low-latency applications, where the limited amount of available data makes data gaps particularly disruptive.</description>

      <title>The RISTRETTO simulator: Exoplanet reflected spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The upcoming Ristretto spectrograph is dedicated to the detection and analysis of exoplanetary atmospheres, with a primary focus on the temperate rocky world Proxima b. This scientific endeavor relies on the interplay of a high-contrast adaptive optics (AO) system and a high-resolution echelle spectrograph. In this work, I present a comprehensive simulation of Ristretto's output spectra, employing the Python package Pyechelle. Starting from realistic spectra of both exoplanets and their host stars, I generate synthetic 2D spectra to closely resemble those that will be produced by Ristretto itself. These synthetic spectra are subsequently treated as authentic data and therefore analyzed. These simulations facilitate not only the investigation of potential exoplanetary atmospheres but also an in-depth assessment of the inherent capabilities and limitations of the Ristretto spectrograph.</description>

      <title>Lowering In-Memory Footprint of Antenna Beams via Polynomial Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the emergence of new radio telescopes promising larger fields of view at lower observation frequencies (e.g., SKA), addressing direction-dependent effects (DDE) (e.g., direction-specific beam responses), polarisation leakage, and pointing errors has become all the more important. Be it through A-projection or otherwise, addressing said effects often requires reliable representations of antenna/station beams; yet, these require significant amounts of computational memory as they are baseline-, frequency-, time-, and polarisation-dependent. A novel prototype is reported here to approximate antenna beams suitable for SKA-MID using Zernike polynomials. It is shown that beam kernels can be well approximated, paving the way for future optimisations towards facilitating more efficient beam-dependent solutions and approaches to tackling the aforementioned challenges, all of which are essential for large-scale radio telescopes.</description>

      <title>Novel SiC UV Instrumentation Development with Potential Applications for the Habitable Worlds Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we detail recent and current work that is being carried out to fabricate and advance novel SiC UV instrumentation that is aimed at enabling more sensitive measurements across numerous disciplines, with a short discussion of the promise such detectors may hold for the Habitable Worlds Observatory. We discuss SiC instrument development progress that is being carried out under multiple NASA grants, including several PICASSO and SBIR grants, as well as an ECI grant. Testing of pixel design, properties and layout as well as maturation of the integration scheme developed through these efforts provide key technology and engineering advancement for potential HWO detectors. Achieving desired noise characteristics, responsivity, and validating operation of SiC detectors using standard read out techniques offers a compelling platform for operation of denser and higher dimensionality SiC photodiode arrays of interest for use in potential HWO Coronagraph, Spectrograph, and High Resolution Imaging Instruments. We incorporate these SiC detector properties into a simulation of potential NUV exoplanet observations by HWO using SiC detectors and also discuss potential application to HWO.</description>

      <title>A Simplified Theory of External Occulters for Solar Coronagraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a first-principles analytic treatment of modern multi-vane occulters in circular (coronagraph) and linear (heliospheric imager) geometry, develop a simplified theory that is useful for designing and predicting their performance, explain certain visual artifacts, and explore the performance limits of multi-vane occulters. Multi-vane occulters are challenging to design in part because they violate the conditions for both the Fraunhofer and Fresnel approximations to diffraction theory, and new designs have therefore generally required explicit simulation, empirical measurement, "guesstimation", or all three. Starting from the Kirchoff diffraction integral, we develop a "sequential plane wave" approximate analytic theory that is suitable for predicting performance of multi-vane occulters, and use it to derive closed-form expressions for the performance of new designs. We review the fundamental 2-D system of an occulter edge, discuss how it applies to real 3-D systems by extrusion or revolution, present the reason for observed bright quasi-achromatic fringing around coronagraph occulters, develop the sequential plane wave approximation in 2-D and explore its limits, describe the relevance of the 2-D theory to practical 3-D instruments, and discuss implications for multi-vane occulter design in current and future instruments.</description>

      <title>From terrestrial weather to space weather through the history of scintillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent observations of interplanetary scintillation (IPS) at radio frequencies have proved to be a powerful tool for probing the solar environment from the ground. But how far back does this tradition really extend? Our survey of the literature to date has revealed a long history of scintillating observations, beginning with the oral traditions of Indigenous peoples from around the globe, encompassing the works of the Ancient Greeks and Renaissance scholars, and continuing right through into modern optics, astronomy and space science. We outline here the major steps that humanity has taken along this journey, using scintillation as a tool for predicting first terrestrial, and then space weather without ever having to leave the ground.</description>

      <title>A Neural Network-Based Search for Unmodeled Transients in LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA's Third Observing Run</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the results of a Neural Network (NN)-based search for short-duration gravitational-wave transients in data from the third observing run of LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA. The search targets unmodeled transients with durations of milliseconds to a few seconds in the 30-1500 Hz frequency band, without assumptions about the incoming signal direction, polarization, or morphology. Using the Gravitational Wave Anomalous Knowledge (GWAK) method, three compact binary coalescences (CBCs) identified by existing pipelines are successfully detected, along with a range of detector glitches. The algorithm constructs a low-dimensional embedded space to capture the physical features of signals, enabling the detection of CBCs, detector glitches, and unmodeled transients. This study demonstrates GWAK's ability to enhance gravitational-wave searches beyond the limits of existing pipelines, laying the groundwork for future detection strategies.</description>

      <title>The Advantage of Early Detection and Localization from Eccentricity-Induced Higher Harmonic Modes in Second-Generation Ground-Based Detector Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Early detection and localization of gravitational waves (GWs) are crucial for identifying and capturing their electromagnetic (EM) counterparts, playing a significant role in multi-messenger astronomy. For second-generation (2G) detectors such as LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA, the typical duration of GW signals ranges from $\mathcal{O}(0.1)$ seconds to several tens of seconds due to their optimal sensitivities only at higher frequencies. This limited duration is insufficient to provide adequate early warning and localization for potential GWs and their associated EM counterparts. In this paper, we investigate whether eccentricity-induced higher harmonic modes, which enter the detector band much earlier than the dominant mode, can aid early detection and localization of GW sources using the 2G ground-based detector network. We select two typical events, a GW170817-like BNS and a GW150914-like BBH, as illustrative examples. For a GW170817-like BNS, we find that the eccentric case with $e_0=0.4$ at 10 Hz can achieve an SNR of 4 and the threshold SNR of 8 approximately 12 minutes and 5 minutes before merger, representing 4.5- and 1.5-minute improvements in time-to-merger compared to the circular case, respectively. Additionally, with $e_0=0.4$, it can achieve a localization of $1000 \, (100)\, \rm deg^2$ at 5 (1) minutes before the merger, reflecting improvements of 2 minutes (15 seconds) compared to the circular case. For a typical GW150914-like BBH, due to the much shorter signal duration, the time-to-merger gained from higher modes for achieving the same SNR and localization is limited to $\mathcal{O}(0.1)-\mathcal{O}(1)$ seconds. Our results demonstrate the usefulness of eccentricity-induced higher harmonic modes in improving early warning and localization of GW and EM counterparts, particularly for BNS systems.</description>

      <title>Solar Filaments Detection using Active Contours Without Edges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, an active contours without edges (ACWE)-based algorithm has been proposed for the detection of solar filaments in H-alpha full-disk solar images. The overall algorithm consists of three main steps of image processing. These are image pre-processing, image segmentation, and image post-processing. Here in the work, contours are initialized on the solar image and allowed to deform based on the energy function. As soon as the contour reaches the boundary of the desired object, the energy function gets reduced, and the contour stops evolving. The proposed algorithm has been applied to few benchmark datasets and has been compared with the classical technique of object detection. The results analysis indicates that the proposed algorithm outperforms the results obtained using the existing classical algorithm of object detection.</description>

      <title>Rotational excitation cross sections for chloronium based on a new 5D interaction potential with molecular hydrogen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chloronium (H$_2$Cl$^+$) is an important intermediate of Cl-chemistry in space. The accurate knowledge of its collisional properties allows a better interpretation of the corresponding observations in interstellar clouds and therefore a better estimation of its abundance in these environments. While the ro-vibrational spectroscopy of H$_2$Cl$^+$ is well known, the studies of its collisional excitation are rather limited and these are available for the interaction with helium atoms only. We provide a new 5-dimensional rigid-rotor potential energy surface for the interaction of H$_2$Cl$^+$ with H$_2$, calculated from explicitly correlated coupled cluster ab initio theory, which was fitted then with a set of analytical functions, allowing to perform scattering calculations using accurate quantum theories. We analyze the collision-energy-dependence of the rotational state-to-state cross sections and the temperature dependence of the corresponding thermal rate coefficients, with a particular attention on the collisional propensity rules. When comparing our results for collisions with H$_2$ with those obtained with He as a colliding partner, we found very significant differences with non-linear scaling trends, which proves again that He is not a suitable proxy for collisions between hydride molecules and molecular hydrogen, the most abundant gas particle in the interstellar medium.</description>

      <title>MPI-Rockstar: a Hybrid MPI and OpenMP Parallel Implementation of the Rockstar Halo finder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18629v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: MPI-Rockstar is a massively parallel halo finder based on the Rockstar phase-space temporal halo finder code, which is one of the most extensively used halo finding codes. Compared to the original code, parallelized by a primitive socket communication library, we parallelized it in a hybrid way using MPI and OpenMP, which is suitable for analysis on the hybrid shared and distributed memory environments of modern supercomputers. This implementation can easily handle the analysis of more than a trillion particles on more than 100,000 parallel processes, enabling the production of a huge dataset for the next generation of cosmological surveys. As new functions to the original Rockstar code, MPI-Rockstar supports HDF5 as an output format and can output additional halo properties such as the inertia tensor.</description>

      <title>COMAP Pathfinder -- Season 2 results I. Improved data selection and processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07510v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The CO Mapping Array Project (COMAP) Pathfinder is performing line intensity mapping of CO emission to trace the distribution of unresolved galaxies at redshift $z \sim 3$. We present an improved version of the COMAP data processing pipeline and apply this to the first two seasons of observations. This analysis improves on the COMAP Early Science (ES) results in several key aspects. On the observational side, all second season scans were made in constant-elevation mode, after noting that the previous Lissajous scans were associated with increased systematic errors; those scans accounted for 50% of the total Season 1 data volume. Secondly, all new observations were restricted to an elevation range of 35-65 degrees, to minimize sidelobe ground pickup. On the data processing side, more effective data cleaning in both the time- and map-domain has allowed us to eliminate all data-driven power spectrum-based cuts. This increases the overall data retention and reduces the risk of signal subtraction bias. On the other hand, due to the increased sensitivity, two new pointing-correlated systematic errors have emerged, and we introduce a new map-domain PCA filter to suppress these. Subtracting only 5 out of 256 PCA modes, we find that the standard deviation of the cleaned maps decreases by 67% on large angular scales, and after applying this filter, the maps appear consistent with instrumental noise. Combining all these improvements, we find that each hour of raw Season 2 observations yields on average 3.2 times more cleaned data compared to ES analysis. Combining this with the increase in raw observational hours, the effective amount of data available for high-level analysis is a factor of 8 higher than in ES. The resulting maps have reached an uncertainty of $25$-$50\,\mu K$ per voxel, providing by far the strongest constraints on cosmological CO line emission published to date.</description>

Abstract: Relativistic corrections are essential for time transformations between geocentric, solar system barycentric, and luni-centric reference systems to account for differences in gravitational potential and relative motion. As the primary reference for Earth-based systems, Terrestrial Time (TT) provides the foundation for precise synchronization across spatial and temporal frameworks. To ensure consistency with TT, Barycentric Dynamical Time (TDB) must exhibit no average rate difference from TT. Although the International Astronomical Union (IAU) has established resolutions for transformations between TT and TDB, extending these frameworks to define a lunar surface time scale (TL) is essential for advancing lunar exploration. This paper derives the (TL - TT) transformation, quantifying a secular drift of 56.0256 us/day and periodic terms, with the largest amplitude of ~0.470 us at the mean anomalistic period. Additionally, the TT-compatible spatial scale and Lorentz contraction of Moon-centered positional coordinates are computed, achieving sub-nanosecond timing precision. These transformations, implemented in JPL ephemeris generation software, provide a robust framework for high-fidelity relativistic models of lunar timekeeping, enabling further refinements and supporting navigation, communication, and scientific operations in cis-lunar space.</description>
