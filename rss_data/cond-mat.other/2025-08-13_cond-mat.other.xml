      <title>Pressure dynamics in the bottleneck flow of self-propelled particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an experimental investigation of the pressure dynamics during the flow of self-propelled particles through narrow passages. When the ensemble is flowing, pressure fluctuates around a constant value that does not depend on the crowd size, suggesting that the orifice locally determines the dynamics in this scenario. On the contrary, when the system clogs, pressures are higher for larger crowd sizes, highlighting the importance of the whole collectivity in the process. Then, by correlating the pressure evolution with the exit time of the self-propelled particles, we discover that when a clog is resolved, pressure suddenly drops as a consequence of system reorganization. After this dramatic event, there is a sustained pressure growth over time that shows a square root dependence, compatible with the structural aging that has been proposed to be behind the broad tail distributions of clogging times.</description>

      <title>Translation Groups for arbitrary Gauge Fields in Synthetic Crystals with real hopping amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Cayley-crystals introduced in [F. R. Lux and E. Prodan, Annales Henri Poincar\'e 25(8), 3563 (2024)] are a class of synthetic lattices whose Hamiltonians are symmetric under the simply transitive action of a generic discrete group G. We show that these systems naturally realize the generalization of the so-called magnetic translation groups to arbitrary discrete gauge groups. The one-body dynamics mimics that of a particle carrying multiple charges, each experiencing a distinct static gauge-field configuration. The possible types of gauge fields are determined by the irreducible representations of the commutator subgroup C of G, while the Wilson-loop configurations - which need not be homogeneous - are fixed by the embedding of C in G. We analyze in depth the role of other subgroups in shaping both the lattice geometry and the dynamics. For engineering relevance, we discuss a theorem that constructs all Cayley-crystals for a given abelian gauge group, and we provide two-dimensional examples corresponding to crystals threaded by inhomogeneous magnetic fluxes. Moreover, Cayley-crystals can be realized with only real hopping amplitudes and in scalable geometries that can fit higher-than-3D dynamics, enabling experimental exploration and eventual exploitation in metamaterials, cQED, and other synthetic platforms.</description>

      <title>Finite-dimensional approximations of generalized squeezing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09041v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show unexpected behaviour in simulations of generalized squeezing performed with finite-dimensional truncations of the Fock space: even for extremely large dimension of the state space, the results depend on whether the truncation dimension is even or odd. This situation raises the question whether the simulation results are physically meaningful. We demonstrate that, in fact, the two truncation schemes correspond to two well-defined, distinct unitary evolutions whose generators are defined on different subsets of the infinite-dimensional Fock space. This is a consequence of the fact that the generalized squeezing Hamiltonian is not self-adjoint on states with finite excitations, but possesses multiple self-adjoint extensions. Furthermore, we present results on the spectrum of the squeezing operators corresponding to even and odd truncation size that elucidate the properties of the two different self-adjoint extensions corresponding to the even and odd truncation scheme. To make the squeezing operator applicable to a physical system, we must regularize it by other terms that depend on the specifics of the experimental implementation. We show that the addition of a Kerr interaction term in the Hamiltonian leads to uniquely converging simulations, with no dependence on the parity of the truncation size, and demonstrate that the Kerr term indeed renders the Hamiltonian self-adjoint and thus physically interpretable.</description>
