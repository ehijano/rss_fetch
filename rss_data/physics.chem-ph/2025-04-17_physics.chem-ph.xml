      <title>Can Charge Transfer Across C-H...O Hydrogen Bonds Stabilize Oil Droplets in Water?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Oil-water emulsions resist aggregation due to the presence of negative charges at their surface that leads to mutual repulsion between droplets, but the molecular origin of oil charge is currently under debate. While much evidence has suggested that hydroxide ions must accumulate at the interface, an alternative perspective attributes the negative charge on the oil droplet to not an ionic species, but charge transfer of electron density from water to oil molecules. While the charge transfer mechanism is consistent with the correct sign of oil charge based on electrophoresis experiments, it is just as important to provide good estimates of the magnitude of the negative charge to explain emulsion stability. Here we show using energy decomposition analysis that the amount of net flow of charge from water to oil is negligibly small due to nearly equal forward and backward charge transfer through weak oil-water interactions, such that oil droplets would be unstable and coalesce, contrary to experiment. The lack of charge transfer also explains why vibrational sum frequency scattering reports a blue shift in the oil C-H frequency when forming emulsions with water, which arises from Pauli repulsion due to localized confinement at the interface.</description>

      <title>Ammonia Synthesis under Ambient Conditions: Insights into Water-Nitrogen-Magnetite Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: New routes for transforming nitrogen into ammonia at ambient conditions would be a milestone toward an energy efficient and economically attractive production route in comparison to the traditional Haber-Bosch process. Recently, the synthesis of ammonia from water and nitrogen at room temperature and atmospheric pressure has been reported to be catalyzed by Fe3O4 at the air-water interface. By integrating ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and ab initio molecular dynamics and free energy calculations, we investigate the underlying reaction mechanisms governing ammonia and hydrazine formation at the water/Fe3O4/nanoparticle interface, laying the fundamental groundwork for future advancements in environmentally benign ammonia synthesis.</description>

      <title>Gas-solid Reaction Dynamics on Li$_6$PS$_5$Cl Surfaces: A Case Study of the Influence of CO$_2$ and CO$_2$/O$_2$ Atmospheres Using AIMD and MLFF Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, rapid progress has been made in solid-state lithium batteries. Among various technologies, coating the surface of electrodes or electrolytes has proven to be an effective method to enhance interfacial stability and improve battery cycling performance. Recent experimental studies showed that gas-solid reactions offer a convenient approach to form modified coating layers on the solid electrolyte. Here, we performed computational simulations to investigate this surface reaction process. Specifically, we simulated the gas-solid reactions of Li$_6$PS$_5$Cl(LPSC) solid-state electrolytes in pure CO$_2$ and in mixed CO$_2$/O$_2$ atmospheres using ab-initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) and machine-learning force fields (MLFF)-accelerated molecular dynamics (MD) approaches. In the former case, LPSC surfaces primarily form Li$_2$CO$_2$S because it is difficult to dissociate another oxygen atom from the second CO$_2$ molecule. While in CO$_2$/O$_2$ mixed atmosphere, O$_2$ molecules preferentially adsorb onto LPSC, which supplies oxygen sites for subsequent CO$_2$ adsorption to form carbonate -CO$_3$ units. This reaction pathway ultimately generates an interfacial product dominated by Li$_2$CO$_3$. These coatings exhibit distinct electronic and ionic conductivity characteristics, allowing the possibility to control coating compositions and configurations by adjusting the gas-solid reactions. Key criteria for applying this strategy are extracted from the current research.</description>

      <title>Anharmonic infrared spectra of cationic pyrene and superhydrogenated derivatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studying the anharmonicity in the infrared (IR) spectra of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) at elevated temperatures is important to understand vibrational features and chemical properties of interstellar dust, especially in the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) era. We take pyrene as an example PAH and investigate how different degrees of superhydrogenation affects the applicability of the harmonic approximation and the role of temperature in IR spectra of PAHs. This is achieved by comparing theoretical IR spectra generated by classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and experimental IR spectra obtained via gas-phase action spectroscopy which utilizes the Infrared Multiple Photon Dissociation (IRMPD). All simulations are accelerated by a machine learning interatomic potential, in order to reach first principle accuracies while keeping low computational costs. We have found that the harmonic approximation with empirical scaling factors is able to reproduce experimental band profile of pristine and partially superhydrogenated pyrene cations. However, a MD-based anharmonic treatment is mandatory in the case of fully superhydrogenated pyrene cation for matching theory and experiment. In addition, band shifts and broadenings as the temperature increases are investigated in detail. Those findings may aid in the interpretation of JWST observations on the variations in band positions and widths of interstellar dust.</description>

      <title>Lifelong and Universal Machine Learning Potentials for Chemical Reaction Network Explorations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent developments in computational chemistry facilitate the automated quantum chemical exploration of chemical reaction networks for the in-silico prediction of synthesis pathways, yield, and selectivity. However, the underlying quantum chemical energy calculations require vast computational resources, limiting these explorations severely in practice. Machine learning potentials (MLPs) offer a solution to increase computational efficiency, while retaining the accuracy of reliable first-principles data used for their training. Unfortunately, MLPs will be limited in their generalization ability within chemical (reaction) space, if the underlying training data is not representative for a given application. Within the framework of automated reaction network exploration, where new reactants or reagents composed of any elements from the periodic table can be introduced, this lack of generalizability will be the rule rather than the exception. Here, we therefore study the benefits and drawbacks of two MLP concepts in this context. Whereas universal MLPs are designed to cover most of the relevant chemical space in their training, lifelong MLPs push their adaptability by efficient continual learning of additional data. While the accuracy of the universal MLPs turns out to be not yet sufficient for reaction search trials without any fine-tuning, lifelong MLPs can reach chemical accuracy. We propose an improved learning algorithm for lifelong adaptive data selection yielding efficient integration of new data while previous expertise is preserved.</description>

      <title>Diagrammatic Simplification of Linearized Coupled Cluster Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linearized Coupled Cluster Doubles (LinCCD) often provides near-singular energies in small-gap systems that exhibit static correlation. This has been attributed to the lack of quadratic $T_2^2$ terms that typically balance out small energy denominators in the CCD amplitude equations. Herein, I show that exchange contributions to ring and crossed-ring contractions (not small denominators per se) cause the divergent behavior of LinCC(S)D approaches. Rather than omitting exchange terms, I recommend a regular and size-consistent method that retains only linear ladder diagrams. As LinCCD and configuration interaction doubles (CID) equations are isomorphic, this also implies that simplification (rather than quadratic extensions) of CID amplitude equations can lead to a size-consistent theory. Linearized ladder CCD (LinLCCD) is robust in statically-correlated systems and can be made $O(n_{\text{occ}}^4n_{\text{vir}}^2)$ with a hole-hole approximation. The relationship between LinLCCD and random-phase approximation sets the stage for the development of next-generation double-hybrid density functionals that can describe static correlation.</description>

      <title>Accurate Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials for Polyacene Molecular Crystals: Application to Single Molecule Host-Guest Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emerging machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) offer a promising solution for large-scale accurate material simulations, but stringent tests related to the description of vibrational dynamics in molecular crystals remain scarce. Here, we develop a general MLIP by leveraging the graph neural network-based MACE architecture and active-learning strategies to accurately capture vibrational dynamics across a range of polyacene-based molecular crystals, namely naphthalene, anthracene, tetracene and pentacene. Through careful error propagation, we show that these potentials are accurate and enable the study of anharmonic vibrational features, vibrational lifetimes, and vibrational coupling. In particular, we investigate large-scale host-guest systems based on these molecular crystals, showing the capacity of molecular-dynamics-based techniques to explain and quantify vibrational coupling between host and guest nuclear motion. Our results establish a framework for understanding vibrational signatures in large-scale complex molecular systems and thus represent an important step for engineering vibrational interactions in molecular environments.</description>

      <title>FEAT: Free energy Estimators with Adaptive Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Free energy Estimators with Adaptive Transport (FEAT), a novel framework for free energy estimation -- a critical challenge across scientific domains. FEAT leverages learned transports implemented via stochastic interpolants and provides consistent, minimum-variance estimators based on escorted Jarzynski equality and controlled Crooks theorem, alongside variational upper and lower bounds on free energy differences. Unifying equilibrium and non-equilibrium methods under a single theoretical framework, FEAT establishes a principled foundation for neural free energy calculations. Experimental validation on toy examples, molecular simulations, and quantum field theory demonstrates improvements over existing learning-based methods.</description>

      <title>Generative Deep Learning Framework for Inverse Design of Fuels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present work, a generative deep learning framework combining a Co-optimized Variational Autoencoder (Co-VAE) architecture with quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) techniques is developed to enable accelerated inverse design of fuels. The Co-VAE integrates a property prediction component coupled with the VAE latent space, enhancing molecular reconstruction and accurate estimation of Research Octane Number (RON) (chosen as the fuel property of interest). A subset of the GDB-13 database, enriched with a curated RON database, is used for model training. Hyperparameter tuning is further utilized to optimize the balance among reconstruction fidelity, chemical validity, and RON prediction. An independent regression model is then used to refine RON prediction, while a differential evolution algorithm is employed to efficiently navigate the VAE latent space and identify promising fuel molecule candidates with high RON. This methodology addresses the limitations of traditional fuel screening approaches by capturing complex structure-property relationships within a comprehensive latent representation. The generative model provides a flexible tool for systematically exploring vast chemical spaces, paving the way for discovering fuels with superior anti-knock properties. The demonstrated approach can be readily extended to incorporate additional fuel properties and synthesizability criteria to enhance applicability and reliability for de novo design of new fuels.</description>

      <title>Max-Cut graph-driven quantum circuit design for planar spin glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finding the ground state of spin glasses is a challenging problem with broad implications. Many hard optimization problems, including NP-complete problems, can be mapped, for instance, to the Ising spin glass model. We present a graph-based approach that allows for accurate state initialization of a frustrated triangular spin-lattice with up to 20 sites that stays away from barren plateaus. To optimize circuit efficiency and trainability, we employ a clustering strategy that organizes qubits into distinct groups based on the maximum cut technique, which divides the lattice into two subsets maximally disconnected. We provide evidence that this Max-Cut-based lattice division offers a robust framework for optimizing circuit design and effectively modeling frustrated systems at polynomial cost. All simulations are performed within the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) formalism, the current paradigm for noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ), but can be extended beyond. Our results underscore the potential of hybrid quantum-classical methods in addressing complex optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Exploring Intrinsic Bond Orbitals in Solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18212v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a study of the construction and spatial properties of localized Wannier orbitals in large supercells of insulating solids using plane waves as the underlying basis. The Pipek-Mezey (PM) functional in combination with intrinsic atomic orbitals (IAOs) as projectors is employed, resulting in so-called intrinsic bond orbitals (IBOs). Independent of the bonding type and band gap, a correlation between orbital spreads and geometric properties is observed. As a result, comparable sparsity patterns of the Hartree-Fock exchange matrix are found across all considered bulk 3D materials, exhibiting covalent bonds, polar covalent bonds, and ionic bonds. Recognizing the considerable computational effort required to construct localized Wannier orbitals for large periodic simulation cells, we address the performance and scaling of different solvers for the localization problem. This includes the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS), Conjugate-Gradient (CG), Steepest Ascent (SA) as well as the Direct Inversion in the Iterative Subspace (DIIS) method. Each algorithm performs a Riemannian optimization under unitary matrix constraint, efficiently reaching the optimum in the "curved parameter space" on geodesics. We hereby complement the quantum chemistry and materials science literature with an introduction to this topic along with key references. The solvers have been implemented both within the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) and as a standalone open-source software package. Furthermore, we observe that the construction of Wannier orbitals for supercells of metal oxides presents a significant challenge, requiring approximately one order of magnitude more iteration steps than other systems studied.</description>

      <title>Is fixed-node diffusion quantum Monte Carlo reproducible?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12950v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fixed-node diffusion quantum Monte Carlo (FN-DMC) is a widely-trusted many-body method for solving the Schr\"{o}dinger equation, known for its reliable predictions of material and molecular properties. Furthermore, its excellent scalability with system complexity and near-perfect utilization of computational power makes FN-DMC ideally positioned to leverage new advances in computing to address increasingly complex scientific problems. Even though the method is widely used as a computational gold standard, reproducibility across the numerous FN-DMC code implementations has yet to be demonstrated. This difficulty stems from the diverse array of DMC algorithms and trial wave functions, compounded by the method's inherent stochastic nature. This study represents a community-wide effort to address the titular question, affirming that: Yes, FN-DMC is reproducible (when handled with care). Using the water-methane dimer as the canonical test case, we compare results from eleven different FN-DMC codes and show that the approximations to treat the non-locality of pseudopotentials are the primary source of the discrepancies between them. In particular, we demonstrate that, for the same choice of determinantal component in the trial wave function, reliable and reproducible predictions can be achieved by employing the T-move (TM), the determinant locality approximation (DLA), or the determinant T-move (DTM) schemes, while the older locality approximation (LA) leads to considerable variability in results. This work lays the foundation to establish accurate and reproducible FN-DMC estimates for all future studies across applications in materials science, physics, chemistry, and biology.</description>
