      <title>Self-Supervised Score-Based Despeckling for SAR Imagery via Log-Domain Transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The speckle noise inherent in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery significantly degrades image quality and complicates subsequent analysis. Given that SAR speckle is multiplicative and Gamma-distributed, effectively despeckling SAR imagery remains challenging. This paper introduces a novel self-supervised framework for SAR image despeckling based on score-based generative models operating in the transformed log domain. We first transform the data into the log-domain and then convert the speckle noise residuals into an approximately additive Gaussian distribution. This step enables the application of score-based models, which are trained in the transformed domain using a self-supervised objective. This objective allows our model to learn the clean underlying signal by training on further corrupted versions of the input data itself. Consequently, our method exhibits significantly shorter inference times compared to many existing self-supervised techniques, offering a robust and practical solution for SAR image restoration.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Deformable Image Registration with Local-Global Attention and Image Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deformable image registration is a critical technology in medical image analysis, with broad applications in clinical practice such as disease diagnosis, multi-modal fusion, and surgical navigation. Traditional methods often rely on iterative optimization, which is computationally intensive and lacks generalizability. Recent advances in deep learning have introduced attention-based mechanisms that improve feature alignment, yet accurately registering regions with high anatomical variability remains challenging. In this study, we proposed a novel unsupervised deformable image registration framework, LGANet++, which employs a novel local-global attention mechanism integrated with a unique technique for feature interaction and fusion to enhance registration accuracy, robustness, and generalizability. We evaluated our approach using five publicly available datasets, representing three distinct registration scenarios: cross-patient, cross-time, and cross-modal CT-MR registration. The results demonstrated that our approach consistently outperforms several state-of-the-art registration methods, improving registration accuracy by 1.39% in cross-patient registration, 0.71% in cross-time registration, and 6.12% in cross-modal CT-MR registration tasks. These results underscore the potential of LGANet++ to support clinical workflows requiring reliable and efficient image registration.

      <title>Partial Decoder Attention Network with Contour-weighted Loss Function for Data-Imbalance Medical Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image segmentation is pivotal in medical image analysis, facilitating clinical diagnosis, treatment planning, and disease evaluation. Deep learning has significantly advanced automatic segmentation methodologies by providing superior modeling capability for complex structures and fine-grained anatomical regions. However, medical images often suffer from data imbalance issues, such as large volume disparities among organs or tissues, and uneven sample distributions across different anatomical structures. This imbalance tends to bias the model toward larger organs or more frequently represented structures, while overlooking smaller or less represented structures, thereby affecting the segmentation accuracy and robustness. To address these challenges, we proposed a novel contour-weighted segmentation approach, which improves the model's capability to represent small and underrepresented structures. We developed PDANet, a lightweight and efficient segmentation network based on a partial decoder mechanism. We evaluated our method using three prominent public datasets. The experimental results show that our methodology excelled in three distinct tasks: segmenting multiple abdominal organs, brain tumors, and pelvic bone fragments with injuries. It consistently outperformed nine state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the proposed contour-weighted strategy improved segmentation for other comparison methods across the three datasets, yielding average enhancements in Dice scores of 2.32%, 1.67%, and 3.60%, respectively. These results demonstrate that our contour-weighted segmentation method surpassed current leading approaches in both accuracy and robustness. As a model-independent strategy, it can seamlessly fit various segmentation frameworks, enhancing their performance. This flexibility highlighted its practical importance and potential for broad use in medical image analysis.</description>

      <title>LiNUS: Lightweight Automatic Segmentation of Deep Brain Nuclei for Real-Time DBS Surgery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes LiNUS, a lightweight deep learning framework for the automatic segmentation of the Subthalamic Nucleus (STN) in Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) surgery. Addressing the challenges of small target volume and class imbalance in MRI data, LiNUS improves upon the U-Net architecture by introducing spectral normalization constraints, bilinear interpolation upsampling, and a multi-scale feature fusion mechanism. Experimental results on the Tsinghua DBS dataset (TT14) demonstrate that LiNUS achieves a Dice coefficient of 0.679 with an inference time of only 0.05 seconds per subject, significantly outperforming traditional manual and registration-based methods. Further validation on high-resolution data confirms the model's robustness, achieving a Dice score of 0.89. A dedicated Graphical User Interface (GUI) was also developed to facilitate real-time clinical application.</description>

      <title>Filtered 2D Contour-Based Reconstruction of 3D STL Model from CT-DICOM Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconstructing a 3D Stereo-lithography (STL) Model from 2D Contours of scanned structure in Digital Imaging and Communication in Medicine (DICOM) images is crucial to understand the geometry and deformity. Computed Tomography (CT) images are processed to enhance the contrast, reduce the noise followed by smoothing. The processed CT images are segmented using thresholding technique. 2D contour data points are extracted from segmented CT images and are used to construct 3D STL Models. The 2D contour data points may contain outliers as a result of segmentation of low resolution images and the geometry of the constructed 3D structure deviate from the actual. To cope with the imperfections in segmentation process, in this work we propose to use filtered 2D contour data points to reconstruct 3D STL Model. The filtered 2D contour points of each image are delaunay triangulated and joined layer-by-layer to reconstruct the 3D STL model. The 3D STL Model reconstruction is verified on i) 2D Data points of basic shapes and ii) Region of Interest (ROI) of human pelvic bone and are presented as case studies. The 3D STL model constructed from 2D contour data points of ROI of segmented pelvic bone with and without filtering are presented. The 3D STL model reconstructed from filtered 2D data points improved the geometry of model compared to the model reconstructed without filtering 2D data points.</description>

      <title>Vision Models for Medical Imaging: A Hybrid Approach for PCOS Detection from Ultrasound Scans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is the most familiar endocrine illness in women of reproductive age. Many Bangladeshi women suffer from PCOS disease in their older age. The aim of our research is to identify effective vision-based medical image analysis techniques and evaluate hybrid models for the accurate detection of PCOS. We introduced two novel hybrid models combining convolutional and transformer-based approaches. The training and testing data were organized into two categories: "infected" (PCOS-positive) and "noninfected" (healthy ovaries). In the initial stage, our first hybrid model, 'DenConST' (integrating DenseNet121, Swin Transformer, and ConvNeXt), achieved 85.69% accuracy. The final optimized model, 'DenConREST' (incorporating Swin Transformer, ConvNeXt, DenseNet121, ResNet18, and EfficientNetV2), demonstrated superior performance with 98.23% accuracy. Among all evaluated models, DenConREST showed the best performance. This research highlights an efficient solution for PCOS detection from ultrasound images, significantly improving diagnostic accuracy while reducing detection errors.</description>

      <title>Large-Scale Label Quality Assessment for Medical Segmentation via a Vision-Language Judge and Synthetic Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-scale medical segmentation datasets often combine manual and pseudo-labels of uneven quality, which can compromise training and evaluation. Low-quality labels may hamper performance and make the model training less robust. To address this issue, we propose SegAE (Segmentation Assessment Engine), a lightweight vision-language model (VLM) that automatically predicts label quality across 142 anatomical structures. Trained on over four million image-label pairs with quality scores, SegAE achieves a high correlation coefficient of 0.902 with ground-truth Dice similarity and evaluates a 3D mask in 0.06s. SegAE shows several practical benefits: (I) Our analysis reveals widespread low-quality labeling across public datasets; (II) SegAE improves data efficiency and training performance in active and semi-supervised learning, reducing dataset annotation cost by one-third and quality-checking time by 70% per label. This tool provides a simple and effective solution for quality control in large-scale medical segmentation datasets. The dataset, model weights, and codes are released at https://github.com/Schuture/SegAE.</description>

      <title>XD-MAP: Cross-Modal Domain Adaptation using Semantic Parametric Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Until open-world foundation models match the performance of specialized approaches, the effectiveness of deep learning models remains heavily dependent on dataset availability. Training data must align not only with the target object categories but also with the sensor characteristics and modalities. To bridge the gap between available datasets and deployment domains, domain adaptation strategies are widely used. In this work, we propose a novel approach to transferring sensor-specific knowledge from an image dataset to LiDAR, an entirely different sensing domain. Our method XD-MAP leverages detections from a neural network on camera images to create a semantic parametric map. The map elements are modeled to produce pseudo labels in the target domain without any manual annotation effort. Unlike previous domain transfer approaches, our method does not require direct overlap between sensors and enables extending the angular perception range from a front-view camera to a full 360 view. On our large-scale road feature dataset, XD-MAP outperforms single shot baseline approaches by +19.5 mIoU for 2D semantic segmentation, +19.5 PQth for 2D panoptic segmentation, and +32.3 mIoU in 3D semantic segmentation. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach achieving strong performance on LiDAR data without any manual labeling.</description>

      <title>Field-Space Autoencoder for Scalable Climate Emulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kilometer-scale Earth system models are essential for capturing local climate change. However, these models are computationally expensive and produce petabyte-scale outputs, which limits their utility for applications such as probabilistic risk assessment. Here, we present the Field-Space Autoencoder, a scalable climate emulation framework based on a spherical compression model that overcomes these challenges. By utilizing Field-Space Attention, the model efficiently operates on native climate model output and therefore avoids geometric distortions caused by forcing spherical data onto Euclidean grids. This approach preserves physical structures significantly better than convolutional baselines. By producing a structured compressed field, it serves as a good baseline for downstream generative emulation. In addition, the model can perform zero-shot super-resolution that maps low-resolution large ensembles and scarce high-resolution data into a shared representation. We train a generative diffusion model on these compressed fields. The model can simultaneously learn internal variability from abundant low-resolution data and fine-scale physics from sparse high-resolution data. Our work bridges the gap between the high volume of low-resolution ensemble statistics and the scarcity of high-resolution physical detail.</description>

      <title>Weakly-supervised segmentation using inherently-explainable classification models and their application to brain tumour classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.05148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.05148v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep learning has demonstrated significant potential in medical imaging; however, the opacity of "black-box" models hinders clinical trust, while segmentation tasks typically necessitate labourious, hard-to-obtain pixel-wise annotations. To address these challenges simultaneously, this paper introduces a framework for three inherently explainable classifiers (GP-UNet, GP-ShuffleUNet, and GP-ReconResNet). By integrating a global pooling mechanism, these networks generate localisation heatmaps that directly influence classification decisions, offering inherent interpretability without relying on potentially unreliable post-hoc methods. These heatmaps are subsequently thresholded to achieve weakly-supervised segmentation, requiring only image-level classification labels for training. Validated on two datasets for multi-class brain tumour classification, the proposed models achieved a peak F1-score of 0.93. For the weakly-supervised segmentation task, a median Dice score of 0.728 (95% CI 0.715-0.739) was recorded. Notably, on a subset of tumour-only images, the best model achieved an accuracy of 98.7%, outperforming state-of-the-art glioma grading binary classifiers. Furthermore, comparative Precision-Recall analysis validated the framework's robustness against severe class imbalance, establishing a direct correlation between diagnostic confidence and segmentation fidelity. These results demonstrate that the proposed framework successfully combines high diagnostic accuracy with essential transparency, offering a promising direction for trustworthy clinical decision support.

      <title>A Dynamic Prognostic Prediction Method for Colorectal Cancer Liver Metastasis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03123v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Colorectal cancer liver metastasis (CRLM) exhibits high postoperative recurrence and pronounced prognostic heterogeneity, challenging individualized management. Existing prognostic approaches often rely on static representations from a single postoperative snapshot, and fail to jointly capture tumor spatial distribution, longitudinal disease dynamics, and multimodal clinical information, limiting predictive accuracy. We propose DyPro, a deep learning framework that infers postoperative latent trajectories via residual dynamic evolution. Starting from an initial patient representation, DyPro generates a 12-step sequence of trajectory snapshots through autoregressive residual updates and integrates them to predict recurrence and survival outcomes. On the MSKCC CRLM dataset, DyPro achieves strong discrimination under repeated stratified 5-fold cross-validation, reaching a C-index of 0.755 for OS and 0.714 for DFS, with OS AUC@1y of 0.920 and OS IBS of 0.143. DyPro provides quantitative risk cues to support adjuvant therapy planning and follow-up scheduling.</description>

      <title>Ultra-Strong Gradient Diffusion MRI with Self-Supervised Learning for Prostate Cancer Characterization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03196v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion MRI (dMRI) enables non-invasive assessment of prostate microstructure but conventional dMRI metrics such as the Apparent Diffusion Coefficient in multiparametric MRI and reflect a mixture of underlying tissues features rather than distinct histologic characteristics. Integrating dMRI with the compartment-based biophysical VERDICT (Vascular, Extracellular, and Restricted Diffusion for Cytometry in Tumours) framework offers richer microstructural insights, though clinical gradient systems (40-80 mT/m) often suffer from poor signal-to-noise ratio at stronger diffusion weightings due to prolonged echo times. Ultra-strong gradients (e.g., 300 mT/m) can mitigate these limitations by improving SNR and contrast-to-noise ratios. This study investigates whether physics-informed self-supervised VERDICT (ssVERDICT) fitting when combined with ultra-strong gradient data, enhances prostate microstructural characterization relative to current fitting approaches and clinical gradient systems. We developed enhanced ssVERDICT fitting approaches using dense multilayer perceptron and convolutional U-Net architectures, comparing them against non-linear least-squares (NLLS) VERDICT fitting, original ssVERDICT implementation, and Diffusion Kurtosis Imaging across clinical- to ultra-strong gradient systems. For the same ultra-strong gradient data, Dense ssVERDICT outperformed NLLS VERDICT, boosting median CNR by 47%, cutting inter-patient Coefficient of Variation by 52%, and reducing pooled $f_{ic}$ variation by 50%. Overall, Dense ssVERDICT delivered the highest CNR, the most stable parameter estimates, and the clearest tumour-normal contrast compared with conventional fitting methods and clinical gradient systems. These findings underscore that meaningful gains in non-invasive prostate cancer characterization arise from the combination of advanced gradient systems and deep learning-based modelling.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Network Reveals the Local Cortical Morphology of Brain Aging in Normal Cognition and Alzheimers Disease</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10912v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Estimating brain age (BA) from T1-weighted magnetic resonance images (MRIs) provides a useful approach to map the anatomic features of brain senescence. Whereas global BA (GBA) summarizes overall brain health, local BA (LBA) can reveal spatially localized patterns of aging. Although previous studies have examined anatomical contributors to GBA, no framework has been established to compute LBA using cortical morphology. To address this gap, we introduce a novel graph neural network (GNN) that uses morphometric features (cortical thickness, curvature, surface area, gray/white matter intensity ratio and sulcal depth) to estimate LBA across the cortical surface at high spatial resolution (mean inter-vertex distance = 1.37 mm). Trained on cortical surface meshes extracted from the MRIs of cognitively normal adults (N = 14,250), our GNN identifies prefrontal and parietal association cortices as early sites of morphometric aging, in concordance with biological theories of brain aging. Feature comparison using integrated gradients reveals that morphological aging is driven primarily by changes in surface area (gyral crowns and highly folded regions) and cortical thickness (occipital lobes), with additional contributions from gray/white matter intensity ratio (frontal lobes and sulcal troughs) and curvature (sulcal troughs). In Alzheimers disease (AD), as expected, the model identifies widespread, excessive morphological aging in parahippocampal gyri and related temporal structures. Significant associations are found between regional LBA gaps and neuropsychological measures descriptive of AD-related cognitive impairment, suggesting an intimate relationship between morphological cortical aging and cognitive decline. These results highlight the ability of GNN-derived gero-morphometry to provide insights into local brain aging.</description>

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of brain tumors is essential for clinical diagnosis and treatment planning. Deep learning is currently the state-of-the-art for brain tumor segmentation, yet it requires either large datasets or extensive computational resources that are inaccessible in most areas. This makes the problem increasingly difficult: state-of-the-art models use thousands of training cases and vast computational power, where performance drops sharply when either is limited. The top performer in the Brats GLI 2023 competition relied on supercomputers trained on over 92,000 augmented MRI scans using an AMD EPYC 7402 CPU, six NVIDIA RTX 6000 GPUs (48GB VRAM each), and 1024GB of RAM over multiple weeks. To address this, the Karhunen--Lo\`eve Expansion (KLE) was implemented as a feature extraction step on downsampled, z-score normalized MRI volumes. Each 240$\times$240$\times$155 multi-modal scan is reduced to four $48^3$ channels and compressed into 32 KL coefficients. The resulting approximate reconstruction enables a residual-based anomaly map, which is upsampled and added as a fifth channel to a compact 3D U-Net. All experiments were run on a consumer workstation (AMD Ryzen 5 7600X CPU, RTX 4060Ti (8GB VRAM), and 64GB RAM while using far fewer training cases. This model achieves post-processed Dice scores of 0.929 (WT), 0.856 (TC), and 0.821 (ET), with HD95 distances of 2.93, 6.78, and 10.35 voxels. These results are significantly better than the winning BraTS 2023 methodology for HD95 distances and WT dice scores. This demonstrates that a KLE-based residual anomaly map can dramatically reduce computational cost and data requirements while retaining state-of-the-art performance.</description>
