      <title>Weighted norm estimates of noncommutative Calder\'{o}n-Zygmund operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to studying weighted endpoint estimates of operator-valued singular integrals. Our main results include weighted weak-type $(1,1)$ estimate of noncommutative maximal Calder\'{o}n-Zygmund operators, corresponding version of square functions and a weighted $H_1- L_1$ type inequality. All these results are obtained under the condition that the weight belonging to the Muchenhoupt $A_1$ class and certain regularity assumptions imposed on kernels which are weaker than the Lipschitz condition.</description>

      <title>Sharp Invertibility in Quotient Algebras of $H^\infty$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider inner functions $\Theta$ with the zero set $\mathcal Z(\Theta)$ such that the quotient algebra $H^\infty / \Theta H^\infty$ satisfies the Strong Invertibility Property (SIP), that is for every $\varepsilon&gt;0$ there exists $\delta&gt;0$ such that the conditions $f \in H^\infty$, $\|[f]\|_{H^\infty/ \Theta H^\infty}=1$, $\inf_{\mathcal Z(\Theta)} |f| \ge 1-\delta$ imply that $[f]$ is invertible in $H^\infty / \Theta H^\infty$ and $\| 1/ [f] \|_{H^\infty/ \Theta H^\infty}\le 1+\varepsilon$. We prove that the SIP is equivalent to the maximal asymptotic growth of $\Theta $ away from its zero set. We also describe inner functions satisfying the SIP in terms of the narrowness of their sublevel sets and relate the SIP to the Weak Embedding Property introduced by P.Gorkin, R.Mortini, and N.Nikolski as well as to inner functions whose Frostman shifts are Carleson--Newman Blaschke products. We finally study divisors of inner functions satisfying the SIP. We describe geometrically the zero set of inner functions such that all its divisors satisfy the SIP. We also prove that a closed subset $E$ of the unit circle is of finite entropy if and only if any singular inner function associated to a singular measure supported on $E$ is a divisor of an inner function satisfying the SIP.</description>

      <title>On the Smoothness of Zero-Extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.13747v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This note investigates the regularity of zero-extensions of $L^p$ functions from bounded domains. Simple examples show the possibility of a loss in smoothness and our goal is to quantify this loss more generally.
  For the unit cube $\mathcal{Q}=[0,1]^d$, one of our main results is a bound for the $L^p$ modulus of continuity of zero-extensions. Using this, we prove that nonconstant functions in the Besov space $B^\alpha_{p,q}(\mathcal{Q})$ have zero-extensions in $B^\beta_{p,r}(\mathbb{R}^d)$ with $\beta=\frac\alpha{\alpha p+1}$ and $r=q(1+\alpha p)$. This seems to be new when $\frac1p\leq\alpha&lt;1$. The key idea behind the main estimate is to use piecewise constant approximation on dyadic subcubes. This technique can likely be sharpened, even for the unit cube, and extended to less regular domains.</description>

      <title>Exact and Efficient Representation of Totally Anti-Symmetric Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05064v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper concerns the long-standing question of representing (totally) anti-symmetric functions in high dimensions. We propose a new ansatz based on the composition of an odd function with a fixed set of anti-symmetric basis functions. We prove that this ansatz can exactly represent every anti-symmetric and continuous function and the number of basis functions has efficient scaling with respect to dimension (number of particles). The singular locus of the anti-symmetric basis functions is precisely identified.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15588v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a real sequence $\{\lambda_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ satisfying $\lambda_n = n + o(1)$, and a Schwartz function $f$ on $\mathbb{R}$, such that for any $N$ the system of translates $\{f(x - \lambda_n)\}$, $n &gt; N$, is complete in the space $L^p(\mathbb{R})$ for every $p&gt;1$. The same system is also complete in a wider class of Banach function spaces on $\mathbb{R}$.</description>

      <title>Self-embedding similitudes of Bedford-McMullen carpets with dependent ratios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02123v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that any non-degenerate Bedford-McMullen carpet does not allow oblique self-embedding similitudes; that is, if $f$ is a similitude sending the carpet into itself, then the image of the $x$-axis under $f$ must be parallel to one of the principal axes. We also establish a logarithmic commensurability result on the contraction ratios of such embeddings. This completes a previous study of Algom and Hochman [Ergod. Th. &amp; Dynam. Sys. 39 (2019), 577--603] on Bedford-McMullen carpets generated by multiplicatively independent exponents, together with a new proof on their non-obliqueness statement.
  For the self-similar case, however, we construct a generalized Sierpinski carpet that is symmetric with respect to an appropriate oblique line and hence allows a reflectional oblique self-embedding. As a complement, we prove that if a generalized Sierpinski carpet satisfies the strong separation condition and permits an oblique rotational self-embedding similitude, then the tangent of the rotation angle takes values $\pm 1$.</description>

      <title>Mean field limits of co-evolutionary signed heterogeneous networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.01742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.01742v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many science phenomena are modelled as interacting particle systems (IPS) coupled on static networks. In reality, network connections are far more dynamic. Connections among individuals receive feedback from nearby individuals and make changes to better adapt to the world. Hence, it is reasonable to model myriad real-world phenomena as co-evolutionary (or adaptive) networks. These networks are used in different areas including telecommunication, neuroscience, computer science, biochemistry, social science, as well as physics, where Kuramoto-type networks have been widely used to model interaction among a set of oscillators. In this paper, we propose a rigorous formulation for limits of a sequence of co-evolutionary Kuramoto oscillators coupled on heterogeneous co-evolutionary networks, which receive both positive and negative feedback from the dynamics of the oscillators on the networks. We show under mild conditions, the mean field limit (MFL) of the co-evolutionary network exists and the sequence of co-evolutionary Kuramoto networks converges to this MFL. Such MFL is described by solutions of a generalized Vlasov equation. We treat the graph limits as signed graph measures, motivated by the recent work in [Kuehn, Xu. Vlasov equations on digraph measures, JDE, 339 (2022), 261--349]. In comparison to the recently emerging works on MFLs of IPS coupled on non-co-evolutionary networks (i.e., static networks or time-dependent networks independent of the dynamics of the IPS), our work seems the first to rigorously address the MFL of a co-evolutionary network model.</description>

      <title>Potential systems with singular $\Phi$-Laplacian</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09090v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We are concerned with solvability of the boundary value problem $$-\left[ \phi(u^{\prime}) \right] ^{\prime}=\nabla_u F(t,u), \quad \left ( \phi \left( u^{\prime }\right)(0), -\phi \left( u^{\prime }\right)(T)\right )\in \partial j(u(0), u(T)),$$ where $\phi$ is a homeomorphism from $B_a$ -- the open ball of radius $a$ centered at $0_{\mathbb{R}^N},$ onto $\mathbb{R}^N$, satisfying $\phi(0_{\mathbb{R}^N})=0_{\mathbb{R}^N}$, $\phi =\nabla \Phi$, with $\Phi: \overline{B}_a \to (-\infty, 0]$ of class $C^1$ on $B_a$, continuous and strictly convex on $\overline{B}_a.$ The potential $F:[0,T] \times \mathbb{R}^N \to \mathbb{R}$ is of class $C^1$ with respect to the second variable and $j:\mathbb{R}^N \times \mathbb{R}^N \rightarrow (-\infty, +\infty]$ is proper, convex and lower semicontinuous. We first provide a variational formulation in the frame of critical point theory for convex, lower semicontinuous perturbations of $C^1$-functionals. Then, taking the advantage of this key step, we obtain existence of minimum energy as well as saddle-point solutions of the problem. Some concrete illustrative examples of applications are provided.</description>

      <title>Explicit Expressions for Iterates of Power Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09809v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present five different formulas for both discrete and fractional iterations of an invertible power series $f$ utilizing a novel and unifying approach from umbral calculus. Established formulas are extended, and their proofs simplified, while new formulas are introduced. In particular, through the use of $q$-calculus identities, we eliminate the requirement for $f'(0)$ to equal $1$ and, consequently, the corresponding new expressions for the iterative logarithm are derived.</description>
