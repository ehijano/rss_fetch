      <title>Unravelling and circumventing failure mechanisms in chalcogenide optical phase change materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chalcogenide optical phase change materials (PCMs) have garnered significant interest for their growing applications in programmable photonics, optical analog computing, active metasurfaces, and beyond. Limited endurance or cycling lifetime is however increasingly becoming a bottleneck toward their practical deployment for these applications. To address this issue, we performed a systematic study elucidating the cycling failure mechanisms of Ge$_2$Sb$_2$Se$_4$Te (GSST), a common optical PCM tailored for infrared photonic applications, in an electrothermal switching configuration commensurate with their applications in on-chip photonic devices. We further propose a set of design rules building on insights into the failure mechanisms, and successfully implemented them to boost the endurance of the GSST device to over 67,000 cycles.</description>

      <title>Photorefractive and pyroelectric photonic memory and long-term stability in thin-film lithium niobate microresonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stability of the integrated photonic circuits is of critical importance for many applications that require high frequency precision or robust operation over time, such as optomechanical sensing, frequency conversion, optical communication, and quantum optics. Photonic memory is useful for low-energy optical computing and interconnects. Thin film lithium niobate (TFLN), as an emerging photonic platform, exhibits complex material properties including pyroelectric (PE) and photorefractive (PR) effects which could lead to intra-device drift and excess noise under different environmental or operating conditions as well as be utilized for building photonic memory. However, the long-term stability and memory effect of its optical properties has not been explored. In this paper, we discovered a long-lived change of optical refractive index as a result of light excitation and temporal temperature variation using Z-cut TFLN microresonators and reveal a strong dependence of the instability with the crystal orientation of the thin film form. The recovery time are measured to be over 10 hours. Leveraging the photonic memory with a long relaxation time, we realize optical trimming of the cavity resonance frequencies. Our result offers insights towards understanding the fundamental noise properties and dynamic behavior of the integrated TFLN material and devices.</description>

      <title>Bayer-type Vis-NIR Routing via Inverse Design for Submicron-pixel Image Sensing Chip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the advent of high-precision nanoscale lithography technology, high-resolution image sensing has experienced rapid development in recent years. Currently, mainstream commercial image sensors predominantly utilize Bayer array color filters to implement RGB colorful imaging strategies. However, as pixel sizes transition into the submicron dimensions, traditional dye filters used in image sensors have long been hampered by limited optical efficiency, suboptimal signal-to-noise ratios, and significant difficulties in miniaturization. In this work, a novel 4-channel RGB-IR color router for image sensing, distinct from the traditional absorption-transmission mechanisms, was proposed through inverse design methodologies. Utilizing genetic algorithms and DCGAN models, approximately 20,000 random color routing structures were generated and trained. From these, an optimized spectral splitting structure with a minimal periodic size of 1.6 um * 1.6 um was identified. This structure achieves peak optical efficiencies 1.7 times greater than those of dye filters, while also offering superior color imaging quality and signal intensity. This innovative design approach, leveraging deep learning integration, demonstrates an on-chip strategy for color realization in 4-channel image sensors, and holds significant promise for enhancing the development of next-generation high-performance image sensing chip systems.</description>

      <title>Exploring angle-dependent Phonon Modes in Sodium Mesitylene Sulfonate (SMS) crystals using THz-time domain polarimetry (THz-TDP)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employed sodium mesitylene sulfonate crystals to investigate angle-dependent phonon resonance and thickness-dependent splitting in THz time-domain polarimetry. This crystal possesses a C2 space group, leading to a repetition pattern after 180deg rotations. Our experimental observations revealed intriguing behaviour: We observed a non-linear response when varying the angle from 10deg to 360deg in both 0.182mm and 1.266mm thick crystals. specifically, at 90deg and 270deg, dip resonance occurred, while at 180deg and 360deg, no phonon resonance was observed. For thick crystals, we observed the splitting of phonon modes. Our findings offer valuable insights into the phononic properties of this crystal as the angle varies.</description>

      <title>Nanocavities for Molecular Optomechanics: their fundamental description and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vibrational Raman scattering -- a process where light exchanges energy with a molecular vibration through inelastic scattering -- is most fundamentally described in a quantum framework where both light and vibration are quantized. When the Raman scatterer is embedded inside a plasmonic nanocavity, as in some sufficiently controlled implementations of surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), the coupled system realizes an optomechanical cavity, where coherent and parametrically amplified light-vibration interaction becomes a resource for vibrational state engineering and nanoscale nonlinear optics. The purpose of this Perspective is to clarify the connection between the languages and parameters used in the fields of molecular cavity optomechanics (McOM) vs. its conventional, `macroscopic' counterpart, and to summarize the main results achieved so far in McOM and the most pressing experimental and theoretical challenges. We aim to make the theoretical framework of molecular cavity optomechanics practically usable for the SERS and nanoplasmonics community at large. While quality factors ($Q$'s) and mode volumes ($V$'s) essentially describe the performance of a nanocavity in enhancing light-matter interaction, we point to the light-cavity coupling efficiencies ($\eta$'s) and optomechanical cooperativities ($\mathcal{C}$'s) as the key parameters for molecular optomechanics. As an illustration of the significance of these quantities, we investigate the feasibility of observing optomechanically induced transparency with a molecular vibration -- a measurement that would allow for a direct estimate of the optomechanical cooperativity.</description>

      <title>Ultracompact programmable silicon photonics using layers of low-loss phase-change material Sb$_2$Se$_3$ of increasing thickness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-performance programmable silicon photonic circuits are considered to be a critical part of next generation architectures for optical processing, photonic quantum circuits and neural networks. Low-loss optical phase change materials (PCMs) offer a promising route towards non-volatile free-form control of light. Here, we exploit direct-write digital patterning of waveguides using layers of the PCM Sb$_2$Se$_3$ with a thickness of up to 100 nm, demonstrating the ability to strongly increase the effect per pixel compared to previous implementations where much thinner PCM layers were used. We exploit the excellent refractive index matching between Sb$_2$Se$_3$ and silicon to achieve a low-loss hybrid platform for programmable photonics. A five-fold reduction in modulation length of a Mach-Zehnder interferometer is achieved compared to previous work using thin-film Sb$_2$Se$_3$ devices, decreased to 5 $\mu$m in this work. Application of the thicker PCM layers in direct-write digital programming of a multimode interferometer (MMI) shows a three-fold reduction of the number of programmed pixels to below 10 pixels per device. The demonstrated scaling of performance with PCM layer thickness is important for establishing the optimum working range for hybrid silicon-PCM devices and holds promise for achieving ultracompact programmable photonic circuits.</description>

      <title>Terahertz Plasmonic Transport in Topological Valley Metal-slabs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological photonic devices have attracted great attentions in terahertz (THz) and optical regimes due to their robust protected transport properties. However, it remains challenging in miniaturization of the devices to get superior performance for photonic integrated circuits in optical networks. In this paper, Kagome photonic insulators constructed with ultrathin metal-slab on Polyimide substrate are proposed for THz waveguiding. Theoretical analysis and numerical simulation demonstrate that $C_{3v}$ symmetry can be broken by global rotation $\theta$ of the air holes in metallic Kagome lattice, providing topological phase transitions. The propagation of THz waves through Z-shaped domain walls with multiple sharp corners verifies the robustness of plasmonic transport. The positive/negative refraction of topological valley edge state from Zigzag interface into background space is illustrated. These results present a novel approach to manipulate THz waves and facilitate development of photonic integrated circuits with high compactness and robustness.</description>

      <title>Shot-noise-limited emission from interband and quantum cascade lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intensity noise of a laser source represents one of the key factors limiting the ultimate sensitivity in laser-based systems for sensing and telecommunication. For advanced applications based on interferometry, the availability of a shot-noise-limited local oscillator is even more important for the effective feasibility of high-precision measurements. This is particularly crucial in quantum optics applications based on homodyne detection schemes to measure non-classical light states, such as squeezed states. This work deeply investigates and analyzes the intensity noise features of the most widely used mid-infrared semiconductor heterostructured lasers: quantum cascade and interband cascade lasers. For this purpose, a comprehensive comparison of three different continuous-wave lasers operating at room temperature around 4.5 {\mu}m wavelength is presented. First, a thorough electro-optical characterization is given, highlighting the differences and the shared common characteristics of the tested devices. Then, a detailed intensity noise analysis is reported, identifying their different noise operations with a particular reference to shot-noise-limited operations. Finally, some perspectives towards advanced applications are discussed.</description>

      <title>Feasibility of a solely acoustic-wave-driven light amplifier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Brillouin and Raman lasers, light is amplified by an input pump light through the excited acoustic and molecular oscillations in a medium. However, can medium oscillations alone amplify light in a realistic photonic circuit? Here, we demonstrate that modulating an optical resonator by a traveling wave having a frequency and phase velocity much smaller than the frequency and phase velocity of light can result in dramatically large narrow-band light amplification. Our calculations show that the proposed light amplifier can be realized in a lithium niobate racetrack resonator with millimeter-scale perimeter modulated by a surface acoustic wave with a surprisingly small amplitude and with the propagation constant satisfying the Brillouin phase matching condition.</description>

      <title>GeSn 320 \times 256 Focal Plane Array for Silicon-Based Short-wave Infrared Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Short-wave infrared (SWIR) imaging arrays have demonstrated great potential in applications spanning from military to civilian consumer electronics. However, the current focal plane arrays (FPAs), which are based on compound semiconductors, have limited applications in civilian circumstances due to elevated manufacturing costs and prolonged fabrication cycle time. To address this, a high-performance 320 $\times$ 256 focal plane array based on group-IV semiconductors has been designed and manufactured on a Si substrate using a complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) compatible fabrication process. The optical absorption layer is composed of GeSn alloy, whose bandgap could be tailored by choosing the appropriate Sn concentration. In this work, a 10% Sn concentration was employed, yielding a response cutoff wavelength of 2308 nm for the Si-based photodetector, which was measured at 298 K. Moreover, a specific detectivity of 9.7 $\times$ 10$^{11}$ cm$\cdot$ Hz$^{1/2}$ $\cdot$ W$^{-1}$ has been achieved at 77 K, surpassing all previously reported GeSn devices, and rivals commercial extended InGaAs photodetectors. With the help of read-out circuits (ROIC), SWIR images have been successfully captured for the first time by using Si-based GeSn FPA. This work demonstrates the potential of group IV imaging arrays for various applications in the commercial SWIR imaging field.</description>

      <title>Lie algebraic invariants in quantum linear optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum linear optics is a promising candidate for obtaining a quantum computational advantage. However, linear optics without post-selection is not powerful enough to produce any quantum state from a given input state. This limits its utility since some computations require entangled resources that are difficult to prepare. Thus, we need a deeper understanding of linear optical state preparation. In this work, we give a recipe to derive conserved quantities in the evolution of arbitrary states along any possible passive linear interferometer. We obtain the invariants by projecting the density operator of the state onto the Lie algebra of passive linear optical Hamiltonians. The conservation of the invariants gives necessary conditions for exact and approximate state preparation with passive linear optics: if input and output states have different invariants, it will be impossible to design a linear optical experiment that evolves one into the other or a sufficiently close one. Therefore, the invariants allow us to narrow the search when trying to prepare entangled states useful for quantum information, like Bell or NOON states, from easy-to-prepare states, like Fock states. We conclude that future exact and approximate state preparation methods will need to take into account the necessary conditions given by our invariants to weed out impossible linear optical evolutions.</description>

      <title>Topological argument for robustness of coherent states in quantum optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coherent states, being the closest analog to classical states of wave systems, are well known to possess special properties that set them apart from most other quantum optical states. For example, they are robust against photon loss and do not easily get entangled upon interaction with a beamsplitter, and hence are called ``pointer states'', which is often attributed to them being eigenstates of the annihilation operator. Here we provide insights into a topological argument for their robustness using two separate but exact mappings of a prototypical quantum optics model - the driven Jaynes-Cummings model. The first mapping is based on bosonization and refermionization of the Jaynes-Cummings model into the fermionic Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model hosting zero-energy topologically protected edge states. The second mapping is based on the algebra of deformed f-oscillators. We choose these mappings to explicitly preserve the translational symmetry of the model along a Fock-state ladder basis, which is important for maintaining the symmetry-protected topology of such 1D lattices. In addition, we show that the edge state form is preserved even when certain chiral symmetry is broken, corresponding to a single-photon drive for the quantum optics model that preserves the coherent state; however, the addition of two-photon drive immediately disturbs the edge state form, as confirmed by numerical simulations of the mapped SSH model; this is expected since two-photon drive strongly perturbs the coherent state into a squeezed state. Our theory sheds light on a fundamental reason for the robustness of coherent states, both in existence and entanglement -- an underlying connection to topology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09535v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The large-scale clock network is the key ingredient to obtain high precision in many scenarios, from fundamental research to cutting-edge applications. The advantage of the time synchronization among microwave clocks is their cost, size, and accessibility. Here, we demonstrate a femtosecond-level time synchronization of microwave clocks through a commercial link of 205.86 km via dual-comb-enhanced optical two-way time transfer, which achieves a 6.23-fs residual time deviation between synchronized timescales at 1 s and an instability below 6E-18 at 10,000 s. Further, the high-precision time synchronization of microwave clocks significantly enhances the probe ability of subtle reciprocity changes of fiber to the sub-picosecond level. This work provides a path toward secure fiber time-frequency networks to support future microwave-clock-based precise timing and sensing systems.</description>

      <title>Visible-frequency hyperbolic plasmon polaritons in a natural van der Waals crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15420v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Controlling light at subwavelength scales is one of the main challenges of nanophotonics. Leveraging hyperbolic polaritons supporting arbitrarily large wavevectors can lead to extreme light confinement, effectively overcoming the diffraction limit. Hyperbolicity was initially realized in artificial metamaterials, but their performances are limited by high losses in the metallic components. While recently discovered natural low-loss hyperbolic phonon polaritons initiated a revival in the interest for hyperbolic materials, they are confined to the mid-infrared frequency range, limiting their use for several applications. Some hyperbolic materials at visible frequencies have been studied, but they are either very lossy or only feature out-of-plane hyperbolicity. Here, we demonstrate the presence of low-loss, in-plane hyperbolic plasmon polaritons in the visible and near-infrared in thin films of $\mathrm{MoOCl}_2$, a natural van der Waals crystal. The polariton dispersion is predicted based on the framework of light propagation in biaxial media, and experimentally confirmed by real space nano imaging on exfoliated flakes. $\mathrm{MoOCl}_2$ constitutes a novel material platform for visible-range applications leveraging the unboundedness of hyperbolic modes, such as hyperlensing, Purcell factor enhancement and super-resolution imaging, without the drawbacks of metamaterials.</description>

      <title>Analytical solutions to intensity calculation in scintillation detectors and their application to the scintillation flash coordinates reconstruction</title>

Abstract: Detectors with continuous scintillator and matrix of photomultipliers attached are widely used in modern particle physics, and various medical tomographs. There are two common ways to calculate the coordinates of the scintillation flash via photomultipliers energy outcome: Anger method and Monte Carlo simulations. In this article, we derive an analytical solution for the computation of the energy outcome from several photomultipliers built into the bottom face of the scintillation camera with a continuous scintillator shaped as a rectangular parallelepiped. The lateral faces of the scintillation camera are considered specular reflectors with reflective indexes $\sim 1$ or $0$. The analytical solution is used as a reference point for the scintillation flash coordinates reconstruction. The achieved results are similar to those the Monte Carlo simulation provides but require less computational time.</description>

      <title>Nanomechanical crystalline AlN resonators with high quality factors for quantum optoelectromechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12196v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-\Qm{} mechanical resonators are crucial for applications where low noise and long coherence time are required, as mirror suspensions, quantum cavity optomechanical devices, or nanomechanical sensors. Tensile strain in the material enables the use of dissipation dilution and strain engineering techniques, which increase the mechanical quality factor. These techniques have been employed for high-\Qm{} mechanical resonators made from amorphous materials and, recently, from crystalline materials such as InGaP, SiC, and Si. A strained crystalline film exhibiting substantial piezoelectricity expands the capability of high-\Qm{} nanomechanical resonators to directly utilize electronic degrees of freedom. In this work we realize nanomechanical resonators with \Qm{} up to $2.9\times 10^{7}$ made from tensile-strained \SI{290}{\nano\meter}-thick AlN, which is an epitaxially-grown crystalline material offering strong piezoelectricity. We demonstrate nanomechanical resonators that exploit dissipation dilution and strain engineering to reach a \Qf-product approaching $10^{13}$\,\SI{}{\hertz} at room temperature. We realize a novel resonator geometry, triangline, whose shape follows the Al-N bonds and offers a central pad that we pattern with a photonic crystal. This allows us to reach an optical reflectivity above 80\% for efficient coupling to out-of-plane light. The presented results pave the way for quantum optoelectromechanical devices at room temperature based on tensile-strained AlN.</description>

      <title>Mirror-induced effects in cavity polaritonics: Influence on edge states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08357v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical cavities are widely used to induce strong light-matter coupling and thereby enable the presence of polaritons. While polaritons are at the source of most of the observed physics, the mirrors forming the cavity may also themselves be responsible for a number of phenomena, independently of the strong light-matter coupling regime. Here we use a toy model of a chain of dipolar emitters coupled to a cuboidal cavity. We unveil several effects originating solely from the boundary conditions imposed by the cavity mirrors, that are dominant when the distances of the emitters to the cavity walls are of the order of the interdipole separation. In particular, we show that mirrors in the direction transverse to the chain may act as effective defects, leading to the emergence of Tamm edge states. Considering a topological chain, we demonstrate that such transverse mirrors may also protect edge states against the effects of the strong light-matter coupling. Finally, we find that mirrors parallel to the chain, by the image charges they involve, induce topological phase transitions even in the case of highly off-resonant photons.</description>

      <title>Synthetic-lattice Bloch wave dynamics in a single-mode microwave resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00760v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Frequency-based synthetic dimensions are a promising avenue to extend the dimensionality of photonic systems. In this work, we show how a tilted synthetic lattice is naturally realised by periodically modulating a single-mode resonator under a coherent monochromatic drive. We theoretically study the Bloch wave dynamics in the tilted synthetic lattice, which gives rise to peculiar features in the spectral distribution of the cavity field. Our predictions are experimentally confirmed using a planar tunable superconducting microwave resonator.</description>
