      <title>Multi-scale Topology Optimization using Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A long-standing challenge is designing multi-scale structures with good connectivity between cells while optimizing each cell to reach close to the theoretical performance limit. We propose a new method for direct multi-scale topology optimization using neural networks. Our approach focuses on inverse homogenization that seamlessly maintains compatibility across neighboring microstructure cells. Our approach consists of a topology neural network that optimizes the microstructure shape and distribution across the design domain as a continuous field. Each microstructure cell is optimized based on a specified elasticity tensor that also accommodates in-plane rotations. The neural network takes as input the local coordinates within a cell to represent the density distribution within a cell, as well as the global coordinates of each cell to design spatially varying microstructure cells. As such, our approach models an n-dimensional multi-scale optimization problem as a 2n-dimensional inverse homogenization problem using neural networks. During the inverse homogenization of each unit cell, we extend the boundary of each cell by scaling the input coordinates such that the boundaries of neighboring cells are combined. Inverse homogenization on the combined cell improves connectivity. We demonstrate our method through the design and optimization of graded multi-scale structures.</description>

      <title>An Integrated Toolbox for Creating Neuromorphic Edge Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) and neuromorphic models are more efficient and have more biological realism than the activation functions typically used in deep neural networks, transformer models and generative AI. SNNs have local learning rules, are able to learn on small data sets, and can adapt through neuromodulation. Although research has shown their advantages, there are still few compelling practical applications, especially at the edge where sensors and actuators need to be processed in a timely fashion. One reason for this might be that SNNs are much more challenging to understand, build, and operate due to their intrinsic properties. For instance, the mathematical foundation involves differential equations rather than basic activation functions. To address these challenges, we have developed CARLsim++. It is an integrated toolbox that enables fast and easy creation of neuromorphic applications. It encapsulates the mathematical intrinsics and low-level C++ programming by providing a graphical user interface for users who do not have a background in software engineering but still want to create neuromorphic models. Developers can easily configure inputs and outputs to devices and robots. These can be accurately simulated before deploying on physical devices. CARLsim++ can lead to rapid development of neuromorphic applications for simulation or edge processing.</description>

      <title>NeuroLGP-SM: Scalable Surrogate-Assisted Neuroevolution for Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) play a crucial role in the architectural configuration and training of Artificial Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), a process known as neuroevolution. However, neuroevolution is hindered by its inherent computational expense, requiring multiple generations, a large population, and numerous epochs. The most computationally intensive aspect lies in evaluating the fitness function of a single candidate solution. To address this challenge, we employ Surrogate-assisted EAs (SAEAs). While a few SAEAs approaches have been proposed in neuroevolution, none have been applied to truly large DNNs due to issues like intractable information usage. In this work, drawing inspiration from Genetic Programming semantics, we use phenotypic distance vectors, outputted from DNNs, alongside Kriging Partial Least Squares (KPLS), an approach that is effective in handling these large vectors, making them suitable for search. Our proposed approach, named Neuro-Linear Genetic Programming surrogate model (NeuroLGP-SM), efficiently and accurately estimates DNN fitness without the need for complete evaluations. NeuroLGP-SM demonstrates competitive or superior results compared to 12 other methods, including NeuroLGP without SM, convolutional neural networks, support vector machines, and autoencoders. Additionally, it is worth noting that NeuroLGP-SM is 25% more energy-efficient than its NeuroLGP counterpart. This efficiency advantage adds to the overall appeal of our proposed NeuroLGP-SM in optimising the configuration of large DNNs.</description>

      <title>Advanced Intelligent Optimization Algorithms for Multi-Objective Optimal Power Flow in Future Power Systems: A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This review explores the application of intelligent optimization algorithms to Multi-Objective Optimal Power Flow (MOPF) in enhancing modern power systems. It delves into the challenges posed by the integration of renewables, smart grids, and increasing energy demands, focusing on evolutionary algorithms, swarm intelligence, and deep reinforcement learning. The effectiveness, scalability, and application of these algorithms are analyzed, with findings suggesting that algorithm selection is contingent on the specific MOPF problem at hand, and hybrid approaches offer significant promise. The importance of standard test systems for verifying solutions and the role of software tools in facilitating analysis are emphasized. Future research is directed towards exploiting machine learning for dynamic optimization, embracing decentralized energy systems, and adapting to evolving policy frameworks to improve power system efficiency and sustainability. This review aims to advance MOPF research by highlighting state-of-the-art methodologies and encouraging the development of innovative solutions for future energy challenges.</description>

      <title>Plus Strategies are Exponentially Slower for Planted Optima of Random Height</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compare the $(1,\lambda)$-EA and the $(1 + \lambda)$-EA on the recently introduced benchmark DisOM, which is the OneMax function with randomly planted local optima. Previous work showed that if all local optima have the same relative height, then the plus strategy never loses more than a factor $O(n\log n)$ compared to the comma strategy. Here we show that even small random fluctuations in the heights of the local optima have a devastating effect for the plus strategy and lead to super-polynomial runtimes. On the other hand, due to their ability to escape local optima, comma strategies are unaffected by the height of the local optima and remain efficient. Our results hold for a broad class of possible distortions and show that the plus strategy, but not the comma strategy, is generally deceived by sparse unstructured fluctuations of a smooth landscape.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Quantification in Detecting Choroidal Metastases on MRI via Evolutionary Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Uncertainty quantification plays a vital role in facilitating the practical implementation of AI in radiology by addressing growing concerns around trustworthiness. Given the challenges associated with acquiring large, annotated datasets in this field, there is a need for methods that enable uncertainty quantification in small data AI approaches tailored to radiology images. In this study, we focused on uncertainty quantification within the context of the small data evolutionary strategies-based technique of deep neuroevolution (DNE). Specifically, we employed DNE to train a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with MRI images of the eyes for binary classification. The goal was to distinguish between normal eyes and those with metastatic tumors called choroidal metastases. The training set comprised 18 images with choroidal metastases and 18 without tumors, while the testing set contained a tumor-to-normal ratio of 15:15.
  We trained CNN model weights via DNE for approximately 40,000 episodes, ultimately reaching a convergence of 100% accuracy on the training set. We saved all models that achieved maximal training set accuracy. Then, by applying these models to the testing set, we established an ensemble method for uncertainty quantification.The saved set of models produced distributions for each testing set image between the two classes of normal and tumor-containing. The relative frequencies permitted uncertainty quantification of model predictions. Intriguingly, we found that subjective features appreciated by human radiologists explained images for which uncertainty was high, highlighting the significance of uncertainty quantification in AI-driven radiological analyses.</description>

      <title>Heuristic Solution to Joint Deployment and Beamforming Design for STAR-RIS Aided Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper tackles the deployment challenges of Simultaneous Transmitting and Reflecting Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (STAR-RIS) in communication systems. Unlike existing works that use fixed deployment setups or solely optimize the location, this paper emphasizes the joint optimization of the location and orientation of STAR-RIS. This enables searching across all user grouping possibilities and fully boosting the system's performance. We consider a sum rate maximization problem with joint optimization and hybrid beamforming design. An offline heuristic solution is proposed for the problem, developed based on differential evolution and semi-definite programming methods. In particular, a point-point representation is proposed for characterizing and exploiting the user-grouping. A balanced grouping method is designed to achieve a desired user grouping with low complexity. Numerical results demonstrate the substantial performance gains achievable through optimal deployment design.</description>

      <title>LSROM: Learning Self-Refined Organizing Map for Fast Imbalanced Streaming Data Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Streaming data clustering is a popular research topic in the fields of data mining and machine learning. Compared to static data, streaming data, which is usually analyzed in data chunks, is more susceptible to encountering the dynamic cluster imbalanced issue. That is, the imbalanced degree of clusters varies in different streaming data chunks, leading to corruption in either the accuracy or the efficiency of streaming data analysis based on existing clustering methods. Therefore, we propose an efficient approach called Learning Self-Refined Organizing Map (LSROM) to handle the imbalanced streaming data clustering problem, where we propose an advanced SOM for representing the global data distribution. The constructed SOM is first refined for guiding the partition of the dataset to form many micro-clusters to avoid the missing small clusters in imbalanced data. Then an efficient merging of the micro-clusters is conducted through quick retrieval based on the SOM, which can automatically yield a true number of imbalanced clusters. In comparison to existing imbalanced data clustering approaches, LSROM is with a lower time complexity $O(n\log n)$, while achieving very competitive clustering accuracy. Moreover, LSROM is interpretable and insensitive to hyper-parameters. Extensive experiments have verified its efficacy.</description>

      <title>SNN4Agents: A Framework for Developing Energy-Efficient Embodied Spiking Neural Networks for Autonomous Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent trends have shown that autonomous agents, such as Autonomous Ground Vehicles (AGVs), Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), and mobile robots, effectively improve human productivity in solving diverse tasks. However, since these agents are typically powered by portable batteries, they require extremely low power/energy consumption to operate in a long lifespan. To solve this challenge, neuromorphic computing has emerged as a promising solution, where bio-inspired Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) use spikes from event-based cameras or data conversion pre-processing to perform sparse computations efficiently. However, the studies of SNN deployments for autonomous agents are still at an early stage. Hence, the optimization stages for enabling efficient embodied SNN deployments for autonomous agents have not been defined systematically. Toward this, we propose a novel framework called SNN4Agents that consists of a set of optimization techniques for designing energy-efficient embodied SNNs targeting autonomous agent applications. Our SNN4Agents employs weight quantization, timestep reduction, and attention window reduction to jointly improve the energy efficiency, reduce the memory footprint, optimize the processing latency, while maintaining high accuracy. In the evaluation, we investigate use cases of event-based car recognition, and explore the trade-offs among accuracy, latency, memory, and energy consumption. The experimental results show that our proposed framework can maintain high accuracy (i.e., 84.12% accuracy) with 68.75% memory saving, 3.58x speed-up, and 4.03x energy efficiency improvement as compared to the state-of-the-art work for NCARS dataset, thereby enabling energy-efficient embodied SNN deployments for autonomous agents.</description>

      <title>Novel entropy difference-based EEG channel selection technique for automated detection of ADHD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the common neurodevelopmental disorders in children. This paper presents an automated approach for ADHD detection using the proposed entropy difference (EnD)- based encephalogram (EEG) channel selection approach. In the proposed approach, we selected the most significant EEG channels for the accurate identification of ADHD using an EnD-based channel selection approach. Secondly, a set of features is extracted from the selected channels and fed to a classifier. To verify the effectiveness of the channels selected, we explored three sets of features and classifiers. More specifically, we explored discrete wavelet transform (DWT), empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and symmetrically-weighted local binary pattern (SLBP)-based features. To perform automated classification, we have used k-nearest neighbor (k-NN), Ensemble classifier, and support vectors machine (SVM) classifiers. Our proposed approach yielded the highest accuracy of 99.29% using the public database. In addition, the proposed EnD-based channel selection has consistently provided better classification accuracies than the entropy-based channel selection approach. Also, the developed method</description>

      <title>Listen to the Waves: Using a Neuronal Model of the Human Auditory System to Predict Ocean Waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have evolved from the 1940s primitive models of brain function to become tools for artificial intelligence. They comprise many units, artificial neurons, interlinked through weighted connections. ANNs are trained to perform tasks through learning rules that modify the connection weights. With these rules being in the focus of research, ANNs have become a branch of machine learning developing independently from neuroscience. Although likely required for the development of truly intelligent machines, the integration of neuroscience into ANNs has remained a neglected proposition.
  Here, we demonstrate that designing an ANN along biological principles results in drastically improved task performance. As a challenging real-world problem, we choose real-time ocean-wave prediction which is essential for various maritime operations. Motivated by the similarity of ocean waves measured at a single location to sound waves arriving at the eardrum, we redesign an echo state network to resemble the brain's auditory system. This yields a powerful predictive tool which is computationally lean, robust with respect to network parameters, and works efficiently across a wide range of sea states. Our results demonstrate the advantages of integrating neuroscience with machine learning and offer a tool for use in the production of green energy from ocean waves.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we discuss the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to the exemplary industrial use case of the two-dimensional commissioning problem in a high-bay storage, which essentially can be phrased as an instance of Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP). We investigate the mlrose library that provides an TSP optimizer based on various heuristic optimization techniques. Our focus is on two methods, namely Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Hill Climbing (HC), which are provided by mlrose. We present improvements for both methods that yield shorter tour lengths, by moderately exploiting the problem structure of TSP. That is, the proposed improvements have a generic character and are not limited to TSP only.</description>

      <title>A precise symbolic emulator of the linear matter power spectrum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15865v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computing the matter power spectrum, $P(k)$, as a function of cosmological parameters can be prohibitively slow in cosmological analyses, hence emulating this calculation is desirable. Previous analytic approximations are insufficiently accurate for modern applications, so black-box, uninterpretable emulators are often used. We utilise an efficient genetic programming based symbolic regression framework to explore the space of potential mathematical expressions which can approximate the power spectrum and $\sigma_8$. We learn the ratio between an existing low-accuracy fitting function for $P(k)$ and that obtained by solving the Boltzmann equations and thus still incorporate the physics which motivated this earlier approximation. We obtain an analytic approximation to the linear power spectrum with a root mean squared fractional error of 0.2% between $k = 9\times10^{-3} - 9 \, h{\rm \, Mpc^{-1}}$ and across a wide range of cosmological parameters, and we provide physical interpretations for various terms in the expression. Our analytic approximation is 950 times faster to evaluate than camb and 36 times faster than the neural network based matter power spectrum emulator BACCO. We also provide a simple analytic approximation for $\sigma_8$ with a similar accuracy, with a root mean squared fractional error of just 0.1% when evaluated across the same range of cosmologies. This function is easily invertible to obtain $A_{\rm s}$ as a function of $\sigma_8$ and the other cosmological parameters, if preferred. It is possible to obtain symbolic approximations to a seemingly complex function at a precision required for current and future cosmological analyses without resorting to deep-learning techniques, thus avoiding their black-box nature and large number of parameters. Our emulator will be usable long after the codes on which numerical approximations are built become outdated.</description>

      <title>On the Feasibility of Deep Learning Classification from Raw Signal Data in Radiology, Ultrasonography and Electrophysiology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16165v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Medical imaging is a very useful tool in healthcare, various technologies being employed to non-invasively peek inside the human body. Deep learning with neural networks in radiology was welcome - albeit cautiously - by the radiologist community. Most of the currently deployed or researched deep learning solutions are applied on already generated images of medical scans, use the neural networks to aid in the generation of such images, or use them for identifying specific substance markers in spectrographs. This paper's author posits that if the neural networks were trained directly on the raw signals from the scanning machines, they would gain access to more nuanced information than from the already processed images, hence the training - and later, the inferences - would become more accurate. The paper presents the main current applications of deep learning in radiography, ultrasonography, and electrophysiology, and discusses whether the proposed neural network training directly on raw signals is feasible.</description>

Abstract: Rapid and accurate evaluation of the nonlinear matter power spectrum, $P(k)$, as a function of cosmological parameters and redshift is of fundamental importance in cosmology. Analytic approximations provide an interpretable solution, yet current approximations are neither fast nor accurate relative to numerical emulators. We use symbolic regression to obtain simple analytic approximations to the nonlinear scale, $k_\sigma$, the effective spectral index, $n_{\rm eff}$, and the curvature, $C$, which are required for the halofit model. We then re-optimise the coefficients of halofit to fit a wide range of cosmologies and redshifts. We explore the space of analytic expressions to fit the residuals between $P(k)$ and the optimised predictions of halofit. Our results are designed to match the predictions of EuclidEmulator2, but are validated against $N$-body simulations. Our symbolic expressions for $k_\sigma$, $n_{\rm eff}$ and $C$ have root mean squared fractional errors of 0.8%, 0.2% and 0.3%, respectively, for redshifts below 3 and a wide range of cosmologies. The re-optimised halofit parameters reduce the root mean squared fractional error (compared to EuclidEmulator2) from 3% to below 2% for wavenumbers $k=9\times10^{-3}-9 \, h{\rm Mpc^{-1}}$. We introduce syren-halofit (symbolic-regression-enhanced halofit), an extension to halofit containing a short symbolic correction which improves this error to 1%. Our method is 2350 and 3170 times faster than current halofit and hmcode implementations, respectively, and 2680 and 64 times faster than EuclidEmulator2 (which requires running class) and the BACCO emulator. We obtain comparable accuracy to EuclidEmulator2 and BACCO when tested on $N$-body simulations. Our work greatly increases the speed and accuracy of symbolic approximations to $P(k)$, making them significantly faster than their numerical counterparts without loss of accuracy.</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces semantic features as a candidate conceptual framework for white-box neural networks. The proof of concept model is well-motivated, inherently interpretable, has low parameter-count and achieves almost human-level adversarial test metrics - with no adversarial training! These results and the general nature of the approach warrant further research on semantic features. The code is available at https://github.com/314-Foundation/white-box-nn</description>

      <title>Learning Heuristics for Transit Network Design and Improvement with Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05894v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transit agencies world-wide face tightening budgets. To maintain quality of service while cutting costs, efficient transit network design is essential. But planning a network of public transit routes is a challenging optimization problem. The most successful approaches to date use metaheuristic algorithms to search through the space of possible transit networks by applying low-level heuristics that randomly alter routes in a network. The design of these low-level heuristics has a major impact on the quality of the result. In this paper we use deep reinforcement learning with graph neural nets to learn low-level heuristics for an evolutionary algorithm, instead of designing them manually. These learned heuristics improve the algorithm's results on benchmark synthetic cities with 70 nodes or more, and obtain state-of-the-art results when optimizing operating costs. They also improve upon a simulation of the real transit network in the city of Laval, Canada, by as much as 54% and 18% on two key metrics, and offer cost savings of up to 12% over the city's existing transit network.</description>
