      <title>Probing Boson Clouds with Supermassive Black Hole Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rotating black holes can generate boson clouds via superradiance when the boson's Compton wavelength is comparable to the black hole's size. In binary systems, these clouds can produce distinctive observational imprints. Recent studies accounting for nonlinearities induced by orbital backreaction suggest that if the binary forms at a large separation, resonance transitions can significantly deplete the cloud, minimizing later observational consequences except for very specific orbital inclinations. In this paper, we extend this framework to supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs), considering the influence of their astrophysical evolutionary histories. We find that, before entering the gravitational wave (GW) radiation stage, the additional energy loss channels can accelerate orbital evolution. This acceleration makes hyperfine resonant transitions inefficient, allowing a sufficient portion of the cloud to remain for later direct observations. We further discuss the ionization effects and cloud depletion occurring at this stage. Based on these theoretical insights, we explore how multi-messenger observations for SMBHBs can be utilized to detect the ionization effects of boson clouds by examining changes in the orbital period decay rate via electromagnetic measurements and variations in GW strain over a wide frequency band. Our findings reveal a complex dependence on the binary's total mass, mass ratio, and boson mass, emphasizing the significant role of astrophysical evolution histories in detecting boson clouds within binaries.</description>

      <title>Local vs. nonlocal entanglement in top-quark pairs at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the entanglement observed in top-antitop quark spin states at the LHC is local in the energy region close to the production threshold. In contrast, nonlocal entanglement is observed in the central boosted region defined by a top-quark pair invariant mass $m_{t\bar t} &gt; 800$ GeV and scattering angles $\Theta$ satisfying $|\cos \Theta |&lt;0.2$. This makes top-quark pairs a unique laboratory for studying the interplay between entanglement and Bell locality. The locality of entanglement near the production threshold is further supported by a recent CMS analysis, which reports a significance of more than $5\sigma$.</description>

      <title>Positivity in Perturbative Renormalization: an EFT $a$-theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the direction of renormalization in effective field theory is constrained by fundamental principles in the infrared$\unicode{x2014}$unitarity, analyticity, and Lorentz invariance. Our theorem, in the spirit of the $a$-theorem in conformal field theory, determines the sign of the one-loop running of couplings in the forward limit, when one inserts two operators whose mass dimensions are identical and even. The theorem holds for a broad class of effective field theories with arbitrary ultraviolet completions. The constraint directly applies to linear positivity bounds derived using tree-level amplitudes in the IR, providing a criterion for whether renormalization effects can preserve the positivity bounds, or lead to their apparent violation. We discuss the phenomenological implications of our theorem in chiral perturbation theory and the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, where our theorem is particularly constraining for the running at dimension eight. We provide several examples and show various extensions and applications even at dimension six.</description>

      <title>Constraining the Coexistence of Freeze-in Dark Matter and Primordial Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Particle dark matter and primordial black holes (PBH) might coexist with appreciable cosmic abundances, with both contributing to the observed dark matter density $\Omega_{\rm DM}$. Large populations of PBH (with $\Omega_{\rm PBH}\sim \Omega_{\rm DM}$) are tightly constrained for PBH heavier than $10^{-11} M_\odot$. However, large fractional abundances with $ f_{\rm PBH}\simeq \Omega_{\rm PBH}/\Omega_{\rm DM}\sim0.01$ are consistent with the limits on PBH for a wide range of PBH masses. Scenarios with significant populations of both particle dark matter and PBH are intriguing. Notably, if the particle dark matter has interactions with the Standard Model, new constraints arise due to pair-annihilations that are enhanced by the PBHs, resulting in dark matter indirect detection constraints on $f_{\rm PBH}$. Here we derive the bounds on mixed scenarios in which PBHs coexist with particle dark matter whose relic abundance is set via freeze-in (``FIMPs''). We show that while the restrictions on $f_{\rm PBH}$ are less constraining for FIMPs than WIMPs, modest bounds still arise for large classes of models. We examine both IR and UV freeze-in scenarios, including the case of ``superheavy'' particle dark matter with PeV scale mass.</description>

      <title>Large One-Loop Effects of BSM Triple Higgs Couplings on Double Higgs Production at $e^+e^-$ Colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The measurement of the Higgs boson self-coupling is crucial for our understanding of the nature of electroweak symmetry breaking and potential physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM). In this work, we study in the framework of the 2-Higgs-Doublet Model (2HDM) the impact of one-loop corrections to triple Higgs couplings (THCs) on the pair production of two Standard Model (SM)-like Higgs bosons $h$ at future high-energy $e^+ e^-$ colliders, focusing on the $e^+ e^- \to Zhh$ process. By including the one-loop corrections to the THCs relevant for this process, i.e. the coupling between three SM-like Higgs bosons, $\lambda_{hhh}$, and between the non-SM-like Higgs $H$, assumed to be heavier, and two SM-like Higgs bosons, $\lambda_{hhH}$, we account for the leading one-loop corrections to the di-Higgs production cross section. We show that the one-loop corrected THC $\lambda_{hhh}$ can be enhanced up to nearly six times its SM value, which substantially enhances the di-Higgs production cross section w.r.t. the tree-level prediction, even in the alignment limit. On the other hand, one-loop corrections to $\lambda_{hhH}$ can also enhance its value, potentially yielding to more prominent heavy Higgs $H$ resonant production. We explore the sensitivity to the loop-corrected $\lambda_{hhh}$ and the possible access to $\lambda_{hhH}$ via the $H$ resonant peak at a future high-energy $e^+e^-$ collider, such as the ILC. We highlight the fact that including the one-loop corrected THCs can enhance the sensitivity to the $H$ resonant peak, and therefore to $\lambda_{hhH}$. Finally, we discuss the required experimental precision at future $e^+e^-$ colliders necessary to achieve these sensitivities.</description>

      <title>Holography and charmonium structure in a finite density plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has recently been proposed that the extra dimension in holographic models for charmoniun is related to its internal structure. Representing the interaction between the quark anti-quark pair by a string inside the background used in these models, the linear term of the Cornell potential was obtained. More than that, the dissociation in the thermal medium is also described in a consistent way. Here we extend this study to the case of a plasma with finite density. The combined effects of density and temperature are analyzed from the point of view of quark anti-quark interaction and the results obtained are consistent with the ones derived previously using spectral functions.</description>

      <title>Matter-antimatter asymmetry in minimal inverse seesaw framework with $A_4$ modular symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a minimal inverse seesaw framework based on $A_4$ modular symmetry. We have studied the neutrino oscillation parameters in our work and our model excludes some $3 \sigma$ values of the mixing angle $\theta_{23}$. Also, there is a clear linear relation between the mixing angles $\theta_{12}$ and $\theta_{23}$ found in the allowed $3 \sigma$ region. We also examine whether the parameter points consistent with neutrino oscillation data simultaneously comply with the experimental limits on lepton flavor violating (LFV) decays, specifically: $\mu \longrightarrow e \gamma$, $\tau \longrightarrow e \gamma$, and $\tau \longrightarrow \mu \gamma$. We have also investigated the matter-antimatter asymmetry of our universe via the resonant leptogenesis mechanism. Here, we present the contribution of lepton number conserving scattering processes mediated by the $ Z' $ boson in the context of leptogenesis.</description>

      <title>Higgs-like inflation under ACTivated mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent analyses that combine the latest data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) with cosmic microwave background observations by BICEP/Keck and Planck, together with the DESI baryon acoustic-baryonic-oscillation (BAO) measurements, have tightened the limits on inflationary scenarios. The joint data set yields a spectral index of primordial scalar perturbations $n_s = 0.9743 \pm 0.0034$ and an upper bound on the tensor-to-scalar ratio of $r &lt; 0.038$. This slight upward shift in $n_s$ puts the previously favored Starobinsky model, and the conventional metric Higgs(-like) inflation--based on a quartic potential with a large non-minimal coupling in the Jordan frame--under tension with observations. In metric Higgs-like inflation the attractor behavior makes the predictions remarkably stable against higher-order operators, so modifying $n_s$ through such terms is difficult. In this paper, I show that adding a quadratic mass term to the Jordan-frame potential can raise $n_s$ and restore compatibility with the new data. I also discuss how this mass term can naturally arise from threshold effects in Higgs inflation.</description>

      <title>Study of octupole deformations in Pb-Pb collisions at 5.02 TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we present the study of the role of octupole deformation in non-spherical nuclei in most-central Pb--Pb collisions at the LHC energy regime. The sensitivity of octupole deformation $\beta_3$ to the QGP observables is presented by employing the Monte Carlo HYDJET++ model. Motivated by the discrepancies in the $v_2$-to-$v_3$ puzzle found in Pb--Pb collisions and the low-energy nuclear structure calculations of nuclear deformation, we studied the first basic observables necessary for any study in heavy-ion collisions. Using the HYDJET++ framework, we calculate the pseudorapidity distribution, transverse momentum ($p_{\mathrm{T}}$) spectra, and average anisotropic flow ($v_2$ and $v_3$) of primary charged hadrons with different parameters in two geometrical configurations: body-body and tip-tip types of Pb--Pb collisions. The kinematic ranges $0 &lt; p_{\mathrm{T}} &lt; 20~\mathrm{GeV}/c$ and $|\eta| &lt; 0.8$ are considered. We observe that the charged hadron multiplicity and transverse momentum spectra are dependent on the strength of the octupole deformation parameter. The $\langle v_2 \rangle$ and $\langle v_3 \rangle$ in body-body collisions show a weak positive correlation with $\beta_3$, while the average anisotropic flow in tip-tip collisions is weakly correlated with $\beta_3$ in the most-central collision region.</description>

      <title>Hidden Valleys in the CMS muon endcap detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the sensitivity of the CMS search to displaced showers arising from the decays of long-lived particles in the muon system, in the context of Hidden Valley scenarios. To establish our simulation setup, we employ a theoretically consistent parameterization of Hidden Valley theory space. We also adopt a hybrid strategy where we treat lifetime as a free parameter to provide model-independent Hidden Valley quark production cross-section upper-limits. Our results demonstrate that the CMS search is sensitive to the underlying theory parameters and has the capacity to constrain the overall Hidden Valley scale as well as the relevant mass ratio. Additionally, we observe that the search exhibits comparatively weak sensitivity to the number of Hidden Valley colors or flavors. Finally, we establish model dependent limits on the maximum strength of the mediator coupling to the Hidden Valley quarks. Our setup and reinterpretation goes beyond the well-established simplified model strategies and demonstrates the use and effectiveness of following a first principles theory setup.</description>

      <title>Axion effects on the non-radial oscillations of neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effects of axions on quark matter equation of state (EOS) is studied within the three flavor Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model and its effects on on the non-radial oscillations of neutron stars is investigated. Using such an EOS for quark matter with axions and a EOS for hadronic matter within the relativistic mean field (RMF) theory, we discuss the hadron-quark phase transition (HQPT) using the Gibbs construction. The EOS so obtained is used to investigate the structure of hybrid neutron star (NS)s. It is found that the presence of axions in the core of compact stars stabilizes hybrid NSs in agreement with modern astrophysical constraints. It is further observed that the quadrupolar fundamental modes ($f$-modes) for such hybrid NSs get substantial enhancements both due to a larger quark core in the presence of axions and from the hyperons as compared to a canonical nucleonic neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Particle decay as asymptotic narrow parametric resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parametric resonance can produce particles from oscillating scalar field, where an exponential growth of the particle number density can be developed. While it has been noticed that stimulated decay in Boltzmann equations exhibits similar parametric dependence of the exponential growth, it is not quantitatively clear yet under what circumstance can the two phenomena reconcile. We demonstrate that trilinear particle interaction in the Boltzmann equation can provide a good approximation to describe the distribution function and the number density in the asymptotic regime of narrow parametric resonance. We find that the crucial treatment leading to the quantitative agreement is a proper Gaussian simulation of the momentum spread inherited from nonrelativistic particle decay. With the simple particle picture, the analytic Boltzmann approximation can be applied to explosive photon production from axions/axion-like particles and to dark matter production from oscillating fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the exclusion constraints on the parameters of a narrow dark photon set by direct experimental searches. We investigate how a dark photon with a larger decay width impacts these limits, in particular, in the case where the dark photon also decays into light dark matter. As an example, taking the upper limits on the mixing parameter, $\epsilon$, reported by the CMS collaboration, we find that they could be significantly relaxed. Indeed, even a very modest coupling of the dark photon to dark matter can lead to an increase in the bound on the mixing parameter by an order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>IAFormer: Interaction-Aware Transformer network for collider data analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce IAFormer, a novel Transformer-based architecture that efficiently integrates pairwise particle interactions through a dynamic sparse attention mechanism. The IAformer has two new mechanisms within the model. First, the attention matrix depends on predefined boost invariant pairwise quantities, reducing the network parameter significantly from the original particle transformer models. Second, IAformer incorporate the sparse attention mechanism by utilizing the ``differential attention'', so that it can dynamically prioritizes relevant particle tokens while reducing computational overhead associated with less informative ones. This approach significantly lowers the model complexity without compromising performance. Despite being computationally efficient by more than an order of magnitude than the Particle Transformer network, IAFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance in classification tasks on the Top and quark-gluon datasets. Furthermore, we employ AI interpretability techniques, verifying that the model effectively captures physically meaningful information layer by layer through its sparse attention mechanism, building an efficient network output that is resistant to statistical fluctuations. IAformer highlights the need to sparse attention in any Transformer analysis to reduce the network size while improving its performance.</description>

      <title>Study of Heavy Hadron Production in Au+Au Collisions at a Center-of-Mass Energy of $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the Monte Carlo HYDJET++ model, the transverse momentum ($p_{T}$) spectra of $D^{0}$, $\Bar{D^{0}}$, and $\Lambda_{c}$, as well as the nuclear modification factors of $D^{0}$ and $D^{\pm}$, produced in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200$ GeV RHIC energy across various centrality bins, are presented. To achieve the best description of heavy hadron production, several input parameters in both the soft and hard components of the model are tuned. The model effectively reproduces experimental data of $p_{T}$ spectra at low and intermediate $p_{T}$, capturing key features of charm hadron production in the quark-gluon plasma medium. However, it overpredicts the data at high $p_{T}$, indicating the need for improvements in modeling heavy quark energy loss mechanisms. Another observable, the nuclear modification factors $R_{AA}$ and $R_{CP}$ for $D^{0}$ mesons exhibit significant suppression in central collisions, which matches with experimental observations, highlighting the roles of collisional and radiative energy loss due to collective effects, such as coalescence and radial flow. The antiparticle-to-particle and mixed particle ratios are also presented, showing good agreement with experimental data and revealing limitations in baryon production due to the absence of heavy quark coalescence in HYDJET++. Additionally, we compare the HYDJET++ results with those from other theoretical models, including TAMU, SUBATECH, Torino, Duke and AMPT.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic form factors of $\Omega^-$ with the meson cloud in the spacelike and timelike regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present comprehensive calculations of the electromagnetic form factors, including the charge, magnetic-dipole, electric-quadrupole and magnetic-octupole form factors, of the $\Omega^-$ in the spacelike region using the quark-diquark approach, incorporating the effect of the meson cloud. The obtained magnetic moment is in agreement with the experimental measurement and the electromagnetic radii are comparable with other model calculations. It is found that the meson cloud effect remains almost unchanged as the energy becomes high and this feature implies that the meson cloud should be considered in all the energy region. Moreover, the asymptotic relations allow us to extend the electromagnetic form factors from the spacelike region to the timelike region, and then the effective form factor is almost identical with the data from CLEO and BESIII. Finally, polarization properties of the final state $\Omega^-$ in the $e^+ e^- \rightarrow \Omega^- \bar{\Omega}^+$ process with the unpolarized initial states are also investigated.</description>

      <title>Forward-backward correlations: A probe to study dynamical fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The source of the fluctuations in the final state particles is the initial event-by-event fluctuation in energy density. Forward-Backward (F-B) correlation is one of the important probes to study such fluctuations. The results of F-B correlation are available in a wide range of energy, from STAR of RHIC to ALICE of LHC. It will be more interesting to study the dynamical fluctuation using F-B correlation at SIS100 energy too. In this study, an attempt has been made to investigate the F-B correlation in UrQMD-hydro generated data for 10 AGeV Au+Au collisions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analytical solution for the evolution of parton distributions incorporating mixed-order QCD $\otimes$ QED corrections, addressing both polarized and unpolarized cases. Using the Altarelli-Parisi kernels extended to mixed order, we solve the DGLAP equations exactly in Mellin $N$-space and derive the associated Wilson coefficients for the polarized structure function $g_1$. Our analytical approach not only improves computational efficiency but also enhances the precision of theoretical predictions relevant for current and future phenomenological applications.</description>

      <title>Cosmic strings and domain walls of the QCD quark condensate with and without a hidden axion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The chiral quark condensate of QCD, which spontaneously breaks the anomalous axial symmetry, gives rise to axionic type global string-wall systems. If a Peccei-Quinn type axion exists in the theory, the axionic strings are in general accompanied by winding of the QCD quark condensate. Depending on the axion model the winding can proceed either in the $\eta'$ or in the pion direction. This determines the structure of fermionic zero modes and the anomaly inflow which has important astrophysical consequences. We point out that $\eta'$ and pion string-wall systems exist in pure QCD, independently of the hidden axion. Strikingly, even if a hidden axion exists, the early cosmology can be entirely dominated by string-wall systems formed by the QCD quark condensate. We also discuss their role in the QCD phase transition and in heavy-ion physics.</description>

      <title>95 GeV Higgs boson and nano-Hertz gravitational waves from domain walls in the N2HDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the diphoton and $b\bar{b}$ excesses at 95.4 GeV, as well as nano-Hertz gravitational waves originating from domain walls, within the framework of the next-to-two-Higgs-doublet model (N2HDM), which extends the two-Higgs-doublet model by introducing a real singlet scalar subject to a discrete $Z_2$ symmetry. The $Z_2$ symmetry is spontaneously broken by the non-zero vacuum expectation value of the singlet scalar, $v_s$, which leads to the formation of domain walls. We discuss two different scenarios: in scenario A, the 95.4 GeV Higgs boson predominantly originates from the singlet field, while in scenario B, it arises mainly from the CP-even components of the Higgs doublets. Taking into account relevant theoretical and experimental constraints, we find that scenario A can fully account for both the diphoton and $b\bar{b}$ excesses at 95.4 GeV within the $1\sigma$ range. Moreover, the peak amplitude of the gravitational wave spectrum at a peak frequency of $10^{-9}$ Hz can reach $2 \times 10^{-12}$ for $v_s = 100$ TeV. Scenario B only marginally accounts for the diphoton and $b\bar{b}$ excesses at the $1\sigma$ level, but the peak amplitude of the gravitational wave spectrum at the peak frequency of $10^{-9}$ Hz can reach $6\times 10^{-8}$ for $v_s=100$ TeV. The nano-Hertz gravitational wave signals predicted in both scenarios can be tested by the current and future pulsar timing array projects.</description>

      <title>Double-bottom centrifugal-barrier molecules dancing with four quarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent Belle II measurement of the open-bottom cross section, we perform a systematic study of the double-bottom molecular tetraquark spectrum, including both $S$-wave and $P$-wave configurations. Using the one-boson-exchange potential and the complex scaling method, we investigate the $B^{(*)}\bar{B}^*$ and $B^{(*)}B^*$ systems and predict several bound states and resonances. Our analysis reveals a rich spectrum, including $B\bar{B}^*$ ($0(1^{++})$, $0(0^{-+})$), $B^*\bar{B}^*$ ($0(2^{++})$, $0(0^{-+})$, $0(1^{--})$), $BB^*$ ($0(1^+)$), and $B^*B^*$ ($0(1^+)$) bound states, as well as $B\bar{B}^*$ ($0(1^{--})$, $0(2^{--})$), $B^*\bar{B}^*$ ($0(3^{--})$), $BB^*$ ($0(0^-)$), and $B^*B^*$ ($0(1^-)$, $0(2^-)$) resonances. Our results provide theoretical support for the existence of double-bottom tetraquarks and deliver key benchmarks for future searches at LHCb, Belle II, and other experiments.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we express the singular part of a scattering amplitude in terms of Feynman integrals compatible with topologies appearing in the bare amplitude, and we choose a basis of locally finite Master Integrals. In two-loop massless QCD, we find such a representation of the amplitude singularities using a systematic ansatz reconstruction of the integrand from a predicted integrated form. As an example application, we write the finite part of an amplitude for the digluon production in quark annihilation for some helicity configurations as manifestly locally finite.</description>

      <title>The LHC sensitivity to weak gauginos in light of the latest muon $g-2$ and dark matter results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among the electroweakinos, the weak gauginos have the largest production rate at the LHC and should therefore be the primary focus of searches. In this work, we examine the LHC sensitivity to weak gauginos in light of the latest constraints from the muon $g-2$ anomaly and dark matter (DM) observations. To simultaneously account for the observed $5\sigma$ deviation in muon $g-2$ and the correct DM relic abundance, the DM candidate in the MSSM must be bino-like: wino- or higgsino-like neutralinos require TeV-scale masses to avoid underabundance, rendering the electroweakino spectrum too heavy to yield a sizable $g-2$ contribution. Moreover, tight direct detection limits disfavor light higgsinos, which can induce sizable DM-nucleon scattering via bino-higgsino mixing. We thus focus on scenarios with a bino-like LSP and relatively heavy higgsinos. Two classes of wino spectra are considered: a light-wino scenario (LWo) with $m_{\tilde{W}} \lesssim 1$~TeV, and a heavy-wino scenario (HWo) with $m_{\tilde{W}} \gtrsim 1$~TeV. For each, we delineate the viable parameter space under current constraints and assess the discovery potential at future LHC stages. We find that while the high-luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) can probe a portion of the parameter space, the high-energy 27~TeV LHC (HE-LHC) is capable of covering most of it.</description>

      <title>Stay Positive: Neural Refinement of Sample Weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monte Carlo simulations are an essential tool for data analysis in particle physics. Simulated events are typically produced alongside weights that redistribute the cross section across the phase space. Latent degrees of freedom introduce a distribution of weights at a given point in the phase space, which can include negative values. Several post-hoc reweighting methods have been developed to eliminate the negative weights. All of these methods share the common strategy of approximating the average weight as a function of phase space. We introduce an alternative approach with a potentially simpler learning task. Instead of reweighting to the average, we refine the initial weights with a scaling transformation, utilizing a phase space-dependent factor. Since this new refinement method does not need to model the full weight distribution, it can be more accurate. High-dimensional and unbinned phase space is processed using neural networks for the refinement. Using both realistic and synthetic examples, we show that the new neural refinement method is able to match or exceed the accuracy of similar weight transformations.</description>

      <title>Gauge invariance and color charge fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nature of confinement is connected with color charge. Unfortunately, the color charge densities in QCD, the Noether charge densities associated with the global color invariance, are not invariant under local color rotations. This implies that the expectation values of the net color charge in any region of any physical state in QCD, states that satisfy the color Gauss law, are automatically zero for all components of color. In this paper it is shown that the expectation value of the square of the net color charge in a region, a measure of the color charge fluctuations, is necessarily nonzero when evaluated in physical states and the result, while depending on the scheme and scale by which the theory is regulated, is gauge invariant. This holds despite the formal lack of gauge invariance of the operator. Moreover, there is a particular combination of the color charge fluctuations for the vacuum and for a system describable by a non-trivial density matrix that is independent that has a well-defined continuum limit</description>

      <title>Vlasov Perturbation Theory applied to $\Lambda$CDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply the framework of Vlasov Perturbation Theory (VPT) to the two-loop matter power spectrum within $\Lambda$CDM cosmologies. The main difference to Standard Perturbation Theory (SPT) arises from taking the velocity dispersion tensor into account, and the resulting screening of the backreaction of UV modes renders loop integrals cutoff-independent. VPT is informed about non-perturbative small scale dynamics via the average value of the dispersion generated by shell-crossing, which impacts the evolution of perturbations on weakly non-linear scales. When using an average dispersion from halo models, the VPT power spectrum agrees with the one from the simulation, up to differences from missing three-loop contributions. Alternatively, treating the average dispersion as free parameter we find a remarkably stable prediction of the matter power spectrum from collisionless dynamics at percent level for a wide range of the dispersion scale. We quantify the impact of truncating the Vlasov hierarchy for the cumulants of the phase-space distribution function, finding that the two-loop matter power spectrum is robust to neglecting third and higher cumulants. Finally, we introduce and validate a simplified fast scheme fVPT that can be easily incorporated into existing codes and is as numerically efficient as SPT.</description>

      <title>A Continuous Galactic Line Source of Axions: The Remarkable Case of 23Na</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We argue that $^{23}$Na is a potentially significant source of galactic axions. For temperatures $\gtrsim 7 \times 10^8$K -- characteristic of carbon burning in the massive progenitors of supernovae and ONeMg white dwarfs -- the 440 keV first excited state of $^{23}$Na is thermally populated, with its repeated decays pumping stellar energy into escaping axions. Odd-A nuclear abundances are typically very low in high-temperature stellar environments (or absent entirely due to burn-up). $^{23}$Na is an exception: $\approx 0.1 M_\odot$ of the isotope is synthesized during carbon burning then maintained at $\approx 10^9$K for times ranging up to $6 \times 10^4$y. Using MESA simulations, a galactic model, and sampling over progenitor masses, locations, and evolutionary stages, we find a continuous flux at earth of $\langle \phi_a \rangle \approx 22$/cm$^2$s for $g^\mathrm{eff}_{aNN} = 10^{-9}$. Some fraction of these axions convert to photons as they propagate through the galactic magnetic field, producing a distinctive 440 keV line $\gamma$ ray detectable by all-sky detectors like the Compton Spectrometer and Imager (COSI). Assuming a 1$\mu$G galactic magnetic field and a sufficiently light axion mass, we find that COSI will be able to probe $| g_{aNN}^\mathrm{eff} g_{a \gamma \gamma} | \gtrsim1.8 \times 10^{-22}$ GeV$^{-1}$ at $3\sigma$ after two years of surveying.</description>

      <title>Digital quantum simulations of scattering in quantum field theories using W states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-energy particle collisions can convert energy into matter through the inelastic production of new particles. Quantum computers are an ideal platform for simulating the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of the collision and the formation of the subsequent many-particle state. In this work, evidence for inelastic particle production is observed in one-dimensional Ising field theory using IBM's quantum computers. The scattering experiment is performed on 100 qubits of ibm_marrakesh and uses up to 6,412 two-qubit gates to access the post-collision dynamics. Integral to these simulations is a new quantum algorithm for preparing the initial state (wavepackets) of a quantum field theory scattering simulation. This method efficiently prepares wavepackets by extending recent protocols for creating W states with mid-circuit measurement and feedforward. The required circuit depth is independent of wavepacket size and spatial dimension, representing a superexponential improvement over previous methods. Our wavepacket preparation algorithm can be applied to a wide range of lattice models and is demonstrated in one-dimensional Ising field theory, scalar field theory, the Schwinger model, and two-dimensional Ising field theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aether Scalar-Tensor theory is a relativistic alternative gravity model that behaves like cold dark matter on cosmological scales while predicting the MOND force-law in astrophysical systems. The theory correctly predicts the cosmic microwave background and linear matter power spectra, and the mass discrepancies observed across the Universe. We derive and solve the equations governing neutron stars in Aether Scalar Tensor theory at first-order in slow rotation, finding that the theory predicts approximate universal relations between the moment of inertia and the compactness ($I$--$C$ relations) that differ from their general relativity counterparts. These relations may enable tests of Aether Scalar-Tensor theory using X-ray observations of pulsars and gravitational wave observations of binary neutron star mergers.</description>

      <title>Three-body universality in the B meson sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.06176</link>
      <description>arXiv:1705.06176v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The charged exotic mesons Z_b(10610) and Z'_b(10650) observed by the Belle collaboration in 2011 are very close to the B* Bbar and B* Bbar* thresholds, respectively. This suggests their interpretation as shallow hadronic molecules of B and B* mesons. Using the masses of the Z_b(10610) and Z'_b(10650) as input, we rule out the possibility for universal bound states of three B and B* mesons arising from the Efimov effect based on their spin-isospin structure. As a consequence, we can predict the phase shifts for the scattering of B and B* mesons off the exotic mesons Z_b(10610) and Z'_b(10650) to leading order in a non-relativistic effective field theory with contact interactions based on two-body information alone.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Resonant and Broadband Detection of Ultralight Dark Matter and High-Frequency Gravitational Waves via Cavities and Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.12387v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electromagnetic resonant systems, such as cavities and LC circuits, are widely used to detect ultralight boson dark matter and high-frequency gravitational waves. However, the narrow bandwidth of single-mode resonators necessitates multiple scan steps to cover broad frequency ranges. By incorporating a network of auxiliary modes via beam-splitter-type and non-degenerate parametric couplings, we enable broadband detection with an effective bandwidth of each scan matching the order of the resonant frequency, while maintaining a strong signal response. In heterodyne upconversion detection, where a background cavity mode transitions into another due to a potential background source, multiple orders of the source frequency can be probed with high sensitivity without tuning the cavity frequency. Consequently, our method allows for significantly deeper exploration of the parameter space within the same integration time compared to single-mode detection.</description>

      <title>Composite nature of the $T_{cc}$ state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19597v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2021, LHCb collaboration reported a very narrow state in the $D^0D^0\pi^+$ mass spectrum just below the $D^{*+}D^0$ mass threshold. We consider the influence of the Castillejo-Dalitz-Dyson (CDD) pole in the scattering amplitude to derive a general treatment for the two-body final state interaction near its threshold. The line shape (or the energy dependent event distribution) are then obtained, where the parameters can be fixed by fitting to the experimental data on the $D^0D^0\pi^+$ mass spectrum. Within our method the data are quite well reproduced. The pole structure in the complex energy plane indicates that the $T_{cc}$ state has a large portion of elementary degree of freedom (e.g., the compact tetraquark component) inside its hadron wave function. The compositeness as a measure of molecule component in its wave function is predicted to be $0.23_{-0.09}^{+0.40}$. Clearly, the non-molecular component takes a non-negligible or even dominant portion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07725v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Core-collapse supernovae (SNe) provide a unique environment to study Feebly Interacting Particles (FIPs) such as Axion-Like Particles (ALPs), sterile neutrinos, and Dark Photons (DPs). This paper focuses on heavy FIPs produced in SNe, whose decay produces electrons and positrons, generating observable secondary signals during their propagation and annihilation. We focus on the In-flight Annihilation (IA) of positrons, which emerge as the most significant contribution to the resulting gamma-ray spectrum. Using data from COMPTEL and EGRET we derive the most stringent bounds on the FIP-electron couplings for heavy ALPs, sterile neutrinos, and DPs. These results strenghten existing bounds of one or two orders of magnitude, depending on the FIP model.</description>

      <title>Form factors of light pseudoscalar mesons from the perturbative QCD approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08783v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the electromagnetic and meson-photon transition form factors (TFF) of light pseudoscalar mesons from the perturbative QCD (pQCD) approach. To comprehensively account for both the longitudinal and transverse nonperturbative dynamics of hadronic constituents, we incorpoarate intrinsic transverse momentum distributions (iTMDs) alongside the conventional light-cone distribution amplitudes (LCDAs). The main motivations of this work are the disjointedness of electromagnetic form factors between the theoretical predictions and the experimental measurements, and the BaBar-Belle tension of pion-photon transition form factor in the large momentum transfers. Our calculation is carried out at the next-to-leading-order for the contributions from leading and subleading twist LCDAs, and leading order for the twist four contributions. Notably, this work presents the first systematic evaluation of higher-twist contributions to meson-photon TFFs. The key findings are: (a) iTMDs play a crucial role in describing form factor data, particularly in the small-to-intermediate momentum transfer region where they induce significant modifications to pQCD predictions. (b) The extracted transverse size parameters for valence quark states are found to be $\beta_\pi^2 = 0.51 \pm 0.04$ GeV$^{-2}$ and $\beta_K^2 = 0.30 \pm 0.05$ GeV$^{-2}$, the chiral mass of pion meson $m_0^\pi$ at $1$ GeV is determined to be $1.84 \pm 0.07$ GeV. (c) The meson-photon TFFs are predominantly governed by leading-twist LCDAs. The iTMDs-enhanced pQCD results show better agreement with Belle's pion TFF data across intermediate and large momentum transfers and favor a small $\eta-\eta^\prime$ mixing angle. (d) Remarkably, the inclusion of iTMDs extends the applicability of pQCD calculations down to a few GeV$^2$ for all considered form factors, significantly improving the theory-data consistency.</description>

      <title>Warm Inflation with the Standard Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18829v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show for the first time that warm inflation is feasible with Standard Model (SM) gauge interactions alone. Our model consists of a minimal extension of the SM by a single scalar inflaton field with an axion-like coupling to gluons and a monomial potential. The effects of light fermions, which were previously argued to render warm inflation with the SM impossible, are alleviated by Hubble dilution of their chiral chemical potentials. Our model only features one adjustable combination of parameters and accommodates all inflationary observables. We briefly discuss implications for axion experiments, dark matter, and the strong CP-problem.</description>

      <title>Two-loop Renormalization Group Equations in the $\nu$SMEFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00792v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We calculate two-loop renormalization group equations (RGEs) in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) with right-handed neutrinos, i.e., the so-called $\nu$SMEFT, up to dimension five. Besides the two-loop RGEs of dimension-five (dim-5) operators, we also present those of the renormalizable couplings, including contributions from dim-5 operators. We check consistency relations among the first and second poles of $\varepsilon \equiv (4-d)/2$ with $d$ being the space-time dimension for all renormalization constants and find that those for lepton doublet and right-handed neutrino wave-function renormalization constants, as well as for renormalization constants of charged-lepton and neutrino Yukawa coupling matrices, do not hold. This leads to divergent RG functions for these fields and Yuwawa coupling matrices. We figure out that such infinite RG functions arise from the non-invariance of fields and Yukawa coupling matrices under field redefinitions, considering that flavor transformations are a kind of linear field redefinitions. Those infinite RG functions will disappear once one restores contributions from the derivative of renormalization constants with respect to the Wilson coefficients of redundant operators or, alternatively, considers the RGEs of flavor invariants, which are physical quantities and remain invariant under field redefinitions.</description>

      <title>The Unitarity-Limit Expansion for Two Nucleons with Perturbative Pions: Digest and Ideas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13353v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the Unitarity Limit, the NN S-wave binding energies are zero, the scattering lengths infinite, Physics is universal, i.e. insensitive to details of the interactions, and observables display richer symmetries, namely invariance under both scaling and Wigner's combined SU(4) transformation of spin and isospin. This presentation is a digest of the first quantitative exploration of corrections to this picture when pions are included [1] (see there for a more comprehensive list of references). Since the pion mass and decay constant introduce dimensionful scales in the NN system, they explicitly break the symmetries of the Unitarity fixed point. In $\chi$EFT, these symmetries must therefore be classified as emergent. This text focuses on the $\chi$EFT variant with Perturbative ("KSW") Pions at next-to-next-to leading order (N2LO). This leads to the Hypothesis that both scale invariance and Wigner-SU(4) symmetry in the Unitarity Expansion show persistence, i.e. the footprint of both combined dominates even for $k\gtrsim m_\pi$ and is more relevant than chiral symmetry, so that the tensor/Wigner-SU(4) symmetry-breaking part of OPE is suppressed and does not enter before N3LO. Included are also ideas about underlying mechanisms and LO results of $\chi$EFT with Nonperturbative Pions in the expansion about Unitarity.</description>

      <title>Study of electron-positron annihilation into four pions within chiral effective field theory in the low energy region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00770v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we employ chiral effective field theory to study the process of electron-positron annihilation into four pions in the low energy region within $E_{c.m.}\leq 0.6$ GeV. The prediction of the cross-section is obtained through $SU(3)$ chiral perturbation theory up to the next-to-leading order, which is smaller than the experimental data in the energy region [0.6-0.65] GeV, though the data has only a few points and poor statistics. Then, the resonance chiral theory is applied to include the resonance contribution, with the lightest scalars and vectors written in the effective Lagrangians. A series of relevant decay widths and the masses of the vectors are studied to fix the unknown couplings. The resonance contribution should be one order larger than that of the chiral perturbation theory but still one to two orders smaller than the data. The significant discrepancy urged the new experimental measurements to give more guidance. We also compute the hadronic vacuum polarization contribution from the four pion channels to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, $(g-2)_\mu$. In the energy range from threshold up to 0.6 GeV within RChT, the contributions are $a_\mu=(0.6678\pm0.0933)\times10^{-16}$ and $a_\mu=(0.4575\pm0.0517)\times10^{-16}$ for the processes of $e^+e^-\to\pi^+\pi^+\pi^-\pi^-$, $\pi^0\pi^0\pi^+\pi^-$, respectively.</description>

      <title>Semi-inclusive direct photon+jet and $\pi^{0}$+jet correlations measured in $p+p$ and central Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}} = 200$ GeV</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.00145v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The STAR experiment at RHIC reports new measurements of jet quenching based on the semi-inclusive distribution of charged-particle jets recoiling from direct photon ($\gamma_{\rm dir}$) and neutral pion ($\pi^{0}$) triggers in pp and central Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=200$ GeV, for triggers in the range $9&lt;E_{\rm T}^{\rm trig}&lt;20$ GeV. The datasets have integrated luminosities of 3.9$ {\rm nb}^{-1}$ for Au+Au and 23$ {\rm pb}^{-1}$ for pp collisions. Jets are reconstructed using the anti-$k_{\rm T}$ algorithm with resolution parameters $R$=0.2 and 0.5. The large uncorrelated jet background in central Au+Au collisions is corrected using a mixed-event approach, which enables precise charged-particle jet measurements at low transverse momentum $p_{\rm T,jet}^{\rm ch}$ and large $R$. Recoil-jet distributions are reported in the range $p_{\rm T,jet}^{\rm ch}&lt;25$ \gev. Comparison of the distributions measured in pp and Au+Au collisions reveals strong medium-induced jet yield suppression for $R=0.2$, with markedly less suppression for $R=0.5$. Comparison is also made to theoretical models incorporating jet quenching. These data provide new insight into the mechanisms underlying jet quenching and the angular dependence of medium-induced jet-energy transport, and provide new constraints on modelling such effects.</description>

Abstract: Ultralight bosons can condense to form the so-called bosonic clouds around spinning black holes by superradiance instability. When quantum effects are taken into account, the classical black holes were replaced by exotic compact objects including area quantized black holes. In this work, we consider the superradiant instabilities of massive scalar fields around area quantized Kerr black hole. We introduce the reflectivity of area quantized black hole possesses the distinct discrete feature, and the scalar fields have the superradiant modes solution only within the specific mass range. In addition, the area quantization may terminate the superradiance when the black hole spins down, or even suppress the formation of the bosionic cloud.</description>

      <title>Daily modulations and broadband strategy in axion searches. An application with CAST-CAPP detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10972v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been previously advocated that the presence of the daily and annual modulations of the axion flux on the Earth's surface may dramatically change the strategy of the axion searches. The arguments were based on the so-called Axion Quark Nugget (AQN) dark matter model which was originally put forward to explain the similarity of the dark and visible cosmological matter densities $\Omega_{\rm dark}\sim \Omega_{\rm visible}$. In this framework, the population of galactic axions with mass $ 10^{-6} {\rm eV}\lesssim m_a\lesssim 10^{-3}{\rm eV}$ and velocity $\langle v_a\rangle\sim 10^{-3} c$ will be accompanied by axions with typical velocities $\langle v_a\rangle\sim 0.6 c$ emitted by AQNs. Furthermore, in this framework, it has also been argued that the AQN-induced axion daily modulation (in contrast with the conventional WIMP paradigm) could be as large as $(10-20)\%$, which represents the main motivation for the present investigation. We argue that the daily modulations along with the broadband detection strategy can be very useful tools for the discovery of such relativistic axions. The data from the CAST-CAPP detector have been used following such arguments. Unfortunately, due to the dependence of the amplifier chain on temperature-dependent gain drifts and other factors, we could not conclusively show the presence or absence of a dark sector-originated daily modulation. However, this proof of principle analysis procedure can serve as a reference for future studies.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Time-Dependent Instrumental Noise for LISA SGWB Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00832v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Variations in the instrumental noise of the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) over time are expected as a result of e.g. scheduled satellite operations or unscheduled glitches. We demonstrate that these fluctuations can be leveraged to improve the sensitivity to stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds (SGWBs) compared to the stationary noise scenario. This requires optimal use of data segments with downward noise fluctuations, and thus a data analysis pipeline capable of analysing and combining shorter time segments of mission data. We propose that simulation based inference is well suited for this challenge. In an approximate, but state-of-the-art, modeling setup, we show by comparison with Fisher Information Matrix estimates that the optimal information gain can be achieved in practice.</description>

      <title>Signatures of linearized gravity in atom interferometers: A simplified computational framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03828v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a general framework for calculating the leading-order, general relativistic contributions to the gravitational phase shift in single-photon atom interferometers within the context of linearized gravity. We show that the atom gradiometer observable, which only depends on the atom interferometer propagation phase, can be written in terms of three distinct contributions: the Doppler phase shift, which accounts for the tidal displacement of atoms along the baseline, the Shapiro phase shift, which accounts for the delay in the arrival time of photons at atom-light interaction points, and the Einstein phase shift, which accounts for the gravitational redshift measured by the atoms. For specific atom gradiometer configurations, we derive the signal and response functions for two physically motivated scenarios: (i) transient gravitational waves in the transverse-traceless gauge and, for the first time, in the proper detector frame, and (ii) transient massive objects sourcing weak and slow-varying Newtonian potentials. We find that the Doppler contribution of realistic Newtonian noise sources (e.g., a freight truck or a piece of space debris) at proposed atom gradiometer experiments, such as AION, MAGIS and AEDGE, can exceed the shot noise level and thus affect physics searches if not properly subtracted.</description>

      <title>Does Gauss-Bonnet Inflationary Gravitational Waves satisfy the Pulsar Timing Arrays observations?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07949v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The observations from pulsar timing arrays (PTAs), led by the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav), have provided opportunities to constrain primordial gravitational waves at low frequencies. In this paper, we analyze the best-fit parameter values for different Gauss-Bonnet Inflationary Gravitational Wave (GB-IGW) models with the PTArcade program, and we compare the results with the observations of NANOGrav, European Pulsar Timing Array (EPTA), Parkes Pulsar Timing Array (PPTA), and International Pulsar Timing Array (IPTA). We find the potential parameter $n$ derived from the GB-IGW model is not necessarily positive. Instead, PTA data suggest the possibility of new parameter ranges. Meanwhile, the other parameters' results, such as the spectral indices of the scalar and tensor perturbation also have differences with traditional Cosmic Microwave Background analyses from Planck 2018, showing the reason for the different phenomena of Gravitational Wave power spectra expected. Additionally, the GB-IGW models we calculated are closer to the central values of multiple PTA datasets compared to the standard inflation model, making the GB-IGW model more likely to be detected by future space-based gravitational wave observatories.</description>

      <title>An Explicit Categorical Construction of Instanton Density in Lattice Yang-Mills Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07195v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since the inception of lattice QCD, a natural definition for the Yang-Mills instanton on lattice has been long sought for. In a recent work, one of authors showed the natural solution has to be organized in terms of bundle gerbes in higher homotopy theory / higher category theory, and introduced the principles for such a categorical construction. To pave the way towards actual numerical implementation in the near future, nonetheless, an explicit construction is necessary. In this paper we provide such an explicit construction for $SU(2)$ gauge theory, with technical aspects inspired by L\"{u}scher's 1982 geometrical construction. We will see how the latter is in a suitable sense a saddle point approximation to the full categorical construction. The generalization to $SU(N)$ will be discussed. The construction also allows for a natural definition of lattice Chern-Simons-Yang-Mills theory in three spacetime dimensions.</description>

      <title>First Measurement of the Muon Neutrino Interaction Cross Section and Flux as a Function of Energy at the LHC with FASER</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03186v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This letter presents the measurement of the energy-dependent neutrino-nucleon cross section in tungsten and the differential flux of muon neutrinos and anti-neutrinos. The analysis is performed using proton-proton collision data at a center-of-mass energy of $13.6 \, {\rm TeV}$ and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $(65.6 \pm 1.4) \, \mathrm{fb^{-1}}$. Using the active electronic components of the FASER detector, $338.1 \pm 21.0$ charged current muon neutrino interaction events are identified, with backgrounds from other processes subtracted. We unfold the neutrino events into a fiducial volume corresponding to the sensitive regions of the FASER detector and interpret the results in two ways: We use the expected neutrino flux to measure the cross section, and we use the predicted cross section to measure the neutrino flux. Both results are presented in six bins of neutrino energy, achieving the first differential measurement in the TeV range. The observed distributions align with Standard Model predictions. Using this differential data, we extract the contributions of neutrinos from pion and kaon decays.</description>

      <title>Calorimetric analysis for long-baseline neutrino experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16325v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In neutrino long-baseline experiments the energy of the incoming neutrino must be reconstructed from observations of the final state. We first discuss the problems that arise for energy conservation during the final-state interactions in a momentum-dependent potential. We then show, for the example of the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment, that the presence of such a potential is necessarily connected with a large uncertainty in the reconstructed energy. This same uncertainty also affects the determination of energy- and four-momentum-transfers in neutrino-nucleus reactions. We analyze the origins of these uncertainties using transport theory for the description of the evolution of the final state of the reaction. We show that the spectral functions of target nuclei play an essential role not only for the initial neutrino-nucleus interaction but also for the final state evolution.</description>

      <title>Superallowed $0^+ \rightarrow 0^+$ $\beta$ decay studies at GANIL and upcoming opportunities with DESIR and S$^3$-LEB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14082v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Corrected transition rates ($\mathcal{F}t^{0^+ \rightarrow 0^+}$) of $0^+ \rightarrow 0^+$ superallowed $\beta$ decays currently give the most precise value of $V_{ud}$, the dominant term of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) quark mixing matrix. By setting stringent constrains on the CKM unitarity, these decays allow probing physics beyond the Standard Model in the electroweak sector. A recent global reevaluation of the $\mathcal{F}t^{0^+ \rightarrow 0^+}$ values has indicated a violation of CKM unitarity prompting reassessment of the theoretical radiative and isospin symmetry breaking corrections applied on the experimental transition rates $ft$. In this article we briefly discuss this current situation and the experimental program at GANIL geared towards constraining isospin symmetry breaking corrections. We conclude by presenting the opportunities that will be available at DESIR and S$^3$-LEB, the upcoming low-energy radioactive ion beam facilities at GANIL.</description>
