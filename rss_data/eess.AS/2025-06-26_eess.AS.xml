      <title>CodecSlime: Temporal Redundancy Compression of Neural Speech Codec via Dynamic Frame Rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural speech codecs have been widely used in audio compression and various downstream tasks. Current mainstream codecs are fixed-frame-rate (FFR), which allocate the same number of tokens to every equal-duration slice. However, speech is inherently non-uniform in temporal information density. As a result, many tokens are wasted on steady-state segments like long vowels and silences. To address this mismatch, we present CodecSlime, a plugin-style method for compressing temporal redundancy through supporting dynamic frame rate (DFR) on neural speech codecs for the first time. Our method is unsupervised and architecture-agnostic, combining two key innovations, ScheDFR and Melt-and-Cool, for adapting inference and training, respectively. When integrated into a typical VQ-GAN codec backbone and operating at 40 Hz DFR ($\approx$ 600 bps), the reconstruction WER of CodecSlime is reduced by up to 46% relative to conventional FFR baselines with the same model architecture and similar bitrates, while other metrics are also competitive. CodecSlime also enables flexible trade-offs between reconstruction quality and bitrate: a single model supports inference at multiple frame rates and consistently outperforms FFR models at the corresponding frame rates. Audio samples are available at https://acadarmeria.github.io/codecslime/.</description>

      <title>Post-training for Deepfake Speech Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a post-training approach that adapts self-supervised learning (SSL) models for deepfake speech detection by bridging the gap between general pre-training and domain-specific fine-tuning. We present AntiDeepfake models, a series of post-trained models developed using a large-scale multilingual speech dataset containing over 56,000 hours of genuine speech and 18,000 hours of speech with various artifacts in over one hundred languages. Experimental results show that the post-trained models already exhibit strong robustness and generalization to unseen deepfake speech. When they are further fine-tuned on the Deepfake-Eval-2024 dataset, these models consistently surpass existing state-of-the-art detectors that do not leverage post-training. Model checkpoints and source code are available online.</description>

      <title>Performance improvement of spatial semantic segmentation with enriched audio features and agent-based error correction for DCASE 2025 Challenge Task 4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This technical report presents submission systems for Task 4 of the DCASE 2025 Challenge. This model incorporates additional audio features (spectral roll-off and chroma features) into the embedding feature extracted from the mel-spectral feature to im-prove the classification capabilities of an audio-tagging model in the spatial semantic segmentation of sound scenes (S5) system. This approach is motivated by the fact that mixed audio often contains subtle cues that are difficult to capture with mel-spectrograms alone. Thus, these additional features offer alterna-tive perspectives for the model. Second, an agent-based label correction system is applied to the outputs processed by the S5 system. This system reduces false positives, improving the final class-aware signal-to-distortion ratio improvement (CA-SDRi) metric. Finally, we refine the training dataset to enhance the classi-fication accuracy of low-performing classes by removing irrele-vant samples and incorporating external data. That is, audio mix-tures are generated from a limited number of data points; thus, even a small number of out-of-class data points could degrade model performance. The experiments demonstrate that the submit-ted systems employing these approaches relatively improve CA-SDRi by up to 14.7% compared to the baseline of DCASE 2025 Challenge Task 4.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Deep Learning and Signal Processing for Arabic Dialect Recognition in Low-Resource Settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Arabic dialect recognition presents a significant challenge in speech technology due to the linguistic diversity of Arabic and the scarcity of large annotated datasets, particularly for underrepresented dialects. This research investigates hybrid modeling strategies that integrate classical signal processing techniques with deep learning architectures to address this problem in low-resource scenarios. Two hybrid models were developed and evaluated: (1) Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) combined with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and (2) Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) features combined with a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). The models were trained on a dialect-filtered subset of the Common Voice Arabic dataset, with dialect labels assigned based on speaker metadata. Experimental results demonstrate that the MFCC + CNN architecture achieved superior performance, with an accuracy of 91.2% and strong precision, recall, and F1-scores, significantly outperforming the Wavelet + RNN configuration, which achieved an accuracy of 66.5%. These findings highlight the effectiveness of leveraging spectral features with convolutional models for Arabic dialect recognition, especially when working with limited labeled data. The study also identifies limitations related to dataset size, potential regional overlaps in labeling, and model optimization, providing a roadmap for future research. Recommendations for further improvement include the adoption of larger annotated corpora, integration of self-supervised learning techniques, and exploration of advanced neural architectures such as Transformers. Overall, this research establishes a strong baseline for future developments in Arabic dialect recognition within resource-constrained environments.</description>

      <title>ThinkSound: Chain-of-Thought Reasoning in Multimodal Large Language Models for Audio Generation and Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While end-to-end video-to-audio generation has greatly improved, producing high-fidelity audio that authentically captures the nuances of visual content remains challenging. Like professionals in the creative industries, such generation requires sophisticated reasoning about items such as visual dynamics, acoustic environments, and temporal relationships. We present \textbf{ThinkSound}, a novel framework that leverages Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to enable stepwise, interactive audio generation and editing for videos. Our approach decomposes the process into three complementary stages: foundational foley generation that creates semantically coherent soundscapes, interactive object-centric refinement through precise user interactions, and targeted editing guided by natural language instructions. At each stage, a multimodal large language model generates contextually aligned CoT reasoning that guides a unified audio foundation model. Furthermore, we introduce \textbf{AudioCoT}, a comprehensive dataset with structured reasoning annotations that establishes connections between visual content, textual descriptions, and sound synthesis. Experiments demonstrate that ThinkSound achieves state-of-the-art performance in video-to-audio generation across both audio metrics and CoT metrics and excels in out-of-distribution Movie Gen Audio benchmark.

      <title>A Multi-Stage Framework for Multimodal Controllable Speech Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controllable speech synthesis aims to control the style of generated speech using reference input, which can be of various modalities. Existing face-based methods struggle with robustness and generalization due to data quality constraints, while text prompt methods offer limited diversity and fine-grained control. Although multimodal approaches aim to integrate various modalities, their reliance on fully matched training data significantly constrains their performance and applicability. This paper proposes a 3-stage multimodal controllable speech synthesis framework to address these challenges. For face encoder, we use supervised learning and knowledge distillation to tackle generalization issues. Furthermore, the text encoder is trained on both text-face and text-speech data to enhance the diversity of the generated speech. Experimental results demonstrate that this method outperforms single-modal baseline methods in both face based and text prompt based speech synthesis, highlighting its effectiveness in generating high-quality speech.</description>

      <title>Step-by-Step Video-to-Audio Synthesis via Negative Audio Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel step-by-step video-to-audio generation method that sequentially produces individual audio tracks, each corresponding to a specific sound event in the video. Our approach mirrors traditional Foley workflows, aiming to capture all sound events induced by a given video comprehensively. Each generation step is formulated as a guided video-to-audio synthesis task, conditioned on a target text prompt and previously generated audio tracks. This design is inspired by the idea of concept negation from prior compositional generation frameworks. To enable this guided generation, we introduce a training framework that leverages pre-trained video-to-audio models and eliminates the need for specialized paired datasets, allowing training on more accessible data. Experimental results demonstrate that our method generates multiple semantically distinct audio tracks for a single input video, leading to higher-quality composite audio synthesis than existing baselines.</description>

      <title>PeakNetFP: Peak-based Neural Audio Fingerprinting Robust to Extreme Time Stretching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces PeakNetFP, the first neural audio fingerprinting (AFP) system designed specifically around spectral peaks. This novel system is designed to leverage the sparse spectral coordinates typically computed by traditional peak-based AFP methods. PeakNetFP performs hierarchical point feature extraction techniques similar to the computer vision model PointNet++, and is trained using contrastive learning like in the state-of-the-art deep learning AFP, NeuralFP. This combination allows PeakNetFP to outperform conventional AFP systems and achieves comparable performance to NeuralFP when handling challenging time-stretched audio data. In extensive evaluation, PeakNetFP maintains a Top-1 hit rate of over 90% for stretching factors ranging from 50% to 200%. Moreover, PeakNetFP offers significant efficiency advantages: compared to NeuralFP, it has 100 times fewer parameters and uses 11 times smaller input data. These features make PeakNetFP a lightweight and efficient solution for AFP tasks where time stretching is involved. Overall, this system represents a promising direction for future AFP technologies, as it successfully merges the lightweight nature of peak-based AFP with the adaptability and pattern recognition capabilities of neural network-based approaches, paving the way for more scalable and efficient solutions in the field.</description>

      <title>A Hierarchical Deep Learning Approach for Minority Instrument Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying instrument activities within audio excerpts is vital in music information retrieval, with significant implications for music cataloging and discovery. Prior deep learning endeavors in musical instrument recognition have predominantly emphasized instrument classes with ample data availability. Recent studies have demonstrated the applicability of hierarchical classification in detecting instrument activities in orchestral music, even with limited fine-grained annotations at the instrument level. Based on the Hornbostel-Sachs classification, such a hierarchical classification system is evaluated using the MedleyDB dataset, renowned for its diversity and richness concerning various instruments and music genres. This work presents various strategies to integrate hierarchical structures into models and tests a new class of models for hierarchical music prediction. This study showcases more reliable coarse-level instrument detection by bridging the gap between detailed instrument identification and group-level recognition, paving the way for further advancements in this domain.</description>

      <title>Prompt-Guided Turn-Taking Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Turn-taking prediction models are essential components in spoken dialogue systems and conversational robots. Recent approaches leverage transformer-based architectures to predict speech activity continuously and in real-time. In this study, we propose a novel model that enables turn-taking prediction to be dynamically controlled via textual prompts. This approach allows intuitive and explicit control through instructions such as "faster" or "calmer" adapting dynamically to conversational partners and contexts. The proposed model builds upon a transformer-based voice activity projection (VAP) model, incorporating textual prompt embeddings into both channel-wise transformers and a cross-channel transformer. We evaluated the feasibility of our approach using over 950 hours of human-human spoken dialogue data. Since textual prompt data for the proposed approach was not available in existing datasets, we utilized a large language model (LLM) to generate synthetic prompt sentences. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed model improved prediction accuracy and effectively varied turn-taking timing behaviors according to the textual prompts.</description>

      <title>Integrating Vehicle Acoustic Data for Enhanced Urban Traffic Management: A Study on Speed Classification in Suzhou</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents and publicly releases the Suzhou Urban Road Acoustic Dataset (SZUR-Acoustic Dataset), which is accompanied by comprehensive data-acquisition protocols and annotation guidelines to ensure transparency and reproducibility of the experimental workflow. To model the coupling between vehicular noise and driving speed, we propose a bimodal-feature-fusion deep convolutional neural network (BMCNN). During preprocessing, an adaptive denoising and normalization strategy is applied to suppress environmental background interference; in the network architecture, parallel branches extract Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) and wavelet-packet energy features, which are subsequently fused via a cross-modal attention mechanism in the intermediate feature space to fully exploit time-frequency information. Experimental results demonstrate that BMCNN achieves a classification accuracy of 87.56% on the SZUR-Acoustic Dataset and 96.28% on the public IDMT-Traffic dataset. Ablation studies and robustness tests on the Suzhou dataset further validate the contributions of each module to performance improvement and overfitting mitigation. The proposed acoustics-based speed classification method can be integrated into smart-city traffic management systems for real-time noise monitoring and speed estimation, thereby optimizing traffic flow control, reducing roadside noise pollution, and supporting sustainable urban planning.</description>

      <title>Exploring Adapter Design Tradeoffs for Low Resource Music Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fine-tuning large-scale music generation models, such as MusicGen and Mustango, is a computationally expensive process, often requiring updates to billions of parameters and, therefore, significant hardware resources. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques, particularly adapter-based methods, have emerged as a promising alternative, enabling adaptation with minimal trainable parameters while preserving model performance. However, the design choices for adapters, including their architecture, placement, and size, are numerous, and it is unclear which of these combinations would produce optimal adapters and why, for a given case of low-resource music genre. In this paper, we attempt to answer this question by studying various adapter configurations for two AI music models, MusicGen and Mustango, on two genres: Hindustani Classical and Turkish Makam music.
  Our findings reveal distinct trade-offs: convolution-based adapters excel in capturing fine-grained local musical details such as ornamentations and short melodic phrases, while transformer-based adapters better preserve long-range dependencies crucial for structured improvisation. Additionally, we analyze computational resource requirements across different adapter scales, demonstrating how mid-sized adapters (40M parameters) achieve an optimal balance between expressivity and quality. Furthermore, we find that Mustango, a diffusion-based model, generates more diverse outputs with better adherence to the description in the input prompt while lacking in providing stability in notes, rhythm alignment, and aesthetics. Also, it is computationally intensive and requires significantly more time to train. In contrast, autoregressive models like MusicGen offer faster training and are more efficient, and can produce better quality output in comparison, but have slightly higher redundancy in their generations.</description>

      <title>Learnable Adaptive Time-Frequency Representation via Differentiable Short-Time Fourier Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The short-time Fourier transform (STFT) is widely used for analyzing non-stationary signals. However, its performance is highly sensitive to its parameters, and manual or heuristic tuning often yields suboptimal results. To overcome this limitation, we propose a unified differentiable formulation of the STFT that enables gradient-based optimization of its parameters. This approach addresses the limitations of traditional STFT parameter tuning methods, which often rely on computationally intensive discrete searches. It enables fine-tuning of the time-frequency representation (TFR) based on any desired criterion. Moreover, our approach integrates seamlessly with neural networks, allowing joint optimization of the STFT parameters and network weights. The efficacy of the proposed differentiable STFT in enhancing TFRs and improving performance in downstream tasks is demonstrated through experiments on both simulated and real-world data.</description>

      <title>Aligning Spoken Dialogue Models from User Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel preference alignment framework for improving spoken dialogue models on real-time conversations from user interactions. Current preference learning methods primarily focus on text-based language models, and are not directly suited to the complexities of real-time speech interactions, with richer dynamics (e.g. interruption, interjection) and no explicit segmentation between speaker turns.We create a large-scale dataset of more than 150,000 preference pairs from raw multi-turn speech conversations, annotated with AI feedback, to cover preferences over both linguistic content and temporal context variations. We leverage offline alignment methods to finetune a full-duplex autoregressive speech-to-speech model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that feedback on generic conversations can be consistently effective in improving spoken dialogue models to produce more factual, safer and more contextually aligned interactions. We deploy the finetuned model and conduct holistic human evaluations to assess the impact beyond single-turn conversations. Our findings shed light on the importance of a well-calibrated balance among various dynamics, crucial for natural real-time speech dialogue systems.</description>

      <title>Aliasing Reduction in Neural Amp Modeling by Smoothing Activations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04082v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasing demand for high-quality digital emulations of analog audio hardware, such as vintage tube guitar amplifiers, led to numerous works on neural network-based black-box modeling, with deep learning architectures like WaveNet showing promising results. However, a key limitation in all of these models was the aliasing artifacts stemming from nonlinear activation functions in neural networks. In this paper, we investigated novel and modified activation functions aimed at mitigating aliasing within neural amplifier models. Supporting this, we introduced a novel metric, the Aliasing-to-Signal Ratio (ASR), which quantitatively assesses the level of aliasing with high accuracy. Measuring also the conventional Error-to-Signal Ratio (ESR), we conducted studies on a range of preexisting and modern activation functions with varying stretch factors. Our findings confirmed that activation functions with smoother curves tend to achieve lower ASR values, indicating a noticeable reduction in aliasing. Notably, this improvement in aliasing reduction was achievable without a substantial increase in ESR, demonstrating the potential for high modeling accuracy with reduced aliasing in neural amp models.</description>

      <title>ITO-Master: Inference-Time Optimization for Audio Effects Modeling of Music Mastering Processors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16889v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Music mastering style transfer aims to model and apply the mastering characteristics of a reference track to a target track, simulating the professional mastering process. However, existing methods apply fixed processing based on a reference track, limiting users' ability to fine-tune the results to match their artistic intent. In this paper, we introduce the ITO-Master framework, a reference-based mastering style transfer system that integrates Inference-Time Optimization (ITO) to enable finer user control over the mastering process. By optimizing the reference embedding during inference, our approach allows users to refine the output dynamically, making micro-level adjustments to achieve more precise mastering results. We explore both black-box and white-box methods for modeling mastering processors and demonstrate that ITO improves mastering performance across different styles. Through objective evaluation, subjective listening tests, and qualitative analysis using text-based conditioning with CLAP embeddings, we validate that ITO enhances mastering style similarity while offering increased adaptability. Our framework provides an effective and user-controllable solution for mastering style transfer, allowing users to refine their results beyond the initial style transfer.</description>

      <title>TCDiff++: An End-to-end Trajectory-Controllable Diffusion Model for Harmonious Music-Driven Group Choreography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18671v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Music-driven dance generation has garnered significant attention due to its wide range of industrial applications, particularly in the creation of group choreography. During the group dance generation process, however, most existing methods still face three primary issues: multi-dancer collisions, single-dancer foot sliding and abrupt swapping in the generation of long group dance. In this paper, we propose TCDiff++, a music-driven end-to-end framework designed to generate harmonious group dance. Specifically, to mitigate multi-dancer collisions, we utilize a dancer positioning embedding to better maintain the relative positioning among dancers. Additionally, we incorporate a distance-consistency loss to ensure that inter-dancer distances remain within plausible ranges. To address the issue of single-dancer foot sliding, we introduce a swap mode embedding to indicate dancer swapping patterns and design a Footwork Adaptor to refine raw motion, thereby minimizing foot sliding. For long group dance generation, we present a long group diffusion sampling strategy that reduces abrupt position shifts by injecting positional information into the noisy input. Furthermore, we integrate a Sequence Decoder layer to enhance the model's ability to selectively process long sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our TCDiff++ achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in long-duration scenarios, ensuring high-quality and coherent group dance generation.</description>

      <title>IndieFake Dataset: A Benchmark Dataset for Audio Deepfake Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19014v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Advancements in audio deepfake technology offers benefits like AI assistants, better accessibility for speech impairments, and enhanced entertainment. However, it also poses significant risks to security, privacy, and trust in digital communications. Detecting and mitigating these threats requires comprehensive datasets. Existing datasets lack diverse ethnic accents, making them inadequate for many real-world scenarios. Consequently, models trained on these datasets struggle to detect audio deepfakes in diverse linguistic and cultural contexts such as in South-Asian countries. Ironically, there is a stark lack of South-Asian speaker samples in the existing datasets despite constituting a quarter of the worlds population. This work introduces the IndieFake Dataset (IFD), featuring 27.17 hours of bonafide and deepfake audio from 50 English speaking Indian speakers. IFD offers balanced data distribution and includes speaker-level characterization, absent in datasets like ASVspoof21 (DF). We evaluated various baselines on IFD against existing ASVspoof21 (DF) and In-The-Wild (ITW) datasets. IFD outperforms ASVspoof21 (DF) and proves to be more challenging compared to benchmark ITW dataset. The complete dataset, along with documentation and sample reference clips, is publicly accessible for research use on project website.</description>
