      <title>Lineshape-asymmetry-caused shift in atomic interferometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the shift caused by asymmetry of spectroscopic lineshape in atomic interferometers, which has not previously been discussed in the scientific literature. This asymmetry arises because laser field is frequency-chirped not only during the free-evolution intervals of atoms, but also during the Ramsey pulses. As a result, the effective detuning from the working atomic transition during the pulses also depends on the chirping rate, which, in turn, leads to the lineshape-asymmetry-caused shift (LACS). It is shown that this shift has an inverse cubic dependence of $\propto 1/T^3$ on the duration of the interval between the Ramsey pulses $T$, which markedly contrasts with the $\propto 1/T^2$ dependence typical in atomic interferometry. Therefore, the metrological importance of this shift substantially increases for compact atomic interferometers with a short baseline. For example, for interferometers-gravimeters using two-photon transitions in rubidium atoms, at $T\sim 1$~ms we estimate the LACS shift and its variations at the level of 0.1-1~mGal, while for $T\sim 100$~$\mu$s this can reach a value of 0.1-1~Gal.</description>

      <title>Real-time phase control methods for cold-atom interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present two methods to achieve real-time inertial phase compensation in atom interferometers. Both methods, based on jumps of the position of the retroreflection mirror or frequencies of Raman lasers, demonstrate similar state-of-the-art performance on our cold atom gyroscope, comparable to that of the reference method based on optical phase jumps. These alternative approaches broaden the scope of applications for real-time inertial phase compensation methods in atomic interferometers, particularly for space applications.</description>

      <title>Collapse of Coulomb Bound States of Vector Bosons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Charged spin 1 (vector) particles behave very differently from electrons or scalars in a Coulomb field. For an infinitely heavy point-like nucleus their bound state wave functions fall to the centre, and embedding the system in a renormalisable electroweak-type theory does not remedy this short-distance pathology. We therefore solve the pure Coulomb problem for a finite nuclear radius $R$ and recover the point nucleus limit by letting $R\to 0$. This approach allows us to include the crucial Upsilon term in the wave equations, which for the point-like nucleus is proportional to delta(r) and was ignored in the previous calculations of the energy spectrum. Several unusual effects emerge: (i) The Upsilon term supports a tower of states located mainly inside the nucleus. As R -&gt; 0 their number diverges, most lying in the negative energy continuum (energy epsilon &lt; - m c^2). They trigger vacuum breakdown - particle-antiparticle pair creation that ultimately screens the nuclear charge.
  (ii) Ordinary Sommerfeld-like states (with binding energy smaller m c^2) persist, but a finite fraction of each wave function leaks into the nucleus, even as R -&gt; 0.
  (iii) Charge density of a negatively charged vector particle changes sign in a vicinity of the nucleus and becomes positive charge density, whereas the Upsilon term ensures its density inside the nucleus remains negative.
  (iv) For weak coupling, Z alpha &lt;&lt; 1, yet with mR &lt;Z alpha, the non-relativistic solution differs qualitatively from Schrodinger theory despite binding energies are well below m c^2; agreement is recovered only when Z alpha &lt;&lt; mR.
  These phenomena highlight the distinctive and subtle behaviour of spin-1 particles in the Coulomb field.</description>

      <title>Quantum sensing of high-frequency gravitational waves with ion crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A detection method for high-frequency gravitational waves using two-dimensional ion crystals is investigated. Gravitational waves can resonantly excite the drumhead modes of the ion crystal, particularly the parity-odd modes. In the optical dipole force protocol, entanglement between the drumhead modes and the collective spins transfers the excitation of the drumhead modes to the rotation of the total spin. Furthermore, gravitational wave detection beyond the standard quantum limit becomes possible as a squeezed spin state is generated through this entanglement. The sensitivity gets better with a larger ions crystals as well as a larger number of the ions. Future realization of large ion crystals can significantly improve the sensitivity to gravitational waves in the 10 kHz to 10 MHz region.</description>

      <title>Non-Dichroic Enantio-Sensitive Chiroptical Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chiroptical effects using circularly polarized light produce signals that change sign when switching either molecular handedness (enantiosensitivity) or the light helicity (circular dichroism). Here, we break this enantiosensitive-and-dichroic paradigm by measuring a new type of chiroptical signal which is enantiosensitive but not dichroic. We photoionize chiral molecules using a strong laser field and detect the three-dimensional photoelectron momentum distribution. The non-dichroic, enantiosensitive asymmetry is encoded in octupolar and higher multipolar terms in the photoelectron angular distribution, which appear in multiphoton ionization with elliptically polarized fields or cross polarized two-color fields. The robustness of the enantiosensitivity with respect to the relative phase between the vectorial components of the ionizing field represents an example of symmetry protection, and opens unexplored opportunities for imaging ultrafast dynamics in chiral molecules, such as enantiosensitive photoelectron spectroscopy with bright squeezed vacuum states.</description>

      <title>A fast, large-scale optimal transport algorithm for holographic beam shaping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimal transport methods have recently established state of the art accuracy and efficiency for holographic laser beam shaping. However, use of such methods is hindered by severe $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ memory and $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ time requirements for large scale input or output images with $N$ total pixels. Here we leverage the dual formulation of the optimal transport problem and the separable structure of the cost to implement algorithms with greatly reduced $\mathcal{O}(N)$ memory and $\mathcal{O}(N\log N)$ to $\mathcal{O}(N^{3/2})$ time complexity. These algorithms are parallelizable and can solve megapixel-scale beam shaping problems in tens of seconds on a CPU or seconds on a GPU.</description>

      <title>Reactive near-field subwavelength microwave imaging with a non-invasive Rydberg probe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-invasive microwave field imaging--accurately mapping field distributions without perturbing them--is essential in areas such as aerospace engineering, biomedical imaging and integrated-circuit diagnostics. Conventional metal probes, however, inevitably perturb reactive near fields: they act as strong scatterers that drive induced currents and secondary radiation, remap evanescent components and thereby degrade both accuracy and spatial resolution, particularly in the reactive near-field regime that is most relevant to these applications. Here we demonstrate, to our knowledge for the first time, reactive near-field subwavelength imaging of microwave fields using the quantum non-demolition properties of Rydberg atoms, realized with a compact, non-invasive single-ended fibre-integrated Rydberg probe engineered to minimize field disturbance. The probe achieves an imaging resolution of {\unboldmath$\lambda/56$}, and the measured field distributions agree with full-wave simulations with structural similarity approaching unity, confirming both its subwavelength spatial resolution and its genuinely non-invasive character compared with conventional metal-based probes. Because the atomic sensor is intrinsically isotropic, the same device can faithfully image multi-dimensional field structures without orientation-dependent calibration. Our results therefore establish a general, non-invasive route to high-accuracy, subwavelength reactive near-field microwave imaging, with particular promise for applications such as chip-defect detection and integrated-circuit diagnostics, where even small perturbations by the probe can mask the underlying physics of interest.</description>

      <title>Single Sr Atoms in Optical Tweezer Arrays for Quantum Simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19816v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on the realization of a platform for trapping and manipulating individual $^{88}$Sr atoms in optical tweezers. A first cooling stage based on a blue shielded magneto-optical trap (MOT) operating on the $^1S_0$ -&gt; $^1P_1$ transition at 461 nm enables us to trap approximately $4\times 10^6$ atoms at a temperature of 6.8 mK. Further cooling is achieved in a narrow-line red MOT using the $^1S_0$ -&gt; $^3P_1$ intercombination transition at 689 nm, bringing $4\times 10^5$ atoms down to 5 $\mu$K and reaching a density of $\approx 10^{10}$ cm$^{-3}$. Atoms are then loaded into 813 nm tweezer arrays generated by crossed acousto-optic deflectors and tightly focused onto the atoms with a high-numerical-aperture objective. Through light-assisted collision processes we achieve the collisional blockade, which leads to single-atom occupancy with a probability of about $50\%$. The trapped atoms are detected via fluorescence imaging with a fidelity of $99.986(6)\%$, while maintaining a survival probability of $97(2)\%$. The release-and-recapture measurement provides a temperature of $12.92(5)$ $\mu$K for the atoms in the tweezers, and the ultra-high-vacuum environment ensures a vacuum lifetime higher than 7 min. These results demonstrate a robust alkaline-earth tweezer platform that combines efficient loading, cooling, and high-fidelity detection, providing the essential building blocks for scalable quantum simulation and quantum information processing with Sr atoms.</description>

      <title>Classical and quantum beam dynamics simulation of the RF photoinjector test bench</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00732v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present beam-dynamics simulations for an S-band RF photoinjector test bench under development at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research. The facility is intended to produce high-quality electron beams and to enable future generation of relativistic vortex electrons carrying quantized orbital angular momentum (OAM). Simulations of a 1.5-cell RF photogun operating at the currently available accelerating gradient of 45 MV/m demonstrate stable bunch formation at low bunch charge (Q = 0.63 pC), where space-charge effects are weak and the transverse emittance is primarily determined by RF-induced correlations. Optimization of the injection phase and the cathode-region solenoid field results in a robust emittance-compensated regime, yielding a final normalized emittance of 3.2 pi mm mrad. To evaluate the prospects for accelerating vortex electron beams, we further model the quantum evolution of single-electron Laguerre-Gaussian wave packets. The simulations show that acceleration to the multi-MeV energy range significantly suppresses free-space wave-packet spreading and preserves the initial OAM structure, indicating that the proposed test bench provides suitable conditions for forthcoming experimental studies of relativistic vortex electrons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02925v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen discussed their paradox in terms of measuring the positions or momenta of two particles. These degrees of freedom can become entangled upon scattering, but how much entanglement can be created in this process? Here we address this question using fully coherent calculations of bipartite scattering in three-dimensional space, quantifying entanglement by the inverse of the single particle purity. We show that the standard plane-wave description of scattering fails to capture the entanglement properties, due to the essential role of quantum uncertainty in the initial state. For a more realistic description of a scattering setup, we find that the entanglement scales linearly with the scattering cross section, including strong enhancement near shape resonances, for sufficiently narrow initial momentum dispersion. We highlight the differences between scattering in one and higher spatial dimensions and discuss how the generation of motional entanglement can be detected in experiments. Our results open the way to probing, controlling, and eventually using entanglement in quantum collisions.</description>

      <title>Superradiant decay in non-Markovian Waveguide Quantum Electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22332v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An array of initially excited emitters coupled to a one-dimensional waveguide exhibits superradiant decay under the Born-Markov approximation, manifested as a coherent burst of photons in the output field. In this work, we employ tensor-network methods to investigate its non-Markovian dynamics induced by finite time delays in photon exchange among the emitters. We find that the superradiant burst breaks into a structured train of correlated photons, each intensity peak corresponding to a specific photon number. We quantify the emitter-photon and emitter-emitter entanglement generated during this process and show that the latter emerges in the long-time limit, as part of the excitation becomes trapped within the emitters' singlet subspace. We finally consider the decay of the system's most radiant state, the symmetric Dicke state, and show that time delay can lead to decay rates exceeding those predicted by the Markovian approximation.</description>
