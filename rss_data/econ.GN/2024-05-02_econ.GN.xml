      <title>Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Mortgage Lending: New Evidence from Expanded HMDA Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates gaps in access to and the cost of housing credit by race and ethnicity using the near universe of U.S. mortgage applications. Our data contain borrower creditworthiness variables that have historically been absent from industry-wide application data and that are likely to affect application approval and loan pricing. We find large unconditional disparities in approval and pricing between racial and ethnic groups. After conditioning on key elements of observable borrower creditworthiness, these disparities are smaller but remain economically meaningful. Sensitivity analysis indicates that omitted factors as predictive of approval/pricing and race/ethnicity as credit score can explain some of the pricing disparities but cannot explain the approval disparities. Taken together, our results suggest that credit score, income, and down payment requirements significantly contribute to disparities in mortgage access and affordability but that other systemic barriers are also responsible for a large share of disparate outcomes in the mortgage market.</description>

      <title>Does Financial Literacy Impact Investment Participation and Retirement Planning in Japan?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By employing causal discovery method, the Fast Causal Inference (FCI) model to analyze data from the 2022 "Financial Literacy Survey," we explore the causal relationships between financial literacy and financial activities, specifically investment participation and retirement planning. Our findings indicate that increasing financial literacy may not directly boost engagement in financial investments or retirement planning in Japan, which underscores the necessity for alternative strategies to motivate financial activities among Japanese households. This research offers valuable insights for policymakers focused on improving financial well-being by advancing the use of causal discovery algorithms in understanding financial behaviors.</description>

      <title>Modelling user behavior towards smartphones and wearable technologies: A bibliometric study and brief literature review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study uses bibliometric as well as content analysis to determine the current situation regarding the application of technology adoption models (i.e., the Technology Acceptance Model, Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology, and Innovation Diffusion Theory) to the smartphone market that also includes smart wearables. Hereby the author would like to determine the connection between smartphone usage and adoption models and enrich literature by defining state-of-the-art tendencies and approaches. To achieve the goal, the author applied a two-stage approach: in the first stage, 213 articles were analyzed using Citation and Bibliographic coupling tools in VOSviewer (1.6.20). The papers were selected from the Scopus database and the search of the papers was conducted in the fields of Economics, Business, and Computer technologies. In the second stage, the author conducted a brief literature review of the most influential papers. The results illustrate the situation regarding the implementation of different models in the case of smartphone adoption. Content analyses of the most influential papers were applied to explain and enrich the results of bibliometric analyses as well as determine research gaps and future research development.</description>
