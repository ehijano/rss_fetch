      <title>Global Dynamics Of Quadratic And Cubic Planar Quasi-homogeneous Differential Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we obtain the global dynamics and phase portraits of quadratic and cubic quasi-homogeneous but non-homogeneous systems. We first prove that all planar quadratic and cubic quasi-homogeneous but non-homogeneous polynomial systems can be reduced to three homogeneous ones. Then for the homogeneous systems, we employ blow-up method, normal sector method, Poincar\'e compactification and other techniques to discuss their dynamics. Finally we characterize the global phase portraits of quadratic and cubic quasi-homogeneous but non-homogeneous polynomial systems.</description>

      <title>Ubiquitous Asymptotic Robustness in Biochemical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Living systems maintain stable internal states despite environmental fluctuations. Absolute concentration robustness (ACR) is a striking homeostatic phenomenon in which the steady-state concentration of a molecular species remains entirely invariant to changes in total molecular supply. Although experimental studies have reported approximate -- but not exact -- robustness in steady-state concentrations, such behavior has often been attributed to exact ACR motifs perturbed by measurement noise or minor side reactions, rather than recognized as a structural property of the network itself. In this work, we highlight a previously underappreciated phenomenon, which we term {\em asymptotic ACR} (or {\em aACR}): approximate robustness can emerge solely from the architecture of the reaction network, without requiring parameters being negligible or the presence of an exact ACR motif. We find that aACR is far more common than classical ACR, as demonstrated in systems such as the \textit{Escherichia coli} EnvZ-OmpR system and MAPK signaling cascade. Furthermore, we mathematically prove that such ubiquity stems solely from network structures. Finally, we reveal a counterintuitive feature of aACR in systems with multiple conserved quantities, revealing subtle distinctions in how robustness manifests in complex biochemical networks.</description>

      <title>Products of exact dynamical systems and Lorentzian continued fractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a new continued fraction system in Minkowski space $\mathbb R^{1,1}$, proving convergence, ergodicity with respect to an explicit invariant measure, and Lagrange's theorem. The proof of ergodicity leads us to the question of exactness for products of dynamical systems. Under technical assumptions, namely Renyi's condition, we show that products of exact dynamical systems are again exact, allowing us to study $\alpha$-type perturbations of the system. In addition, we describe new CF systems in $\mathbb R^{1,1}$ and $\mathbb R^{2,1}\cong \mathrm{Sym}_2(\mathbb R)$ that, based on experimental evidence, we conjecture to be convergent and ergodic with respect to a finite invariant measure.</description>

      <title>Modeling extreme events and intermittency in turbulent diffusion with a mean gradient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the statistical properties of passive tracer transport in turbulent flows with a mean gradient, emphasizing tracer intermittency and extreme events. An analytically tractable model is developed, coupling zonal and shear velocity components with both linear and nonlinear stochastic dynamics. Formulating the model in Fourier space, a simple explicit solution for the tracer invariant statistics is derived. Through this model we identify the resonance condition responsible for non-Gaussian behavior and bursts in the tracer. Resonant conditions, that lead to a peak in the tracer variance, occur when the zonal flow and the shear flow phase speeds are equivalent. Numerical experiments across a range of regimes, including different energy spectra and zonal flow models, are performed to validate these findings and demonstrate how the velocity field and stochasticity determines tracer extremes. These results provide additional insight into the mechanisms underlying turbulent tracer transport, with implications for uncertainty quantification and data assimilation in geophysical and environmental applications.</description>

      <title>Some iterative algorithms on Riemannian manifolds and Banach spaces with good global convergence guarantee</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce some new iterative optimisation algorithms on Riemannian manifolds and Hilbert spaces which have good global convergence guarantees to local minima. More precisely, these algorithms have the following properties: If $\{x_n\}$ is a sequence constructed by one such algorithm then:
  - Finding critical points: Any cluster point of $\{x_n\}$ is a critical point of the cost function $f$.
  - Convergence guarantee: Under suitable assumptions, the sequence $\{x_n\}$ either converges to a point $x^*$, or diverges to $\infty$.
  - Avoidance of saddle points: If $x_0$ is randomly chosen, then the sequence $\{x_n\}$ cannot converge to a saddle point.
  Our results apply for quite general situations: the cost function $f$ is assumed to be only $C^2$ or $C^3$, and either $f$ has at most countably many critical points (which is a generic situation) or satisfies certain Lojasiewicz gradient inequalities. To illustrate the results, we provide a nice application with optimisation over the unit sphere in a Euclidean space.
  As for tools needed for the results, in the Riemannian manifold case we introduce a notion of "strong local retraction" and (to deal with Newton's method type) a notion of "real analytic-like strong local retraction". In the case of Banach spaces, we introduce a slight generalisation of the notion of "shyness", and design a new variant of Backtracking New Q-Newton's method which is more suitable to the infinite dimensional setting (and in the Euclidean setting is simpler than the current versions).</description>

      <title>Continuity and approximability of competitive spectral radii</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The competitive spectral radius extends the notion of joint spectral radius to the two-player case: two players alternatively select matrices in prescribed compact sets, resulting in an infinite matrix product; one player wishes to maximize the growth rate of this product, whereas the other player wishes to minimize it. We show that when the matrices represent linear operators preserving a cone and satisfying a "strict positivity" assumption, the competitive spectral radius depends continuously - and even in a Lipschitz-continuous way - on the matrix sets. Moreover, we show that the competive spectral radius can be approximated up to any accuracy. This relies on the solution of a discretized infinite dimensional non-linear eigenproblem. We illustrate the approach with an example of age-structured population dynamics.</description>

      <title>On the Intractability of Chaotic Symbolic Walks: Toward a Non-Algebraic Post-Quantum Hardness Assumption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most classical and post-quantum cryptographic assumptions, including integer factorization, discrete logarithms, and Learning with Errors (LWE), rely on algebraic structures such as rings or vector spaces. While mathematically powerful, these structures can be exploited by quantum algorithms or advanced algebraic attacks, raising a pressing need for structure-free alternatives. To address this gap, we introduce the Symbolic Path Inversion Problem (SPIP), a new computational hardness assumption based on symbolic trajectories generated by contractive affine maps with bounded noise over Z2. Unlike traditional systems, SPIP is inherently non-algebraic and relies on chaotic symbolic evolution and rounding-induced non-injectivity to render inversion computationally infeasible. We prove that SPIP is PSPACE-hard and #P-hard, and demonstrate through empirical simulation that even short symbolic sequences (e.g., n = 3, m = 2) can produce over 500 valid trajectories for a single endpoint, with exponential growth reaching 2256 paths for moderate parameters. A quantum security analysis further shows that Grover-style search offers no practical advantage due to oracle ambiguity and verification instability. These results position SPIP as a viable foundation for post-quantum cryptography that avoids the vulnerabilities of algebraic symmetry while offering scalability, unpredictability, and resistance to both classical and quantum inversion.</description>

      <title>Physical measures for mostly sectional expanding flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.04207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.04207v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that a partially hyperbolic attracting set for a C2 vector field, having slow recurrence to equilibria, supports an ergodic physical/SRB measure if, and only if, the trapping region admits non-uniform sectional expansion on a positive Lebesgue measure subset. Moreover, in this case, the attracting set supports at most finitely many ergodic physical/SRB measures, which are also Gibbs states along the central-unstable direction.
  This extends to continuous time systems a similar well-known result obtained for diffeomorphisms, encompassing the presence of equilibria accumulated by regular orbits within the attracting set. In codimension two the same result holds, assuming only the trajetories on the trapping region admit a sequence of times with asymptotical sectional expansion, on a positive volume subset.
  We present several examples of application, including the existence of physical measures for asymptotically sectional hyperbolic attracting sets, and obtain physical measures in an alternative unified way for many known examples: Lorenz-like and Rovella attractors, and sectional-hyperbolic attracting sets (including the multidimensional Lorenz attractor).</description>

      <title>Size of exceptional sets in weakly mixing systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.09786v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For any weakly mixing system \((X,\mcr{B},\mu,T)\) and any \(A,B\in\mcr{B}\), it is well known that there exists a density-zero ``exceptional set'' \(J_{A,B}\subseteq\mathbb{N}\) along which \[ \mu\bigl(A\cap T^{-n}B\bigr)\to\mu(A)\,\mu(B) \] for $n\notin J_{A,B}$. In this paper, we investigate finer quantitative properties of the exceptional set. First, assuming a given rate of weak mixing, we derive an explicit upper bound on \[ \bigl|J_{A,B}\cap[0,n]\bigr| \] in terms of that rate. We apply this result to interval exchange transformations and to a class of substitution dynamical systems. Next, we analyze a broad family of cutting and stacking transformations (of which the Chacon map is a special case): we construct a universal exceptional set \(J\) and show that for any increasing function \(h:\mathbb{R}_{&gt;0}\to\mathbb{R}_{&gt;0}\) diverging to infinity, one can choose \(J\subseteq\mathbb{N}\) satisfying \[ \bigl|J\cap[0,n]\bigr|\le(\log n)^{h(n)} \quad\text{for all }n, \] uniformly over all Lebesgue-measurable \(A,B\subseteq[0,1]\). We prove that this is optimal, in the sense that for any \(t&gt;0\), there exist measurable sets \(A,B\subseteq[0,1]\) and a constant \(N&gt;0\) such that \[ \bigl|J_{A,B}\cap[0,n]\bigr|\ge\;(\log n)^{t} \quad\text{for all }n&gt;N. \]</description>

      <title>A generic approach via relative singularity and controllability: Frequency-preserving with arbitrarily weak regularity in parameterized Hamiltonian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.11797v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel and generic approach to prove the persistence of frequency-preserving invariant tori in parameterized Hamiltonian systems, addressing irregular continuity with respect to parameters. Unlike traditional methods that strongly rely on domain extraction techniques or uniform weak convexity of the frequency mapping, we propose the concepts of relative singularity and controllability for the first time. These concepts enable us to deal with a wide range of explicit parameterized Hamiltonian systems with arbitrarily weak regularity, thereby overcoming a previously insurmountable challenge. We also construct several counterexamples to highlight the indispensability of our new conditions in the sense of frequency-preserving. Furthermore, we demonstrate the broad applicability of our results to various cases with explicit arbitrarily weak regularity, including the partial frequency-preserving case and the infinite-dimensional case without any spectral asymptotics. Overall, our approach, based on the concepts of relative singularity and controllability, illustrates its genericity in the frequency-preserving KAM theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15774v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Metric mean dimension is a geometric invariant of dynamical systems with infinite topological entropy. We relate this concept with the fractal structure of the phase space and the H\"older regularity of the map. Afterwards we improve our general estimates in a family of interval maps by computing the metric mean dimension in a way similar to the Misiurewicz formula for the entropy, which in particular shows that our bounds are sharp. As an application, we determine the metric mean dimension of the classical Weierstrass functions. Of independent interest, we develop a dynamical analogue of the Minkowski-Bouligand dimension for subshifts on Ahlfors regular alphabets, which also provides an entropy formula in terms of the size of the set of admissible words, generalizing the classical result for subshifts on finite alphabets.</description>

      <title>Every finite set of natural numbers is realizable as algebraic periods of a Morse$\unicode{x2013}$Smale diffeomorphism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12372v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A given self-map $f\colon M\to M$ of a compact manifold determines the sequence $(L(f^n))$ of the Lefschetz numbers of its iterations. We consider its dual sequence $(a_n(f))$ given by the M\"obius inversion formula. The set ${\mathcal AP}(f)=\{ n\in \mathbb N\ \colon\ a_n(f)\neq 0\}$ is called the set of algebraic periods.
  We solve an open problem existing in literature by showing that for every finite subset ${\mathcal A}$ of natural numbers there exist an orientable surface $S_{\rm g}$, as well as a non-orientable surface $N_{\rm g}$, of genus ${\rm g}$, and a Morse$\unicode{x2013}$Smale diffeomorphism $f$ of this surface such that $\mathcal{AP}(f)=\mathcal{A}$. For such a map it implies the existence of points of a minimal period $n$ for each odd $n \in \mathcal{A}$. For the orientation-reversing Morse$\unicode{x2013}$Smale diffeomorphisms of $S_{\rm g}$, we identify strong restrictions on ${\mathcal AP}(f)$. Our method also provides an estimate of the number of conjugacy classes of mapping classes containing Morse$\unicode{x2013}$Smale diffeomorphisms, which is exponential in ${\rm g}$.</description>

      <title>On absolute continuity of inhomogeneous and contracting on average self-similar measures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18936v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a condition for absolute continuity of self-similar measures in arbitrary dimensions. This allows us to construct the first explicit absolutely continuous examples of inhomogeneous self-similar measures in dimension one and two. In fact, for $d\geq 1$ and any given rotations in $O(d)$ acting irreducibly on $\mathbb{R}^d$ as well as any distinct translations, all having algebraic coefficients, we construct absolutely continuous self-similar measures with the given rotations and translations. We furthermore strengthen Varj\'u's result for Bernoulli convolutions, treat complex Bernoulli convolutions and in dimension $\geq 3$ improve the condition on absolute continuity by Lindenstrauss-Varj\'u. Moreover, self-similar measures of contracting on average measures are studied, which may include expanding similarities in their support.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12958v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive a necessary and sufficient condition for a homeomorphism with the shadowing property to be topologically transitive: to have an invariant subset $A$, dense in the non-wandering set, where the barycenter property holds. To elucidate its dynamical nature, we compare this condition with other properties known to be sufficient for an Anosov diffeomorphism to be topologically transitive. We also describe the $C^1$ interior of the set of diffeomorphisms which comply with this condition, discuss examples with a variety of dynamics and present some applications of interest.</description>

      <title>Dold coefficients of quasi-unipotent homeomorphisms of orientable surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19313v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The sequence of Dold coefficients $(a_n(f))$ of a self-map $f\colon X \to X$ forms a dual sequence to the sequence of Lefschetz numbers $(L(f^n))$ of iterations of $f$ under the M\"obius inversion formula. The set ${\mathcal AP}(f) = \{ n \,\colon\, a_n(f) \neq 0 \}$ is called the set of algebraic periods of $f$. Both the set of algebraic periods and sequence of Dold coefficients play an important role in dynamical systems and periodic point theory.
  In this work we provide a description of surface homeomorphisms with bounded $(L(f^n))$ (quasi-unipotent maps) in terms of Dold coefficients. We also discuss the problem of minimization of the genus of a surface for which one can realize a given set of natural numbers as the set of algebraic periods. Finally, we compute and list all possible Dold coefficients and algebraic periods for a given orientable surface with small genus and give some geometrical applications of the obtained results.</description>

      <title>Directional $p$-Adic Littlewood Conjecture for Algebraic Vectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04430v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For every vector $\overline \alpha\in \RR^n$ and for every rational approximation $(\overline p,q)\in \RR^n\times\RR$ we can associate the displacement vector $q\alpha-\overline p$. We focus on algebraic vectors, namely $\overline \alpha=(\alpha_1,\dots,\alpha_n)$ such that $1, \alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_n$ span a rank $n$ number field. For these vectors, we investigate the size of their displacements as well as the distribution of their directions. We give a new proof to the result of Bugeaud in \cite{YannPAdic} saying that algebraic vectors $\overline \alpha$ satisfy the $p$-adic Littlewood Conjecture. Namely, we prove that \begin{equation}
  \liminf_{k \to \infty} \left( k \abs{k}_p \right)^{1/n} \| k (\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_n) \|_\infty = 0. \end{equation} Our new proof lets us classify all limiting distributions, with a special weighting, of the sequence of directions of the defects in the $\varepsilon$-approximations of $(\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_n)$. Each such limiting measure is expressed as the pushforward of an algebraic measure on $X_n$ to the sphere.</description>

      <title>Arnold Diffusion in the Full Three-Body Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09273v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The full three-body problem, on the motion of three celestial bodies under their mutual gravitational attraction, is one of the oldest unsolved problems in classical mechanics. The main difficulty comes from the presence of unstable and chaotic motions, which make long-term prediction impossible. In this paper, we show that the full three-body problem exhibits a strong form of instability known as Arnold diffusion. We consider the planar full three-body problem, formulated as a perturbation of both the Kepler problem and the planar circular restricted three-body problem. We show that the system exhibits Arnold diffusion, in the sense that there is a transfer of energy -- of an amount independent of the perturbation parameter -- between the Kepler problem and the restricted three-body problem. Our argument is based on the topological method of correctly aligned windows, which is implemented into a computer assisted proof. We demonstrate that the approach can be applied to physically relevant masses of the bodies, choosing a Neptune-Triton-asteroid system as an example. In this case, we obtain explicit estimates for the range of the perturbation parameter and for the diffusion time.</description>

      <title>Backward bifurcations and multistationarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12352v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The theory of backward bifurcations provides a criterion for the existence of positive steady states in epidemiological models with parameters where the basic reproductive ratio is less than one. It is often seen in simulations that this phenomenon is accompanied by multistationarity, i.e. the existence of more than one positive steady state, but the latter circumstance is not implied by the general theory. The central result of this paper is a theorem which gives a criterion for the existence of one stable and one unstable positive steady state for parameters where the basic reproductive ratio is less than one. It also gives a criterion for the existence of one stable and one unstable positive steady state in the case that the basic reproductive ratio is greater than one. These steady states arise in a bifurcation. It is shown that in one case, a model for the in-host dynamics of hepatitis C, this result can be used as a basis for showing the existence of parameters for which there are two positive steady states, one of which is stable. Thus, in particular, multistationarity is proved in that case. It is also shown to what extent this theorem can be applied to some other models which have been studied in the literature and what new results can be obtained. In that context the new approach is compared with those previously known.</description>

      <title>On Triangular Forms for x-Flat Control-Affine Systems With Two Inputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15562v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper examines a broadly applicable triangular normal form for two-input x-flat control-affine systems. First, we show that this triangular form encompasses a wide range of established normal forms. Next, we prove that any x-flat system can be transformed into this triangular structure after a finite number of prolongations of each input. Finally, we introduce a refined algorithm for identifying candidates for x-flat outputs. Through illustrative examples, we demonstrate the usefulness of our results. In particular, we show that the refined algorithm exceeds the capabilities of existing methods for computing flat outputs based on triangular forms.</description>

      <title>Word problems and embedding-obstructions in cellular automata groups on groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05572v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study groups of reversible cellular automata, or CA groups, on groups. More generally, we consider automorphism groups of subshifts of finite type on groups. It is known that word problems of CA groups on virtually nilpotent groups are in co-NP, and can be co-NP-hard. We show that under the Gap Conjecture of Grigorchuk, their word problems are PSPACE-hard on all other groups. On free and surface groups, we show that they are indeed always in PSPACE. On a group with co-NEXPTIME word problem, CA groups themselves have co-NEXPTIME word problem, and on the lamplighter group (which itself has polynomial-time word problem) we show they can be co-NEXPTIME-hard. We show also nonembeddability results: the group of cellular automata on a non-cyclic free group does not embed in the group of cellular automata on the integers (this solves a question of Barbieri, Carrasco-Vargas and Rivera-Burgos); and the group of cellular automata in dimension $D$ does not embed in a group of cellular automata in dimension $d$ if $D &gt; d$ (this solves a question of Hochman).</description>

      <title>Transitions to Intermittent Chaos in Quorum Sensing Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14363v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study analyses the dynamical consequences of heterogeneous temporal delays within a quorum sensing-inspired (QS-inspired) system, specifically addressing the differential response kinetics of two sub-populations to signalling molecules. A nonlinear delay differential equation (DDE) model, predicated upon an activator-inhibitor framework, is formulated to represent the interspecies interactions. Key analytical techniques, including the derivation of the pseudo-characteristic polynomial and the determination of Hopf bifurcation criteria, are employed to investigate the stability properties of steady-state solutions. The analysis reveals the critical role of multiple, dissimilar delays in modulating system dynamics and inducing bifurcations. Numerical simulations, conducted in conjunction with analytical results, reveal the emergence of periodic self-sustained oscillations and intermittent chaotic behaviour. These observations emphasise the intricate relationship between temporal heterogeneity and the stability landscape of systems exhibiting QS-inspired dynamics. This interplay highlights the capacity for temporal variations to induce complex dynamical transitions within such systems. These findings assist to the comprehension of temporal dynamics within these and related systems, and may contribute to the development of strategies aimed at modulating intercellular communication and engineering synthetic biological systems with temporal control.</description>
