      <title>Streamlined approach to mitigation of cascading failure in complex networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cascading failures represent a fundamental threat to the integrity of complex systems, often precipitating a comprehensive collapse across diverse infrastructures and financial networks. This research articulates a robust and pragmatic approach designed to attenuate the risk of such failures within complex networks, emphasizing the pivotal role of local network topology. The core of our strategy is an innovative algorithm that systematically identifies a subset of critical nodes within the network, a subset whose relative size is substantial in the context of the network's entirety. Enhancing this algorithm, we employ a graph coloring heuristic to precisely isolate nodes of paramount importance, thereby minimizing the subset size while maximizing strategic value. Securing these nodes significantly bolsters network resilience against cascading failures. The method proposed to identify critical nodes and experimental results show that the proposed technique outperforms other typical techniques in identifying critical nodes. We substantiate the superiority of our approach through comparative analyses with existing mitigation strategies and evaluate its performance across various network configurations and failure scenarios. Empirical validation is provided via the application of our method to real-world networks, confirming its potential as a strategic tool in enhancing network robustness.</description>

      <title>A Weighted-Median Model of Opinion Dynamics on Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social interactions influence people's opinions. In some situations, these interactions result in a consensus opinion; in others, they result in opinion fragmentation and the formation of different opinion groups in the form of "echo chambers". Consider a social network of individuals, who hold continuous-valued scalar opinions and change their opinions when they interact with each other. In such an opinion model, it is common for an opinion-update rule to depend on the mean opinion of interacting individuals. However, we consider an alternative update rule - which may be more realistic in some situations - that instead depends on a weighted median opinion of interacting individuals. Through numerical simulations of our opinion model, we investigate how the limit opinion distribution depends on network structure. For configuration-model networks, we also derive a mean-field approximation for the asymptotic dynamics of the opinion distribution when there are infinitely many individuals in a network.</description>

      <title>Networks with many structural scales: a Renormalization Group perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scale invariance profoundly influences the dynamics and structure of complex systems, spanning from critical phenomena to network architecture. Here, we propose a precise definition of scale-invariant networks by leveraging the concept of a constant entropy loss rate across scales in a renormalization-group coarse-graining setting. This framework enables us to differentiate between scale-free and scale-invariant networks, revealing distinct characteristics within each class. Furthermore, we offer a comprehensive inventory of genuinely scale-invariant networks, both natural and artificially constructed, demonstrating, e.g., that the human connectome exhibits notable features of scale invariance. Our findings open new avenues for exploring the scale-invariant structural properties crucial in biological and socio-technological systems.</description>
