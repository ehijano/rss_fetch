      <title>On the propagation speed of the single monostable equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we first focus on the speed selection problem for the reaction-diffusion equation of the monostable type. By investigating the decay rates of the minimal traveling wave front, we propose a sufficient and necessary condition that reveals the essence of propagation phenomena. Moreover, since our argument relies solely on the comparison principle, it can be extended to more general monostable dynamical systems, such as nonlocal diffusion equations.</description>

      <title>Sufficient conditions for determining the sign of the wave speed in the Lotka-Volterra competition system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper mainly focuses on the sign of the wave speed in the Lotka-Volterra competition system of bistable type, also known as the strong-strong competition case. The traveling wave solution of the system is crucial for understanding the long-time behavior of solutions to the Cauchy problem. Specifically, the sign of the wave speed is key to predicting which species will prevail in the competition. In this paper, by studying a degenerate Lotka-Volterra competition system, we propose two sufficient conditions for determining the sign of the wave speed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the following $p$-Laplacian equation $$ -\Delta_{p} u+h(x)|u|^{p-2} u=\left(R_{\alpha} *F(u)\right)f(u) $$ on lattice graphs $\mathbb{Z}^N$, where $p\geq 2$, $\alpha \in(0,N)$ are constants and $R_{\alpha}$ is the Green's function of the discrete fractional Laplacian that behaves as the Riesz potential. Under different assumptions on potential function $h$, we prove the existence of ground state solutions respectively by the methods of Nehari manifold.</description>

      <title>Singular solutions of a system of a non-strictly hyperbolic system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Systems of the first order partial differential equations with singular solutions appear in many multiphysics problems and the weak formulation of solutions involve in many cases product of distributions. In this paper we study such a system derived from Eulerian droplet model for air particle flow. This is a 2 x 2 non - strictly hyperbolic system of conservation laws with linear damping. We first study a regularized viscous system with variable viscosity term and obtain a weak asymptotic solution with general initial data and also get solution in the Colombeau algebra. We also study the vanishing viscosity limit and show that this limit is a distribution solution. Further we study the large time asymptotic behaviour of the viscous system. This important system, is not very well studied due to complexities in the analysis. As far as we know the only work done on this system is for Riemann type of initial data. The significance of this paper is that we work on the system having general initial data and not just initial data of the Riemann type.</description>

      <title>Cylindrical extensions of critical Sobolev type inequalities and identities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate cylindrical extensions of critical Sobolev type (improved Hardy) inequalities and identities in the style of Badiale-Tarantello \cite{BT02}, which in a special case give a critical Hardy inequality and its stability results. We also obtain higher order identities, which interestingly include well-known numbers like double factorial, Oblong numbers and Stirling numbers of second kind. All functional identities are obtained in $L^{p}$ for $p\in (1,\infty)$ without the real-valued function assumption, which give a simple and direct understanding of the corresponding inequalities as well as the nonexistence of nontrivial extremizers. As applications, we obtain Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg type inequalities with logarithmic weights, which in a particular case give the critical case of the Heisenberg-Pauli-Weyl type uncertainty principle. We also discuss these results in the setting of Folland and Stein's homogeneous Lie groups. A special focus is devoted to stratified Lie groups, where Sobolev type inequalities become intricately intertwined with the properties of sub-Laplacians and more general subelliptic partial differential equations. The obtained results are already new even in the classical Euclidean setting with respect to the range of parameters and the arbitrariness of the choice of any homogeneous quasi-norm. Most inequalities are obtained with sharp constants.</description>

      <title>Spaces of distributions with Sobolev wave front in a fixed conic set: compactness, pullback by smooth maps and the compensated compactness theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the space $\mathcal{D}'^r_L(M;E)$ of distributional sections of the smooth complex vector bundle $E\rightarrow M$ whose Sobolev wave front set of order $r\in\mathbb{R}$ lies in the closed conic subset $L$ of $T^*M\backslash0$. We introduce a locally convex topology on it to study the continuity of the pullback by smooth maps and generalise the result of H\"ormander about the pullback on the space of distributions with $\mathcal{C}^{\infty}$ wave front set in $L$. We employ an idea of G\'erard [18] to extend the Kolmogorov-Riesz compactness theorem to $\mathcal{D}'^r_L(M;E)$ and we characterise its relatively compact subsets. We study the continuity properties of pseudo-differential operators when acting on $\mathcal{D}'^r_L(M;E)$, $r\in\mathbb{R}$, and we generalise the Rellich's lemma. As an application of our results, we extend the microlocal defect measures of G\'erard and Tartar to sequences in $\mathcal{D}'^0_L(M;E)$ and we show a microlocal variant of the compensated compactness theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a concavity inequality for $k$-Hessian operators under the semi-convexity condition. As an application, we establish interior estimates for semi-convex solutions of the $k$-Hessian equations with vanishing Dirichlet boundary and obtain a Liouville-type result. Additionally, we provide new and simple proofs of Guan-Ren-Wang's results on global curvature estimates for $k$-curvature equations.</description>

      <title>Energy-critical inhomogeneous nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with two power-type nonlinearities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the initial value problem for the inhomogeneous nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with double nonlinearities (DINLS)
  \begin{equation*}
  i \partial_t u + \Delta u = \lambda_1 |x|^{-b_1}|u|^{p_1}u + \lambda_2|x|^{-b_2}|u|^{\frac{4-2b_2}{N-2}}u,
  \end{equation*} where $\lambda_1,\lambda_2\in \mathbb{R}$, $3\leq N&lt;6$ and $0&lt;b_1,b_2&lt;\min\{2,\frac{6-N}{2}\}$. In this paper, we establish global well-posedness results for certain parameter regimes and prove finite-time blow-up phenomena under specific conditions. Our analysis relies on stability theory, energy estimates, and virial identities adapted to the DINLS model.</description>

      <title>$H$-compactness for nonlocal linear operators in fractional divergence form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the $H$-convergence problem for a class of nonlocal linear operators in fractional divergence form, where the oscillations of the matrices are prescribed outside the reference domain. Our compactness argument bypasses the failure of the classical localisation techniques, that mismatch with the nonlocal nature of the operators involved. If symmetry is also assumed, we show that the $H$-compactness can be equivalently obtained through the $\Gamma$-convergence of the associated energies.</description>

      <title>Random dynamics of solutions for three-dimensional stochastic globally modified Navier-Stokes equations on unbounded Poincar\'e domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we propose a novel version of three-dimensional (3D) globally modified Navier-Stokes (GMNS) system introduced by [Caraballo et. al., Adv. Nonlinear Stud. (2006), 6:411-436], which is very significant from the perspective of deterministic as well as stochastic partial differential equations. Our focus is on examining a stochastic version of the suggested 3D GMNS equations that are perturbed by an infinite-dimensional additive noise. We can consider a rough additive noise (Lebesgue space valued) with this model, which is not appropriate to consider with the system presented in [Caraballo et. al., Adv. Nonlinear Stud. (2006), 6:411-436]. One of the technical problems associated with the rough noise is overcome by the use of the corresponding Cameron-Martin (or reproducing kernel Hilbert) space. This article aims to accomplish three objectives. Firstly, we establish the existence and uniqueness of weak solutions (in the analytic sense) of the underlying stochastic system using a Doss-Sussman transformation and a primary ingredient Minty-Browder technique. Secondly, we demonstrate the existence of random attractors for the underlying stochastic system in the natural space of square integrable divergence-free functions. Finally, we show the existence of an invariant measure for the underlying stochastic system for any viscosity coefficient $ \nu &gt; 0 $ and uniqueness of invariant measure for sufficiently large $\nu$ by using the exponential stability of solutions. A validation of the proposed version of 3D GMNS equations has also been discussed in the appendix by establishing that the sequence of weak solutions of 3D GMNS equations converges to a weak solution of 3D Navier-Stokes equations as the modification parameter goes to infinity.</description>

      <title>ABP estimate on metric measure spaces via optimal transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By using optimal transport theory, we establish a sharp Alexandroff--Bakelman--Pucci (ABP) type estimate on metric measure spaces with synthetic Riemannian Ricci curvature lower bounds, and prove some geometric and functional inequalities including a functional ABP estimate. Our result not only extends the border of ABP estimate, but also provides an effective substitution of Jacobi fields computation in the non-smooth framework, which has potential applications to many problems in non-smooth geometric analysis.</description>

      <title>Semi-Continuity of the Morse Index for Ricci Shrinkers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove lower and upper semi-continuity of the Morse index for sequences of gradient Ricci shrinkers which bubble tree converge in the sense of past work by the author and Buzano. Our proofs rely on adapting recent arguments of Workman which were used to study certain sequences of CMC hypersurfaces and were in turn adapted from work on Da Lio-Gianocca-Riviere. Moreover, we are able to refine Workman's methods by using techniques related to polynomially weighted Sobolev spaces. This all also requires us to extend the analysis to handle when the shrinkers we study are non-compact, which we can do due to the availability of a suitable notion of finite weighted volume. Finally, we identify a technical condition which ensures the Morse index of an asymptotically conical shrinker is bounded below by the f-index of its asymptotic cone.</description>

      <title>Regularization of Stationary Second-order Mean Field Game Partial Differential Inclusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mean field Game (MFG) Partial Differential Inclusions (PDI) are generalizations of the system of Partial Differential Equations (PDE) of Lasry and Lions to situations where players in the game may have possibly nonunique optimal controls, and the resulting Hamiltonian is not required to be differentiable. We study second-order MFG PDI with convex, Lipschitz continuous, but possibly nondifferentiable Hamiltonians, and their approximation by systems of classical MFG PDE with regularized Hamiltonians. Under very broad conditions on the problem data, we show that, up to subsequences, the solutions of the regularized problems converge to solutions of the MFG PDI. In particular, we show the convergence of the value functions in the $H^1$-norm and of the densities in $L^q$-norms. Under stronger hypotheses on the problem data, we also show rates of convergence between the solutions of the original and regularized problems, without requiring any higher regularity of the solutions. We give concrete examples that demonstrate the sharpness of several aspects of the analysis.</description>

      <title>The high resolution sampling methods for acoustic sources from multi-frequency far field patterns at sparse observation directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work is dedicated to novel uniqueness results and high resolution sampling methods for source support from multi-frequency sparse far field patterns. With a single pair of observation directions $\pm\hat{x}$, we prove that the lines $\{z\in\mathbb R^2|\, \hat{x}\cdot z = \hat{x}\cdot y, \,y\in A_{\hat{x}}\}$ can be determined by multi-frequency far field patterns at the directions $\pm\hat{x}$, where $A_{\hat{x}}$ denotes a set containing the corners of the boundary and points whose normal vector to the boundary is parallel to $\hat{x}$. Furthermore, if the source support is composed of polygons and annuluses, then we prove that the support can be determined by multi-frequency far field patterns at sparse directions. Precisely, the lowest number of the observation directions is given in terms of the number of the corners and the annuluses. Inspired by the uniqueness arguments, we introduce two novel indicators to determine the source support. Numerical examples in two dimensions are presented to show the validity and robustness of the two indicators for reconstructing the boundaries of the source support with a high resolution. The second indicator also shows its powerful ability to determine the unknown source function.</description>

      <title>The $C^3$-null gluing problem: linear and nonlinear analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the $C^3$-null gluing problem for the Einstein vacuum equations, that is, we consider the null gluing of up to and including third-order derivatives of the metric. In the regime where the characteristic data is close to Minkowski data, we show that this $C^3$-null gluing problem is solvable up to a $20$-dimensional space of obstructions. The obstructions correspond to $20$ linearly conserved quantities: $10$ of which are already present in the $C^2$-null gluing problem analysed by Aretakis, Czimek and Rodnianski, and $10$ are novel obstructions inherent to the $C^3$-null gluing problem. The $10$ novel obstructions are linearly conserved charges calculated from third-order derivatives of the metric.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo Physics-informed neural networks for multiscale heat conduction via phonon Boltzmann transport equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The phonon Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) is widely used for describing multiscale heat conduction (from nm to $\mu$m or mm) in solid materials. Developing numerical approaches to solve this equation is challenging since it is a 7-dimensional integral-differential equation. In this work, we propose Monte Carlo physics-informed neural networks (MC-PINNs), which do not suffer from the {\emph{``curse of dimensionality''}}, to solve the phonon BTE to model the multiscale heat conduction in solid materials. MC-PINNs use a deep neural network to approximate the solution to the BTE, and encode the BTE as well as the corresponding boundary/initial conditions using the automatic differentiation. In addition, we propose a novel two-step sampling approach to address inefficiency and inaccuracy issues in the widely used sampling methods in PINNs. In particular, we first randomly sample a certain number of points in the temporal-spatial space (Step I), and then draw another number of points randomly in the solid angular space (Step II). The training points are constructed using the tensor product of the data drawn from the above two steps. The two-step sampling strategy enables MC-PINNs (1) to model the heat conduction from ballistic to diffusive regimes, and (2) is more memory-efficient compared to conventional numerical solvers or existing PINNs for BTE. A series of numerical examples including quasi-one-dimensional (quasi-1D) steady/unsteady heat conduction in a film, and the heat conduction in a quasi-two- and three-dimensional square domain, are conducted to justify the effectiveness of the MC-PINN for heat conduction spanning diffusive and ballistic regimes. Finally, we compare the computational time and memory usage of the MC-PINN and a state-of-art numerical methods to demonstrate the potential of the MC-PINN for large scale problems in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Well posedness of linear parabolic partial differential equations posed on a star-shaped network with local time Kirchhoff's boundary condition at the vertex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.08017v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The main purpose of this work is to provide an existence and uniqueness result for the solution of a linear parabolic system posed on a star-shaped network, which presents a new type of Kirchhoff's boundary transmission condition at the junction. This new type of Kirchhoff's condition-that we decide to call here local-time Kirchhoff 's condition-induces a dynamical behavior with respect to an external variable that may be interpreted as a local time parameter, designed to drive the system only at the singular point of the network. The seeds of this study point towards a forthcoming theoretical inquiry of a particular generalization of Walsh's random spider motions, whose spinning measures would select the available directions according to the local time of the motion at the junction of the network.</description>

Abstract: The main purpose of this work is to obtain a comparison principle for viscosity solutions of a system of elliptic Walsh's spider Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations, possessing a new boundary condition called non linear local-time Kirchhoff's transmission. The main idea is to build test functions at the neighborhood of the vertex solutions of ODE, with well-designed coefficients. The key point is to impose a 'local-time' derivative at the vertex absorbing the error term induced by - what we decide to call here - the Kirchhoff's speed of the Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Optimal regularity for the variable coefficients parabolic Signorini problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13305v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we discuss the optimal regularity of the variable coefficient parabolic Signorini problem with $W^{1,1}_p$ coefficients and $L^p$ inhomogeneity, where $p&gt;n+2$ with $n$ being the space dimension. Relying on an parabolic Carleman estimate and an epiperimetric inequality, we show the optimal regularity of the solutions as well as the regularity of the regular free boundary.</description>

      <title>Dynamics near the origin of the long range scattering for the one-dimensional Schrodinger equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06400v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the cubic Schrodinger equation on the line, for which the scattering theory requires modifications due to long range effects. We revisit the construction of the modified wave operator, and recall the construction of its inverse, in order to describe the asymptotic behavior of these operators near the origin. At leading order, these operators, whose definition includes a nonlinear modification in the phase compared to the linear dynamics, correspond to the identity. We compute explicitly the first corrector in the asymptotic expansion, and justify this expansion by error estimates.</description>

      <title>Modelling of planetary accretion and core-mantle structure formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06750v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We advance a thermodynamically consistent model of self-gravitational accretion and differentiation in planets. The system is modeled in actual variables as a compressible thermoviscoelastic fluid in a fixed, sufficiently large domain. The supply of material to the accreting and differentiating system is described as a bulk source of mass, volume, impulse, and energy localized in some border region of the domain. Mass, momentum, and energy conservation, along with constitutive relations, result in an extended compressible Navier-Stokes-Fourier-Poisson system. After studying some single-component setting, we consider a two-component situation, where metals and silicates mix and differentiate under gravity, eventually forming a core-mantle structure. The energetics of the models are elucidated. Moreover, we prove that the models are stable, in that self-gravitational collapse is excluded. Eventually, we comment on the prospects of devising a rigorous mathematical approximation and existence theory.</description>

      <title>Cylindrical estimates for the Cheeger constant and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09864v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a lower bound for the Cheeger constant of a cylinder $\Omega\times (0,L)$, where $\Omega$ is an open and bounded set. As a consequence, we obtain existence of minimizers for the shape functional defined as the ratio between the first Dirichlet eigenvalue of the $p$-Laplacian and the $p$-th power of the Cheeger constant, within the class of bounded convex sets in any $\mathbb{R}^N$. This positively solves open conjectures raised by Parini (J. Convex Anal. (2017)) and by Briani-Buttazzo-Prinari (Ann. Mat. Pura Appl. (2023)).</description>

Abstract: We exhibit existence of non-trivial solutions of some fractional linear Schr\"odinger equations which are radial and vanish at the origin. This is in stark contrast to what happens in the local case. We also prove analogous results in the presence of a Hardy potential.</description>

      <title>The Variation of the Uncentered Maximal Operator with respect to Cubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.10747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.10747v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the maximal operator with respect to uncentered cubes on Euclidean space with arbitrary dimension. We prove that for any function with bounded variation, the variation of its maximal function is bounded by the variation of the function times a dimensional constant.
  We also prove the corresponding result for maximal operators with respect to collections of more general sets than cubes. The sets are required to satisfy a certain inner cone star condition and in addition the collection must enjoy a tiling property which for example the collection of all cubes does enjoy and the collection of all Euclidean balls does not.</description>
