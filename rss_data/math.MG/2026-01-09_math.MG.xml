      <title>Power-law asymptotics of fractional $L^p$ polar projection bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The notion of $s$--fractional $L^p$ polar projection bodies, recently introduced by Haddad and Ludwig (Math.\ Ann.\ \textbf{388}:1091--1115, 2024), provides a bridge between fractional Sobolev theory and convex geometry. In this manuscript, we study the limit of their Minkowski gauges under two natural asymptotic regimes: \\ \hspace*{3em} (a) first sending $p \to \infty$ and then $s \to 1^-$; \\ \hspace*{3em} (b) first sending $s \to 1^-$ and then $p \to \infty$. \\ Our main result shows that these two limiting processes commute. As a consequence, we derive precise asymptotic behavior for the associated volumes and dual mixed volumes, thereby linking the (fractional) $L^p$ polar projection bodies to the newly introduced (fractional) $L^\infty$ polar projection bodies. These results further yield new geometric inequalities, including endpoint Lipschitz/H\"older isoperimetric--type and variants of P\'olya--Szeg\H{o} inequalities in the $L^\infty$ setting.</description>

      <title>Non-smooth paths having unit speed with respect to the Kobayashi metric, and their applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03709v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the question of whether a non-constant absolutely continuous path can be reparametrized to be of unit speed with respect to the Kobayashi metric and be absolutely continuous. Even when the answer is "Yes," which isn't always the case, its proof involves some subtleties. We answer the above question and discuss several applications.</description>

      <title>Balanced quasistatic evolutions of critical points in metric spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09812v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quasistatic evolutions of critical points of time-dependent energies exhibit piecewise smooth behavior, making them useful for modeling continuum mechanics phenomena like elastic-plasticity and fracture. Traditionally, such evolutions have been derived as vanishing viscosity and inertia limits, leading to balanced viscosity solutions. However, for nonconvex energies, these constructions have been realized in Euclidean spaces and assume non-degenerate critical points. In this paper, we take a different approach by decoupling the time scales of the energy evolution and of the transition to equilibria. Namely, starting from an equilibrium configuration, we let the energy evolve, while keeping frozen the system state; then, we update the state by freezing the energy, while letting the system transit via gradient flow or an approximation of it (e.g., minimizing movement or backward differentiation schemes). This approach has several advantages. It aligns with the physical principle that systems transit through energy-minimizing steady states. It is also fully constructive and computationally implementable, with physical and computational costs governed by appropriate action functionals. Additionally, our analysis is simpler and more general than previous formulations in the literature, as it does not require non-degenerate critical points. Finally, this approach extends to evolutions in locally compact metric path spaces, and our axiomatic presentation allows for various realizations.</description>
