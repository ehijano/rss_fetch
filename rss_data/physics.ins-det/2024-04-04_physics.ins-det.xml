      <title>DoubleTES detectors to investigate the CRESST low energy background: results from above-ground prototypes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent times, the sensitivity of low-mass direct dark matter searches has been limited by unknown low energy backgrounds close to the energy threshold of the experiments known as the low energy excess (LEE). The CRESST experiment utilises advanced cryogenic detectors constructed with different types of crystals equipped with Transition Edge Sensors (TESs) to measure signals of nuclear recoils induced by the scattering of dark matter particles in the detector. In CRESST, this low energy background manifests itself as a steeply rising population of events below 200 eV. A novel detector design named doubleTES using two identical TESs on the target crystal was studied to investigate the hypothesis that the events are sensor-related. We present the first results from two such modules, demonstrating their ability to differentiate between events originating from the crystal's bulk and those occurring in the sensor or in its close proximity.</description>

      <title>Non-Destructive, High-Resolution, Chemically Specific, 3D Nanostructure Characterization using Phase-Sensitive EUV Imaging Reflectometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Next-generation nano and quantum devices have increasingly complex 3D structure. As the dimensions of these devices shrink to the nanoscale, their performance is often governed by interface quality or precise chemical or dopant composition. Here we present the first phase-sensitive extreme ultraviolet imaging reflectometer. It combines the excellent phase stability of coherent high-harmonic sources, the unique chemical- and phase-sensitivity of extreme ultraviolet reflectometry, and state-of-the-art ptychography imaging algorithms. This tabletop microscope can non-destructively probe surface topography, layer thicknesses, and interface quality, as well as dopant concentrations and profiles. High-fidelity imaging was achieved by implementing variable-angle ptychographic imaging, by using total variation regularization to mitigate noise and artifacts in the reconstructed image, and by using a high-brightness, high-harmonic source with excellent intensity and wavefront stability. We validate our measurements through multiscale, multimodal imaging to show that this technique has unique advantages compared with other techniques based on electron and scanning-probe microscopies.</description>

      <title>Non-Equilibrium Oscillations Arising in Thermally Induced Convective Systems through Homodyne Dynamic Light Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use Homodyne Dynamic Light Scattering (HDLS) with a dual-laser beam setup to investigate the drift velocities of colloidal particles immersed in a solvent exposed to thermally-induced convection. Our investigation reveals the appearance of oscillations of a well-defined frequency in the intensity autocorrelation function, which are linked to the particle drift velocities. In addition to this non-equilibrium oscillations, we report an enhanced decay of the intensity correlation function attributable to the loss of correlation as particles depart from the scattering volume due to prevailing convective flow. A pivotal discovery of our research is the identification of a specific temperature gradient threshold, beyond which pronounced velocity fluctuations ensue as a consequence of the establishment of a non-stationary flow within the measurement cell. The experimental results, obtained for different colloidal systems, are corroborated by a theoretical model and thoroughly validated with fluid dynamics simulations and Brownian dynamics simulations, yielding excellent agreement with the experimental data, and providing a robust and complete explanation of the observed phenomena. This study presents an insight in the field of non-equilibrium particle dynamics, offering a reliable method to study complex behaviors in convective systems through advanced HDLS techniques and multidisciplinary simulations.</description>

      <title>Multi-Objective Bayesian Active Learning for MeV-ultrafast electron diffraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultrafast electron diffraction using MeV energy beams(MeV-UED) has enabled unprecedented scientific opportunities in the study of ultrafast structural dynamics in a variety of gas, liquid and solid state systems. Broad scientific applications usually pose different requirements for electron probe properties. Due to the complex, nonlinear and correlated nature of accelerator systems, electron beam property optimization is a time-taking process and often relies on extensive hand-tuning by experienced human operators. Algorithm based efficient online tuning strategies are highly desired. Here, we demonstrate multi-objective Bayesian active learning for speeding up online beam tuning at the SLAC MeV-UED facility. The multi-objective Bayesian optimization algorithm was used for efficiently searching the parameter space and mapping out the Pareto Fronts which give the trade-offs between key beam properties. Such scheme enables an unprecedented overview of the global behavior of the experimental system and takes a significantly smaller number of measurements compared with traditional methods such as a grid scan. This methodology can be applied in other experimental scenarios that require simultaneously optimizing multiple objectives by explorations in high dimensional, nonlinear and correlated systems.</description>

      <title>Efficient ultra-broadband low-resolution astrophotonic spectrographs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Broadband low-resolution near-infrared spectrographs in a compact form are crucial for ground- and space-based astronomy and other fields of sensing. Astronomical spectroscopy poses stringent requirements including high efficiency, broad band operation ($&gt;$ 300 nm), and in some cases, polarization insensitivity. We present and compare experimental results from the design, fabrication, and characterization of broadband (1200 - 1650 nm) arrayed waveguide grating (AWG) spectrographs built using the two most promising low-loss platforms - Si$_3$N$_4$ (rectangular waveguides) and doped-SiO$_2$ (square waveguides). These AWGs have a resolving power ($\lambda/\Delta\lambda$) of ~200, a free spectral range of ~ 200-350 nm, and a small footprint of ~ 50-100 mm$^2$. The peak overall (fiber-chip-fiber) efficiency of the doped-SiO$_2$ AWG was ~ 79\% (1 dB), and it exhibited a negligible polarization-dependent shift compared to the channel spacing. For Si$_3$N$_4$ AWGs, the peak overall efficiency in TE mode was ~ 50\% (3 dB), and the main loss component was found to be fiber-to-chip coupling losses. These broadband AWGs are key to enabling compact integrations such as multi-object spectrographs or dispersion back-ends for other astrophotonic devices such as photonic lanterns or nulling interferometers.</description>

      <title>Development of proton beam irradiation system for the NA65/DsTau experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.13070v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tau neutrino is the least studied lepton of the Standard Model (SM). The NA65/DsTau experiment targets to investigate $D_s$, the parent particle of the $\nu_\tau$, using the nuclear emulsion-based detector and to decrease the systematic uncertainty of $\nu_\tau$ flux prediction from over 50% to 10% for future beam dump experiments. In the experiment, the emulsion detectors are exposed to the CERN SPS 400 GeV proton beam. To provide optimal conditions for the reconstruction of interactions, the protons are required to be uniformly distributed over the detector's surface with an average density of $10^5~\rm{cm^{-2}}$ and the fluctuation of less than 10%. To address this issue, we developed a new proton irradiation system called the target mover. The new target mover provided irradiation with a proton density of $0.98~\rm{cm^{-2}}$ and the density fluctuation of $2.0\pm 0.3$% in the DsTau 2021 run.</description>

      <title>Estimating the detection of antineutrinos in the future Brazilian neutron source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17812v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In line with the tradition of employing nuclear reactors for neutrino physics research, we present potential experiments that could be undertaken using the new Brazilian neutron source, the Brazilian Multipurpose Reactor (RMB). This upcoming facility has clearly defined objectives, including the production of radiopharmaceuticals for the healthcare system, material irradiation testing, and research using neutron beams to investigate the micro and mesostructures of various materials. However, we anticipate that the RMB will generate up to $3,500$ antineutrinos daily, potentially expanding the facility's scope to include neutrino physics experiments involving beta and inverse beta reactions. The modern operational conditions of the RMB and its location in the Iper\'o-Brazil region may also enable neutrino oscillation experiments and the determination of the $\theta_{13}$ parameter, as well as support safeguards activities by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), allowing for the monitoring of nuclear fuel burning cycles and isotope fractions. We discuss the potential utilization of the RMB as an antineutrino source, proposing experiments and addressing associated technical limitations.</description>

      <title>Ptycho-endoscopy on a lensless ultrathin fiber bundle tip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17213v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) utilizes an aircraft-carried antenna to emit electromagnetic pulses and detect the returning echoes. As the aircraft travels across a designated area, it synthesizes a large virtual aperture to improve image resolution. Inspired by SAR, we introduce synthetic aperture ptycho-endoscopy (SAPE) for micro-endoscopic imaging beyond the diffraction limit. SAPE operates by hand-holding a lensless fiber bundle tip to record coherent diffraction patterns from specimens. The fiber cores at the distal tip modulate the diffracted wavefield within a confined area, emulating the role of the 'airborne antenna' in SAR. The handheld operation introduces positional shifts to the tip, analogous to the aircraft's movement. These shifts facilitate the acquisition of a ptychogram and synthesize a large virtual aperture extending beyond the bundle's physical limit. We mitigate the influences of hand motion and fiber bending through a low-rank spatiotemporal decomposition of the bundle's modulation profile. Our tests demonstrate the ability to resolve a 548-nm linewidth on a resolution target. Furthermore, SAPE's refocusing capability enables imaging over an extended depth of field exceeding 2 cm. The aperture synthesizing process in SAPE surpasses the diffraction limit set by the probe's maximum collection angle, heralding new opportunities for both fiber-based and distal-chip endoscopy.</description>
