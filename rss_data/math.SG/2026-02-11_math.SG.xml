      <title>$p$-adic symplectic geometry of integrable systems and Weierstrass-Williamson theory II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is a sequel to arXiv:2501.14444, in which we shall give proofs of several results stated in arXiv:2501.14444 (Theorems D--L) which, for brevity and clarity, we postponed to this sequel paper. These results were the following: for any prime number $p$, first we show that every $2$-by-$2$ symmetric matrix with coefficients in $\mathbb{Q}_p$ can be reduced to a canonical form, and we give the exact numbers of families of normal forms with one parameter and of isolated normal forms, which depend on $p$. Then we make the same analysis for $4$-by-$4$ matrices. We also prove that, for higher size, the number of families of normal forms of matrices, even in the non-degenerate case, grows almost exponentially with the size. The paper can be read independently of arXiv:2501.14444 as we recall the statements of arXiv:2501.14444 that we shall prove here. The statements and proofs of the present paper are of an algebraic and arithmetical nature, and rely mainly on Galois theory of $p$-adic extension fields.</description>

      <title>A mirror theorem for partial flag bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a family of points on the Lagrangian cone of a partial flag bundle associated to a (possibly non-split) vector bundle from any Weyl-invariant $I$-function of a prequotient. This result can be seen as the nonabelian analogue of the mirror theorem for projective bundles in arXiv:2307.03696, and generalizes Oh's mirror theorem for split partial flag bundles in arXiv:1607.08326.</description>

      <title>Infinitely many Lefschetz pencils on ruled surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that any ruled surface $X$ with $\chi(X) &lt; 0$ admits infinitely many inequivalent Lefschetz pencils of fixed genus and number of base points. Our proof proceeds by building infinitely many inequivalent Lefschetz fibrations on a blow-up $X \# 4 \overline{\mathbb{CP}^2}$ of $X$ with constant fiber class, via a mechanism known as partial conjugation. Furthermore, there exists a symplectic form on $X$ compatible with all such pencils, and similarly for the fibrations in $X\#4\overline{\mathbb{CP}^2}$. This provides the first example of this phenomenon and makes progress on Problem 4.98 of the K3 list of problems in low-dimensional topology in the case of ruled surfaces.</description>

      <title>The symplectic geometry of the three-body problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.04438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2101.04438v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A book, concerning the classical restricted three body problem, and the approach to this old conundrum coming from the modern methods of symplectic and contact geometry. It is split into Part I (theoretical aspects), and Part II (practical aspects). The main themes are Floer theory, contact topology, symplectic dynamics, and astrodynamics (with a view towards space mission design).</description>

      <title>Positive microlocal holonomies are globally regular</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07435v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a geometric criterion for local microlocal holonomies to be globally regular on the moduli space of Lagrangian fillings. This local-to-global regularity result holds for arbitrary Legendrian links and it is a key input for the study of cluster structures on such moduli spaces. Specifically, we construct regular functions on derived moduli stacks of sheaves with Legendrian microsupport by studying the Hochschild homology of the associated dg-categories via relative Lagrangian skeleta. In this construction, a key geometric result is that local microlocal merodromies along positive relative cycles in Lagrangian fillings yield global Hochschild 0-cycles for these dg-categories.</description>

      <title>De Rham Theory in Derived Differential Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03978v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the question: What is the de Rham theory for general differentiable spaces? We identify two potential answers and study them. In the first part, we show that the de Rham cohomology calculated using (the completion of) the exterior algebra of the cotangent complex yields non-trivial local invariants for singular differentiable spaces. In particular, in some cases, it differs from the constant sheaf cohomology, which provides an obstruction for the de Rham comparison map to be an equivalence. Moreover, we provide conditions under which this local invariant trivializes, yielding a de Rham-type isomorphism. In the second part, we show that for a suitably defined de Rham stack, there is always an isomorphism between functions on it and constant sheaf cohomology of the underlying topological space. Consequently, there exists a version of the de Rham theorem for singular differentiable spaces which holds with almost no restrictions. Finally, we sketch a generalization of this result to other theories of smooth functions, such as holomorphic or analytic functions. The last part is thus related to analytic de Rham stacks of Rodriguez Camargo used by Scholze to geometrize the local Langlands correspondence.</description>

      <title>Egorov-Type Semiclassical Limits for Open Quantum Systems with a Bi-Lindblad Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03041v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a bridge between bi-Hamiltonian structures of Poisson-Lie type, contact Hamiltonian dynamics, and the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKSL) formalism for quantum open systems. On the classical side, we consider bi-Hamiltonian systems defined by a Poisson pencil with non-trivial invariants. Using an exact symplectic realization, these invariants are lifted and projected onto a contact manifold, yielding a completely integrable contact Hamiltonian system in terms of dissipated quantities and a Jacobi-commutative algebra of observables. On the quantum side, we introduce a class of contact-compatible Lindblad generators: GKSL evolutions whose dissipative part preserves a commutative $C^\ast$-subalgebra generated by the quantizations of the classical dissipated quantities, and whose Hamiltonian part admits an Egorov-type semiclassical limit to the contact dynamics. This construction provides a mathematical mechanism compatible with the semiclassical limit for pure dephasing, compatible with integrability and contact dissipation. An explicit Euler-top-type Poisson-Lie pencil, inspired by deformed Euler top models, is developed as a fully worked-out example illustrating the resulting bi-Lindblad structure and its semiclassical behavior.</description>
