      <title>A note on the hit problem for the polynomial algebra in the case of odd primes and its application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $P_h = \mathbb{F}_p[t_1,\dots,t_h]$ be the polynomial algebra over $\mathbb{F}_p$ ($p$ prime). We consider the hit problem: finding a minimal generating set for $P_h$ as a module over the mod $p$ Steenrod algebra $\mathscr{A}_p$, or equivalently, determining a basis for $\mathbb{F}_p \otimes_{\mathscr{A}_p} P_h$. This problem is related to the $\mathscr{A}_p$-module structure of $H^*(V; \mathbb{F}_p) \cong \Lambda(V^\sharp) \otimes P_h$, where $V$ is an elementary abelian $p$-group of rank $h$. Information about the hit problem aids in studying the Singer algebraic transfer $Tr_h^{\mathscr{A}_p}$, a homomorphism from $GL(h, \mathbb{F}_p)$-coinvariants related to $H^*(V; \mathbb{F}_p)$ to ${\rm Ext}_{\mathscr{A}_p}^{h,h+*}(\mathbb{F}_p, \mathbb{F}_p)$, which helps analyze Ext groups. This work studies $\mathscr{A}_p$-generators for $P_h$ when $p$ is an odd prime. As an application, we investigate the third algebraic transfer ($h=3$) in certain generic degrees. Our main result shows that this transfer is an isomorphism in these degrees.</description>

      <title>Stable moduli spaces of odd-dimensional manifold triads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a homotopy-theoretic description of the homology of stable moduli spaces of $(2n+1)$-dimensional manifold triads $(N, \partial^h N, \partial^v N)$ with fixed $\partial^v N$, whenever $n \geq 3$ and $(N, \partial^h N)$ is $1$-connected. Stabilization is performed by taking boundary connected sum with $S^n \times D^{n+1}$. This is an analog of earlier work of Galatius and Randal-Williams for even-dimensional manifolds with fixed boundary, and it extends a previous result by Botvinnik and Perlmutter. As a byproduct, we obtain an analog for odd-dimensional triads of Kreck's stable diffeomorphism classification of even-dimensional manifolds.</description>

      <title>Rational Homotopy in Pseudotopological Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pseudotopological spaces are the Cartesian closed hull of the category of \v{C}ech closure spaces. In this paper, we give a direct proof that the model category of the pseudotopological spaces constructed by Rieser is Quillen equivalent to the category of simplicial sets. In addition to noting that every pseudotopological space is weak homotopy equivalent to a topological CW complex, we prove that any weak equivalence of pseudotopological spaces can be converted to a weak equivalence of topological spaces. Finally, combining these ingredients, we construct rational homotopy for simply connected pseudotopological spaces. In this paper, we also prove that the cartesian product of two pseudotopological CW complexes is a CW complex.</description>

      <title>A Computational (Co)homological Approach to Contiguity Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new algebraic invariant, the (co)homological distance, which provides computable lower bounds for the homotopic distance and refines the classical cup-length estimates. We then define the simplicial cohomological distance and prove a convergence theorem showing that, after sufficiently many barycentric subdivisions, it approximates the cohomological distance of the corresponding continuous maps. Several explicit computations are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Topological decoding of grid cell activity via path lifting to covering spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-dimensional neural activity often reside in a low-dimensional subspace, referred to as neural manifolds. Grid cells in the medial entorhinal cortex provide a periodic spatial code that are organized near a toroidal manifold, independent of the spatial environment. Due to the periodic nature of its code, it is unclear how the brain utilizes the toroidal manifold to understand its state in a spatial environment. We introduce a novel framework that decodes spatial information from grid cell activity using topology. Our approach uses topological data analysis to extract toroidal coordinates from grid cell population activity and employs path-lifting to reconstruct trajectories in physical space. The reconstructed paths differ from the original by an affine transformation. We validated the method on both continuous attractor network simulations and experimental recordings of grid cells, demonstrating that local trajectories can be reliably reconstructed from a single grid cell module without external position information or training data. These results suggest that co-modular grid cells contain sufficient information for path integration and suggest a potential computational mechanism for spatial navigation.</description>

      <title>The motivic fundamental groupoid at tangential basepoints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a general construction of the motivic fundamental groupoid at tangential basepoints, extending previous works of P. Deligne, A. B. Goncharov, and M. Levine, which were limited to ordinary basepoints or to specific varieties. Given a smooth variety over a field endowed with a simple normal crossings divisor, we encode its tangential basepoints using the language of logarithmic geometry. Building on the recent construction by F. Binda, D. Park, and P. A. {\O}stv{\ae}r of a stable $\infty$-category of $\mathbb{A}^1$-invariant logarithmic motives and its comparison with the usual $\infty$-category of motives, we define in a functorial manner the associated motivic pointed path spaces. In the presence of a motivic $t$-structure, truncating yields the motivic fundamental groupoid. In general, we construct Betti and de Rham realization functors for logarithmic motives (linearizing the construction of F. Binda, D. Park and P. A. {\O}stv{\ae}r for the Betti case) and we show that the periods of the motivic fundamental groupoid are given by regularized iterated integration of logarithmic differential $1$-forms, thus yielding a general version of Chen's theorem with tangential basepoints.</description>

      <title>Computing the Matching Distance of 2-Parameter Persistence Modules from Critical Values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.12868v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The exact computation of the matching distance for multi-parameter persistence modules is an active area of research in computational topology. Achieving an easily obtainable exact computation of this distance would permit multi-parameter persistent homology to be a viable option for data analysis. For this purpose, two approaches are currently available, limited to persistence with parameters from $\mathbb{R}^2$: authors of arXiv:1812.09085, arXiv:2111.10303 work in the discrete setting and apply the point-line duality; authors of arXiv:2210.16718, arXiv:2312.04201 work in the smooth setting while remaining in the primal plane. In this paper, we streamline the computation of the matching distance in the combinatorial setting while staying in the primal plane. In doing so, besides connecting results from the literature, we give explicit formulas for the switch points needed by all the available methods and we show that it is possible to avoid considering vertical and horizontal lines. For the latter, lines with slope 1 play an essential role.</description>

Abstract: We show that the classification diagram of a relative $\infty$-category arising from a relative simplicial category is equivalent to the levelwise nerve. Applications include the comparison of the diagonal of the levelwise nerve and the homotopy coherent nerve, and a result on the levelwise localizations of simplicial categories.</description>

      <title>A "Periodicity" Phenomenon of the Attaching Map of the Suspended Two-Cell Complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21444v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $f\in\pi_{n+k}(S^{n})$, ($n\geq2$ and $k\geq0$) and let $F$ be the homotopy fibre of the pinch map $\Sigma C_{f}=S^{n+1}\cup e^{n+k+2} \rightarrow S^{n+k+2}$; (further suppose that $\Sigma C_{f}\not\simeq*$ if $k=0$). Assume that, via the homoptopy fibration $F\rightarrow \Sigma C_{f} \rightarrow S^{n+k+2}$, we wish to compute the $p$-primary component of $\pi_{*}(\Sigma C_{f})$ which is possibly far unstable, where the prime $p\neq3$. As a type of Gray's relative James constructions, $ F$ has a CW decomposition $F=(S^{n+1}\cup_{\alpha} e^{2n+k+2})\cup_{\beta} e^{3n+2k+3}\cup \cdots$, where $\alpha=[1_{S^{n+1}},\Sigma f]$ is the Whitehead product and $\beta$ is a higher Whitehead product. However, higher Whitehead products are intricate to manage. In this paper, by use of Selick-Wu's $\mathrm{A}^{\mathrm{min}}$-theory and the machinery of the Eilenberg-Moore spectral sequence, we show that in the 2-local case, the attaching map $\beta$ is decomposed to be $\Sigma ^{2n+k+2}f$ composing with a certain inclusion; in the $p$-local case, where $p\geq5$ and $n+k$ is odd, $\beta$ admits a similar decomposition. In other words, the attaching map $\Sigma f$ manifests a ``periodicity'' phenomenon. Therefore, we are able to calculate $\pi_{*}(\Sigma C_{f})\otimes \mathbb{Z}_{(p)}$ in the range requiring the 3-cell skeleton of $F$. As an application, we determine the 2-primary component of $\pi_{18}(\Sigma ^{3}\mathbb{C}P^{2})$.</description>

Abstract: We provide a direct connection between the Z_{max} (or essential) JSJ decomposition and the Friedl--Tillmann polytope of a hyperbolic two-generator one-relator group with abelianisation of rank $2$.
  We deduce various structural and algorithmic properties, like the existence of a quadratic-time algorithm computing the Z_{max}-JSJ decomposition of such groups.</description>

      <title>Equivalence of field theories: Crane-Yetter and the shadow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.04570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.04570v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work solves a 28-year conjecture by showing that two major invariants of smooth 4-manifolds, the shadow model (motivated by statistical mechanics [Tur91]) and the simplicial Crane-Yetter model (motivated by topological quantum field theory [CY93]), are in fact equal.
  These invariants, both of which degenerate to the 3D Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev model in a special case, had been open for years to clarify their relationship. Despite the seeming difference in their origins and formal constructions, we prove their equivalence. Along the way, we sketch a dictionary between the two models, provide a brief survey of the shadow construction \`a la Turaev, and suggest once again that the semisimple models have reached their limits.</description>

      <title>Topological Sequence Analysis of Genomes: Category theory Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08043v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sequence data, such as DNA, RNA, and protein sequences, exhibit intricate, multi-scale structures that pose significant challenges for conventional analysis methods, particularly those relying on alignment or purely statistical representations. In this work, we introduce category-based topological sequence analysis (CTSA ) of genomes. CTSA models a sequence as a resolution category, capturing its hierarchical structure through a categorical construction. Substructure complexes are then derived from this categorical representation, and their persistent homology is computed to extract multi-scale topological features. Our models depart from traditional alignment-free approaches by incorporating structured mathematical formalisms rooted in sequence topology. The resulting topological signatures provide informative representations across a variety of tasks, including the phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 variants and the prediction of protein-nucleic acid binding affinities. Comparative studies were carried out against six state-of-the-art methods. Experimental results demonstrate that CTSA achieves excellent and consistent performance in these tasks, suggesting its general applicability and robustness. Beyond sequence analysis, the proposed framework opens new directions for the integration of categorical and homological theories for biological sequence analysis.</description>
