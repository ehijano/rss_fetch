      <title>Exponential Runge-Kutta methods for parabolic equations with state-dependent delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to construct and analyze exponential Runge-Kutta methods for the temporal discretization of a class of semilinear parabolic problems with arbitrary state-dependent delay. First, the well-posedness of the problem is established. Subsequently, first and second order schemes are constructed. They are based on the explicit exponential Runge-Kutta methods, where the delayed solution is approximated by a continuous extension of the time discrete solution. Schemes of arbitrary order can be constructed using the methods of collocation type. The unique solvability and convergence of the proposed schemes are established. Finally, we discuss implementation issues and present some numerical experiments to illustrate our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Numerical Approximation and Bifurcation Results for an Elliptic Problem with Superlinear Subcritical Nonlinearity on the Boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop numerical algorithms to approximate positive solutions of elliptic boundary value problems with superlinear subcritical nonlinearity on the boundary of the form $-\Delta u + u = 0$ in $\Omega$ with $\frac{\partial u}{\partial \eta} = \lambda f(u)$ on $\partial\Omega$ as well as an extension to a corresponding system of equations. While existence, uniqueness, nonexistence, and multiplicity results for such problems are well-established, their numerical treatment presents computational challenges due to the absence of comparison principles and complex bifurcation phenomena. We present finite difference formulations for both single equations and coupled systems with cross-coupling boundary conditions, establishing admissibility results for the finite difference method. We derive principal eigenvalue analysis for the linearized problems to determine unique bifurcation points from trivial solutions. The eigenvalue analysis provides additional insight into the theoretical properties of the problem while also providing intuition for computing approximate solutions based on the proposed finite difference formulation. We combine our finite difference methods with continuation methods to trace complete bifurcation curves, validating established existence and uniqueness results and consistent with the results of the principle eigenvalue analysis.</description>

      <title>Numerical modeling of elastic waves in thin shells with grid-characteristic method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical modeling of strength and non-destructive testing of complex structures such as buildings, space rockets or oil reservoirs often involves calculations on extremely large grids. The modeling of elastic wave processes in solids places limitations on the grid element size because resolving different elastic waves requires at least several grid elements for the characteristic size of the modeled object. For a thin plate, the defining size is its thickness, and a complex structure that contains large-scale thin objects requires a large-scale grid to preserve its uniformity. One way to bypass this problem is the theory of thin plates and shells that replaces a simple material model on a fine three-dimensional mesh with a more complex material model on a coarser mesh. This approach loses certain fine effects inside the thin plate, but allows us to model large and complex thin objects with a reasonable size calculation grid and resolve all the significant wave types. In this research, we take the Kirchhoff-Love material model and derive a hyperbolic dynamic system of equations that allows for a physical interpretation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors. The system is solved numerically with a grid-characteristic method. Numerical results for several model statements are compared with three-dimensional calculations based on grid-characteristic method for a three dimensional elasticity.</description>

      <title>Characterization of the near-null error components utilized in composite adaptive AMG solvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a theoretical justification for the construction of adaptive composite solvers based on a sequence of AMG (algebraic multigrid) $\mu$-cycle methods that exploit error components that the current solver cannot damp efficiently. Each solver component is an aggregation based AMG where its aggregates are constructed using the popular in graph community detection modularity matrix. The latter utilizes the given matrix and the error component vector the current solver cannot handle. The performance of the resulting adaptive composite solver is illustrated on a variety of sparse matrices both arising from discretized PDEs and ones with more general nature.</description>

      <title>Strong convergence of a semi tamed scheme for stochastic differential algebraic equation under non-global Lipschitz coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are investigating the first strong convergence analysis of a numerical method for stochastic differential algebraic equations (SDAEs) under a non-global Lipschitz setting. It is well known that the explicit Euler scheme fails to converge strongly to the exact solution of a stochastic differential equation (SDEs) when at least one of the coefficients grows superlinearly. The problem becomes more challenging in the case of stochastic differential-algebraic equations (SDAEs) due to the singularity of the matrix. To address this, we build a new scheme called the semi-implicit tamed method for SDAEs and provide its strong convergence result under non-global Lipschitz setting. In other words, the linear component of the drift term is approximated implicitly, whereas its nonlinear component is tamed and approximated explicitly. We show that this method strongly converges with order $\frac{1}{2}$ to the exact solution. To prove this strong convergence result, we first derive an equivalent scheme, that we call the dual tamed scheme, which is more suitable for mathematical analysis and is associated with the inherent stochastic differential equation obtained by eliminating the constraints from the original SDAEs. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, numerical simulations are performed, confirming that the theoretical findings are consistent with the numerical results.</description>

      <title>Fast Operator-Splitting Methods for Nonlinear Elliptic Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear elliptic problems arise in many fields, including plasma physics, astrophysics, and optimal transport. In this article, we propose a novel operator-splitting/finite element method for solving such problems. We begin by introducing an auxiliary function in a new way for a semilinear elliptic partial differential equation, leading to the development of a convergent operator-splitting/finite element scheme for this equation. The algorithm is then extended to fully nonlinear elliptic equations of the Monge-Amp\`ere type, including the Dirichlet Monge-Amp\`ere equation and Pucci's equation. This is achieved by reformulating the fully nonlinear equations into forms analogous to the semilinear case, enabling the application of the proposed splitting algorithm. In our implementation, a mixed finite element method is used to approximate both the solution and its Hessian matrix. Numerical experiments show that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches in efficiency and accuracy, and can be readily applied to problems defined on domains with curved boundaries.</description>

      <title>Hybrid-Precision Block-Jacobi Preconditioned GMRES Solver for Linear System in Circuit Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As integrated circuits become increasingly complex, the demand for efficient and accurate simulation solvers continues to rise. Traditional solvers often struggle with large-scale sparse systems, leading to prolonged simulation times and reduced accuracy. In this paper, a hybrid-precision block-Jacobi preconditioned GMRES solver is proposed to solve the large sparse system in circuit simulation. The proposed method capitalizes on the structural sparsity and block properties of circuit matrices, employing a novel hybrid-precision strategy that applies single-precision arithmetic for computationally intensive tasks and double-precision arithmetic for critical accuracy-sensitive computations. Additionally, we use the graph partitioning tools to assist in generating preconditioners, ensuring an optimized preconditioning process. For large-scale problems, we adopt the restart strategy to increase the computational efficiency. Through rigorous mathematical reasoning, the convergence and error analysis of the proposed method are carried out. Numerical experiments on various benchmark matrices demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing solvers, including SuperLU, KLU, and SFLU, in terms of both preconditioning and GMRES runtime. The proposed hybrid-precision preconditioner effectively improves spectral clustering, leading to faster solutions.</description>

      <title>Isogeometric Topology Optimization Based on Topological Derivatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topology optimization is a valuable tool in engineering, facilitating the design of optimized structures. However, topological changes often require a remeshing step, which can become challenging. In this work, we propose an isogeometric approach to topology optimization driven by topological derivatives. The combination of a level-set method together with an immersed isogeometric framework allows seamless geometry updates without the necessity of remeshing. At the same time, topological derivatives provide topological modifications without the need to define initial holes [7]. We investigate the influence of higher-degree basis functions in both the level-set representation and the approximation of the solution. Two numerical examples demonstrate the proposed approach, showing that employing higher-degree basis functions for approximating the solution improves accuracy, while linear basis functions remain sufficient for the level-set function representation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a strong convergence rate analysis of general discretization approximations for McKean-Vlasov SDEs with super-linear growth coefficients over infinite time horizon. Under some specified non-globally Lipschitz conditions, we derive the propagation of chaos, and the mean-square convergence rate over infinite time horizon for general one-step time discretization schemes for the underlying Mckean-Vlasov SDEs. As an application of the general result it is obtained the mean-square convergence rate over infinite time horizon for two numerical schemes: the projected Euler scheme and the backward Euler scheme for Mckean-Vlasov SDEs in non-globally Lipschitz settings. Numerical experiments are provided to validate the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Optimal Control of a Hemivariational Inequality of Stationary Convective Brinkman-Forchheimer Extended Darcy equations with Numerical Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies an optimal control problem for a stationary convective Brinkman-Forchheimer extended Darcy (CBFeD) hemivariational inequality in two and three dimensions, subject to control constraints, and develops its numerical approximation. The hemivariational inequality provides the weak formulation of a stationary incompressible fluid flow through a porous medium, governed by the CBFeD equations, which account for convection, damping, and nonlinear resistance effects. The problem incorporates a non-leak boundary condition and a subdifferential friction-type condition. We first analyze the stability of solutions with respect to perturbations in the external force density and the superpotential. Next, we prove the existence of a solution to the optimal control problem, where the external force density acts as the control variable. We then propose a numerical scheme for solving the optimal control problem and establish its convergence. For concreteness, the numerical method is implemented using finite element discretization. Finally, we provide some numerical examples to validate the theory developed.</description>

      <title>Euler-type methods for Levy-driven McKean-Vlasov SDEs with super-linear coefficients: mean-square error analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop and analyze a general class of Euler-type numerical schemes for Levy-driven McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations (SDEs), where the drift, diffusion and jump coefficients grow super-linearly in the state variable. These numerical schemes are derived by incorporating projections or nonlinear transformations into the classical Euler method, with the primary objective of establishing moment bounds for the numerical solutions. This class of schemes includes the tanh-Euler, tamed-Euler and sine-Euler schemes as special cases. In contrast to existing approaches that rely on a coercivity condition (e.g., Assumption B-1 in Kumar et al., arXiv:2010.08585), the proposed schemes remove such a restrictive assumption. We provide a rigorous mean-square convergence analysis and establish that the proposed schemes achieve convergence rates arbitrarily close to 1/2 for the interacting particle systems associated with Levy-driven McKean-Vlasov SDEs. Several numerical examples are presented to illustrate the convergence behavior and validate the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Expressive Power of Deep Networks on Manifolds: Simultaneous Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key challenge in scientific machine learning is solving partial differential equations (PDEs) on complex domains, where the curved geometry complicates the approximation of functions and their derivatives required by differential operators. This paper establishes the first simultaneous approximation theory for deep neural networks on manifolds. We prove that a constant-depth $\mathrm{ReLU}^{k-1}$ network with bounded weights--a property that plays a crucial role in controlling generalization error--can approximate any function in the Sobolev space $\mathcal{W}_p^{k}(\mathcal{M}^d)$ to an error of $\varepsilon$ in the $\mathcal{W}_p^{s}(\mathcal{M}^d)$ norm, for $k\geq 3$ and $s&lt;k$, using $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-d/(k-s)})$ nonzero parameters, a rate that overcomes the curse of dimensionality by depending only on the intrinsic dimension $d$. These results readily extend to functions in H\"older-Zygmund spaces. We complement this result with a matching lower bound, proving our construction is nearly optimal by showing the required number of parameters matches up to a logarithmic factor. Our proof of the lower bound introduces novel estimates for the Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension and pseudo-dimension of the network's high-order derivative classes. These complexity bounds provide a theoretical cornerstone for learning PDEs on manifolds involving derivatives. Our analysis reveals that the network architecture leverages a sparse structure to efficiently exploit the manifold's low-dimensional geometry.</description>

      <title>A Low-Rank tensor framework for THB-Splines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a low-rank framework for adaptive isogeometric analysis with truncated hierarchical B-splines (THB-splines) that targets the main bottleneck of local refinement: memory- and time-intensive matrix assembly once the global tensor-product structure is lost. The method interpolates geometry-induced weight and source terms in separable spline spaces and computes their tensor-train (TT) representations via the alternating minimal energy (AMEn) solver, enabling level-wise assembly of system operators using univariate quadrature. To recover separability in the adaptive setting, we reduce the active basis to tensor-product domains and partition active/non-active cells into a small number of Cartesian cuboids, so each contributes a Kronecker factor that is accumulated and rounded in TT. We realize the two-scale relation with truncation in low rank and assemble the global hierarchical operators in a block TT format suitable for iterative solvers. A prototype MATLAB implementation built on the GeoPDEs package and the TT-Toolbox demonstrates that, for model problems with moderately complex refinement regions, the approach reduces memory footprint and assembly time while maintaining accuracy; we also discuss limitations when ranks grow with geometric or refinement complexity. This framework advances scalable adaptive IgA with THB-splines, particularly in three dimensions.</description>

      <title>Second-order Optimally Stable IMEX (pseudo-)staggered Galerkin discretization: application to lava flow modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present second-order optimally stable Implicit-Explicit (IMEX) Runge-Kutta (RK) schemes with application to a modified set of shallow water equations that can be used to model the dynamics of lava flows. The schemes are optimally stable in the sense that they satisfy, at the space-time discretization level, a condition analogous to the \texttt{L}-stability of Runge-Kutta methods for ordinary differential equations. A novel (pseudo-)staggered Galerkin scheme is introduced, which can be interpreted as an extension of the classical two-step Taylor-Galerkin (TG2) scheme. The method is derived by combining a von Neumann stability analysis with a Lax-Wendroff procedure. For the discretization of the non-conservative terms that characterize the lava flow model, we employ the Path-Conservative (PC) method. The proposed scheme is evaluated on a number of relevant test cases, demonstrating accuracy, robustness, and well-balancing properties for the lava flow model.</description>

      <title>Minimality of Tree Tensor Network Ranks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a given tree tensor network $G$, we call a tuple of bond dimensions minimal if there exists a tensor $T$ that can be represented by this network but not on the same tree topology with strictly smaller bond dimensions. We establish necessary and sufficient conditions on the bond dimensions of a tree tensor network to be minimal, generalizing a characterization of Carlini and Kleppe about existence of tensors with a given multilinear rank. We also show that in a minimal tree tensor network, the non-minimal tensors form a Zariski closed subset, so minimality is a generic property in this sense.</description>

      <title>Bioluminescence tomography: A new regularized shape optimization method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate an inverse source problem arising in bioluminescence tomography (BLT), where the objective is to recover both the support and intensity of the light source from boundary measurements. A shape optimization framework is developed, in which the source strength and its support are decoupled through first-order optimality conditions. To enhance the stability of the reconstruction, we incorporate a parameter-dependent coupled complex boundary method(CCBM) scheme together with perimeter and volume regularizations. The level-set representation naturally accommodates topological changes, enabling the reconstruction of multiple, closely located, or nested sources. Theoretical justifications are provided, and a series of numerical experiments are conducted to validate the proposed method. The results demonstrate the robustness, accuracy, and noise-resistance of the algorithm, as well as its advantages over existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Iterative energy reduction Galerkin methods and variational adaptivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Critical points of energy functionals, which are of broad interest, for instance, in physics and chemistry, in solid and quantum mechanics, in material science, or in general diffusion-reaction models arise as solutions to the associated Euler-Lagrange equations. While classical computational solution methods for such models typically focus solely on the underlying partial differential equations, we propose an approach that also incorporates the energy structure itself. Specifically, we examine (linearized) iterative Galerkin discretization schemes that ensure energy reduction at each step. Additionally, we provide necessary conditions, which are applicable to a wide class of problems, that guarantee convergence to critical points of the PDE. Moreover, in the specific context of finite element discretizations, we present a very generally applicable adaptive mesh refinement strategy - the so-called variational adaptivity approach - which, rather than using classical a posteriori estimates, is based on exploiting local energy reductions. The theoretical results are validated for several computational experiments in the context of nonlinear diffusion-reaction models, thereby demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.</description>

      <title>A Phase-Field Approach to Fracture and Fatigue Analysis: Bridging Theory and Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article presents a novel, robust and efficient framework for fatigue crack-propagation that combines the principles of Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM) with phase-field fracture (PFF). Contrary to cycle-by-cycle PFF approaches, this work relies on a single simulation and uses standard crack propagation models such as Paris' law for the material response, simplifying its parametrization.
  The core of the methodology is the numerical evaluation of the derivative of a specimen's compliance with respect to the crack area. To retrieve this compliance the framework relies on a PFF-FEM simulation, controlled imposing a monotonic crack growth. This control of the loading process is done by a new crack-control scheme which allows to robustly trace the complete equilibrium path of a crack, capturing complex instabilities. The specimen's compliance obtained from the PFF simulation enables the integration of Paris' law to predict fatigue life.
  The proposed methodology is first validated through a series of benchmarks with analytical solutions to demonstrate its accuracy. The framework is then applied to more complex geometries where the crack path is unknown, showing a very good agreement with experimental results of both crack paths and fatigue life.</description>

      <title>Efficient High-Order Participation Factor Computation via Batch-Structured Tensor Contraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Participation factors (PFs) quantify the interaction between system modes and state variables, and they play a crucial role in various applications such as modal analysis, model reduction, and control design. With increasing system complexity, especially due to power electronic devices and renewable integration, the need for scalable and high-order nonlinear PF (NPF) computation has become more critical. This paper presents an efficient tensor-based method for calculating NPFs up to an arbitrary order. Traditional computation of PFs directly from normal form theory is computationally expensive -- even for second-order PFs -- and becomes infeasible for higher orders due to memory constraints. To address this, a tensor contraction-based approach is introduced that enables the calculation of high-order PFs using a batching strategy. The batch sizes are dynamically determined based on the available computational resources, allowing scalable and memory-efficient computation.</description>

      <title>Symmetries in stochastic homogenization and acclimatizations for the RVE method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the implications of a given symmetry of a random microstructure on the obtained effective tensor and its fluctuation in the context of thermal conductivity, and study strategies for enforcing these symmetries in postprocessing via orthogonal projectors. Within the framework of the representative volume element (RVE) method, we establish the invariance conditions for the effective tensor and its fluctuation under different symmetry groups of the microstructure. Interestingly, the symmetry of the considered cell type in the RVE method may break the ensemble symmetry and compromise the approximation of the effective properties. To rectify this issue, we introduce dedicated techniques which permit to enforce the expected symmetries in postprocessing and study the implications on the bounds for the effective properties as well as the total, the random and the systematic errors. We provide theoretical arguments that suitable projections lead to unbiased variance-reduction strategies which furthermore enforce the expected symmetries exactly. Through large-scale FFT-based homogenization simulations, we study the symmetry structure of the estimated effective conductivities and their fluctuations. Moreover, we demonstrate the power of the symmetry-projection techniques for fiber-reinforced composite microstructures of industrial scale.</description>

      <title>Numerical analysis of the homogeneous Landau equation: approximation, error estimates and simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a numerical solution to the spatially homogeneous Landau equation with Coulomb potential on a domain $D_L$ with N retained Fourier modes. By deriving an explicit error estimate in terms of $L$ and $N$, we demonstrate that for any prescribed error tolerance and fixed time interval $[0, T ]$, there exist choices of $D_L$ and $N$ satisfying explicit conditions such that the error between the numerical and exact solutions is below the tolerance. Specifically, the estimate shows that sufficiently large $L$ and $N$ (depending on initial data parameters and $T$) can reduce the error to any desired level. Numerical simulations based on this construction are also presented. The results in particular demonstrate the mathematical validity of the spectral method proposed in the referenced literature.</description>

      <title>Robust Non-Linear Correlations via Polynomial Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Hirschfeld-Gebelein-R\'enyi (HGR) correlation coefficient is an extension of Pearson's correlation that is not limited to linear correlations, with potential applications in algorithmic fairness, scientific analysis, and causal discovery. Recently, novel algorithms to estimate HGR in a differentiable manner have been proposed to facilitate its use as a loss regularizer in constrained machine learning applications. However, the inherent uncomputability of HGR requires a bias-variance trade-off, which can possibly compromise the robustness of the proposed methods, hence raising technical concerns if applied in real-world scenarios. We introduce a novel computational approach for HGR that relies on user-configurable polynomial kernels, offering greater robustness compared to previous methods and featuring a faster yet almost equally effective restriction. Our approach provides significant advantages in terms of robustness and determinism, making it a more reliable option for real-world applications. Moreover, we present a brief experimental analysis to validate the applicability of our approach within a constrained machine learning framework, showing that its computation yields an insightful subgradient that can serve as a loss regularizer.</description>

      <title>A preconditioned third-order implicit-explicit algorithm with a difference of varying convex functions and extrapolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel preconditioned implicit-explicit algorithm enhanced with the extrapolation technique for non-convex optimization problems. The algorithm employs a third-order Adams-Bashforth scheme for the nonlinear and explicit parts and a third-order backward differentiation formula for the implicit part of the gradient flow in variational functions. The proposed algorithm, akin to a generalized difference-of-convex (DC) approach, employs a changing set of convex functions in each iteration. Under the Kurdyka-\L ojasiewicz (KL) properties, the global convergence of the algorithm is guaranteed, ensuring that it converges within a finite number of preconditioned iterations. Our numerical experiments, including least squares problems with SCAD regularization and the graphical Ginzburg-Landau model, demonstrate the proposed algorithm's highly efficient performance compared to conventional DC algorithms.</description>

      <title>ReBaNO: Reduced Basis Neural Operator Mitigating Generalization Gaps and Achieving Discretization Invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel data-lean operator learning algorithm, the Reduced Basis Neural Operator (ReBaNO), to solve a group of PDEs with multiple distinct inputs. Inspired by the Reduced Basis Method and the recently introduced Generative Pre-Trained Physics-Informed Neural Networks, ReBaNO relies on a mathematically rigorous greedy algorithm to build its network structure offline adaptively from the ground up. Knowledge distillation via task-specific activation function allows ReBaNO to have a compact architecture requiring minimal computational cost online while embedding physics. In comparison to state-of-the-art operator learning algorithms such as PCA-Net, DeepONet, FNO, and CNO, numerical results demonstrate that ReBaNO significantly outperforms them in terms of eliminating/shrinking the generalization gap for both in- and out-of-distribution tests and being the only operator learning algorithm achieving strict discretization invariance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1807.09335v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we combine deep learning concepts and some proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) model reduction methods for predicting flow in heterogeneous porous media. Nonlinear flow dynamics is studied, where the dynamics is regarded as a multi-layer network. The solution at the current time step is regarded as a multi-layer network of the solution at the initial time and input parameters. As for input, we consider various sources, which include source terms (well rates), permeability fields, and initial conditions. We consider the flow dynamics, where the solution is known at some locations and the data is integrated to the flow dynamics by modifying the reduced-order model. This approach allows modifying the reduced-order formulation of the problem. Because of the small problem size, limited observed data can be handled. We consider enriching the observed data using the computational data in deep learning networks. The basis functions of the global reduced order model are selected such that the degrees of freedom represent the solution at observation points. This way, we can avoid learning basis functions, which can also be done using neural networks. We present numerical results, where we consider channelized permeability fields, where the network is constructed for various channel configurations. Our numerical results show that one can achieve a good approximation using forward feed maps based on multi-layer networks.</description>

      <title>Multivariate confluent Vandermonde with G-Arnoldi and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09266v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the least-squares fitting framework, the Vandermonde with Arnoldi (V+A) method presented in [Brubeck, Nakatsukasa, and Trefethen, {SIAM Review}, 63 (2021), pp. 405-415] is an effective approach to compute a polynomial that approximates an underlying univariate function $f$. Extensions of V+A include its multivariate version and the univariate confluent V+A; the latter enables us to use the information of the derivative of $f$ in obtaining the approximation polynomial. In this paper, we shall extend V+A further to the multivariate confluent V+A. Besides the technical generalization of the univariate confluent V+A, we also introduce a general and application-dependent $G$-orthogonalization in the Arnoldi process. We shall demonstrate with several applications that, by specifying an application-related $G$-inner product, the desired approximate multivariate polynomial, as well as certain of its partial derivatives can be computed accurately from a well-conditioned least-squares problem whose coefficient matrix is orthonormal. The desired multivariate polynomial is represented in a discrete $G$-orthogonal polynomials basis which admits an explicit recurrence, and therefore, facilitates evaluating function values and certain partial derivatives at new nodes efficiently. We demonstrate its flexibility by applying it to solve the multivariate Hermite least-squares problem and PDEs with various boundary conditions in irregular domains.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Low-Rank Approximation Strategies for Nonlinear Feedback Control Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07439v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the stabilization of dynamical systems in the infinite horizon optimal control setting using nonlinear feedback control based on State-Dependent Riccati Equations (SDREs). While effective, the practical implementation of such feedback strategies is often constrained by the high dimensionality of state spaces and the computational challenges associated with solving SDREs, particularly in parametric scenarios. To mitigate these limitations, we introduce the Dynamical Low-Rank Approximation (DLRA) methodology, which provides an efficient and accurate framework for addressing high-dimensional feedback control problems. DLRA dynamically constructs a compact, low-dimensional representation that evolves with the problem, enabling the simultaneous resolution of multiple parametric instances in real-time.
  We propose two novel algorithms to enhance numerical performances: the cascade-Newton-Kleinman method and Riccati-based DLRA (R-DLRA). The cascade-Newton-Kleinman method accelerates convergence by leveraging Riccati solutions from the nearby parameter or time instance, supported by a theoretical sensitivity analysis. R-DLRA integrates Riccati information into the DLRA basis construction to improve the quality of the solution. These approaches are validated through nonlinear one-dimensional and two-dimensional test cases showing transport-like behavior, demonstrating that R-DLRA outperforms standard DLRA and Proper Orthogonal Decomposition-based model order reduction in both speed and accuracy, offering a superior alternative to Full Order Model solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17656v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a new fast iterative solver for large systems involving kernel matrices. Advantageous aspects of H2 matrix approximations and the multigrid method are hybridized to create the H2-MG algorithm. This combination provides the time and memory efficiency of H2 operator representation along with the rapid convergence of a multilevel method. We describe how H2-MG works, show its linear complexity, and demonstrate its effectiveness on two standard kernels and on a single-layer potential boundary element discretization with complex geometry. The current zoo of H2 solvers, which includes a wide variety of iterative and direct solvers, so far lacks a method that exploits multiple levels of resolution, commonly referred to in the iterative methods literature as ``multigrid'' from its origins in a hierarchy of grids used to discretize differential equations. This makes H2-MG a valuable addition to the collection of H2 solvers. The algorithm has potential for advancing various fields that require the solution of large, dense, symmetric positive definite matrices.</description>

      <title>A structure-preserving LDG discretization of the Fisher-Kolmogorov equation for modeling neurodegenerative diseases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05784v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents a structure-preserving, high-order, unconditionally stable numerical method for approximating the solution to the Fisher-Kolmogorov equation on polytopic meshes, with a particular focus on its application in simulating misfolded protein spreading in neurodegenerative diseases. The model problem is reformulated using an entropy variable to guarantee solution positivity, boundedness, and satisfaction of a discrete entropy-stability inequality at the numerical level. The scheme combines a local discontinuous Galerkin method on polytopal meshes for the space discretization with a $\nu$-step backward differentiation formula for the time integration. Implementation details are discussed, including a detailed derivation of the linear systems arising from Newton's iteration. The accuracy and robustness of the proposed method are demonstrated through extensive numerical tests. Finally, the method's practical performance is demonstrated through simulations of $\alpha$-synuclein propagation in a two-dimensional brain geometry segmented from MRI data, providing a relevant computational framework for modeling synucleopathies (such as Parkinson's disease) and, more generally, neurodegenerative diseases.</description>

Abstract: Consider an algebraic two-level method applied to the $n$-dimensional linear system $A \mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}$ using fine-space preconditioner (i.e., ``relaxation'' or ``smoother'') $M$, with $M \approx A$, restriction and interpolation $R$ and $P$, and algebraic coarse-space operator ${A_c := R^*AP}$. Then, what are the the best possible transfer operators $R$ and $P$ of a given dimension $n_c &lt; n$? Brannick et al. (2018) showed that when $A$ and $M$ are Hermitian positive definite (HPD), the optimal interpolation is such that its range contains the $n_c$ smallest generalized eigenvectors of the matrix pencil $(A, M)$. Recently, in Ali et al. (2025) we generalized this framework to the non-HPD setting, by considering both right (interpolation) and left (restriction) generalized eigenvectors of $(A, M)$ and defining corresponding nonsymmetric transfer operators $\{R_\#,P_\#\}$. Tight convergence bounds for $\{R_\#,P_\#\}$ are derived in spectral radius, as well as a proof of pseudo-optimality. Note, $\{R_\#,P_\#\}$ are typically complex valued, which is not practical for real-valued problems. Here we build on Ali et al. (2025), first characterizing all inner products in which the coarse-space correction defined by $\{R_\#,P_\#\}$ is orthogonal. We then develop tight two-level convergence bounds in these norms, and prove that the underlying transfer operators $\{R_\#,P_\#\}$ are genuinely optimal. As a special case, our theory both recovers and extends the HPD results from Brannick et al. (2018). Finally, we show how to construct optimal, real-valued transfer operators in the case of that $A$ and $M$ are real valued, but are not HPD. Numerical examples arising from discretized advection and wave-equation problems are used to verify and illustrate the theory.</description>

      <title>Local Convergence Behavior of Extended LOBPCG for Computing Eigenvalues of Hermitian Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08218v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper provides a comprehensive and detailed analysis of the local convergence behavior of an extended variation of the locally optimal preconditioned conjugate gradient method (LOBPCG) for computing the extreme eigenvalue of a Hermitian matrix. The convergence rates derived in this work are either obtained for the first time or sharper than those previously established, including those in Ovtchinnikov's work ({\em SIAM J. Numer. Anal.}, 46(5):2567--2592, 2008). The study also extends to generalized problems, including Hermitian matrix polynomials that admit an extended form of the Rayleigh quotient. The new approach used to obtain these rates may also serve as a valuable tool for the convergence analysis of other gradient-type optimization methods.</description>

      <title>Rational minimax approximation of matrix-valued functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06378v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a rigorous framework for rational minimax approximation of matrix-valued functions that generalizes classical scalar approximation theory. Given sampled data $\{(x_\ell, {F}(x_\ell))\}_{\ell=1}^m$ where ${F}:\mathbb{C} \to \mathbb{C}^{s \times t}$ is a matrix-valued function, we study the problem of finding a matrix-valued rational approximant ${R}(x) = {P}(x)/q(x)$ (with ${P}:\mathbb{C} \to \mathbb{C}^{s \times t}$ a matrix-valued polynomial and $q(x)$ a nonzero scalar polynomial of prescribed degrees) that minimizes the worst-case Frobenius norm error over the given nodes: $$ \inf_{{R}(x) = {P}(x)/q(x)} \max_{1 \leq \ell \leq m} \|{F}(x_\ell) - {R}(x_\ell)\|_{\rm F}. $$ By reformulating this min-max optimization problem through Lagrangian duality, we derive a maximization dual problem over the probability simplex. We analyze weak and strong duality properties and establish a sufficient condition ensuring that the solution of the dual problem yields the minimax approximant $R(x)$. For numerical implementation, we propose an efficient method (\textsf{m-d-Lawson}) to solve the dual problem, generalizing Lawson's iteration to matrix-valued functions. Convergence analysis of \textsf{m-d-Lawson} is established. Numerical experiments are conducted and compared to state-of-the-art approaches, demonstrating its efficiency as a novel computational framework for matrix-valued rational approximation.</description>

      <title>A hyperbolic finite difference scheme for anisotropic diffusion equations: preserving the discrete maximum principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09509v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A hyperbolic system approach is proposed for robust computation of anisotropic diffusion equations that appear in quasineutral plasmas. Though the approach exhibits merits of high extensibility and accurate flux computation, the monotonicity of the scheme for anisotropic diffusion cases has not been understood. In this study, the discrete maximum principle (DMP) of the hyperbolic system approach is analyzed and tested in various anisotropic diffusion cases. A mathematical analysis is conducted to obtain an optimal condition of an arbitrary parameter to guarantee the DMP, and numerical experiments reveal an adoptive selection of the parameter for DMP-preserving results. It is confirmed that, with an appropriate preconditioning matrix and parameter choice, the hyperbolic system approach preserves the DMP even with a linear discretization.</description>

      <title>Tannenbaum's gain-margin optimization meets Polyak's heavy-ball algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19882v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper highlights an apparent, yet relatively unknown link, between algorithm design in optimization theory and control synthesis in robust control. Specifically, quadratic optimization can be recast as a regulation problem within the frame of $H_\infty$ control. From this vantage point, the optimality of Polyak's fastest heavy-ball algorithm can be ascertained as a solution to a gain margin optimization problem. The approach is independent of Polyak's original and brilliant argument, and relies on foundational work by Tannenbaum who introduced and solved gain margin optimization via Nevanlinna-Pick interpolation theory. The link between first-order optimization methods and robust control sheds new light into the limits of algorithmic performance of such methods, and suggests a framework where similar computational tasks can be systematically studied and algorithms optimized. In particular, it raises the question as to whether periodically scheduled algorithms can achieve faster rates for quadratic optimization, in a manner analogous to periodic control that extends gain margin beyond that of time-invariant control. This turns out not to be the case, due to the analytic obstruction of a transmission zero that is inherent in causal schemes. Interestingly, this obstruction can be removed with implicit algorithms, cast as feedback regulation problems with causal, but not strictly causal dynamics, thereby devoid of the transmission zero at infinity and able to achieve superior convergence rates.</description>

      <title>Surrogate normal-forms for the numerical bifurcation and stability analysis of navier-stokes flows via machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21275v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the Equation-Free multiscale modeling approach, we demonstrate how the embed-learn-lift framework enables the construction of surrogate global normal-forms, namely minimal-dimensional reduced-order models (ROMs), from high-fidelity Navier-Stokes simulations. These surrogate models are then used for efficient and accurate bifurcation and stability analysis, thus dealing with the presence of continuous symmetries. The framework proceeds in four steps. First, manifold learning reveals the intrinsic latent dimension of the high-dimensional spatio-temporal Navier-Stokes dynamics across parameter space. Second, we construct low-dimensional "normal-form" like ROMs on this latent space using Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), capturing the emergent dynamics. Third, using these models, we apply numerical bifurcation tools to compute bifurcation diagrams and perform stability analysis in the latent space. This includes tracing branches of limit cycles arising from Andronov-Hopf bifurcations - tasks intractable in full space due to computational cost. Finally, solving the pre-image problem allows reconstruction of the bifurcation structure in the original high-dimensional space. We demonstrate the methodology on two canonical flows: wake flow past an infinite circular cylinder and planar sudden-expansion channel flow. These exhibit Andronov-Hopf and pitchfork bifurcations, respectively, as Reynolds number increases. Our method identifies the latent dimensionality and constructs GPR-based surrogate normal-forms that enable the tracing and stability analysis of bifurcating solutions, including limit cycles, their period, and stability via Floquet multipliers.</description>

      <title>Learning functions through Diffusion Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03758v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a data-driven method for approximating real-valued functions on smooth manifolds, building on the Diffusion Maps framework under the manifold hypothesis. Given pointwise evaluations of a function, the method constructs a smooth extension to the ambient space by exploiting diffusion geometry and its connection to the heat equation and the Laplace-Beltrami operator.
  To address the computational challenges of high-dimensional data, we introduce a dimensionality reduction strategy based on the low-rank structure of the distance matrix, revealed via singular value decomposition (SVD). In addition, we develop an online updating mechanism that enables efficient incorporation of new data, thereby improving scalability and reducing computational cost.
  Numerical experiments, including applications to sparse CT reconstruction, demonstrate that the proposed methodology outperforms classical feedforward neural networks and interpolation methods in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.</description>
