      <title>Slicing for AI: An Online Learning Framework for Network Slicing Supporting AI Services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The forthcoming 6G networks will embrace a new realm of AI-driven services that requires innovative network slicing strategies, namely slicing for AI, which involves the creation of customized network slices to meet Quality of service (QoS) requirements of diverse AI services. This poses challenges due to time-varying dynamics of users' behavior and mobile networks. Thus, this paper proposes an online learning framework to optimize the allocation of computational and communication resources to AI services, while considering their unique key performance indicators (KPIs), such as accuracy, latency, and cost. We define a problem of optimizing the total accuracy while balancing conflicting KPIs, prove its NP-hardness, and propose an online learning framework for solving it in dynamic environments. We present a basic online solution and two variations employing a pre-learning elimination method for reducing the decision space to expedite the learning. Furthermore, we propose a biased decision space subset selection by incorporating prior knowledge to enhance the learning speed without compromising performance and present two alternatives of handling the selected subset. Our results depict the efficiency of the proposed solutions in converging to the optimal decisions, while reducing decision space and improving time complexity.</description>

      <title>Data Matters: The Case of Predicting Mobile Cellular Traffic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate predictions of base stations' traffic load are essential to mobile cellular operators and their users as they support the efficient use of network resources and sustain smart cities and roads. Traditionally, cellular network time-series have been considered for this prediction task. More recently, exogenous factors such as points of presence and other environmental knowledge have been introduced to facilitate cellular traffic forecasting. In this study, we focus on smart roads and explore road traffic measures to model the processes underlying cellular traffic generation with the goal to improve prediction performance. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that by employing road flow and speed, in addition to cellular network metrics, cellular load prediction errors can be reduced by as much as 56.5 %.

      <title>Energy Efficient and Balanced Task Assignment Strategy for Multi-UAV Patrol Inspection System in Mobile Edge Computing Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers a patrol inspection scenario where multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are adopted to traverse multiple predetermined cruise points for data collection. The UAVs are connected to cellular networks and they would offload the collected data to the ground base stations (GBSs) for data processing within the constrained duration. This paper proposes a balanced task assignment strategy among patrol UAVs and an energy-efficient trajectory design method. Through jointly optimizing the cruise point assignment, communication scheduling, computational allocation, and UAV trajectory, a novel solution can be obtained to balance the multiple UAVs' task completion time and minimize the total energy consumption. Firstly, we propose a novel clustering method that considers geometry topology, communication rate, and offload volume; it can determine each UAV's cruise points and balance the UAVs' patrol task. Secondly, a hybrid Time-Energy traveling salesman problem is formulated to analyze the cruise point traversal sequence, and the energy-efficient UAV trajectory can be designed by adopting the successive convex approximation (SCA) technique and block coordinate descent (BCD) scheme. The numerical results demonstrate that the proposed balanced task assignment strategy can efficiently balance the multiple UAVs' tasks. Moreover, the min-max task completion time and total energy consumption performance of the proposed solution outperform that of the current conventional approach.</description>

Abstract: Spectrum occupancy detection is a key enabler for dynamic spectrum access, where machine learning algorithms are successfully utilized for detection improvement. However, the main challenge is limited access to labeled data about users transmission presence needed in supervised learning models. We present a distributed federated learning approach that addresses this challenge for sensors without access to learning data. The paper discusses the results of the conducted hardware experiment, where FL has been applied for DVB-T signal detection.</description>

      <title>UNet: A Generic and Reliable Multi-UAV Communication and Networking Architecture for Heterogeneous Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid growth of UAV applications necessitates a robust communication and networking architecture capable of addressing the diverse requirements of various applications concurrently, rather than relying on application-specific solutions. This paper proposes a generic and reliable multi-UAV communication and networking architecture designed to support the varying demands of heterogeneous applications, including short-range and long-range communication, star and mesh topologies, different data rates, and multiple wireless standards. Our architecture accommodates both adhoc and infrastructure networks, ensuring seamless connectivity throughout the network. Additionally, we present the design of a multi-protocol UAV gateway that enables interoperability among various communication protocols. Furthermore, we introduce a data processing and service layer framework with a graphical user interface of a ground control station that facilitates remote control and monitoring from any location at any time. We practically implemented the proposed architecture and evaluated its performance using different metrics, demonstrating its effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Statistical Analysis to Support CSI-Based Sensing Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building upon the foundational work of the Bachelor's Degree Thesis titled "Analysis and Characterization of Wi-Fi Channel State Information'', this thesis significantly advances the research by conducting an in-depth analysis of CSIs, offering new insights that extend well beyond the original study. The goal of this work is to broaden the mathematical and statistical representation of a wireless channel through the study of CSI behavior and evolution over time and frequency.
  CSI provides a high-level description of the behavior of a signal propagating from a transmitter to a receiver, thereby representing the structure of the environment where the signal propagates. This knowledge can be used to perform ambvient sensing, a technique that extracts relevant information about the surroundings of the receiver from the properties of the received signal, which are affected by interactions with the surfaces of the objects within the analyzed environment. Ambient sensing already plays an essential role in new wireless networks such as 5G and Beyond 5G; its use Joint Communication and Sensing applications and for the optimization of signal propagation through beamforming could also enable the implementation of efficient cooperative ambient sensing in vehicular networks, facilitating Cooperative Perception and, consequently, increasing road safety.
  Due to the lack of research on CSI characterization, this study aims to begin analyzing the structure of CSI traces collected in a controlled experimental environment and to describe their statistical properties. The results of such characterization could provide mathematical support for environment classification and movement recognition tasks that are currently performed only through Machine Learning techniques, introducing instead efficient, dedicated algorithms.</description>

      <title>On the Detection of Non-Cooperative RISs: Scan B-Testing via Deep Support Vector Data Description</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of promptly detecting the presence of non-cooperative activity from one or more Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) with unknown characteristics lying in the vicinity of a Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) communication system using Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM) transmissions. We first present a novel wideband channel model incorporating RISs as well as non-reconfigurable stationary surfaces, which captures both the effect of the RIS actuation time on the channel in the frequency domain as well as the difference between changing phase configurations during or among transmissions. Considering that RISs may operate under the coordination of a third-party system, and thus, may negatively impact the communication of the intended MIMO OFDM system, we present a novel RIS activity detection framework that is unaware of the distribution of the phase configuration of any of the non-cooperative RISs. In particular, capitalizing on the knowledge of the data distribution at the multi-antenna receiver, we design a novel online change point detection statistic that combines a deep support vector data description model with the scan $B$-test. The presented numerical investigations demonstrate the improved detection accuracy as well as decreased computational complexity of the proposed RIS detection approach over existing change point detection schemes.</description>

      <title>TeleOracle: Fine-Tuned Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Long-Context Support for Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The telecommunications industry's rapid evolution demands intelligent systems capable of managing complex networks and adapting to emerging technologies. While large language models (LLMs) show promise in addressing these challenges, their deployment in telecom environments faces significant constraints due to edge device limitations and inconsistent documentation. To bridge this gap, we present TeleOracle, a telecom-specialized retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system built on the Phi-2 small language model (SLM). To improve context retrieval, TeleOracle employs a two-stage retriever that incorporates semantic chunking and hybrid keyword and semantic search. Additionally, we expand the context window during inference to enhance the model's performance on open-ended queries. We also employ low-rank adaption for efficient fine-tuning. A thorough analysis of the model's performance indicates that our RAG framework is effective in aligning Phi-2 to the telecom domain in a downstream question and answer (QnA) task, achieving a 30% improvement in accuracy over the base Phi-2 model, reaching an overall accuracy of 81.20%. Notably, we show that our model not only performs on par with the much larger LLMs but also achieves a higher faithfulness score, indicating higher adherence to the retrieved context.</description>

      <title>NinjaDoH: A Censorship-Resistant Moving Target DoH Server Using Hyperscalers and IPNS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce NinjaDoH, a novel DNS over HTTPS (DoH) protocol that leverages the InterPlanetary Name System (IPNS), along with public cloud infrastructure, to create a censorship-resistant moving target DoH service. NinjaDoH is specifically designed to evade traditional censorship methods that involve blocking DoH servers by IP addresses or domains by continually altering the server's network identifiers, significantly increasing the complexity of effectively censoring NinjaDoH traffic without disruption of other web traffic. We also present an analysis that quantifies the DNS query latency and financial costs of running our implementation of this protocol as a service. Further tests assess the ability of NinjaDoH to elude detection mechanisms, including both commercial firewall products and advanced machine learning-based detection systems. The results broadly support NinjaDoH's efficacy as a robust, moving target DNS solution that can ensure continuous and secure internet access in environments with heavy DNS-based censorship.</description>

      <title>PASTRAMI: Performance Assessment of SofTware Routers Addressing Measurement Instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18644v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Virtualized environments offer a flexible and scalable platform for evaluating network performance, but they can introduce significant variability that complicates accurate measurement. This paper presents PASTRAMI, a methodology designed to assess the stability of software routers, which is critical to accurately evaluate performance metrics such as the Partial Drop Rate at 0.5% (PDR@0.5%). While PDR@0.5% is a key metric to assess packet processing capabilities of a software router, its reliable evaluation depends on consistent router performance with minimal measurement variability. Our research reveals that different Linux versions exhibit distinct behaviors, with some demonstrating non-negligible packet loss even at low loads and high variability in loss measurements, rendering them unsuitable for accurate performance assessments. This paper proposes a systematic approach to differentiate between stable and unstable environments, offering practical guidance on selecting suitable configurations for robust networking performance evaluations in virtualized environments.</description>

      <title>Wireless Edge Content Broadcast via Integrated Terrestrial and Non-terrestrial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05591v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-terrestrial networks (NTN) have emerged as a transformative solution to bridge the digital divide and deliver essential services to remote and underserved areas. In this context, low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations offer remarkable potential for efficient cache content broadcast in remote regions, thereby extending the reach of digital services. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to optimize wireless edge content placement using NTN. Despite wide coverage, the varying NTN transmission capabilities must be carefully aligned with each content placement to maximize broadcast efficiency. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to optimize wireless edge content placement using NTN, positioning NTN as a complement to TN for achieving optimal content broadcasting. Specifically, we dynamically select content for placement via NTN links. This selection is based on popularity and suitability for delivery through NTN, while considering the orbital motion of LEO satellites. Our system-level case studies, based on a practical LEO constellation, demonstrate the significant improvement in placement speed compared to existing methods, which neglect network mobility. We also demonstrate that NTN links significantly outperform standalone wireless TN solutions, particularly in the early stages of content delivery. This advantage is amplified when there is a higher correlation of content popularity across geographical regions.</description>

      <title>Optimizing AoI at Query in Multiuser Wireless Uplink Networks: A Whittle Index Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02108v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore how to schedule multiple users to optimize information freshness in a pull-based wireless network, where the status updates from users are requested by randomly arriving queries at the destination. We use the age of information at query (QAoI) to characterize the performance of information freshness. Such a decision-making problem is naturally modeled as a Markov decision process (MDP), which, however, is prohibitively high to be solved optimally by the standard method due to the curse of dimensionality. To address this issue, we employ Whittle index approach, which allows us to decouple the original MDP into multiple sub-MDPs by relaxing the scheduling constraints. However, the binary Markovian query arrival process results in a bi-dimensional state and complex state transitions within each sub-MDP, making it challenging to verify Whittle indexability using conventional methods. After a thorough analysis of the sub-MDP's structure, we show that it is unichain and its optimal policy follows a threshold-type structure. This facilitates the verification of Whittle indexability of the sub-MDP by employing an easy-to-verify condition. Subsequently, the steady-state probability distributions of the sub-MDP under different threshold-type policies are analyzed, constituting the analytical expressions of different Whittle indices in terms of the expected average QAoI and scheduling time of the sub-MDP. Building on these, we devise an efficient algorithm to calculate Whittle indices for the formulated sub-MDPs. The simulation results validate our analyses and show the proposed Whittle index policy outperforms baseline policies and achieves near-optimal performance.</description>
