      <title>A class of core inverses associated with Green's relations in semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $S$ be a $*$-monoid and let $a,b,c$ be elements of $S$. We say that $a$ is $(b,c)$-core-EP invertible if there exist some $x$ in $S$ and some nonnegative integer $k$ such that $cax(ca)^{k}c=(ca)^{k}c$, $x{\mathcal R}(ca)^{k}b$ and $x{\mathcal L}((ca)^{k}c)^{*}$. This terminology can be seen as an extension of the $w$-core-EP inverse and the $(b,c)$-core inverse. It is explored when $(b,c)$-core-EP invertibility implies $w$-core-EP invertibility. Another accomplishment of our work is to establish the criteria for the $(b,c)$-core-EP inverse of $a$ and to clarify the relations between the $(b,c)$-inverse, the core inverse, the core-EP inverse, the $w$-core inverse, the $(b,c)$-core inverse and the $(b,c)$-core-EP inverse. As an application, we improve a result in the literature focused on $(b,c)$-core inverses. We then establish the criterion for the $(B,C)$-core-EP inverse of $A$ in complex matrices, and give the solution to the system of matrix equations.</description>

      <title>Averaging antisymmetric infinitesimal bialgebra and perm bialgebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a bialgebra theory for averaging algebras, called averaging antisymmetric infinitesimal bialgebras by generalizing the study of antisymmetric infinitesimal bialgebras to the context of averaging algebras. They are characterized by double constructions of averaging Frobenius algebras as well as matched pairs of averaging algebras. Antisymmetric solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation in averaging algebras provide averaging antisymmetric infinitesimal bialgebras. The notions of an $\mathcal{O}$-operator of an averaging algebra and an averaging dendriform algebra are introduced to construct antisymmetric solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation in an averaging algebra and hence averaging antisymmetric infinitesimal bialgebras. Moreover, we introduce the notion of factorizable averaging antisymmetric infinitesimal bialgebras and show that a factorizable averaging antisymmetric infinitesimal bialgebra leads to a factorization of the underlying averaging algebra. We establish a one-to-one correspondence between factorizable averaging antisymmetric infinitesimal bialgebras and symmetric averaging Frobenius algebras with a Rota-Baxter operator of nonzero weight. Finally, we apply the study of averaging antisymmetric infinitesimal bialgebras to perm bialgebras, extending the construction of perm algebras from commutative averaging algebras to the context of bialgebras, which is consistent with the well constructed theory of perm bialgebras.</description>

      <title>Derived equivalence for the simple flop of type $G_2^{\dagger}$ via tilting bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this article is to prove the derived equivalence for a local model of the simple flop of type $G_2^{\dagger}$, which was found by Kanemitsu. This flop is the only known simple flop that comes from a non-homogeneous roof. The proof of the derived equivalence is done by using tilting bundles, and also produces a noncommutative crepant resolution of the singularity that is derived equivalent to both sides of the flop.</description>

      <title>Homology of Steinberg algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study homological invariants of the Steinberg algebra $\mathcal{A}_k(\mathcal{G})$ of an ample groupoid $\mathcal{G}$ over a commutative ring $k$. For $\mathcal{G}$ principal or Hausdorff with ${\mathcal{G}}^{\rm{Iso}}\setminus{\mathcal{G}}^{(0)}$ discrete, we compute Hochschild and cyclic homology of $\mathcal{A}_k(\mathcal{G})$ in terms of groupoid homology. For any ample Hausdorff groupoid $\mathcal{G}$, we find that $H_*(\mathcal{G})$ is a direct summand of $HH_*(\mathcal{A}_k(\mathcal{G}))$; using this and the Dennis trace we obtain a map $\overline{D}_*:K_*(\mathcal{A}_k(\mathcal{G}))\to H_n(\mathcal{G},k)$. We study this map when $\mathcal{G}$ is the (twisted) Exel-Pardo groupoid associated to a self-similar action of a group $G$ on a graph, and compute $HH_*(\mathcal{A}_k(\mathcal{G}))$ and $H_*(\mathcal{G},k)$ in terms of the homology of $G$, and the $K$-theory of $\mathcal{A}_k(\mathcal{G})$ in terms of that of $k[G]$.</description>

      <title>From length-preserving pushouts of graphs to one-surjective pullbacks of graph algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.14470v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The unions of directed graphs are the simplest examples of pushouts of directed graphs. The conditions under which they contravariantly induce surjective gauge-equivariant pullbacks of graph C*-algebras have been well studied and vastly instantiated in noncommutative topology (e.g., quantum balls and spheres). Herein, we go beyond the unions of graphs to systematically determine optimal conditions for more general length-preserving pushouts of graphs under which they contravariantly induce graded pullbacks of path algebras, Leavitt path algebras, and graph C*-algebras. Our pullbacks are surjective only on one side, as dictated by natural examples and K-theory. The proposed new approach enlarges the scope of applications from admissible subgraphs (also called quotient graphs) to generalizations of unlabeled foldings of Stallings and collapsing the line graphs of graphs to initial graphs. Moreover, we introduce the concept of locally derived graphs, which substantially extends the paradigm of derived graphs (or skew products of graphs), and use the projection foldings from locally derived graphs to their base (or voltage) graphs to obtain one-surjective pullbacks of graph C*-algebras.</description>

      <title>Model structures, n-Gorenstein flat modules and PGF dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.12905v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a non-negative integer $n$ and a ring $R$ with identity, we construct an abelian model structure on the category of left $R$-modules where the class of cofibrant objects coincides with $\mathcal{GF}_n(R)$ the class of left $R$-modules with Gorenstein flat dimension less than $n$, the class of fibrant objects coincides with $\mathcal{F}_n(R)^\perp$ the right ${\rm Ext}$-orthogonal class of left $R$-modules with flat dimension less than $n$, and the class of trivial objects coincides with $\mathcal{PGF}(R)^\perp$ the right ${\rm Ext}$-orthogonal class of PGF left $R$-modules recently introduced by \v{S}aroch and \v{S}\v{t}ov\'{\i}\v{c}ek. The homotopy category of this model structure is triangulated equivalent to the stable category $\underline{\mathcal{GF}(R)\cap\mathcal{C}(R)}$ modulo flat-cotorsion modules and it is compactly generated when $R$ has finite global Gorenstein AC-projective dimension.
  The second part of this paper deals with the PGF dimension of modules and rings. Our results suggest that this dimension could serve as an alternative definition of the Gorenstein projective dimension. We show, among other things, that ($n$-)perfect rings can be characterized in terms of Gorenstein homological dimensions, similar to the classical ones, and the global Gorenstein projective dimension coincides with the global PGF dimension.</description>

      <title>Classification of Frobenius algebra structures on two-dimensional vector space over any base field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05246v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classifying Frobenius algebras is a key question that has been addressed in various contexts. The structure of finite-dimensional Frobenius algebras depends on the base field and the dimension of the algebra, leading to different classification results depending on whether the base field has characteristic zero, characteristic $p$, or other properties. Frobenius algebras over fields of characteristic zero have been well-studied, often related to semisimple algebra theory. The behavior of Frobenius algebras over fields of positive characteristic presents new challenges, with connections to modular representation theory. In the paper, we first classify all associative algebra structures on a two-dimensional vector space over any base field equipped with a non-degenerate bilinear form. We then identify which of these are Frobenius algebras. Lists of canonical representatives of the isomorphism classes of these algebras are provided for a base field with characteristics not equal to two or three, as well as for characteristics two and three.</description>

      <title>The covariant functoriality of graph algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08562v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the standard category of directed graphs, graph morphisms map edges to edges. By allowing graph morphisms to map edges to finite paths (path homomorphisms of graphs), we obtain an ambient category in which we determine subcategories enjoying covariant functors to categories of algebras given by constructions of path algebras, Cohn path algebras, and Leavitt path algebras, respectively. Thus we obtain new tools to unravel homomorphisms between Leavitt path algebras and graph C*-algebras. In particular, a graph-algebraic presentation of the inclusion of the C*-algebra of a quantum real projective plane into the Toeplitz algebra allows us to determine a quantum CW-complex structure of the former. It comes as a mixed-pullback theorem where two $*$-homomorphisms are covariantly induced from path homomorphisms of graphs and the remaining two are contravariantly induced by admissible inclusions of graphs. As a main result and an application of new covariant-induction tools, we prove such a mixed-pullback theorem for arbitrary graphs whose all vertex-simple loops have exits, which substantially enlarges the scope of examples coming from noncommutative topology.</description>

      <title>Polynomial functions on a class of finite non-commutative rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10208v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $R$ be a finite non-commutative ring with $1\ne 0$. By a polynomial function on $R$, we mean a function $F\colon R\longrightarrow R$ induced by a polynomial $f=\sum\limits_{i=0}^{n}a_ix^i\in R[x]$ via right substitution of the variable $x$, i.e.
  $F(a)=f(a)= \sum\limits_{i=0}^{n}a_ia^i$ for every $a\in R$. In this paper, we study the polynomial functions of the free $R$-algebra with a central basis $\{1,\beta_1,\ldots,\beta_k\}$ ($k\ge 1$) such that $\beta_i\beta_j=0$ for every $1\le i,j\le k$, $R[\beta_1,\ldots,\beta_k]$. %, the ring of dual numbers over $R$ in $k$ variables.
  Our investigation revolves around assigning a polynomial $\lambda_f(y,z)$ over $R$ in non-commutating variables $y$ and $z$ to each polynomial $f$ in $R[x]$; and describing the polynomial functions on $R[\beta_1,\ldots,\beta_k]$ through the polynomial functions induced on $R$ by polynomials in $R[x]$ and by their assigned polynomials in the non-commutating variables $y$ and $z$. %and analyzing the resulting polynomial functions on $R[\beta_1,\ldots,\beta_k]$.
  By extending results from the commutative case to the non-commutative scenario, we demonstrate that several properties and theorems in the commutative case can be generalized to the non-commutative setting with appropriate adjustments.</description>

      <title>Rings of Quotients of Rings of Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04079v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: From the original PREFACE: The rings of quotients recently introduced by Johnson and Utumi are applied to the ring $C(X)$ of all continuous real-valued functions on a completely regular space $X$. Let $Q(X)$ denote the maximal ring of quotients of $C(X)$; then $Q(X)$ may be realized as the ring of all continuous functions on the dense open sets of $X$ (modulo an obvious equivalence relation). In special cases (e.g., for metric $X$), $Q(X)$ reduces to the classical ring of quotients of $C(X)$ (formed with respect to the regular elements), but in general, the classical ring is only a proper sub-ring of $Q(X)$.</description>
