      <title>A dark matter hail: Detecting macroscopic dark matter with asteroids, planetary rings, and craters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark matter could be composed of macroscopic objects with large masses and geometric cross-sections spanning many decades. We investigate the potential interaction of such `stuff-sized' dark matter by considering its interactions with asteroids, planetary rings, and terrestrial bodies. This hail of dark matter could catastrophically destroy these Solar System objects, evaporate them from their orbits, or cause substantial cratering. We estimate these effects and use them to place competitive bounds on a wide, previously-unconstrained swathe of the dark matter parameter space.</description>

      <title>Dynamical dark energy with AdS-dS transitions vs. Baryon Acoustic Oscillations at $z =$ 2.3-2.4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, written in memory of Alexei Starobinsky, we discuss the observational viability of the Ph-$\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM model - a dynamical dark energy scenario based on a phantom scalar field undergoing an anti-de Sitter (AdS) to de Sitter (dS) transition - and revisit the Sahni-Shtanov braneworld model in light of updated BAO Ly-$\alpha$ data at $z \sim 2.3$. Both models are able to remain consistent with Planck CMB data while offering potential resolutions to the $H_0$ tension. In both cases, the expansion rate $H(z)$ is suppressed relative to Planck-$\Lambda$CDM at high redshift and enhanced at low redshift, while remaining consistent with the comoving distance to recombination as estimated by Planck-$\Lambda$CDM. Comparing model predictions with BAO-inferred values of $H(z)$, we find that SDSS Ly-$\alpha$ data at $z \approx 2.33$ mildly favor such dynamical models, whereas the recent DESI Ly-$\alpha$ measurements agree more closely with $\Lambda$CDM. Although current high-redshift BAO data do not decisively favor one model over another, our findings illustrate how frameworks originally developed to address earlier anomalies - such as the braneworld scenario - may gain renewed relevance in confronting today's cosmological tensions.</description>

      <title>Galaxy and halo properties around cosmic filaments from Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 and the ELUCID simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 (SDSS DR7) along with haloes from the dark matter only constrained ELUCID (Exploring the Local Universe with the reConstructed Initial Density field) simulation, we examine the properties of galaxies and haloes with respect to their distance to cosmic filaments, determined by the medial-axis thinning technique of the COsmic Web Skeleton (COWS) method. Our findings suggest that galaxies or subhaloes grow in mass as they approach these filaments. Galaxies exhibit a redder colour and diminished specific star formation rates as they approach these filaments. Additionally, older subhaloes tend to be more common near the central regions of these filaments. Elliptical galaxies are more frequently found than spiral galaxies in the central regions of the filaments. Lower-mass galaxies typically display reduced sizes in proximity to filaments, whereas higher-mass galaxies tend to exhibit increased sizes when close to filaments. Moreover, the concentration and spin of the haloes grow as they approach the filaments. These findings support the notion that the large-scale structure of the universe, characterized by cosmic web structures, plays a vital role in shaping galaxy and halo properties.</description>

      <title>Measuring Cosmic Growth Rate with CSST Spectroscopic Survey and Fast Radio Burst</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cosmic growth rate, which is related to peculiar velocity and is a primary scientific objective of galaxy spectroscopic surveys, can be inferred from the Redshift Space Distortion effect and the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect. However, the reconstruction noise power spectrum of the radial velocity field in kSZ is significantly dependent on the measurement of the small-scale galaxy-electron power spectrum $P_{ge}$. In this study, we thoroughly discuss the enhancement of cosmic growth rate measurements facilitated by Fast Radio Bursts, which probe the electron density of the universe along their propagation paths to provide crucial additional information on $P_{ge}$. Subsequently, we utilize future spectroscopic surveys from the Chinese Space Station Telescope and the CMB-S4 experiment, combined with FRB dispersion measures, to achieve precise measurements of the cosmic growth rate at redshifts $z_g = 0.15,0.45,0.75$. Employing Fisher matrix forecasting analysis, we anticipate that constraints on $f\sigma_8$ will reach a precision of 0.001 with a sample size of $10^6$ FRBs. Furthermore, we perform a global analysis using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods to constrain key parameters of three distinct dark energy models and a modified gravity model based on cosmic growth rate measurements. The results demonstrate that these refined $f\sigma_8$ measurements considerably enhance the constraints on relevant cosmological parameters compared to those obtained from Planck. As the number of observed FRBs increases, alongside more precise galaxy surveys and next-generation CMB observations, new opportunities will arise for constraining cosmological models using the kSZ effect and for developing novel cosmological applications of FRBs.</description>

      <title>DUCA: Dynamic Universe Cosmological Analysis. I. The halo mass function in dynamical dark energy cosmologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The halo mass function (HMF) is fundamental for interpreting the number counts of galaxy clusters, serving as a pivotal theoretical tool in cosmology. With the advent of high-precision surveys such as LSST, eROSITA, DESI, and Euclid, accurate HMF modeling becomes indispensable to avoid systematic biases in cosmological parameter estimation from cluster cosmology. Moreover, these surveys aim to shed light on the dark sector and uncover dark energy's puzzling nature, necessitating models that faithfully capture its features to ensure robust parameter inference. We aim to construct a model for the HMF in dynamical dark energy cosmologies that preserves the accuracy achieved for the standard $\Lambda (\nu)$CDM model of cosmology, while meeting the precision requirements necessary for future cosmological surveys. Our approach models the HMF parameters as functions of the deceleration parameter at the turnaround, a quantity shown to encapsulate essential information regarding the impact of dynamical dark energy on structure formation. We calibrate the model using results from a comprehensive suite of $N$-body simulations spanning various cosmological scenarios, ensuring sub-percent systematic accuracy. We present an HMF model tailored for dynamical dark energy cosmologies. The model is calibrated following a Bayesian approach, and its uncertainty is characterized by a single parameter controlling its systematic error, which remains at the sub-percent level. This ensures that theoretical uncertainties from our model are subdominant relative to other error sources in future cluster number counts analyses.</description>

      <title>Power spectrum of the CODEX clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims. We analyze the clustering of galaxy clusters in a large contiguous sample, the Constrain Dark Energy with X-ray (CODEX) sample. We construct a likelihood for cosmological parameters by comparing the measured clustering signal and a theoretical prediction, and use this to obtain parameter constraints. Methods. We measured the three multipole moments (monopole, quadrupole, and hexadecapole, $\ell = 0, 2, 4$) of the power spectrum of a subset of the CODEX clusters. To fully model cluster clustering, we also determined the expected clustering bias of the sample using estimates for the cluster masses and a mass-to-bias model calibrated using N-body simulations. We estimated the covariance matrix of the measured power spectrum multipoles using a set of simulated dark-matter halo catalogs. Combining all these ingredients, we performed a Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling of cosmological parameters $\Omega_m$ and $\sigma_8$ to obtain their posterior. Results. We found the CODEX clustering signal to be consistent with an earlier X-ray selected cluster sample, the REFLEX II sample. We also found that the measured power spectrum multipoles are compatible with the predicted, bias-scaled linear matter power spectrum when the cosmological parameters determined by the Planck satellite are assumed. Furthermore, we found the marginalized parameter constraints of $\Omega_m = 0.24^{+0.06}_{-0.04}$ and $\sigma_8 = 1.13^{+0.43}_{-0.24}$. The full 2D posterior is consistent, for example, with the Planck cosmology within the 68% confidence region.</description>

      <title>The Cosmological Evidence for Non-Minimal Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent observational evidence of deviations from the $\Lambda$-Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model points towards the presence of evolving dark energy. The simplest possibility consists of a cosmological scalar field $\varphi$, dubbed quintessence, driving the accelerated expansion. We assess the evidence for the existence of such a scalar field. We find that, if the accelerated expansion is driven by quintessence, the data favour a potential energy $V(\varphi)$ that is concave, i.e., $m^2=d^2V/d\varphi^2&lt;0$. Furthermore, and more significantly, the data strongly favour a scalar field that is non-minimally coupled to gravity (Bayes factor $\log(B) = 7.34 \pm 0.60$), leading to time variations in the gravitational constant on cosmological scales, and the existence of fifth forces on smaller scales. The fact that we do not observe such fifth forces implies that either new physics must come into play on non-cosmological scales or that quintessence is an unlikely explanation for the observed cosmic acceleration.</description>

      <title>Improving Photometric Redshift Estimation for CSST Mock Catalog Using SED Templates Calibrated with Perturbation Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photometric redshifts of galaxies obtained by multi-wavelength data are widely used in photometric surveys because of its high efficiency. Although various methods have been developed, template fitting is still adopted as one of the most popular approaches. Its accuracy strongly depends on the quality of the Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) templates, which can be calibrated using broadband photometric data from galaxies with known spectroscopic redshifts. Such calibration is expected to improve photometric redshift accuracy, as the calibrated templates will align with observed photometric data more closely. The upcoming China Space Station Survey Telescope (CSST) is one of the Stage IV surveys, which aiming for high precision cosmological studies. To improve the accuracy of photometric redshift estimation for CSST, we calibrated the CWW+KIN templates using a perturbation algorithm with broadband photometric data from the CSST mock catalog. This calibration used a training set consisting of approximately 4,500 galaxies, which is 10% of the total galaxy sample. The outlier fraction and scatter of the photometric redshifts derived from the calibrated templates are 2.55% and 0.036, respectively. Compared to the CWW+KIN templates, these values are reduced by 34% and 23%, respectively. This demonstrates that SED templates calibrated with a small training set can effectively optimize photometric redshift accuracy for future large-scale surveys like CSST, especially with limited spectral training data.</description>

      <title>Quantum Gravity Meets DESI: Dynamical Dark Energy in Light of the Trans-Planckian Censorship Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent DESI DR2 observations indicate that dark energy has crossed from phantom to quintessence regime, a behavior known as the quintom-B realization. In this work we constrain dynamical dark energy and modified gravity using the swampland Trans-Planckian Censorship Conjecture (TCC), which forbids eternal acceleration since in this case any trans-Planckian quantum fluctuation would eventually stretch beyond the Hubble radius, breaking the applicability of any effective field theory and cosmological techniques. By combining DESI DR2 data with the TCC criterion, we impose tight constraints on the dark energy equation of state and its parameter space in scenarios such as the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder, Barboza-Alcaniz, Jassal-Bagla-Padmanabhan, EXP and LOG parameterizations, significantly constraining the quintom-A behavior. Also we examine models within the framework of $f(T)$ and $f(Q)$ modified gravity theories, demonstrating that TCC is very powerful to constrain or exclude them, a result that indicates the necessity to consider infrared modifications on General Relativity apart from the usual ultraviolet ones. Our findings imply that viable dynamical dark energy scenarios must asymptotically transit to deceleration, shedding light on new physics consistent with both cosmological observations and quantum gravity principles.</description>

      <title>Large anisotropies in the gravitational wave background from baryogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Affleck-Dine (AD) baryogenesis can produce the baryon asymmetry of the Universe through the $CP$-violating dynamics of AD field. The field generally fragments into Q-balls, whose rapid decay induces enhanced gravitational waves. In this Letter, we investigate the anisotropies in this gravitational wave background as a new essential observable for AD baryogenesis. The evolution of AD field causes non-Gaussian baryonic isocurvature perturbations, and the non-Gaussianity modulates the spatial distribution of Q-balls on large scales, resulting in large-scale anisotropies in the Q-ball-induced gravitational wave background. We present that the anisotropies can be significantly large with a reduced angular power spectrum $\sim 10^{-2}$, and can be detected by future experiments like LISA. Moreover, these anisotropies universally reveal the $CP$-violating dynamics of AD field, opening a novel road to explore the longstanding baryon asymmetry puzzle.</description>

      <title>Stupendously Large Primordial Black Holes from the QCD axion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inflationary diffusion of (pseudo-)scalar fields with discrete symmetries can seed the formation of a gas of closed domain walls after inflation, when the distance between degenerate minima in field space is not too far from the inflationary Hubble scale. Primordial black holes (PBHs) can then be formed once sufficiently heavy domain walls re-enter the Hubble sphere. In this scenario, inflation determines a distinctive PBH mass distribution that is rather flat and can thus lead to a sizable total abundance of PBHs, while avoiding some of the downsides of PBH formation from critical collapse. We show that generic QCD axion models, with decay constant close to the inflationary Hubble scale, can yield up to $1\%$ of the dark matter (DM) today in the form of PBHs, while being compatible with isocurvature constraints from Cosmic Microwave Background observations. This occurs for values of axion decay constants around $f_a\simeq 10^{8}~\text{GeV}$, that is the region targeted by axion helioscopes and partially constrained by astrophysical observations. The resulting PBHs have \textit{stupendously} large masses, above $10^{11}M_\odot$, and their existence can be probed by Large Scale Structure observations. Larger PBH abundances can be generated by axion-like particles. Alternatively, in scenarios where isocurvature constraints can be relaxed, we find that the totality of the DM can be produced by the QCD axion misalignment mechanism, accompanied by a ${\cal O}(10^{-3})$ DM fraction in PBHs of masses $(10^5-10^6)~M_\odot$. These can act as seeds for the formation of massive black holes at large redshifts, as suggested by recent JWST observations.</description>

      <title>One-loop renormalization of the effective field theory of inflationary fluctuations from gravitational interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We dig into the semi-classical description of gravity by studying one-loop corrections to primordial power spectra generated during cosmic inflation from gravitational nonlinear interactions. In the realm of the Effective Field Theory (EFT) of inflationary fluctuations, we renormalize the quadratic Lagrangian dictating the linear dynamics of gauge-invariant perturbations. Since gravity is a non-renormalizable theory, this procedure is performed perturbatively in terms of negative powers of the EFT strong coupling scales. Since the interactions we consider are purely gravitational, they are ubiquitous and independent of the details of the EFT. Our results are thus relevant for a large class of approximately scale-invariant inflationary scenarios, be them driven by a single scalar field with canonical kinetic terms, or with a non-canonical structure \textit{\`a la} $P(X,\phi)$, or for an effective single-field description at the level of fluctuations only and emerging from a covariant multifield theory. Using dimensional regularization, we show that time-dependent Ultra-Violet (UV) divergences appearing at the loop level can be canceled at all times by an appropriate splitting of the bare Lagrangian into renormalized operators and counterterms. Moreover, we explicitly compute all finite contributions to the loops and we prove that, taking into account backreaction, the final one-loop renormalized power spectra of both the primordial curvature perturbation and of gravitational waves are exactly conserved on super-horizon scales. Conclusions of our work imply that the scalar and tensor propagation speeds are immune to radiative corrections from gravitational nonlinearities. We discuss a first application to multifield inflation.</description>

      <title>Baryon asymmetry constraints on magnetic field from the Electroweak epoch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decay of helical (hyper)magnetic fields that may have been present in the Universe during the Electroweak epoch can contribute to generation of the baryon asymmetry of the Universe. We revise constraints on the strength and correlation length of such fields from the requirement that their decay does not lead to over-production of the baryon asymmetry. We show that the helical fields with strength down to 1e-5 of the maximal possible strength during the Electroweak epoch should have had their correlation at least ~1e-6 of the Hubble radius during this epoch. For weaker fields this lower bound on the correlation length relaxes proportionally to the square of magnetic field strength. A field with parameters saturating the bound may actually be responsible for the baryon asymmetry observed today. We show that relic of such a field, surviving in the present day Universe in the form of intergalactic magnetic field detectable with Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory, may have the strength up to 10-100 pG and can have parameters needed to affect the cosmological recombination and relax the Hubble tension. We also show that there is no constraint on the parameters of helical or non-helical magnetic fields stemming from the requirement that the baryon isocurvature perturbations produced by such fields during the Electroweak epoch are within the observational limits.</description>

      <title>What it takes to solve the Hubble tension through scale-dependent modifications of the primordial power spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate scale-dependent modifications to the primordial scalar power spectrum as potential solutions to the Hubble tension. We use the Fisher-bias formalism, recently adapted to examine perturbed recombination solutions to the Hubble tension, and extend its range of validity with an iterative method. We first analyze the Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy data, demonstrating the existence of modifications to the primordial power spectrum capable of fully resolving the tension between Planck and SH0ES. As a proof of concept, we interpret these solutions in terms of small, time-dependent variations in the first slow roll parameter or in the sound speed of curvature perturbations during a stage of primordial inflation. However, these solutions are associated with a low total matter density $\Omega_m$, which makes them inconsistent with baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) and uncalibrated supernovae (SNIa) data. When incorporating additional BOSS and PantheonPlus data, the solutions that reduce the Hubble tension tend to overfit Planck CMB data to compensate for the worsened fit to BAO and SNIa data, making them less compelling. These findings suggest that modifying the primordial power spectrum alone is unlikely to provide a robust resolution to the tension and highlight how the viability of such data-driven solutions depends on the specific datasets considered, emphasizing the role of future high-precision observations in further constraining possible resolutions to the tension.</description>

      <title>Primordial neutrinos fade to gray: constraints from cosmological observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of potentially large distortions of the relic neutrino spectra on cosmological observables.To that end, we consider a phenomenological model of "gray" spectral distributions, described by a single parameter which generalizes the traditional $y$-distortions to possibly large negative values. Implementing these distortions in the primordial nucleosynthesis code PRIMAT, we can constrain the distortion parameter along with the presence of extra radiation, exploiting the complementarity of big bang nucleosynthesis and cosmic microwave background measurements to disentangle gravitational and non-thermal effects. These constraints rule out a distortion where more than $\sim 1/2$ of the neutrinos energy density is replaced by dark radiation. Nonetheless, we find that large distortions, accompanied by extra radiation, are allowed-and even slightly preferred in some cases-by current cosmological observations. As this scenario would require substantial modifications to the physics of neutrino decoupling in the early Universe, these observational constraints call for a renewed attention on the possibility of large deviations from the standard cosmological model in the neutrino sector.</description>

      <title>Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model for realistic and fast generated \textit{Euclid}-like data for weak lensing analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding and mitigating measurement systematics in weak lensing (WL) analysis requires large datasets of realistic galaxies with diverse morphologies and colors. Missions like Euclid, the Nancy Roman Space Telescope, and Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time will provide unprecedented statistical power and control over systematic uncertainties. Achieving the stringent shear measurement requirement of $\lvert m \rvert &lt; 10^{-3}$ demands analyzing $10^9$ galaxies. Accurately modeling galaxy morphology is crucial, as it is shaped by complex astrophysical processes that are not yet fully understood. Subtle deviations in shape and structural parameters can introduce biases in shear calibration. The interplay between bulges, disks, star formation, and mergers contributes to morphological diversity, requiring simulations that faithfully reproduce these features to avoid systematics in shear measurements. Generating such a large and realistic dataset efficiently is feasible using advanced generative models like denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs). In this work, we extend Hubble Space Telescope (HST) data across Euclid's broad optical band using CANDELS and develop a generative AI tool to produce realistic Euclid-like galaxies while preserving morphological details. We validate our tool through visual inspection and quantitative analysis of galaxy parameters, demonstrating its capability to simulate realistic Euclid galaxy images, which will address WL challenges and enhance calibration for current and future cosmological missions.</description>

      <title>Galactic Accelerations from the GD-1 Stream Suggest a Tilted Dark Matter Halo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cold dark matter halos are expected to be triaxial and often tilted relative to the stellar disk. Stellar streams provide a sensitive tracer of the Milky Way's halo shape, though models for the Galactic potential are typically limited to simple, symmetric functional forms. Here, we measure the Galactic acceleration field along the GD-1 stellar stream using a direct differentiation of the stream's track in phase-space. Using a fully data-driven catalog of stream members from Gaia, SDSS, LAMOST, and DESI, we map the stream in 6D phase-space. We fit splines to the stream track, and infer cylindrical acceleration components $a_R = -2.5 \pm_{0.1}^{0.2}, \ a_z = -1.8\pm 0.1, \ a_\phi = 0.2\pm 0.1~\rm{km \ s^{-1} \ Myr^{-1}}$ at $(R,z,\phi) = (11.9~\rm{kpc}, 7.3~\rm{kpc}, 171.1~\rm{deg})$. We measure mass enclosed within $14~\rm{kpc}$ of $1.4\pm 0.1 \times 10^{11} M_\odot$ and z-axis density flattening of $q_{\rho, z} = 0.81\pm^{0.06}_{0.03}$, both consistent with previous estimates. However, we find a 2$\sigma$ deviation from an axisymmetric acceleration field, which can be explained by a triaxial dark matter halo with axis ratios 1:0.75:0.70. The major axis of the halo is consistent with a tilt of $18~\rm{deg}$ above the Galactic plane in the direction of the Sun. The magnitude and direction of the tilt are consistent with measurements of the Milky Way's stellar halo from Gaia and the H3 survey. A tilted triaxial halo has important consequences for orbit-integration-based studies of the Galaxy, and can be further tested by deriving acceleration constraints from multiple streams.</description>

      <title>Search for Axion Dark Matter from 1.1 to 1.3 GHz with ADMX</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Axion dark matter can satisfy the conditions needed to account for all of the dark matter and solve the strong CP problem. The Axion Dark Matter eXperiment (ADMX) is a direct dark matter search using a haloscope to convert axions to photons in an external magnetic field. Key to this conversion is the use of a microwave resonator that enhances the sensitivity at the frequency of interest. The ADMX experiment boosts its sensitivity using a dilution refrigerator and near quantum-limited amplifier to reduce the noise level in the experimental apparatus. In the most recent run, ADMX searched for axions between 1.10-1.31 GHz to extended Kim-Shifman-Vainshtein-Zakharov (KSVZ) sensitivity. This Letter reports on the results of that run, as well as unique aspects of this experimental setup.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave signals from primordial black holes orbiting solar-type stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) with masses between $10^{14}$ and $10^{20}$ kg are candidates to contribute a substantial fraction of the total dark matter abundance. When in orbit around the center of a star, which can possibly be a completely interior orbit, such objects would emit gravitational waves, as predicted by general relativity. In this work, we examine the gravitational wave signals emitted by such objects when they orbit typical stars, such as the Sun. We show that the magnitude of the waves that could eventually be detected on Earth from a possible PBH orbiting the Sun or a neighboring Sun-like star within our galaxy can be significantly stronger than those originating from a PBH orbiting a denser but more distant neutron star (NS). Such signals may be detectable by the LISA gravitational-wave detector. In addition, we estimate the contribution that a large collection of such PBH-star systems would make to the stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB) within a range of frequencies to which pulsar timing arrays are sensitive.</description>

      <title>Wide Binaries from GAIA DR3 : testing GR vs MOND with realistic triple modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide an updated test for modifications of gravity from a sample of wide-binary stars from GAIA DR3, and their sky-projected relative velocities. Here we extend on our earlier 2023 study, using several updated selection cuts aimed at reducing contamination from triple systems with an undetected third star. We also use improved mass estimates from FLAMES, and we add refinements to previous modelling of the triple and other populations and the model-fitting. We fit histograms of observed vs Newtonian velocity differences to a flexible mixture of binary + triple populations with realistic eccentricity distributions, plus unbound flyby and random-chance populations. We find as before that Newtonian models provide a significantly better fit than MOND, though improved understanding of the triple population is necessary to make this fully decisive.</description>

Abstract: We explore four-dimensional scalar-tensor theories obtained from well-defined dimensional regularizations of Lovelock invariants. When an infinite tower of corrections is considered, these theories allow for cosmological models in which the Big Bang singularity is replaced by an inflationary phase in the early-universe, and they also admit a specific class of regular black hole solutions.</description>

      <title>Biased domain walls: faster annihilation, weaker gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the evolution of domain wall networks and their phenomenological implications in a model of a real scalar $\chi$, where a $Z_2$-symmetry is slightly broken by a potential bias $V_{bias}$. It is demonstrated that the latter triggers domain wall annihilation considerably earlier than previously thought. Namely, we observe that the scaling relation $t_{ann} \propto 1/V^{2/3}_{bias}$ for the annihilation time $t_{ann}$ fits to the simulation data better than a commonly assumed $t_{ann} \propto 1/V_{bias}$. As a result, the energy density of gravitational waves produced by the network of biased domain walls, for a given tiny $V_{bias}$, is suppressed compared to naive expectations. The spectral shape of gravitational waves is similar to that resulting from unbiased domain walls, but with more power in the close-to-maximum ultraviolet part. In the far ultraviolet region, the spectrum of gravitational waves becomes nearly flat; such a plateau has been recognized earlier in the case of unbiased walls. In our investigation we mainly focus on the symmetry breaking potential $V_{breaking} \propto \chi^3$, and argue that no significant modifications of the domain walls evolution take place if one includes higher powers of $\chi$.</description>

      <title>Cosmological perturbations with ultralight vector dark matter fields: numerical implementation in CLASS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12052v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we consider a dark matter candidate described by an ultralight vector field, whose mass is in principle in the range $H_{\rm{eq}}\sim 10^{-28}\rm{eV}\ll m&lt; \rm{eV}$. The homogeneous background vector field is assumed to point in a given direction. We present a numerical implementation of cosmological perturbations in a Bianchi type I geometry with vector field dark matter in a modified version of the Cosmic Linear Anisotropy Solving System (CLASS). We study the evolution of large-scale cosmological perturbations in the linear regime. We compute the matter power spectrums defined for Fourier modes pointing in a given direction. We obtain interesting features in the power spectrums whose observational significance depends on the field mass. We compare the results with the standard $\rm{\Lambda CDM}$ and with the corresponding well-studied ultralight scalar field dark matter case. As for the scalar case we obtain a suppression in the power spectrums at small scales characterized by the same scale, namely the Jeans scale. The main characteristic feature of the vector field model we notice here for first time is that the amplitude of the suppression effect depends on the direction of the Fourier modes with respect to the background vector field, leaving eventually a possible anisotropic imprint in structure formation at small scales.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07380v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We estimate the global signal in the redshifted hyperfine structure line 21 cm of hydrogen atoms formed during the Dark Ages and Cosmic Dawn epochs. The evolution of the brightness temperature in this line was computed to study its dependence on the physical conditions in the intergalactic medium. We show that the profile of this line crucially depends on the temperature and ionization of baryonic matter as well as the spectral energy distribution of radiation from the first sources. The cosmological models with the self-annihilating and decaying dark matter with allowable parameters by current observational data, as well as the model of the first light which is consistent with the observational data on reionization were considered. The results show that the Dark Ages part of profile is very sensitive to the parameters of self-annihilating and decaying dark matter particles, while the Cosmic Dawn part of profile is very sensitive also to the spectral energy distribution of radiation from the first sources. It was concluded that only compatible observations of the redshifted 21 cm line in the decameter and meter wavelength range, formed during the Dark Ages and Cosmic Dawn, will make it possible to constrain the parameters of dark matter models and astrophysical models of the first sources based on the radiotomography of the young Universe.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the impact of neutrino mass hierarchies on neutrino mass constraints in light of recent DESI data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03546v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent results from DESI combined with cosmic microwave background data give the tightest constraints on the sum of neutrino masses to date. However, these analyses approximate the neutrino mass hierarchy by three degenerate-mass (DM) neutrinos, instead of the normal (NH) and inverted hierarchies (IH) informed by terrestrial neutrino oscillation experiments. Given the stringency of the upper limits from DESI data, we test explicitly whether the inferred neutrino constraints are robust to the choice of neutrino mass ordering using both Bayesian and frequentist methods. For Planck data alone, we find that the DM hierarchy presents a good approximation to the physically motivated hierarchies while showing a strong dependence on the assumed lower bound of the prior, confirming previous studies. For the combined Planck and DESI baryon acoustic oscillation data, we find that assuming NH ($M_\mathrm{tot} &lt; 0.13\,\mathrm{eV}$) or IH ($M_\mathrm{tot} &lt; 0.16\,\mathrm{eV}$) loosens the Bayesian upper limits compared to the DM approximation ($M_\mathrm{tot} &lt; 0.086\,\mathrm{eV}$). The frequentist analysis shows that the different neutrino models fit the data equally well and the loosening of the constraints can thus be attributed to the lower bounds induced by NH and IH. Overall, we find that the DM hierarchy presents a good approximation to the physically motivated hierarchies also for Planck+DESI data as long as the corresponding lower neutrino mass bounds are imposed.</description>

      <title>An overview of what current data can (and cannot yet) say about evolving dark energy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10264v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent measurements of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) and distance moduli from Type Ia supernovae suggest a preference for Dynamical Dark Energy (DDE) scenarios characterized by a time-varying equation of state (EoS). This focused review assesses its robustness across independent measurements and surveys. Using the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization to describe the evolution of the DE EoS, we analyze over 35 dataset combinations, incorporating Planck Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropies, three independent Type Ia supernova (SN) catalogs (PantheonPlus, Union3, DESY5), BAO measurements from DESI and SDSS, and expansion rate measurements $H(z)$ inferred from the relative ages of massive, passively evolving galaxies at early cosmic times known as Cosmic Chronometers (CC). This review has two main objectives: first, to evaluate the statistical significance of the DDE preference across different dataset combinations, which incorporate varying sources of information. Specifically, we consider cases where only low-redshift probes are used in different combinations, others where individual low-redshift probes are analyzed together with CMB data, and finally, scenarios where high- and low-redshift probes are included in all possible independent combinations. Second, we provide a reader-friendly synthesis of what the latest cosmological and astrophysical probes can (and cannot yet) reveal about DDE. Overall, our findings highlight that combinations that \textit{simultaneously} include PantheonPlus SN and SDSS BAO significantly weaken the preference for DDE. However, intriguing hints supporting DDE emerge in combinations that do not include DESI-BAO measurements: SDSS-BAO combined with SN from Union3 and DESY5 (with and without CMB) support the preference for DDE.</description>

Abstract: Recent findings from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 2 (DR2) favor a dynamical dark energy characterized by a phantom crossing feature. This result also implies a lower value of the Hubble constant, thereby intensifying the so-called Hubble tension. To alleviate the Hubble tension, we consider the early dark energy and explore its impact on the evidence for dynamical dark energy including the Hubble constant calibrated by the SH0ES collaboration. We find that incorporating SH0ES prior with CMB, DESI DR2 BAO and Pantheon Plus/Union3/DESY5 data reduces the preference to dynamical dark energy to $1.5\sigma/1.4\sigma/2.4\sigma$ level, respectively. Our results suggest a potential tension between the Hubble constant $H_0$ of the SH0ES measurement and the phantom-to-quintessence transition in dark energy favored by DESI DR2 BAO data.</description>

      <title>Hubble tension and small-scale inhomogeneities on light propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06831v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the observational challenges in the standard cosmological model is known as the Hubble tension. This $\sim$ 5$\sigma$ discrepancy between early and late measurements of the Hubble Constant arises from observations that rely on cosmological distance estimates, either explicitly or implicitly. In this study, we relax the assumption of the Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) distance-redshift relation and explore the influence of small-scale inhomogeneities on the propagation of light from distant sources, using the Zeldovich-Kantowski-Dyer-Roeder (ZKDR) approximation as an alternative approach to address this tension. We employ the ZKDR equation along with a modified version to test our hypothesis using recent Type Ia supernovae data from the Pantheon+ compilation and the SH0ES collaboration and six gravitational lens systems from the H0LiCOW collaboration. Our findings indicate that a background model characterized by the ZKDR approximation and its modifications does not solve or alleviate the Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>Cosmic acceleration driven by dark matter self-interactions: a phenomenological treatment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.01867</link>
      <description>arXiv:1904.01867v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the idea that cosmic acceleration may be a byproduct of late-time effects like structure formation in two steps. First, we consider the equation of state for an inhomogeneous cosmic fluid, which may lead to a Gedanken-model for cosmic evolution, where dark matter is strongly self-interacting and stays in a plasma state until late stages of the cosmic evolution. After decoupling, it condensates to super-structures with cosmic voids similar to the current picture of the universe, introducing a negative pressure term in relation to self-interaction strength. Secondly, we carry out a cosmological analysis inspired by this scenario via a phenomenological ansatz that exhibits a transient behavior. In this analysis, we use the recent Type Ia supernova compilation and high redshift quasar data and compare the results to that of $\Lambda$CDM. It turns out that proposed model can solve the quasar Hubble diagram tension.</description>

      <title>Prospects for cosmological constraints using gravitational wave memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18083v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The {\Lambda}CDM model has long served as a robust and predictive framework for cosmology, successfully explaining a wide range of observations, including the accelerated expansion of the Universe. However, discrepancies in cosmological parameter estimates and recent findings, such as those from DESI, hint at potential deviations from {\Lambda}CDM. Gravitational wave (GW) observations offer an independent method to probe the nature of dark energy, leveraging GWs from compact binary mergers as standard candles. In this study, we demonstrate that the integrated GW memory over cosmological distances encodes a unique imprint of the background spacetime. Unlike previous analyses, our approach captures non-linear dependencies on cosmological quantities, resulting in an enhancement of the integrated GW memory by a factor of 100 for high-redshift sources well within the sensitivity range of next-generation detectors like Cosmic Explorer and the Einstein Telescope. We find that despite the diminishing strength of individual GWs at high redshifts, their cumulative effect leads to a significant amplification, akin to the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect, offering a potential new avenue for cosmological studies. By examining a range of dark energy models, we reveal that GW memory is potentially highly sensitive to the underlying cosmological framework, making it a promising probe of dark energy. This novel approach presents the possibility of a fresh perspective to address persistent cosmological tensions, and the nature of dark energy.</description>

      <title>Bubbles kick off primordial black holes to form more binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05838v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) may form before cosmological first-order phase transitions, leading to inevitable collisions between PBHs and bubble walls. In this Letter, we have simulated for the first time the co-evolution of an expanding scalar wall passing through a black hole with full numerical relativity. This black hole-bubble wall collision yields multiple far-reaching phenomena, including the PBH mass growth, gravitational wave radiations, and momentum recoil that endows PBHs with additional velocities, approximately doubling the formation rate for PBH binaries and hence strengthening the observational constraints on the PBH abundances.</description>

      <title>Consistency of EFT illuminated via relative entropy: A case study in scalar field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21062v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Relative entropy is a non-negative quantity and offers a powerful means of achieving a unified understanding of fundamental properties in physics, including the second law of thermodynamics and positivity bounds on effective field theories (EFTs). We analyze the relative entropy in scalar field theories and show that the non-negativity of relative entropy is potentially violated in perturbative calculations based on operator and loop expansions. Conversely, this suggests that the consistency of the EFT description in the scalar field theory can be identified by the sign of the relative entropy. In fact, we revisit an EFT of single-field inflation and present a relation between its non-linear parameter $f_{\rm NL}$ and the consistency condition of the EFT description derived from the relative entropy method. We find that interesting regions of $f_{\rm NL}$ that are observationally allowed can be constrained from the relative entropy by imposing the consistency of the EFT description when the EFT is generated via the interaction with heavy fields in UV theories.</description>

      <title>Tilt and Tensor-to-Scalar Ratio in Multi-Scalar Field Inflation: Non-Sum-Separable Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01428v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The canonical multi-scalar field inflation where the kinetic and potential terms are sum-separable is ruled out by the current observations for the chaotic-type potential $V=\sum_{i} \mu_{i} \phi_{i}^{p}$. This paper explores the non-sum-separable case to validate the chaotic-type potential in the multi-scalar field, incorporating a linear coupling term between the kinetic and potential terms in the canonical Lagrangian. This coupling influences the slow-roll parameters and also alters our predictions for the spectral index $n_{s}$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$, which directly depend on those parameters. In fact, compared to standard canonical multi-field inflation, the values of $n_{s}$ and $r$ decrease to levels consistent with the recent Planck+BICEP/Keck constraint.</description>

      <title>Measuring Type Ia Supernova Angular-Diameter Distances with Intensity Interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07725v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the potential of intensity interferometry, based on the Hanbury Brown-Twiss effect, for measuring supernova sizes and distances. Through optimized telescope positioning, observing strategy, and advancements in single-photon detection technology, this method can provide precise angular size measurements of Type Ia supernovae as bright as 12~mag, corresponding to a local volume out to $z\sim0.004$, with an anticipated rate of $\sim 1$ events per year. The combination of angular size data with known physical dimensions enables accurate distance determination. Multiple telescope pairs at different relative positions allow tomographic mapping of the ejecta structure while reducing distance uncertainties. As Type Ia supernovae serve as standardizable candles for measuring the Universe's expansion history, combining intensity interferometry distances with the supernova Hubble diagram facilitates measurements of the Hubble constant $H_0$.</description>

      <title>Bubbles in a box: Eliminating edge nucleation in cold-atom simulators of vacuum decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02829v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The decay of metastable 'false vacuum' states via bubble nucleation plays a crucial role in many cosmological scenarios. Cold-atom analog experiments will soon provide the first empirical probes of this process, with potentially far-reaching implications for early-Universe cosmology and high-energy physics. However, an inevitable difference between these analog systems and the early Universe is that the former have a boundary. We show, using a combination of Euclidean calculations and real-time lattice simulations, that these boundaries generically cause rapid bubble nucleation on the edge of the experiment, obscuring the bulk nucleation that is relevant for cosmology. We demonstrate that implementing a high-density 'trench' region at the boundary completely eliminates this problem, and recovers the desired cosmological behavior. Our findings are relevant for ongoing efforts to probe vacuum decay in the laboratory, providing a practical solution to a key experimental obstacle.</description>
