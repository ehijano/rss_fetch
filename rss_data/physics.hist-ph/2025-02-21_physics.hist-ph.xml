      <title>The life cycle of scientific principles -- a template for characterizing physical principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scientific principles can undergo various developments. While philosophers of science have acknowledged that such changes occur, there is no systematic account of the development of scientific principles. Here we propose a template for analyzing the development of scientific principles called the 'life cycle' of principles. It includes a series of processes that principles can go through: prehistory, elevation, formalization, generalization, and challenge. The life cycle, we argue, is a useful heuristic for the analysis of the development of scientific principles. We illustrate this by discussing examples from foundational physics including Lorentz invariance, Mach's principle, the naturalness principle, and the perfect cosmological principle. We also explore two applications of the template. First, we propose that the template can be employed to diagnose the quality of scientific principles. Second, we discuss the ramifications of the life cycle's processes for the empirical testability of principles.</description>

      <title>Bohmian Mechanics fails to compute multi-time correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The violation of Bell type inequalities in quantum systems manifests that quantum states cannot be described by classical probability distributions. Yet, Bohmian mechanics is a realistic, non-local theory of classical particle trajectories that is claimed to be indistinguishable by observations from more traditional approaches to quantum mechanics. We set up a spatial version of the GHZ system with qubits realised as positional observables that demonstrates that the Bohmian theory fails to match predictions of textbook quantum mechanics (and most likely experients) unless enlarged by a microscopic theory of collapse of the wave function after observation. For this discrepancy to occur it is essential that positions at different times do not commute.</description>

      <title>MoNA -- The first 25 years</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Modular Neutron Array (MoNA) collaboration was initiated in 2000 at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL) at Michigan State University (MSU). Since then, the collaboration studied properties of nuclides at and beyond the neutron dripline discovering seven new isotopes between lithium to fluorine. The collaboration included liberal arts colleges, regional comprehensive universities, and major research universities with the focus of giving undergraduate students meaningful research experiences. Over the last 25 years, the combined efforts of hundreds of undergraduates, dozens of graduate students and research associates, and faculty from more than a dozen colleges and universities produced over fifty publications, won awards for research, and combined research and teaching in new and interesting ways.</description>

      <title>The long-term solar variability, as reconstructed from historical sources: Several case studies in the 17th -- 18th centuries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On a centennial timescale, solar activity was quantified based on records of instrumental sunspot observations. This article briefly discusses several aspects of the recent archival investigations of historical sunspot records in the 17th to 18th centuries. This article also reviews the recent updates for the active day fraction and positions of the reported sunspot groups of the Maunder Minimum to show their significance within the observational history. These archival investigations serve as base datasets for reconstructing solar activity.</description>
