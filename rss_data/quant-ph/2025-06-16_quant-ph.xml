      <title>HQFNN: A Compact Quantum-Fuzzy Neural Network for Accurate Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning vision systems excel at pattern recognition yet falter when inputs are noisy or the model must explain its own confidence. Fuzzy inference, with its graded memberships and rule transparency, offers a remedy, while parameterized quantum circuits can embed features in richly entangled Hilbert spaces with striking parameter efficiency. Bridging these ideas, this study introduces a innovative Highly Quantized Fuzzy Neural Network (HQFNN) that realises the entire fuzzy pipeline inside a shallow quantum circuit and couples the resulting quantum signal to a lightweight CNN feature extractor. Each image feature is first mapped to a single qubit membership state through repeated angle reuploading. Then a compact rule layer refines these amplitudes, and a clustered CNOT defuzzifier collapses them into one crisp value that is fused with classical features before classification. Evaluated on standard image benchmarks, HQFNN consistently surpasses classical, fuzzy enhanced and quantum only baselines while using several orders of magnitude fewer trainable weights, and its accuracy degrades only marginally under simulated depolarizing and amplitude damping noise, evidence of intrinsic robustness. Gate count analysis further shows that circuit depth grows sublinearly with input dimension, confirming the model's practicality for larger images. These results position the model as a compact, interpretable and noise tolerant alternative to conventional vision backbones and provide a template for future quantum native fuzzy learning frameworks.</description>

      <title>The Aharonov-Casher Phase: Considerations Regarding Force, Time-Dependence, and Berry Phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relation of the Aharonov-Casher (AC) effect and the force on a particle having a magnetic moment is explored. The general form of the AC Hamiltonian is derived using the Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation to the Dirac equation. Geometries in which an analytic expression for the phase can be obtained are examined, as well as the relation of the AC phase to the Berry phase. The AC phase is determined for an arbitrary homogeneous electric field; it is quadratic (linear) in the field strength for small (large) electric field strengths.</description>

      <title>Roughening Transition in Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore a roughening phase transition that occurs in the entanglement dynamics of certain quantum circuits. Viewing entanglement as the free energy of a membrane in a circuit-defined random environment, there is a competition between membrane smoothing due to lattice pinning and roughening due to disorder in the circuit. In particular, we investigate the randomness-induced roughening transition of the entanglement membrane in a (3+1)-dimensional Clifford circuit model, by calculating the entanglement entropy for various bipartitions. We further construct a scaling theory for membranes tilted away from lattice planes, uncovering new scaling forms and a crossover to a previously unexplored critical "tilted regime".</description>

      <title>Free Probability in a Minimal Quantum Circuit Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experimental and theoretical developments in many-body quantum systems motivate the study of their out-of-equilibrium properties through multi-time correlation functions. We consider the dynamics of higher-order out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs) in a minimal circuit model for quantum dynamics. This model mimics the dynamics of a structured subsystem locally coupled to a maximally random environment. We prove the exponential decay of all higher-order OTOCs and fully characterize the relevant time scales, showing how local operators approach free independence at late times. We show that the effects of the environment on the local subsystem can be captured in a higher-order influence matrix, which allows for a Markovian description of the dynamics provided an auxiliary degree of freedom is introduced. This degree of freedom directly yields a dynamical picture for the OTOCs in terms of free cumulants from free probability, consistent with recent predictions from the full eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH). This approach and the relevant influence matrix are expected to be applicable in more general settings and present a first step to characterizing quantum memory in higher-order OTOCs.</description>

      <title>Homogeneous Free-Standing Nanostructures from Bulk Diamond over Millimeter Scales for Quantum Technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum devices based on optically addressable spin qubits in diamond are promising platforms for quantum technologies such as quantum sensing and communication. Nano- and microstructuring of the diamond crystal is essential to enhance device performance, yet fabrication remains challenging and often involves trade-offs in surface quality, aspect ratio, device size, and uniformity. We tackle this hurdle with an approach producing millimeter-scale, thin (down to 70 nm) and highly parallel (&lt; 0.35 nm/$\mu$m}) membranes from single-crystal diamond. The membranes remain contamination-free and possess atomically smooth surfaces ($\mathrm{R_q}$ &lt; 200 pm) as required by state-of-the-art quantum applications. We demonstrate the benefits and versatility of our method by fabricating large fields of free-standing and homogeneous photonic nano- and microstructures. Leveraging a refined photolithography-based strategy, our method offers enhanced scalability and produces robust structures suitable for direct use, while remaining compatible with heterogeneous integration through pick-and-place transfer techniques.</description>

      <title>Many-Body Neural Network Wavefunction for a Non-Hermitian Ising Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian (NH) quantum systems have emerged as a powerful framework for describing open quantum systems, non-equilibrium dynamics, and engineered quantum optical materials. However, solving the ground-state properties of NH systems is challenging due to the exponential scaling of the Hilbert space, and exotic phenomena such as the emergence of exceptional points. Another challenge arises from the limitations of traditional methods like exact diagonalization (ED). For the past decade, neural networks (NN) have shown promise in approximating many-body wavefunctions, yet their application to NH systems remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we explore different NN architectures to investigate the ground-state properties of a parity-time-symmetric, one-dimensional NH, transverse field Ising model with a complex spectrum by employing a recurrent neural network (RNN), a restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM), and a multilayer perceptron (MLP). We construct the NN-based many-body wavefunctions and validate our approach by recovering the ground-state properties of the model for small system sizes, finding excellent agreement with ED. Furthermore, for larger system sizes, we demonstrate that the RNN outperforms both the RBM and MLP. However, we show that the accuracy of the RBM and MLP can be significantly improved through transfer learning, allowing them to perform comparably to the RNN for larger system sizes. These results highlight the potential of neural network-based approaches--particularly for accurately capturing the low-energy physics of NH quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Controlling quantum chaos via Parrondo strategies on NISQ hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advancements in Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computing are steadily pushing these systems toward outperforming classical supercomputers on specific, well-defined computational tasks. In this work, we explore and control quantum chaos in NISQ systems using discrete-time quantum walks (DTQW) on cyclic graphs. To efficiently implement quantum walks on NISQ hardware, we employ the quantum Fourier transform (QFT) to diagonalize the conditional shift operator, optimizing circuit depth and fidelity. We experimentally realize the transition from quantum chaos to order via DTQW dynamics on both odd and even cyclic graphs, specifically 3- and 4-cycle graphs, using the counterintuitive Parrondo's paradox strategy across three different NISQ devices. While the 4-cycle graphs exhibit high-fidelity quantum evolution, the 3-cycle implementation shows significant fidelity improvement when augmented with dynamical decoupling pulses. Our results demonstrate a practical approach to probing and harnessing controlled chaotic dynamics on real quantum hardware, laying the groundwork for future quantum algorithms and cryptographic protocols based on quantum walks.</description>

      <title>Configuration design of multimode Gaussian operations on continuous-variable quad-rail lattice cluster states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous-variable quad-rail lattice cluster states enable flexible quantum circuit design on their two-dimensional structure. However, how to combine basic operations on the quad-rail lattice cluster state to realize multimode operations has not been deeply discussed. Here we show a concrete configuration design to efficiently implement beamsplitter network operations on the cluster state. Furthermore, combining the beamsplitter networks, a configuration design of multimode Gaussian unitary operations is also shown. It is theoretically known that the Gaussian operations are sufficient for universal quantum computation if appropriate non-Gaussian states are injected. Our results are fundamentally important for utilizing the flexible quad-rail lattice cluster states for computations.</description>

      <title>Acquisition of Delocalized Information via Classical and Quantum Carriers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the information-theoretic power of spatial superposition by analyzing tasks in which information is locally encoded at multiple distant sites and must be acquired by a single information carrier, such as a particle. Within an operational framework, we systematically compare the statistical correlations that can be generated in such tasks using classical particles, quantum particles in spatial superposition, and hypothetical "second-order interference" resources. We bound classical strategies via convex polytopes and present a study of their symmetry, demonstrating that the vertices are inherently connected to K-juntas as defined in the classical theory of Boolean functions, while their facet inequalities are in one-to-one correspondence with oracle games. We then analyze the violation of the "fingerprinting inequality" achievable by the use of one quantum particle, and we study the dependence of this violation on the dimension of the particle's internal degrees of freedom. Interestingly, we find that both quantum and any other (generalized) second-order interference models exhibit the same asymptotic scaling in violating the fingerprinting inequality. Our results thereby further articulate quantum interference and spatial superposition as a resource for information processing.</description>

      <title>Kilometer-Scale Ion-Photon Entanglement with a Metastable $^{88}$Sr$^{+}$ Qubit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate entanglement between the polarization of an infrared photon and a metastable $^{88}$Sr$^+$ ion qubit. This entanglement persists after transmitting the photon over a $2.8\:$km long commercial fiber deployed in an urban environment. Tomography of the ion-photon entangled state yields a fidelity of $0.949(4)$ within the laboratory and $0.929(5)$ after fiber transmission, not corrected for readout errors. Our results establish the Strontium ion as a promising candidate for metropolitan-scale quantum networking based on an atomic transition at $1092\:$nm, a wavelength compatible with existing telecom fiber infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Drift-resilient mid-circuit measurement error mitigation for dynamic circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Error mitigation (QEM) for dynamic circuits, i.e. those incorporating mid-circuit measurement and feedforward, is important for two key reasons. First, quantum error correction (QEC) circuit are instances of dynamic circuits, and therefore a compatible QEM can extend circuit depth and address errors that QEC struggles with. Second, recent studies show dynamic circuits can significantly outperform purely unitary ones. However, mid-circuit measurement errors remain a major bottleneck. Current solutions rely on readout noise characterization, which is vulnerable to temporal noise drifts. We propose a drift-resilient protocol for addressing preparation, mid-circuit, and terminating measurement errors without requiring calibration or characterization. One scheme uses parity checks of repeated measurements (suitable for superconducting qubits), while the other leverages reset and feedforward (suitable for trapped ions). We demonstrate our methods experimentally on IBMQ and Quantinuum hardware. Combined with the Layered-KIK gate error mitigation protocol, this readout mitigation approach enables 'End-to-end' mitigation for dynamic circuits, which can improve the outcomes of QEC experiments. Other applications of the presented methods include a faster alternative to gate-set tomography and diagnostics of defective qubits during the execution of the target algorithm.</description>

      <title>Inferring Quantum Network Topologies using Genetic Optimisation of Indirect Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The characterisation of quantum networks is fundamental to understanding how energy and information propagates through complex systems, with applications in control, communication, error mitigation and energy transfer. In this work, we explore the use of external probes to infer the network topology in the context of continuous-time quantum walks, where a single excitation traverses the network with a pattern strongly influenced by its topology. The probes act as decay channels for the excitation, and can be interpreted as performing an indirect measurement on the network dynamics. By making use of a Genetic Optimisation algorithm, we demonstrate that the data collected by the probes can be used to successfully reconstruct the topology of any quantum network with high success rates, where performance is limited only by computational resources for large network sizes. Moreover, we show that increasing the number of probes significantly simplifies the reconstruction task, revealing a tradeoff between the number of probes and the required computational power.</description>

      <title>Quantum Fisher information from tensor network integration of Lyapunov equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) is a geometric measure of state deformation calculated along the trajectory parameterizing an ensemble of quantum states. It serves as a key concept in quantum metrology, where it is linked to the fundamental limit on the precision of the parameter that we estimate. However, the QFI is notoriously difficult to calculate due to its non-linear mathematical form. For mixed states, standard numerical procedures based on eigendecomposition quickly become impractical with increasing system size. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel numerical approach based on Lyapunov integrals that combines the concept of symmetric logarithmic derivative and tensor networks. Importantly, this approach requires only the elementary matrix product states algorithm for time-evolution, opening a perspective for broad usage and application to many-body systems. We discuss the advantages and limitations of our methodology through an illustrative example in quantum metrology, where the thermal state of the transverse-field Ising model is used to measure magnetic field amplitude.</description>

      <title>Witnessing PPT entanglement via rank analysis of (sub)matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a new method for entanglement detection in bipartite quantum states, using the violation of the rank-1 generated property of matrices. The positive-semidefinite matrices form a convex cone that has extremal elements of only rank-1. But convex conic subsets resulting from presence of linear constraints allow extremal elements of rank &gt; 1. The problem of deciding when a matrix is rank-1 generated, i.e a sum of rank-1 PSD matrices, has been studied extensively in optimization theory. This rank-1 generated property acts as an entanglement criterion, and we use this property to find novel classes of PPT entangled states. We do this by extracting a matrix from the density matrix, and show that for all separable states, this matrix satisfies the rank-1 generated property. In general, the same is not true for the corresponding matrices of PPT entangled states. We also extend this approach to construct PPT entangled edge states. Finally, we provide different methods that detect the violation of rank-1 generated property.</description>

      <title>Few Single-Qubit Measurements Suffice to Certify Any Quantum State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fundamental task in quantum information science is \emph{state certification}: testing whether a lab-prepared $n$-qubit state is close to a given hypothesis state. In this work, we show that \emph{every} pure hypothesis state can be certified using only $O(n^2)$ single-qubit measurements applied to $O(n)$ copies of the lab state. Prior to our work, it was not known whether even sub-exponentially many single-qubit measurements could suffice to certify arbitrary states. This resolves the main open question of Huang, Preskill, and Soleimanifar (FOCS 2024, QIP 2024).</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theoretical study of fast all-to-all entangling gates in trapped-ion quantum processors, based on impulsive excitation of spin-dependent motion with broadband laser pulses. Previous studies have shown that such fast gate schemes are highly scalable and naturally performant outside the Lamb-Dicke regime, however are limited to nearest-neighbour operations. Here we demonstrate that impulsive spin-dependent excitation can be used to perform high-fidelity non-local entangling operations in quasi-uniform chains of up to 40 ions. We identify a regime of phonon-mediated entanglement between arbitrary pairs of ions in the chain, where any two pairs of ions in the chain can be entangled in approximately 1.3-2 centre-of-mass oscillation periods. We assess the experimental feasibility of the proposed gate schemes, which reveals pulse error requirements that are weakly dependent on the length of the ion chain and the distance between the target qubits. These results suggest entangling gates based on impulsive spin-dependent excitation presents new possibilities for large-scale computation in near-term ion-trap devices.</description>

      <title>Quantum Entanglement with Geometric Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantifying quantum entanglement is a pivotal challenge in quantum information science, particularly for high-dimensional systems, due to its computational complexity. This thesis extends the geometric measure of entanglement (GME) to introduce and investigate a suite of GME-based entanglement monotones tailored for diverse quantum contexts, including pure states, subspaces, and mixed states. These monotones are applicable to both bipartite and multipartite systems, offering a unified framework for characterizing entanglement across various scenarios. Notably, the proposed monotones are adept at identifying entanglement with varying entanglement dimensionalities, making them particularly effective for detecting high-dimensional entanglement. To support practical computation, we develop a non-convex optimization framework that yields accurate upper bounds, complemented by semidefinite programming techniques to establish robust lower bounds. Together, these approaches provide a consistent and efficient computational methodology. This work advances both the theoretical understanding and algorithmic tools for entanglement quantification, contributing to the study of complex quantum correlations in entangled systems.</description>

      <title>Fidelity of entanglement and quantum entropies: unveiling their relationship in quantum states and channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement serves as a fundamental resource for various quantum information processing tasks. Fidelity of entanglement (which measures the proximity to a maximally entangled state) and various quantum entropies are key indicators for certifying entanglement in a quantum state. Quantum states with high fidelity are particularly useful for numerous information-theoretic applications. Similarly, states possessing negative conditional entropy provide significant advantages in several quantum information processing protocols. In this work, we examine the relationship between these two indicators of entanglement, both in state and channel regimes. First, we present a comprehensive analysis and characterization of channels that reduce fidelity of entanglement beyond a threshold limit of bipartite composite systems. In this context, we introduce the notion of fidelity annihilating channel and discuss its topological characterization, along with various information-theoretic properties. We then provide a comparison between channels that diminish the fidelity of entanglement and negative conditional entropies. Extending our analysis from channels to the state level, we further examine the relationship between the fidelity of entanglement and various quantum entropies for general two-qubit states. We derive the upper bound on R\'enyi 2-entropy, conditional R\'enyi 2-entropy, Tsallis 2-entropy, and conditional Tsallis 2-entropy, in terms of the fidelity of entanglement. Finally, we explore the relationship between relative entropy and the fidelity of entanglement of a two qudit quantum state.</description>

      <title>Completeness Stability of Quantum Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a resource monotone, the completeness stability, to quantify the quality of quantum measurements within a resource-theoretic framework. By viewing a quantum measurement as a frame, the minimum eigenvalue of a frame operator emerges as a significant monotone. It captures bounds on estimation errors and the numerical stability of inverting the frame operator to calculate the optimal dual for state reconstruction. Maximizing this monotone identifies a well-characterized class of quantum measurements forming weighted complex projective 2-designs, which includes well-known examples such as SIC-POVMs. Our results provide a principled framework for comparing and optimizing quantum measurements for practical applications.</description>

      <title>Learning Encodings by Maximizing State Distinguishability: Variational Quantum Error Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum error correction is crucial for protecting quantum information against decoherence. Traditional codes like the surface code require substantial overhead, making them impractical for near-term, early fault-tolerant devices. We propose a novel objective function for tailoring error correction codes to specific noise structures by maximizing the distinguishability between quantum states after a noise channel, ensuring efficient recovery operations. We formalize this concept with the distinguishability loss function, serving as a machine learning objective to discover resource-efficient encoding circuits optimized for given noise characteristics. We implement this methodology using variational techniques, termed variational quantum error correction (VarQEC). Our approach yields codes with desirable theoretical and practical properties and outperforms standard codes in various scenarios. We also provide proof-of-concept demonstrations on IBM and IQM hardware devices, highlighting the practical relevance of our procedure.</description>

      <title>Quantum Circuits for the Metropolis-Hastings Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Szegedy's quantization of a reversible Markov chain provides a quantum walk whose mixing time is quadratically smaller than that of the classical walk. Quantum computers are therefore expected to provide a speedup of Metropolis-Hastings (MH) simulations. Existing generic methods to implement the quantum walk require coherently computing the acceptance probabilities of the underlying Markov kernel. However, reversible computing methods require a number of qubits that scales with the complexity of the computation. This overhead is undesirable in near-term fault-tolerant quantum computing, where few logical qubits are available. In this work, we present a quantum walk construction which follows the classical proposal-acceptance logic, does not require further reversible computing methods, and uses a constant-sized ancilla register. Since each step of the quantum walk uses a constant number of proposition and acceptance steps, we expect the end-to-end quadratic speedup to hold for MH simulations.</description>

      <title>Local and global approaches to the thermodynamics of pure decoherence processes in open quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the nonequilibrium thermodynamics of pure decoherence processes in open quantum systems coupled to a thermal reservoir. We review various definitions of central quantities, such as internal energy, work, heat and entropy production, developed within local and global approaches to quantum thermodynamics. Within local approaches thermodynamic quantities only refer to the open system's degrees of freedom, while in the global approaches certain quantities are defined by referring explicitly to the reservoir degrees of freedom. Employing a microscopic, analytically solvable model, we perform a comparison of these two perspectives, revealing substantial differences in the thermodynamic quantities and in the formulations of the first and second law. The main reason for these discrepancies is the fact that the global approaches involve the system-reservoir interaction which exchanges a large amount of energy with the environment, while the average open system energy is constant in time because the dynamics represents pure decoherence and does not affect the open system populations.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the application of the Jordanian quantum algebra $\mathcal{U}_h (\mathfrak{sl}(2, \mathbb{R}))$, as a Hopf algebra deformation of the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{sl}(2, \mathbb{R})$, in the context of entanglement properties of quantum states. For them, several kind of entanglement measures and fidelities are obtained, parametrized by the deformation parameter $h$. In particular, we construct the associated $h$-deformed Dicke states on $\mathfrak{sl}(2, \mathbb{R})$, comparing them to the $q$-Dicke states obtained from the quantum deformation of the $\mathcal U_q (\mathfrak{sl}(2, \mathbb{R}))$. Moreover, the density matrices of these $h$-deformed Dicke states are compared to the experimental realizations of those of Dicke states. A similar behavior is observed, pointing out that the $h$-deformation could be used to describe noise and decoherence effects in experimental settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present two tensor network quantum-inspired algorithms to solve the knapsack and the shortest path problems, and enables to solve some of its variations. These methods provide an exact equation which returns the optimal solution of the problems. As in other tensor network algorithms for combinatorial optimization problems, the method is based on imaginary time evolution and the implementation of restrictions in the tensor network. In addition, we introduce the use of symmetries and the reutilization of intermediate calculations, reducing the computational complexity for both problems. To show the efficiency of our implementations, we carry out some performance experiments and compare the results with those obtained by other classical algorithms.</description>

      <title>Physics-inspired neural networks as quasi inverse of quantum channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum channels are not invertible in general. A quasi-inverse allows for a partial recovery of the input state, but its analytical results are found only in a restricted space of its parameters. This work explores the potential of neural networks to find the quasi-inverse of qubit channels for any values of the channel parameters while keeping the quasi-inverse as a physically realizable quantum operation. We introduce a physics-inspired loss function based on the mean of the square of the modified trace distance (MSMTD). The scaled trace distance is used so that the neural network does not increase the length of the Bloch vector of the quantum states, which ensures that the network behaves as a completely positive and trace-preserving (CPTP) quantum channel. The Kraus operators of the quasi-inverse channel were obtained by performing quantum process tomography on the trained neural network.</description>

      <title>Extremal Magic States from Symmetric Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magic, a key quantum resource beyond entanglement, remains poorly understood in terms of its structure and classification. In this paper, we demonstrate a striking connection between high-dimensional symmetric lattices and quantum magic states. By mapping vectors from the $E_8$, $BW_{16}$, and $E_6$ lattices into Hilbert space, we construct and classify stabiliser and maximal magic states for two-qubit, three-qubit and one-qutrit systems. In particular, this geometric approach allows us to construct, for the first time, closed-form expressions for the maximal magic states in the three-qubit and one-qutrit systems, and to conjecture their total counts. In the three-qubit case, we further classify the extremal magic states according to their entanglement structure. We also examine the distinctive behaviour of one-qutrit maximal magic states with respect to Clifford orbits. Our findings suggest that deep algebraic and geometric symmetries underlie the structure of extremal magic states.</description>

      <title>Quantum Resource Complementarity in Finite-Dimensional Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum resources such as entanglement, information redundancy, and coherence enable revolutionary advantages but obey fundamental tradeoffs. We present a unified geometric constraint governing three core operational tasks: teleportation ($q_1$), cloning ($q_2$), and coherence-based metrology ($q_3$). For any tripartite quantum state $\rho_{ABC}$, we show the tight inequality $q_1^2 + q_2^2 + q_3^2 \leq 1$ confines all physically achievable resources to the positive octant of the unit ball. This Quantum Information Resource Constraint (QIRC) reflects an exclusion principle intrinsic to Hilbert space: optimizing one task necessitates sacrificing others. Crucially, $q_1, q_2, q_3$ are experimentally measurable, making QIRC falsifiable in quantum platforms. Unlike abstract quantum resource theories (QRT) that quantify resources through entropy or monotones, our framework is fundamentally operational, deriving tight constraints from measurable task fidelities in teleportation, cloning, and metrology. The emergent \(\ell^2\)-norm exclusion is irreducible to existing QRT axioms. Remarkably, we demonstrate the resource norm $\mathcal{I} = q_1^2 + q_2^2 + q_3^2$ is conserved under symmetry-preserving unitaries (quantum resource covariance principle) but contracts irreversibly under decoherence. This work establishes a fundamental link between quantum information geometry, symmetry, and thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Suppressing excitations in the nonlinear Landau-Zener model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many complex quantum systems can be described by effectively nonlinear dynamics. While such dynamics have many appealing characteristics, they also make the analysis significantly more involved. This is due to the fact that only a few analytical treatments exist, and that the language of quantum mechanics is built for linear operators. For instance, the very formulation of the quantum adiabatic theorem requires the underlying dynamics to be linear. In this work we show that in a generalized Landau-Zener model, nonlinear dynamics can be leveraged to suppress excitations and coherences of the corresponding linear scenario. To this end, we introduce a generalized "energy spectrum", which is defined by the expectation values of the energy under the stationary states. As a main result, we show that the nonlinear term in the evolution equation acts like an effective shortcut to adiabaticity for the linear Landau-Zener problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While particles cannot travel faster than the speed of light, nor can information, this assumption has over the years been frequently questioned. Most recently, it has been argued [New J. Phys. 22, 033038 (2020)] that in a world with superluminal observers local determinism is impossible, linking the two pillars of physics-quantum theory and relativity-suggesting that the latter serves as the foundation for the former. Motivated by this approach, in this work, we extend the framework of quantum reference frames to incorporate superluminal Lorentz transformations. We apply this conceptual result to examine an apparent paradox where particles acquire negative energies after undergoing a superluminal Lorentz boost and propose a resolution within our framework. We also discuss Bell experiments under superluminal quantum reference frame transformations, showing that involved probabilities remain conserved.</description>

      <title>Gauge-invariant Wigner equation for electromagnetic fields: Strong and weak formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gauge-invariant Wigner theory describes the quantum-mechanical evolution of charged particles in the presence of an electromagnetic field in phase space, which is spanned by position and kinetic momentum. This approach is independent of the chosen potentials, as it depends only on the electric and magnetic field variables. Several approaches to derive a gauge-invariant Wigner evolution equation have been reported, which are generally complex. This work presents a new formulation for a single electron in a general electromagnetic field based solely on differential operators that simplify existing formulations. A gauge-dependent equation is derived first using Moyal's equation. A transformation of the Wigner function, introduced by Stratonovich, is then used to make the equation gauge-invariant, which gives us a strong formulation of the problem. This equation can be transformed into its weak form, which proves that both formulations are equivalent. An analysis of the different properties of the gauge-dependent and gauge-invariant formulations is given, as well as the different requirements for the regularity and asymptotic behavior of the strong and weak formulations.</description>

      <title>Exact requirements for battery-assisted qubit gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the implementation of a unitary gate on a qubit system S via a global energy-preserving operation acting on S and an auxiliary system B that can be seen as a battery. We derive a simple, asymptotically exact expression for the implementation error as a function of the battery state, which we refer to as the it Unitary Defect. Remarkably, this quantity is independent of the specific gate being implemented, highlighting a universal property of the battery itself. We show that minimizing the unitary defect, under given physical constraints on the battery state, is mathematically equivalent to solving a Lagrangian optimization problem, often corresponding to finding the ground state of a one-dimensional quantum system. Using this mapping, we identify optimal battery states that achieve the highest precision under constraints on energy, squared energy, and Quantum Fisher Information. Overall, our results provide an efficient method for establishing bounds on the physical requirements needed to implement a unitary gate via energy-preserving operations and for determining the corresponding optimal protocols.</description>

      <title>Fast and High Excitation Transport in Waveguide Quantum Electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Waveguide quantum electrodynamics (wQED) with underlying collective and long-range atom-atom interactions has led to many distinct dynamical phenomena, including modified collective radiations and intriguing quantum correlations. It stands out as a unique platform to illustrate correlated photon transport, as well as to promise applications in quantum information processing. Here we manifest a fast and high atomic excitation transport by employing two well-separated chirally-coupled atomic arrays. This enhanced waveguide-mediated transport of excitations emerges due to the dominance of spectrally isolated and right-localized right eigenstates in the system's dynamics. Contrary to the instinct of applying the cascaded systems with unidirectional couplings to expedite direct and high excitation transport, the optimal system configurations in open wQED systems demand slight or finite nonreciprocal decay channels to facilitate energy transport by exploiting waveguide-mediated couplings. We also investigate the effect of the couplings' directionality and the scaling of atom number on the transport properties. Our results showcase the wide applicability in wQED platforms and provide insights to quantum engineering and quantum information applications.</description>

      <title>Measurement-based quantum computation with variable-range interacting systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that weighted graph states (WGS) generated via variable-range interacting Ising spin systems where the interaction strength decays with distance as a power law, characterized by the fall-off rate, can successfully implement single- and two-qubit gates with fidelity exceeding classical limits by performing suitable measurements. In the regime of truly long-range interactions (small fall-off rate), optimizing over local unitary operations, while retaining the local measurement scheme in the original measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC) set-up, enables the scheme to achieve nonclassical average fidelities. Specifically, we identify a threshold fall-off rate of the interaction above which the fidelity of both universal single- and two-qubit gates consistently exceeds $90\%$ accuracy. Moreover, we exhibit that the gate-implementation protocol remains robust under two realistic imperfections -- noise in the measurement process, modeled via unsharp measurements, and disorder in the interaction strengths. These findings confirm WGS produced through long-range systems as a resilient and effective resource for MBQC.</description>

      <title>Nanoscale Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Control of a Strongly Interacting Dipolar System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a fundamental tool for physical and life sciences, yet its spatial resolution is typically limited to macroscopic scales. Here, we demonstrate nanoscale MRI by combining strong, time-dependent local magnetic field gradients with coherent control of a dense ensemble of electron spins hosted in atom-like defects in diamond. Using this platform, we generate and manipulate nanoscale spin textures - spatially structured patterns of spin orientation - and track their evolution under engineered many-body interactions. Controlling the dipolar spin exchange driving the dynamics, we observe striking signatures of sensitivity to the microscopic details underlying the polarization distribution. Our results open the door for robust control of metrologically useful entanglement, and nanoscale imaging of materials and biological systems under ambient conditions.</description>

      <title>Hilbert subspace imprint: a new mechanism for non-thermalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The search for non-ergodic mechanisms in quantum many-body systems has become a frontier area of research in non-equilibrium physics. In this Letter, we introduce Hilbert subspace imprint (HSI)-a novel mechanism that enables evasion of thermalization and bridges the gap between quantum many-body scars (QMBS) and Hilbert space fragmentation (HSF). HSI manifests when initial states overlap exclusively with a polynomial scaling (with system size) set of eigenstates. We demonstrate this phenomenon through two distinct approaches: weak symmetry breaking and initial state engineering. In the former case, we observe that ferromagnetic states including those with a single spin-flip display non-thermal behavior under weak U(1) breaking, while antiferromagnetic states thermalize. In contrast, the Z2-symmetric model shows thermalization for both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic states. In the latter case, we engineer the initial state prepared by shallow quantum circuits that enhance the overlap with the small target subspace. Our results establish HSI as a mechanism equally fundamental to non-thermalization as QMBS and HSF.</description>

      <title>Bandwidth enhanced current noise suppression with a SERF magnetometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the behavior of a spin-exchange relaxation-free (SERF) magnetometer integrated into the feedback branch of a closed-loop control circuit, designed to actively suppress noise from a current source. In this configuration, the magnetometer bandwidth is enhanced by almost two orders of magnitude as compared to the open-loop setup. Incorporating an injection transformer, the proposed system effectively reduces current noise to below 3 nA/sqrt(Hz) over a broad frequency bandwidth, independent of DC-current offsets. Analysis of the system sensitivity reveals that the performance is currently limited by technical noise. If this were to be eliminated, the system would achieve a current sensing sensitivity on the order of few pA/sqrt(Hz), while maintaining perfect galvanic isolation from the target circuit.</description>

      <title>Universal cooling of quantum systems via randomized measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is generally believed that the design of cooling protocols requires knowledge of the system's spectrum. In contrast, cooling processes in nature occur whenever the system is coupled to a cold bath. But how does nature know how to cool quantum systems? Here we address this question by mimicking a natural cold bath with a reservoir of "meter" qubits that are initialized in their ground state and interact with the system sequentially for a specified time before being discarded. This protocol is equivalent to quantum measurements without keeping the measurement readouts. We show that a quantum system can be cooled without prior knowledge of the system's details when the interactions between the system and the meters, as well as the level splittings of the meters, are chosen randomly. For sufficiently small interaction strengths and long interaction times, the rotating-wave approximation becomes valid, ensuring that resonant energy-exchange processes, which lead to cooling, dominate over heating. This demonstrates that robust and scalable cooling of complex quantum systems can be achieved through generic, structure-independent protocols. Our findings thus offer a versatile universal framework for engineering, controlling, and manipulating quantum matter far from equilibrium, in particular, for the purposes of quantum information processing and quantum simulations.</description>

      <title>Interpretable representation learning of quantum data enabled by probabilistic variational autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interpretable machine learning is rapidly becoming a crucial tool for scientific discovery. Among existing approaches, variational autoencoders (VAEs) have shown promise in extracting the hidden physical features of some input data, with no supervision nor prior knowledge of the system at study. Yet, the ability of VAEs to create meaningful, interpretable representations relies on their accurate approximation of the underlying probability distribution of their input. When dealing with quantum data, VAEs must hence account for its intrinsic randomness and complex correlations. While VAEs have been previously applied to quantum data, they have often neglected its probabilistic nature, hindering the extraction of meaningful physical descriptors. Here, we demonstrate that two key modifications enable VAEs to learn physically meaningful latent representations: a decoder capable of faithfully reproduce quantum states and a probabilistic loss tailored to this task. Using benchmark quantum spin models, we identify regimes where standard methods fail while the representations learned by our approach remain meaningful and interpretable. Applied to experimental data from Rydberg atom arrays, the model autonomously uncovers the phase structure without access to prior labels, Hamiltonian details, or knowledge of relevant order parameters, highlighting its potential as an unsupervised and interpretable tool for the study of quantum systems.</description>

      <title>A Random Matrix Theory of Pauli Tomography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum state tomography (QST), the process of reconstructing some unknown quantum state $\hat\rho$ from repeated measurements on copies of said state, is a foundationally important task in the context of quantum computation and simulation. For this reason, a detailed characterization of the error $\Delta\hat\rho = \hat\rho-\hat\rho^\prime$ in a QST reconstruction $\hat\rho^\prime$ is of clear importance to quantum theory and experiment. In this work, we develop a fully random matrix theory (RMT) treatment of state tomography in informationally-complete bases; and in doing so we reveal deep connections between QST errors $\Delta\hat\rho$ and the gaussian unitary ensemble (GUE). By exploiting this connection we prove that wide classes of functions of the spectrum of $\Delta\hat\rho$ can be evaluated by substituting samples of an appropriate GUE for realizations of $\Delta\hat\rho$. This powerful and flexible result enables simple analytic treatments of the mean value and variance of the error as quantified by the trace distance $\|\Delta\hat\rho\|_\mathrm{Tr}$ (which we validate numerically for common tomographic protocols), allows us to derive a bound on the QST sample complexity, and subsequently demonstrate that said bound doesn't change under the most widely-used rephysicalization procedure. These results collectively demonstrate the flexibility, strength, and broad applicability of our approach; and lays the foundation for broader studies of RMT treatments of QST in the future.</description>

      <title>The metric from energy-momentum non-conservation: Generalizing Noether and completing spectral geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We complete the program of spectral geometry, in the sense that we show that a manifold's shape, i.e., its metric, can be reconstructed from its resonant sound when tapped lightly, i.e., from its spectrum, -- if in addition we also record the resonances' mutual excitation pattern when the driving is strong enough to reach the nonlinear regime. Applied to spacetime, this finding yields a generalization of Noether's theorem: the specific pattern of energy-momentum non-conservation on a generic curved spacetime, encoded within the quantum field theoretic scattering matrices, is sufficient to calculate the metric. Applied to quantum gravity, this shows that the conventional dichotomy of spacetime versus matter can emerge from an underlying information-theoretic framework of only one type of quantity: abstract correlators, $G^{(n)}$, that are, a priori, merely operators on $n$ tensor factors of a Hilbert space. This is because, on one hand, if abstract higher-order correlators $G^{(n&gt;2)}$ can be diagonalized, these correlators can be represented as local quantum field theoretic vertices on a curved spacetime whose metric $g_{\mu\nu}(x)$ can be explicitly calculated. On the other hand, at sufficiently high energies, such as the Planck scale, the $G^{(n)}$ may not be even approximately representable as correlators of a local QFT on a spacetime, indicating a regime that is mathematically controlled but transcends the concepts of spacetime and matter.</description>

      <title>The Integral Decimation Method for Quantum Dynamics and Statistical Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a method to numerically evaluate functional integrals called integral decimation (ID). It constructs a separable decomposition of the integrand as a spectral tensor train (STT), a continuous generalization of the matrix product state. ID builds the STT by mapping the integrand to an auxiliary many-body wavefunction that evolves in time from an initially unentangled state. Each body-ordered term of the action corresponds to a quantum gate, applied to the state during its evolution. The gates generate entanglement, and decimation during the gate sequence compresses the integral, alleviating memory bottlenecks in high dimensional integration. In the application of ID to moment-generating and partition functions, the continuous nature of the STTs allows for analytical differentiation of the result. To demonstrate its versatility, we employ ID to calculate the partition function of a classical XY model and to solve a non-Markovian quantum relaxation problem. By circumventing the barren plateau problem that limited our earlier STT-based approaches to quantum relaxation [J. Chem. Phys. 161, 234111 (2024)], ID enables high-accuracy simulations of quantum dynamics in systems as large as a 40-site chain.</description>

Abstract: Retrieving the phase of a complex-valued field from the measurements of its amplitude is a crucial problem with a wide range of applications in microscopy and ultracold atomic physics. In particular, obtaining an accurate and efficient solution to this problem is a key step in shaping laser beams for trapping atoms in optical tweezer arrays and applying high-fidelity entangling gates on a neutral atom quantum computer. Current approaches to this problem fail to converge on the optimal solution due to a phenomenon known as vortex formation. In this work, we present an efficient optimization algorithm using Optimal Transport. Our approach completely bypasses the creation of phase vortices and allows for a state-of-the-art solution both in terms of accuracy and efficiency. Furthermore, we show a deep theoretical connection between the Optimal Transport plan and the ray-optics limit of the Wigner distribution of the unknown complex-valued field, and show that our method can be used to retrieve the phase-space transformation of any unknown quadratic phase system. Finally, we reinterpret this problem in the modern quantum learning framework. The techniques we develop provide both useful intuition and practical tools for advancing the frontiers of phase retrieval and laser beam shaping.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two harmonic oscillators interacting through the exchange of a quantum field leads to non-zero entanglement between the two, which is absent for classical interaction. In this work, we determine the entanglement between two such harmonic oscillators living in an expanding universe. It turns out that, if the oscillators are within the Hubble horizon, with their frequencies are comparable to the rate of expansion of the universe, the entanglement is non-zero and significant. While, for oscillators outside the Hubble horizon, with oscillation frequencies much higher than the expansion rate, the entanglement is negligibly small.</description>

      <title>The Darkfield Approach to Measuring Vacuum Birefringence and Light-by-Light Couplings -- A Proof-of-Principle Experiment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vacuum fluctuations give rise to effective nonlinear interactions between electromagnetic fields. These generically modify the characteristics of light traversing a strong-field region. X-ray free-electron lasers constitute a particularly promising probe, due to their brilliance, the possibility of precise control and favourable frequency scaling. However, the nonlinear vacuum response is very small even when probing a tightly focused high-intensity laser field with XFEL radiation and direct measurement of light-by-light scattering of real photons and the associated fundamental physics constants of the quantum vacuum has not been possible to date. Achieving a sufficiently good signal-to-background separation is key to a successful quantum vacuum experiment. To master this challenge, a darkfield detection concept has recently been proposed. Here we present the results of a proof-of-principle experiment validating this approach at the High Energy Density scientific instrument of the European X-Ray Free Electron Laser.</description>

Abstract: Quantum-chaotic systems exhibit several universal properties, ranging from level repulsion in the energy spectrum to wavefunction delocalization. On the other hand, if wavefunctions are localized, the levels exhibit no level repulsion and their statistics is Poisson. At the boundary between quantum chaos and localization, however, one observes critical behavior, not complying with any of those characteristics. An outstanding open question is whether there exist yet another type of universality, which is genuine for the critical point. Previous work suggested that there may exist a relation between the global characteristics of energy spectrum, such as spectral compressibility $\chi$, and the degree of wavefunction delocalization, expressed via the fractal dimension $D_1$ of the Shannon--von Neumann entropy in a preferred (e.g., real-space) basis. Here we study physical systems subject to local and non-local hopping, both with and without time-reversal symmetry, with the Anderson models in dimensions three to five being representatives of the first class, and the banded random matrices as representatives of the second class. Our thorough numerical analysis supports validity of the simple relation $\chi + D_1 = 1$ in all systems under investigation. Hence we conjecture that it represents a universal property of a broad class of critical models. Moreover, we test and confirm the accuracy of our surmise for a closed-form expression of the spectral compressibility in the one-parameter critical manifold of random banded matrices. Based on these findings we derive a universal function $D_{1}(r)$, where $r$ is the averaged level spacing ratio, which is valid for a broad class of critical systems.</description>

      <title>Topological Signatures of Magnetic Phase Transitions with Majorana Fermions through Local Observables and Quantum Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The one-dimensional (1D) $J_1-J_2$ quantum spin model can be viewed as a strong-coupling analogue of the Schrieffer-Su-Heeger model with two inequivalent alternating Ising couplings along the wire, associated to the physics of resonating valence bonds. Similar to the quantum Ising model, which differently presents a long-range Neel ordered phase, this model also maps onto a p-wave superconducting wire which shows a topological phase transition with the emergence of low-energy Majorana fermions. We show how signatures of the topological phase transition for the p-wave superconducting wire, i.e. a half Skyrmion, are revealed through local (short-range) spin observables and their derivatives related to the capacitance of the pairing fermion model. Then, we present an edge correspondence through the edge spin susceptibility in the $J_1-J_2$ model revealing that the topological phase transition is a metal of Majorana fermions. We justify that the spin magnetization at an edge at very small transverse magnetic field is a good marker of the topological invariant. We identify a correspondence between the quantum information of resonating valence bonds and the charge fluctuations in a p-wave superconductor through our method ``the bipartite fluctuations''. This $J_1-J_2$ system may be realized in materials and engineered in quantum circuits, optical lattices.</description>

      <title>Continuously trapped matter-wave interferometry in magic Floquet-Bloch band structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trapped matter-wave interferometry offers the promise of compact high-precision local force sensing. However, the trap itself can introduce new systematic errors which are absent in traditional free-fall interferometers. We describe and demonstrate a novel Floquet-engineered platform for compact, continuously trapped atom interferometry which is intrinsically robust against trap noise and beamsplitter pulse duration. A non-interacting degenerate quantum gas undergoes position-space Bloch oscillations through an amplitude-modulated optical lattice, whose resulting Floquet-Bloch band structure includes Landau-Zener beamsplitters and Bragg mirrors, forming the components of a Mach-Zehnder interferometric force sensor. We identify, realize, and experimentally characterize magic band structures, analogous to the magic wavelengths employed in optical lattice clocks, for which the interferometric phase is insensitive to lattice intensity noise. We leverage the intrinsic programmability of the Floquet synthesis approach to demonstrate a variety of interferometer structures, highlighting the potential of this technique for quantum force sensors which are tunable, compact, simple, and robust.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a fiber-ring resonator that realizes an ultra-narrowband, high-extinction, low-loss, tunable optical filter. It consists of a pair of commercial variable ratio directional couplers that allow precise adjustment of the filter bandwidth and its on-resonance transmission. This design also grants access to multiple modes of operation, such as a simultaneous band-stop and band-pass filter. Our characterization reveals a bandwidth of less than 2 MHz, together with an extinction exceeding 20 dB. The tunability of the filter properties establishes our device as a versatile platform for selective frequency filtering with sub-natural atomic linewidth resolution.</description>

Abstract: Quantum k-SAT (the problem of determining whether a k-local Hamiltonian is frustration-free) is known to be QMA_1-complete for k &gt;= 3, and hence likely hard for quantum computers to solve. Building on a classical result of Alon and Shapira, we show that quantum k-SAT can be solved in randomised polynomial time given the `property testing' promise that the instance is either satisfiable (by any state) or far from satisfiable by a product state; by `far from satisfiable by a product state' we mean that \epsilon n^k constraints must be removed before a product state solution exists, for some fixed \epsilon &gt; 0. The proof has two steps: we first show that for a satisfiable instance of quantum k-SAT, most subproblems on a constant number of qubits are satisfiable by a product state. We then show that for an instance of quantum k-SAT which is far from satisfiable by a product state, most subproblems are unsatisfiable by a product state. Given the promise, quantum k-SAT may therefore be solved by checking satisfiability by a product state on randomly chosen subsystems of constant size.</description>

Abstract: Verifying entanglement between parties is essential for creating secure quantum communication. However, finite statistics can lead to false positive outcomes in any tests for entanglement. Here, we introduce a one-sided device-independent protocol that corrects for apparent signaling effects in experimental probability distributions, caused by statistical fluctuations and experimental imperfections. We use semidefinite programming to identify the optimal inequality, for our experimental probability distribution, without resource-intensive tomography. Our protocol is numerically and experimentally analysed in the context of random, misaligned measurements, correcting apparent signaling where necessary. Our results show a significantly higher probability of violation than existing state-of-the-art inequalities. This work demonstrates the power of semidefinite programming for entanglement verification and brings quantum networks closer to practical applications.</description>

      <title>Shared randomness allows violation of macroscopic realism using a single measurement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15253v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Macro-realistic description of systems is based majorly on two basic intuitions about the classical world, namely, macrorealism per se, that is, the system is always in a distinct state, and non-invasive measurements, that is, measurements do not disturb the system. Given the assumption of no-signalling in time, one utilizes Leggett-Garg inequalities to observe a violation of macroscopic realism which requires at least three measurements. In this work, we show that if one has access to shared randomness then one can observe a violation of macroscopic realism using a single measurement even if no signalling in time is satisfied. Interestingly, using the proposed scheme one can also rule out a larger class of models, which we term "macroscopic no-signalling" theories which can not violate the no-signalling in time conditions. We further construct a witness to observe the violation of macroscopic no-signalling.</description>

      <title>The Thermodynamic Costs of Pure Dephasing in Quantum Heat Engines: Quasistatic Efficiency at Finite Power</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05375v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum heat engines are commonly believed to achieve their optimal efficiency only when operated quasi-statically. When running at finite power, however, they suffer effective friction due to the generation of coherences and transitions between energy eigenstates. It was noted that it is possible to increase the power of a quantum heat engine using external control schemes or suitable dephasing noise. Here, we investigate the thermodynamic cost associated with dephasing noise schemes using both numerical and analytical methods. Our findings unveil that the observed gain in power is generally not free of thermodynamic costs, as it involves energy costs of the control fields or heat flows between thermal and dephasing baths. These contributions must be duly accounted for when determining the engine's overall efficiency. Interestingly, we identify a particular working regime where these costs become negligible, demonstrating that quantum heat engines can be operated at any power with an efficiency per cycle that approaches arbitrarily closely that under quasistatic operation.</description>

      <title>Agnostic Tomography of Stabilizer Product States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03813v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define a quantum learning task called agnostic tomography, where given copies of an arbitrary state $\rho$ and a class of quantum states $\mathcal{C}$, the goal is to output a succinct description of a state that approximates $\rho$ at least as well as any state in $\mathcal{C}$ (up to some small error $\varepsilon$). This task generalizes ordinary quantum tomography of states in $\mathcal{C}$ and is more challenging because the learning algorithm must be robust to perturbations of $\rho$.
  We give an efficient agnostic tomography algorithm for the class $\mathcal{C}$ of $n$-qubit stabilizer product states. Assuming $\rho$ has fidelity at least $\tau$ with a stabilizer product state, the algorithm runs in time $n^{O(1 + \log(1/\tau))} / \varepsilon^2$. This runtime is quasipolynomial in all parameters, and polynomial if $\tau$ is a constant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20143v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that a category of causal contextuality scenarios with no cycles, unique causal bridges, and causally secured covers is equivalent to a category containing a subclass of the formerly published spacetime games, which generalize game theory to decisions arbitrarily located in Minkowski spacetime. This insight leads to certain constructs and proofs being shorter, simpler, and more intuitive when expressed in the spacetime game framework than in the causal contextuality scenario framework. The equivalence of categories and the modular structure of causal contextuality theory also implies that it is possible to build (pure) strategy sheaves, mixed strategy presheaves (equivalent to distribution presheaves) and empirical models on top of spacetime games: the obstruction to a global section in the presence of contextuality corresponds to the non-existence of a mixed strategy in the sense of the Nash game theory framework. This shows that the insights of both frameworks taken together can contribute positively to advancing the field of quantum foundations.</description>

Abstract: Quantum signal processing is a framework for implementing polynomial functions on quantum computers. To implement a given polynomial $P$, one must first construct a corresponding complementary polynomial $Q$. Existing approaches to this problem employ numerical methods that are not amenable to explicit error analysis. We present a new approach to complementary polynomials using complex analysis. Our main mathematical result is a contour integral representation for a canonical complementary polynomial. On the unit circle, this representation has a particularly simple and efficacious Fourier analytic interpretation, which we use to develop a Fast Fourier Transform-based algorithm for the efficient calculation of $Q$ in the monomial basis with explicit error guarantees. Numerical evidence that our algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art optimization-based method for computing complementary polynomials is provided.</description>

Abstract: If we want to transform the quantum state of a system to another using local measurement processes, what is the probability of success? This probability is bounded by quantifying entanglement in both the states. In this paper, we construct a family of local unitary invariants of multipartite states that are monotonic under local operations and classical communication on average. These monotones are constructed from local unitary invariant polynomials of the state and its conjugate, and hence are easy to compute for pure states. Using these measures we bound the success probability of transforming a given state into another state using local quantum operations and classical communication.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07707v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fault-tolerant implementation of non-Clifford gates is a major challenge for achieving universal fault-tolerant quantum computing with quantum error-correcting codes. Magic state distillation is the most well-studied method for this but requires significant resources. Hence, it is crucial to tailor and optimize magic state distillation for specific codes from both logical- and physical-level perspectives. In this work, we perform such optimization for two-dimensional color codes, which are promising due to their higher encoding rates compared to surface codes, transversal implementation of Clifford gates, and efficient lattice surgery. We propose two carefully designed distillation schemes based on the 15-to-1 distillation circuit and lattice surgery, differing in their methods for handling faulty rotations. Our first scheme employs faulty T-measurement, achieving infidelities of $O(p^3)$ for physical noise strength $p$. To achieve lower infidelities, our second scheme integrates distillation with 'cultivation' (a distillation-free approach to fault-tolerantly prepare magic states through transversal Clifford measurements). Our second scheme achieves significantly lower infidelities (e.g., $\sim 2 \times 10^{-16}$ at $p = 10^{-3}$), surpassing the capabilities of both cultivation and single-level distillation. Notably, to reach a given target infidelity, our schemes require approximately two orders of magnitude fewer resources than the previous best magic state distillation schemes for color codes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02414v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We found the quasi inverse of qubit channels as a unitary map, $\mathcal{E}^i$, by minimizing the average trace distance between the input state to the channel and the output of the quasi inverse channel for arbitrary qubit channel $\mathcal{E}$ and for arbitrary input states. The channel $\mathcal{E}$ was assumed completely positive and trace-preserving. To find the quasi inverse for mixed states, we proposed an alternative definition of the quasi inverse based on the mean square of the trace distance (MSTD) of a channel. The definition based on the trace distance allowed easy generalization of the quasi inverse to mixed input states. The quasi inverse of the Pauli, generalized amplitude damping, mixed unitary, and tetrahedron channels calculated based on the MSTD agreed with the one computed using average fidelity in the special case of input states being pure.</description>

Abstract: The coherence transformation is pivotal for quantum technologies, which cannot always be accomplished deterministically. We investigate the probabilistic coherence transformation under strictly incoherent operations. To this end, by virtue of majorization lattice, the greedy and thrifty protocols are adapted for the probabilistic coherence transformation, of which the latter exhibits certain superiority in preserving coherence on average. Intuitively, it is found that the large coherence gain can be realized with the price of success probability loss for coherence transformation, and vice versa. Deterministic and probabilistic coherence transformations between two mixed states are explored. As an application, it is shown that the conversion from coherence into entanglement may benefit from probabilistic coherence transformation.</description>

Abstract: Verstraete, Dehaene, and De Moor (2003) showed that SLOCC invariants provide entanglement monotones. We observe that many highly entangled or useful four-qubit states that appear in prior literature are stationary points of such entanglement measures. This motivates the search for more stationary points. We use the notion of critical points (in the sense of the Kempf-Ness theorem) together with Vinberg theory to reduce the complexity of the problem significantly. We solve the corresponding systems utilizing modern numerical nonlinear algebra methods and reduce the solutions by natural symmetries. This method produces an extended list of four-qubit stationary points, which includes all the critical states in the survey by Enriquez et al (2016). To illustrate the potential for application, we discuss the use of these states to generate pure five-qubit and six-qubit quantum error correcting codes by reversing a construction of Rains (1996).</description>

      <title>The Di\'osi-Penrose model of classical gravity predicts gravitationally induced entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02287v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the dynamics of the Di\'osi-Penrose (DP) model of classical gravity can entangle the mechanical degrees of freedom of two separate particles. For standard experiments of gravitationally induced entanglement (GIE), we find that entanglement can be generated if and only if the particles are separated by a distance smaller than some limiting value $d_c$, proportional to the only free parameter of the DP model. Greater distances can be achieved through new experimental configurations, where the initial wave functions of the particles are allowed to spread perpendicularly to the separation axis. Although the DP dynamics asymptotically drives the system to a separable state, we observe that, for reasonable experimental parameters, GIE can survive for more than a day. Our results therefore imply that GIE detection is not enough to validate quantum gravity. Experimental tests of GIE dynamics have nonetheless the potential to falsify the DP model.</description>

      <title>Bounding Large-Scale Bell Inequalities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08532v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bell inequalities are an important tool for studying non-locality, however quickly become computationally intractable as the system size grows. We consider a novel method for finding an upper bound for the quantum violation of such inequalities by combining the NPA hierarchy, the method of alternating projections, and the memory-efficient optimisation algorithm L-BFGS. Whilst our method may not give the tightest upper bound possible, it often does so several orders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art solvers, with minimal memory usage, thus allowing solutions to problems that would otherwise be intractable. We benchmark using the well-studied I3322 inequality as well as a more general large-scale randomized inequality RXX22. For randomized inequalities with 130 inputs either side (a first-level moment matrix of size 261x261), our method is ~100x faster than both MOSEK and SCS whilst giving a bound only ~2% above the optimum.</description>

Abstract: Foundation models are highly versatile neural-network architectures capable of processing different data types, such as text and images, and generalizing across various tasks like classification and generation. Inspired by this success, we propose Foundation Neural-Network Quantum States (FNQS) as an integrated paradigm for studying quantum many-body systems. FNQS leverage key principles of foundation models to define variational wave functions based on a single, versatile architecture that processes multimodal inputs, including spin configurations and Hamiltonian physical couplings. Unlike specialized architectures tailored for individual Hamiltonians, FNQS can generalize to physical Hamiltonians beyond those encountered during training, offering a unified framework adaptable to various quantum systems and tasks. FNQS enable the efficient estimation of quantities that are traditionally challenging or computationally intensive to calculate using conventional methods, particularly disorder-averaged observables. Furthermore, the fidelity susceptibility can be easily obtained to uncover quantum phase transitions without prior knowledge of order parameters. These pretrained models can be efficiently fine-tuned for specific quantum systems. The architectures trained in this paper are publicly available at https://huggingface.co/nqs-models, along with examples for implementing these neural networks in NetKet.</description>

      <title>Feedback-Based Quantum Strategies for Constrained Combinatorial Optimization Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14369v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Feedback-based quantum algorithms have recently emerged as potential methods for approximating the ground states of Hamiltonians. One such algorithm, the feedback-based algorithm for quantum optimization (FALQON), is specifically designed to solve quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problems. Its extension, the feedback-based algorithm for quantum optimization with constraints (FALQON-C), was introduced to handle constrained optimization problems with equality and inequality constraints. In this work, we extend the feedback-based quantum algorithms framework to address a broader class of constraints known as invalid configuration (IC) constraints, which explicitly prohibit specific configurations of decision variables. We first present a transformation technique that converts the constrained optimization problem with invalid configuration constraints into an equivalent unconstrained problem by incorporating a penalizing term into the cost function. Then, leaning upon control theory, we propose an alternative method tailored for feedback-based quantum algorithms that directly tackles IC constraints without requiring slack variables. Our approach introduces a new operator that encodes the optimal feasible solution of the constrained optimization problem as its ground state. Then, a controlled quantum system based on the Lyapunov control technique is designed to ensure convergence to the ground state of this operator. Two approaches are introduced in the design of this operator to address IC constraints: the folded spectrum approach and the deflation approach. These methods eliminate the need for slack variables, significantly reducing the quantum circuit depth and the number of qubits required. We show the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms through numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Efficient Excited-State Calculations for Molecules Based on Contextual Subspace Method and Symmetry Optimizations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17932v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computing methods for excited-state calculations remain underexplored in Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) hardware, despite their critical role in photochemistry and material science. Herein, we propose a resource-efficient framework that integrates the contextual subspace (CS) method with the Variational Quantum Deflation (VQD) algorithm to enable systematic excited-state calculations for molecules while reducing qubit requirements. On the basis of the numerical results, we find that it is unproblematic to utilize this combination in calculating the excited state to reduce qubits. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the implementation of a spin-conserving hardware-efficient ansatz, namely the $\mathcal{N}(\theta_x,\theta_y,\theta_z)$ block ansatz, allows exploitation of spin symmetry within the projected subspace, thereby achieving further reductions in computational resource demands. Compared to the commonly used $R_{y}R_{z}$ ansatz, using the $\mathcal{N}(\theta_x,\theta_y,\theta_z)$ ansatz can reduce the number of optimization iterations by up to 3 times at a similar circuit depth.</description>

      <title>Recursive Cartan decompositions for unitary synthesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19014v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recursive Cartan decompositions (CDs) provide a way to exactly factorize quantum circuits into smaller components, making them a central tool for unitary synthesis. Here we present a detailed overview of recursive CDs, elucidating their mathematical structure, demonstrating their algorithmic utility, and implementing them numerically at large scales. We adapt, extend, and unify existing mathematical frameworks for recursive CDs, allowing us to gain new insights and streamline the construction of new circuit decompositions. Based on this, we show that several leading synthesis techniques from the literature-the Quantum Shannon, Block-ZXZ, and Khaneja-Glaser decompositions-implement the same recursive CD. We also present new recursive CDs based on the orthogonal and symplectic groups, and derive parameter-optimal decompositions. Furthermore, we aggregate numerical tools for CDs from the literature, put them into a common context, and complete them to allow for numerical implementations of all possible classical CDs in canonical form. As an application, we efficiently compile fast-forwardable Hamiltonian time evolution to fixed-depth circuits, compiling the transverse-field XY model on $10^3$ qubits into $2\times10^6$ gates in 22 seconds on a laptop.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01578v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a technique to investigate multipartite entanglement in the symmetric subspace. Our approach is to map an N-qubit symmetric state onto a bipartite symmetric state of higher local dimension. We show that this mapping preserves separability and allows to characterize the entanglement of the original multipartite state. In particular, we provide several bounds to estimate the symmetric tensor rank and geometric measure of entanglement. Finally, we reveal the existence of entangled symmetric subspaces, where all bipartite states are entangled.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00087v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show a surprising relation between quantum learning theory and algorithmic hardness. We demonstrate that finding near-ground states of certain sparse disordered quantum systems is average-case hard for "Lipschitz" quantum algorithms if there exists an efficient, local learning algorithm -- such as the classical shadows algorithm -- for estimating the energy of a state of the system. A corollary of our result is that many standard quantum algorithms fail to find near-ground states of these systems, including short-time Lindbladian dynamics, short-time quantum annealing, phase estimation, and shallow-depth variational quantum algorithms. To achieve this, we introduce a topological property of quantum systems that we call the quantum overlap gap property (QOGP). This property is only satisfied by systems with an efficient local learning algorithm for the energy. We prove that systems which exhibit this topological property in their low-energy space are intractable for quantum algorithms whose outputs are stable under perturbations to their inputs. We then prove that the QOGP is satisfied for a sparsified variant of the quantum $p$-spin model, giving the first known algorithmic hardness-of-approximation result for quantum algorithms in finding the ground state of a non-stoquastic, noncommuting quantum system. Our resulting lower bound for quantum algorithms optimizing this model using Lindbladian evolution matches the best-known time lower bound for classical Langevin dynamics optimizing classical $p$-spin models. For this reason we suspect that finding ground states of typical quantum $p$-spin models using quantum algorithms is, in practice, as intractable as the classical $p$-spin model is for classical algorithms. Inversely, we show that the Sachdev--Ye--Kitaev (SYK) model does not exhibit the QOGP, consistent with previous evidence that the model is rapidly mixing at low temperatures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18090v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Parameter shift rules are instrumental for derivatives estimation in a wide range of quantum algorithms, especially in the context of Quantum Machine Learning. Application of single-gap parameter shift rule is often not possible in algorithms running on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware due to noise effects and interaction between device qubits. In such cases, generalized parameter shift rules must be applied yet are computationally expensive for larger systems. In this paper we present the approximate generalized parameter rule (aGPSR) that can handle arbitrary device Hamiltonians and provides an accurate derivative estimation while significantly reducing the computational requirements. When applying aGPSR for a variational quantum eigensolver test case ranging from 3 to 6 qubits, the number of expectation calls is reduced by a factor ranging from 7 to 504 while reaching the exact same target energy, demonstrating its huge computational savings capabilities.</description>

Abstract: There is a multitude of interpretations of quantum mechanics, but foundational principles are lacking. Relational quantum mechanics views the observer as a physical system, which allows for an unambiguous interpretation as all axioms are purely operational, describing how observers acquire information. The approach, however, is based on the premise that the observer retains only predictive information about the observed system. Here, we justify this premise using the following principle: Physically embedded observers choose information processing strategies that provide them with the option to approach physical limits to the greatest possible extent. Applied to a lower limit on energy dissipation, the principle leads directly to a compact predictive model, thus justifying this core premise of relational quantum mechanics.</description>

Abstract: Interactions between quantum particles, such as electrons, are the source of important effects, ranging from superconductivity, to the formation of molecular bonds, or the stability of elementary compounds at high-energies. In this article, we illustrate how advances in the cold-atom community to further engineer such long-range interactions have stimulated the simulation of new regimes of these fundamental many-body problems. The goal is two-fold: first, to provide a comprehensive review of the different strategies proposed and/or experimentally realized to induce long-range interactions among atoms moving in optical potentials. Second, to showcase various fields where such platforms can offer new insights, ranging from the simulation of condensed matter phenomena to the study of lattice gauge theories, and the simulation of electronic configurations in chemistry. We then discuss the challenges and opportunities of these platforms compared to other complementary approaches based on digital simulation and quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Insightful Approach to Quantum Noise Suppression Below the Standard Quantum Limit Using a Single Mirror and Beam Splitter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08521v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When a coherent electromagnetic wave passes through a beam splitter (BS), it is divided equally into two parts. However, the quantum noise associated with the resulting coherent states, despite being reduced in amplitude by half, remains fundamentally constrained by the quantum noise limit, independent of the intensity. By placing a mirror at the unused input port of the BS, a standing wave is formed in the vicinity of the mirror, which influences the vacuum fluctuations of the coherent state at the BS output. Using semi-classical and quantum mechanical approaches, we calculate the vacuum fluctuations induced by the mirror and demonstrate that the vacuum noise originating from the mirror side periodically reaches zero at the BS output. Leveraging this effect, we show that the vacuum fluctuations of the light split by the BS can be readily reduced below the quantum noise limit. Furthermore, through feedback mechanisms, the vacuum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field at the other output port can also be suppressed below the quantum noise limit. These findings provide a pivotal insight into the manipulation of electromagnetic noise, with broad implications for all experiments involving quantum noise control.</description>

Abstract: Metastable atomic qubits are a highly promising platform for the realization of quantum computers, owing to their scalability and the possibility of converting leakage errors to erasure errors mid-circuit. Here, we demonstrate and characterize a universal gate set for the metastable fine-structure qubit encoded between the $^3\text{P}_0$ and $^3\text{P}_2$ states in bosonic strontium-88. We find single-qubit gate fidelities of 0.993(1), and two-qubit gate fidelities of 0.9945(6) after correcting for losses during the gate operation. Furthermore, we present a novel state-resolved detection scheme for the two fine-structure states that enables high-fidelity detection of qubit loss. Finally, we leverage the existence of a stable ground state outside the qubit subspace to perform mid-circuit erasure conversion using fast destructive imaging. Our results establish the strontium fine-structure qubit as a promising candidate for near-term error-corrected quantum computers, offering unique scaling perspectives.</description>

      <title>Probing the Topology of Fermionic Gaussian Mixed States with {U(1)} symmetry by Full Counting Statistics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15964v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological band theory has been studied for free fermions for decades, and one of the most profound physical results is the bulk-boundary correspondence. Recently a focus in topological physics is extending topological classification to mixed states. Here, we focus on Gaussian mixed states where the modular Hamiltonians of the density matrix are quadratic free fermion models with {U(1)} symmetry and can be classified by topological invariants. The bulk-boundary correspondence is then manifested as stable gapless modes of the modular Hamiltonian and degenerate spectrum of the density matrix. In this article, we show that these gapless modes can be detected by the full counting statistics, mathematically described by a function introduced as {F(\theta)}. A divergent derivative at {\theta=\pi} can be used to probe the gapless modes in the modular Hamiltonian. Based on this, a topological indicator, whose quantization to unity senses topologically nontrivial mixed states, is introduced. We present the physical intuition of these results and also demonstrate these results with concrete models in both one- and two-dimensions. Our results pave the way for revealing the physical significance of topology in mixed states.</description>

Abstract: In recent years, the lack of a conclusive detection of WIMP dark matter at the 10 GeV/c$^{2}$ mass scale and above has encouraged development of low-threshold detector technology aimed at probing lighter dark matter candidates. Detectors based on Cooper-pair-breaking sensors have emerged as a promising avenue for this detection due to the low (meV-scale) energy required for breaking a Cooper pair in most superconductors. Among them, devices based on superconducting qubits are interesting candidates for sensing due to their observed sensitivity to broken Cooper pairs. We have developed an end-to-end G4CMP-based simulation framework and have used it to evaluate performance metrics of qubit-based devices operating in a gate-based "energy relaxation" readout scheme, akin to those used in recent studies of qubit sensitivity to ionizing radiation. We find that for this readout scheme, the qubit acts as a phonon sensor with an energy threshold ranging down to $\simeq$0.4 eV for near-term performance parameters.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Lattice Formulation of Compact Maxwell-Chern-Simons Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20225v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, a Hamiltonian lattice formulation for 2+1D compact Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory is derived. We analytically solve this theory and demonstrate that the mass gap in the continuum limit matches the well-known continuum formula. Our formulation preserves topological features such as the quantization of the Chern-Simons level, the degeneracy of energy eigenstates, the non-trivial properties of Wilson loops, and the mutual and self statistics of anyons. This work lays the groundwork for future Hamiltonian-based simulations of Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory on classical and quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Modeling Athermal Phonons in Novel Materials using the G4CMP Simulation Toolkit</title>

Abstract: Understanding phonon and charge propagation in superconducting devices plays an important role in both performing low-threshold dark matter searches and limiting correlated errors in superconducting qubits. The Geant4 Condensed Matter Physics (G4CMP) package, originally developed for the Cryogenic Dark Matter Search (CDMS) experiment, models charge and phonon transport within silicon and germanium detectors and has been validated by experimental measurements of phonon caustics, mean charge-carrier drift velocities, and heat pulse propagation times. In this work, we present a concise framework for expanding the capabilities for phonon transport to a number of other novel substrate materials of interest to the dark matter and quantum computing communities, including sapphire (Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$), gallium arsenide (GaAs), lithium fluoride (LiF), calcium tungstate (CaWO$_{4}$), and calcium fluoride (CaF$_{2}$). We demonstrate the use of this framework in generating phonon transport properties of these materials and compare these properties with experimentally-determined values where available.</description>

      <title>Instanton-Induced Supersymmetry Breaking in Topological Semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16891v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Supersymmetry (SUSY) proposed as an elementary symmetry for physics beyond the Standard Model has found important applications in various areas outside high-energy physics. Here, we systematically implement supersymmetric quantum mechanics -- exhibiting fundamental SUSY properties in the simple setting of quantum mechanics -- into a wide range of topological semimetals, where the broken translational symmetry, e.g., by a magnetic field, is effectively captured by a SUSY potential. We show that the dynamical SUSY breaking via the instanton effect over the SUSY potential valleys works as the underlying mechanism for the gap opening of the topological semimetallic phases, and the magnitude of the instanton effect is proportional to the energy gap. This instanton mechanism provides a simple criterion for determining whether the energy gap has been opened, without resorting to detailed calculations, i.e., a finite energy gap is opened if and only if the SUSY potential has an even number of zeros. Our theory leads to previously unexpected results: even an infinitesimal magnetic field can open a gap in topologically robust Dirac, Weyl, and nodal-line semimetallic phases due to the dynamical SUSY breaking. Overall, the revealed connection between SUSY quantum mechanics and non-uniform topological semimetals can elucidate previously ambiguous phenomena, provide guidance for future investigations, and open a new avenue for exploring topological semimetals.</description>

      <title>Exact multiple anomalous mobility edges in a flat band geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10766v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Anomalous mobility edges(AMEs), separating localized from multifractal critical states, represent a novel form of localization transition in quasiperiodic systems. However, quasi-periodic models exhibiting exact AMEs remain relatively rare, limiting the understanding of these transitions. In this work, we leverage the geometric structure of flat band models to construct exact AMEs. Specifically, we introduce an anti-symmetric diagonal quasi-periodic mosaic modulation, which consists of both quasi-periodic and constant potentials, into a cross-stitch flat band lattice. When the constant potential is zero, the system resides entirely in a localized phase, with its dispersion relation precisely determined. For non-zero constant potentials, we use a simple method to derive analytical solutions for a class of AMEs, providing exact results for both the AMEs and the system's localization and critical properties. Additionally, we propose a classical electrical circuit design to experimentally realize the system. This study offers valuable insights into the existence and characteristics of AMEs in quasi-periodic systems.</description>

      <title>Topological Phase Transitions and Mixed State Order in a Hubbard Quantum Simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17009v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological phase transitions challenge conventional paradigms in many-body physics by separating phases that are locally indistinguishable yet globally distinct. Using a quantum simulator of interacting erbium atoms in an optical lattice, we observe such a transition between one-dimensional crystalline symmetry-protected topological phases (CSPTs). We detect the critical point through non-local string order parameters and reveal its connection to the transition predicted between the Mott and Haldane insulators. Moreover, we demonstrate a striking property: stacking two identical systems eliminates the transition, confirming the predicted group structure and invertibility of SPTs. Finally, while introducing symmetry-breaking disorder also removes the transition, disorder averaging restores it. Consequently, the adjacent phases realize a form of mixed-state quantum order wherein the criticality between them depends on the observer's information. Our results demonstrate how topology and information influence quantum phase transitions, opening the doors to probing novel critical phenomena in programmable quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Entanglement and entropy uncertainty in black hole quantum atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10631v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the properties of Hawking radiation induced by the quantum atmosphere beyond the event horizon, by considering two detectors in Schwarzschild spacetime with the parameterized Hartle-Hawking temperature. \textcolor{black}{We explicitly study the dynamics of quantum entanglement and found that its characteristics are closely correlated with Hawking quantum radiation beyond the event horizon. Namely, its minimal value corresponds to the peak of Hawking radiation.} By virtue of the mutual information, we demonstrate the complementary relationship of the information distribution in the black hole. In addition, we detailedly discuss the influence of distance from the center of black hole to particle, radius of event horizon and Hartle-Hawking constant on the entropy uncertainty in the current scenario, and the results interestingly show that there exists an opposite correlation between the entanglement and the entropy uncertainty. It is believed that our observation could provide a new perspective for understanding the black hole information paradox and black hole thermodynamics.</description>
