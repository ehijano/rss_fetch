      <title>Local bifurcation analysis of circular von-K\'arm\'an plate with Kirchhoff rod boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetry based reduction is applied to the buckling of a circular von-Karman plate with Kirchhoff rod boundary, where a mismatch between the edge length and the perimeter of plate is treated as the bifurcation parameter. A nonlinear operator formulation describes the equilibrium of the elastic rod plate system. The critical points, as potential bifurcation points, are stated using the linearized operator. The symmetry of null space for each critical point is identified as a subgroup of the complete symmetry group of nonlinear problem, the equivariance associated with the nonlinear operator is used in this process. Sufficient evidence is provided for each critical point to be a bifurcation point for the symmetry reduced problem and post buckling analysis is carried out using Lyapunov Schmidt reduction. Bifurcation curves are obtained till quadratic order in bifurcation parameter away from each critical value. Theoretical results for bifurcation curves are validated against the numerical simulation based on a symmetry reduced finite element method for some illustrative examples of critical points. A numerical study is carried out for the dependence of the coefficient of quadratic term in the bifurcation parameter when structural parameters are varied in a neighborhood of four fixed sets of structural parameters. Numerical results based on a symmetry reduced finite element analysis confirm that the nonlinear solution agrees with the local theoretical behavior close to a critical point but deviates further away from it. Using these tools, two main conclusions are reached. First it is observed that the critical points of the linearized problem are indeed bifurcation points. Second, an alteration in the nature of bifurcation is observed during the parameter sweep study when the plate is in tension.</description>

      <title>Active rheology of soft solids performed with acoustical tweezers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-beam acoustical tweezers are used to manipulate individual microbubbles and provide quantitative measurements of the local shear modulus of soft hydrogels. The microbubbles are directly generated by electrolysis of the hydrogel and their displacement is detected using optical microscopy in the focal plane of a focused vortex beam. Microbubbles displaced off-axis can be pulled by a restoring radial force component that forms a stable two-dimensional trap. We also observe an off-axis tangential microbubble motion that is due to the transfer of the beam's angular momentum flux. A simple elastic model for the hydrogel deformation combined with radiation force calculations finally provide local values of the medium's shear modulus, which are found to be in good agreement with standard bulk measurements performed with a rheometer. Our results suggest that acoustical tweezers are relevant tools to characterize the local mechanical properties of complex soft materials opening new opportunities in the field of active rheology.</description>

      <title>Through-Thickness Modelling of Metal Rolling using Multiple-Scale Asymptotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01347v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new semi-analytic model of the metal rolling process is introduced, which, for the first time, is able to predict the through-thickness stress and strain oscillations present in long thin roll-gaps. The model is based on multiple-scales asymptotics, assuming a long thin roll-gap and a comparably small Coulomb friction coefficient. The leading-order solution varies only on a long lengthscale corresponding to the roll-gap length and matches with slab models. The next-order correction varies on both this long lengthscale and a short lengthscale associated with the workpiece thickness, and reveals rapid stress and strain oscillation both in the rolling direction and through the thickness. For this initial derivation, the model assumes a rigid perfectly-plastic material behaviour. Despite these strong assumptions, this model compares well with finite element simulations that employ more realistic material behaviour (including elasticity and strain hardening). These assumptions facilitate the simplest possible model to provide a foundational understanding of the complex through-thickness behaviour observed in the finite element simulations, while requiring an order of only seconds to compute. This model can form the foundation of further improved models with more complicated mechanics in the future. Matlab code for evaluating the model is provided in the supplementary material.</description>
