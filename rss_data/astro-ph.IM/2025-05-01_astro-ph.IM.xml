      <title>DeepVoid: A Deep Learning Void Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present DeepVoid, an application of deep learning trained on a physical definition of cosmic voids to detect voids in density fields and galaxy distributions. By semantically segmenting the IllustrisTNG simulation volume using the tidal tensor, we train a deep convolutional neural network to classify local structure using a U-Net architecture for training and prediction. The model achieves a void F1 score of 0.96 and a Matthews correlation coefficient over all structural classes of 0.81 for dark matter particles in IllustrisTNG with interparticle spacing of $\lambda=0.33 h^{-1} \text{Mpc}$. We then apply the machine learning technique of curricular learning to enable the model to classify structure in data with significantly larger intertracer separation. At the highest tracer separation tested, $\lambda=10 h^{-1} \text{Mpc}$, the model achieves a void F1 score of 0.89 and a Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.6 on IllustrisTNG subhalos.</description>

      <title>Flickers, Bursts, and Dips: Detecting Rapid Variability with the g(2) Autocorrelation Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rapid optical transient events can be hard to detect because of the limited number of photons they produce. I discuss a method of inferring the presence of fast, chaotic variability in photometry using the normalized autocorrelation function, what is called $g^{(2)}$ in quantum optics. The variability's signature is a bump in the function at short lags. No periodicity is needed for the method to work. Versions of this method are attested in stellar variability studies, but its uses in some other subfields apparently have not been realized. I calculate expected signal-to-noise ratios with shot noise and scintillation. This method could be used to find unknown phenomena, particularly sub-millisecond optical variability. I present simple models of three example use cases: a flickering artificial "lantern" near a host sun, optical microbursts from the Crab pulsar, and frequent irregular transits of a star by cometary bodies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Astronomical data is rich in volume, information and facets. Although this offers multiple research perspectives, processing the data remains a challenge. Infrastructures for analyzing, inspecting, exploring and communicating with data are mandatory. To address this issue, we introduce Jasmine, the JAvaScript Multimodal INformation Explorer. Jasmine allows users to open different data viewer modals that show a specific data point from a set. The viewer currently supports image data, as well as point cloud objects. Users can decide on which information about the data point they like to have displayed. Point clouds are interactive and allow for zooming, tossing, and turning. Picking a data point is enabled by providing a structured view of the set, arranged by a key property. This arrangement is achieved by autoencoding.</description>

Abstract: This paper describes advances in solar magnetography and developments in instrumental techniques of polarimetry and spectroscopy made at Paris-Meudon observatory in the second half of the twentieth century. The adventure started from Lyot expertise and extended progressively to the measurement of vector magnetic fields using various and improving polarimetric techniques (such as beam exchange or grid) or new spectroscopic methods (such as the MSDP imaging slicer), at Meudon and Pic du Midi, ending by the achievement of the state-of-the-art optimized and polarization free telescope THEMIS in 1999.</description>

      <title>Automated detection and modeling of binary microlensing events in OGLE-IV data. I. Events with well-separated bumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational microlensing depends primarily on the lens mass and presents a larger occurrence rate in crowded regions, which makes it the best tool to uncover the initial mass function (IMF) of low-mass stars in the Galactic bulge. The bulge IMF can be obtained from the luminosity function measured with the Hubble Space Telescope if one knows the statistics of binary stellar systems in the bulge. We aim to analyse a statistically significant number of binary-lens/single-source and single-lens/binary-source events, in order to explore the lower-mass end of the bulge IMF even in unresolved binary systems. This paper deals with events with clearly separated bumps and no caustic crossing or approach, whereas other types will be analysed in following works. A fully-automated approach in the search and modeling of binary events was implemented. Event detection was carried out with a modified version of the algorithm used in previous studies. Model fitting was carried out with Markov chain Monte Carlo and nested sampling methods, in order to find the most probable solution among binary lens or binary source models. We retrieved 107 binary events in Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) light curves spanning ten years in 9 high-cadence and 112 low-cadence fields towards the bulge. Several criteria were applied to reduce false positives, resulting in 55 most likely binary lenses and 52 binary sources. The tools were effective detecting a bona-fide sample of binary events, with a distribution of Einstein timescales around 35-40 days and flat distributions for mass ratio and source flux ratio. After proper consideration of detection efficiency, the statistics for binary fraction and mass ratio will provide valuable constraints for the bulge IMF.</description>

      <title>Fast and accurate parameter estimation of high-redshift sources with the Einstein Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Einstein Telescope (ET), along with other third-generation gravitational wave (GW) detectors, will be a key instrument for detecting GWs in the coming decades. However, analyzing the data and estimating source parameters will be challenging, especially given the large number of expected detections - of order $10^5$ per year - which makes current methods based on stochastic sampling impractical. In this work, we use Dingo-IS to perform Neural Posterior Estimation (NPE) of high-redshift events detectable with ET in its triangular configuration. NPE is a likelihood-free inference technique that leverages normalizing flows to approximate posterior distributions. After training, inference is fast, requiring only a few minutes per source, and accurate, as corrected through importance sampling and validated against standard Bayesian inference methods. To confirm previous findings on the ability to estimate parameters for high-redshift sources with ET, we compare NPE results with predictions from the Fisher information matrix (FIM) approximation. We find that FIM underestimates sky localization errors substantially for most sources, as it does not capture the multimodalities in sky localization introduced by the geometry of the triangular detector. FIM also overestimates the uncertainty in luminosity distance by a factor of $\sim 3$ on average when the injected luminosity distance is $d^{\mathrm{inj}}_{\mathrm{L}} &gt; 10^5~$Mpc, further confirming that ET will be particularly well suited for studying the early Universe.</description>

      <title>An improved parametrized test of general relativity using the IMRPhenomX waveform family: Including higher harmonics and precession</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When testing general relativity (GR) with gravitational wave observations, parametrized tests of deviations from the expected strong-field source dynamics are one of the most widely used techniques. We present an updated version of the parametrized framework with the state-of-art IMRPhenomX waveform family. Our new framework incorporates deviations in the dominant mode as well as in the higher-order modes of the waveform. We demonstrate that the missing physics of either higher-order modes or precession in the parametrized model can lead to a biased conclusion of false deviation from GR. Our new implementation mitigates this issue and enables us to perform the tests for highly asymmetric and precessing binaries without being subject to systematic biases due to missing physics. Finally, we apply the improved test to analyze events observed during the second half of the third observing run of LIGO and Virgo (O3b). We provide constraints on GR deviations by combining O3b results with those from previous observation runs. Our findings show no evidence for violations of GR.</description>

      <title>Feasibility assessment of optical communications between ground and satellite on Mars through the simulation of atmospheric effects on signal quality leading to a proposal for a new communications network architecture during extreme weather</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mars is the next milestone in human exploration. However, there are still several challenges that must be assessed to ensure appropriate conditions in a future settlement. Communications services will be essential for this task, providing not only a link between Earth and Mars but also supporting Martian weather forecasting and any potential rescue missions. These applications require a robust, high data rate communications network that allows for rapid response, remote sensing and public engagement. This research aims to study the feasibility of ground-to-satellite (and vice versa) optical communications during extreme Martian weather conditions, focusing on the link between a ground station on the surface of Mars and a satellite orbiting the planet. Long-lasting and expansive Martian dust storms, particularly common in the southern hemisphere, pose a considerable challenge when considering the feasibility of optical communications with Mars due to their significant impact in terms of signal attenuation and scattering. The methodology of this study is based on a computer simulation of the system featuring the characterisation of the Martian atmosphere and optical link to measure the attenuation and undesired effects suffered by the data signal when applying different environmental configuration parameters. The flexibility of the approach allows for the prediction of communications link quality in extreme cases such as global dust storms. The simulation is based on atmospheric data from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter's Mars Climate Sounder instrument and considers the recently launched Laser Communication Relay Demonstration (LCRD). The extreme conditions during dust storms in the southern polar-hood region lead to the proposal of a new communications network architecture to ensure connectivity during these events.</description>

      <title>X-ray Spectroscopy via Temporal Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel way to fit solar flare X-ray spectra that offers more sensitivity to physical flare parameters than traditional approaches to spectroscopy. We decouple physically distinct emission types in solar flare X-ray spectra using timing behaviors, a technique we call time-decomposed spectroscopy. By fitting the shapes of particular time series to others across a time interval, we extract X-ray emission of distinct physical origins before any forward modeling. We perform spectroscopy on the original and time-decomposed spectra and find good agreement, with physical reasons for the few disagreements. In general, the time decomposition technique provides more precise results than those of traditional spectroscopy. The thermal and nonthermal energies are better constrained by more than an order of magnitude using the time decomposition approach, relative to traditional spectroscopy. We explain mathematically how and why the technique works using the multifractal formalism, and show that fractality is one way to choose appropriate light curves for this analysis. We speculate about applications to different wavelengths for solar data analysis, as well as applications to other physics subfields and domains.</description>

      <title>Searching beyond the fiducial stochastic gravitational wave background in pulsar timing array data using likelihood reweighting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since the recent announcements of evidence for a stochastic gravitational wave background from several pulsar timing array collaborations, much effort has been devoted to explore features beyond the fiducial Hellings-Downs background including those arising in modified gravity theories and deterministic gravitational wave signals. Inspired by previous studies, we propose a method to efficiently screen these models using likelihood reweighting based on the fiducial model. In order to alleviate the well-known unstable weight estimates in vanilla importance sampling, we implement reweighting for the second time making use of the kernel density estimation of the previously reweighted samples. We tested this method by analyzing three simulated datasets with an injected sinusoid signal applied to all pulsars. It is found that likelihood reweighting not only gives results compatible with those from full Bayesian analyses when the signal is subdominant, but is also able to recover the signal posterior to a reasonable accuracy in the presence of a rather strong signal. Given samples from the fiducial model, this method could bring an at least $\mathcal{O}(10)$-time speedup in analyzing new models.</description>

      <title>The new compact triple system: discovery of bright third star around contact binary using LAMOST-MRS spectra and photometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a study of the third star orbiting around known contact eclipsing binary J04+25 using spectra from the LAMOST medium-resolution survey (MRS) and publicly available photometry. This is a rare case of a hierarchical triple, where the third star is significantly brighter than the inner contact subsystem. We successfully extracted radial velocities for all three components, using the binary spectral model in two steps. Third star radial velocities have high precision and allow direct fitting of the orbit. The low precision of radial velocity measurements in the contact system is compensated by large number statistics. We employed a template matching technique for light curves to find periodic variation due to the light time travel effect (LTTE) using several photometric datasets. Joint fit of third star radial velocities and LTTE allowed us to get a consistent orbital solution with $P_3=941.40\pm0.03$ day and $e_3=0.059\pm0.007$. We made estimations of the masses $M_{\rm 12,~3}\sin^3{i_3}=1.05\pm0.02,~0.90\pm0.02~M_\odot$ in a wide system and discussed possible determination of an astrometric orbit in the future data release of Gaia. Additionally, we propose an empirical method for measuring a period and minimal mass of contact systems, based on variation of the projected rotational velocity ($V\sin{i}$) from the spectra.</description>

      <title>Biases from Missing a Small Planet in High Multiplicity Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In an era when we are charting multiple planets per system, one might wonder the extent to which "missing" (or failing to detect) a planet can skew our interpretation of the system architecture. We address this question with a simple experiment: starting from a large, homogeneous catalog, we remove planets and monitor how several well-defined metrics of the system architecture change. We first perform this test on a catalog of observed exoplanets. We then repeat our test on a catalog of synthetic planetary systems with underlying hyperparameters that have been fit to reproduce the observed systems as faithfully as possible (though imperfectly). For both samples, we find that the failure to detect one or more planets tends to create more irregularly spaced planets, whereas the planet mass similarity and coplanarity are essentially unaffected. One key difference between the synthetic and observed data sets is that the observed systems have more evenly spaced planets than the observation-bias-applied synthetic systems. Since our tests show that detection bias tends to increase irregularity in spacing, the even spacing in the observed planetary systems is likely astrophysical rather than the result of the Kepler missions' inherent detection biases. Our findings support the interpretation that planets in the same system have similar sizes and regular spacing and reinforce the need to develop an underlying model of planetary architectures that reproduces these observed patterns.</description>

      <title>Polka-dotted Stars: a Hierarchical Model for Mapping Stellar Surfaces Using Occultation Light Curves and the Case of TOI-3884</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present StarryStarryProcess, a novel hierarchical Bayesian framework for mapping stellar surfaces using exoplanet transit light curves. While previous methods relied solely on stellar rotational light curves--which contain limited information about spot properties -- our approach leverages planetary transits as probes of stellar surfaces. When a planet crosses a spot during transit, it creates a distinctive change in the light curve that directly reveals spot properties. Our model integrates planetary transit modeling with stellar variability analysis by combining the spherical harmonic surface map representation from starry, the probabilistic approach to spot properties of StarryProcess, and a comprehensive transit model that accounts for spot-crossing events during transits. We demonstrate through synthetic data experiments that our model successfully recovers spot distributions, stellar orientation, and spot physical properties. We extend the framework to handle evolving stellar surfaces through time-dependent modeling. Applying our method to TESS observations of TOI-3884, we find evidence for high-latitude spot concentrations and significant spin-orbit misalignment. The transit-based approach overcomes fundamental limitations of previous models by providing constraints on spot properties that would remain hidden in the null space of rotational light curves alone. This methodology enables more accurate exoplanet characterization by disentangling stellar activity due to starspots from planetary signals while simultaneously providing insights into stellar magnetic activity patterns.

      <title>Detection of Thermal Emission at Millimeter Wavelengths from Low-Earth Orbit Satellites</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03374v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The detection of artificial satellite thermal emission at millimeter wavelengths is presented using data from the 3rd-Generation receiver on the South Pole Telescope (SPT-3G). This represents the first reported detection of thermal emission from artificial satellites at millimeter wavelengths. Satellite thermal emission is shown to be detectable at high signal-to-noise ratios on timescales as short as a few tens of milliseconds. An algorithm for downloading orbital information and tracking known satellites given observer constraints and time-ordered observatory pointing is described. Consequences for cosmological surveys and short-duration transient searches are discussed, revealing that the integrated thermal emission from all large satellites does not contribute significantly to the SPT-3G survey intensity map. Measured satellite positions are found to be discrepant from their two-line element (TLE) derived ephemerides up to several arcminutes which may present a difficulty in cross-checking or masking satellites from short-duration transient searches.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Global IoT Networks for a Distributed Radio Telescope: Calibration Methods and Performance Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11818v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces an innovative approach to radio astronomy by utilizing the global network of Internet of Things (IoT) devices to form a distributed radio telescope. Leveraging existing IoT infrastructure with minimal modifications, the proposed system employs widely dispersed devices to simultaneously capture both astronomical and communication signals. Digital beamforming techniques are applied to align the astronomical signals, effectively minimizing interference from communication sources. Calibration is achieved using multiple distributed satellites transmitting known signals, enabling precise channel estimation and phase correction via GPS localization. We analyze two calibration methods, Phase Alignment Calibration (PAC) and Eigenvalue-Based Calibration (EVC), and demonstrate that EVC outperforms PAC in environments with significant variation in node performance. Compared to the Green Bank Telescope (GBT), the IoT-based telescope enhances antenna gain by three orders of magnitude and increases survey speed by eight orders of magnitude, owing to the vast number of nodes and expansive field of view (FoV). These findings demonstrate the feasibility and significant advantages of the IoT-enabled telescope, paving the way for cost-effective, high-speed, and widely accessible astronomical observations.</description>

      <title>Transit Timing and Duration Variations for the Discovery and Characterization of Exoplanets in the TESS era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.09849</link>
      <description>arXiv:1706.09849v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transiting exoplanets in multi-planet systems have non-Keplerian orbits which can cause the times and durations of transits to vary. The theory and observations of transit timing variations (TTV) and transit duration variations (TDV) are reviewed. The Kepler spacecraft has detected several hundred perturbed planets, many of which are still undergoing further study, and now TESS is adding to this sample. In a few cases, these data have been used to discover additional planets, similar to the historical discovery of Neptune in our own Solar System. However, the more impactful aspect of TTV and TDV studies has been characterization of planetary systems in which multiple planets transit. After addressing the equations of motion and parameter scalings, the main dynamical mechanisms for TTV and TDV are described, with citations to the observational literature for real examples. Constraints on model parameters from timing are elucidated, particularly the origin of the mass/eccentricity degeneracy and how it is overcome by the high-frequency component of the signal. On the observational side, derivation of timing precision and introduction to the timing diagram are given. Science results are reviewed, with an emphasis on mass measurements in multi-transiting planetary systems, from which bulk compositions may be inferred. The progress being made in studying transit timing with TRAPPIST-1 and TESS multi-planet systems is reviewed, as well as what the future may hold.</description>

      <title>Circularly Polarized Gravitational Wave Background Search with a Network of Space-borne Triangular Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18916v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Circularly polarized gravitational wave backgrounds are predicted in many well-motivated models of inflation and phase transitions involving spontaneous parity violation. In this work, we investigate the detection of such parity-violating signals with the network of two space-borne triangular detectors. We derive the general analytical formula for the overlap reduction functions of networks composed of two triangular detectors, by exploiting the system's symmetrical properties under the long-wave approximation. Based on these results, we further assess the detectability of a parity-violating background with alternative LISA-Taiji network configurations. We find that the sensitivity to the parity-violating component can be significantly enhanced at low frequencies by adjusting the orientation of Taiji's constellation plane. This sensitivity gain is approximately an order of magnitude around the millihertz band, making the peak sensitivity comparable to that of the total intensity. This provides a promising opportunity to constrain various parity-violating theories in the millihertz band with upcoming space-borne detectors.</description>

      <title>gSeaGen code by KM3NeT: an efficient tool to propagate muons simulated with CORSIKA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24115v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The KM3NeT Collaboration has tackled a common challenge faced by the astroparticle physics community, namely adapting the experiment-specific simulation software to work with the CORSIKA air shower simulation output. The proposed solution is an extension of the open source code gSeaGen, which allows the transport of muons generated by CORSIKA to a detector of any size at an arbitrary depth. The gSeaGen code was not only extended in terms of functionality but also underwent a thorough redesign of the muon propagation routine, resulting in a more accurate and efficient simulation. This paper presents the capabilities of the new gSeaGen code as well as prospects for further developments.</description>

      <title>The MBTA Pipeline for Detecting Compact Binary Coalescences in the Fourth LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Observing Run</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04598v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we describe the Multi-Band Template Analysis (MBTA) search pipeline dedicated to the detection of compact binary coalescence (CBC) gravitational wave signals from the data obtained by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration (LVK) during the fourth observing run (O4), which started in May 2023. We give details on the configuration of the pipeline and its evolution compared to the third observing run (O3). We focus here on the configuration used for the offline results of the first part of the run (O4a), which are part of the GWTC-4 catalog (in preparation). We also give a brief summary of the online configuration and highlight some of the changes implemented or considered for the second part of O4 (O4b).</description>

      <title>Sampling the full hierarchical population posterior distribution in gravitational-wave astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12156v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a full sampling of the hierarchical population posterior distribution of merging black holes using current gravitational-wave data. We directly tackle the most relevant intrinsic parameter space made of the binary parameters (masses, spin magnitudes, spin directions, redshift) of all the events entering the GWTC-3 LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA catalog, as well as the hyperparameters of the underlying population of sources. This results in a parameter space of about 500 dimensions, in contrast with current investigations where the targeted dimensionality is drastically reduced by marginalizing over all single-event parameters. In particular, we have direct access to (i) population parameters, (ii) population-informed single-event parameters, and (iii) correlations between these two sets of parameters. We quantify the fractional contribution of each event to the constraints on the population hyperparameters. Our implementation relies on modern probabilistic programming languages and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, with a continuous interpolation of single-event posterior probabilities. Sampling the full hierarchical problem is feasible, as demonstrated here, and advantageous as it removes some (but not all) of the Monte Carlo integrations that enter the likelihood together with the related variances.</description>

      <title>Conditional Diffusion-Based Retrieval of Atmospheric CO2 from Earth Observing Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17074v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Satellite-based estimates of greenhouse gas (GHG) properties from observations of reflected solar spectra are integral for understanding and monitoring complex terrestrial systems and their impact on the carbon cycle due to their near global coverage. Known as retrieval, making GHG concentration estimations from these observations is a non-linear Bayesian inverse problem, which is operationally solved using a computationally expensive algorithm called Optimal Estimation (OE), providing a Gaussian approximation to a non-Gaussian posterior. This leads to issues in solver algorithm convergence, and to unrealistically confident uncertainty estimates for the retrieved quantities. Upcoming satellite missions will provide orders of magnitude more data than the current constellation of GHG observers. Development of fast and accurate retrieval algorithms with robust uncertainty quantification is critical. Doing so stands to provide substantial climate impact of moving towards the goal of near continuous real-time global monitoring of carbon sources and sinks which is essential for policy making. To achieve this goal, we propose a diffusion-based approach to flexibly retrieve a Gaussian or non-Gaussian posterior, for NASA's Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 spectrometer, while providing a substantial computational speed-up over the current operational state-of-the-art.</description>
