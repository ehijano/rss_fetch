      <title>Modal Decomposition and Identification for a Population of Structures Using Physics-Informed Graph Neural Networks and Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modal identification is crucial for structural health monitoring and structural control, providing critical insights into structural dynamics and performance. This study presents a novel deep learning framework that integrates graph neural networks (GNNs), transformers, and a physics-informed loss function to achieve modal decomposition and identification across a population of structures. The transformer module decomposes multi-degrees-of-freedom (MDOF) structural dynamic measurements into single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) modal responses, facilitating the identification of natural frequencies and damping ratios. Concurrently, the GNN captures the structural configurations and identifies mode shapes corresponding to the decomposed SDOF modal responses. The proposed model is trained in a purely physics-informed and unsupervised manner, leveraging modal decomposition theory and the independence of structural modes to guide learning without the need for labeled data. Validation through numerical simulations and laboratory experiments demonstrates its effectiveness in accurately decomposing dynamic responses and identifying modal properties from sparse structural dynamic measurements, regardless of variations in external loads or structural configurations. Comparative analyses against established modal identification techniques and model variations further underscore its superior performance, positioning it as a favorable approach for population-based structural health monitoring.</description>

      <title>Yield and Buckling Stress Limits in Topology Optimization of Multiscale Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents an extension of multiscale topology optimization by integrating both yield stress and local/global buckling considerations into the design process. Building upon established multiscale methodologies, we develop a new framework incorporating yield stress limits either as constraints or objectives alongside previously established local and global buckling constraints. This approach significantly refines the optimization process, ensuring that the resulting designs meet mechanical performance criteria and adhere to critical material yield constraints. First, we establish local density-dependent von Mises yield surfaces based on local yield estimates from homogenization-based analysis to predict the local yield limits of the homogenized materials. Then, these local Yield-based Load Factors (YLFs) are combined with local and global buckling criteria to obtain topology optimized designs that consider yield and buckling failure on all levels. This integration is crucial for the practical application of optimized structures in real-world scenarios, where material yield and stability behavior critically influence structural integrity and durability. Numerical examples demonstrate how optimized designs depend on the stiffness to yield ratio of the considered building material. Despite the foundational assumption of separation of scales, the de-homogenized structures, even at relatively coarse length scales, exhibit a high degree of agreement with the corresponding homogenized predictions.</description>

      <title>RDPP-TD: Reputation and Data Privacy-Preserving based Truth Discovery Scheme in Mobile Crowdsensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Truth discovery (TD) plays an important role in Mobile Crowdsensing (MCS). However, existing TD methods, including privacy-preserving TD approaches, estimate the truth by weighting only the data submitted in the current round, which often results in low data quality. Moreover, there is a lack of effective TD methods that preserve both reputation and data privacy. To address these issues, a Reputation and Data Privacy-Preserving based Truth Discovery (RDPP-TD) scheme is proposed to obtain high-quality data for MCS. The RDPP-TD scheme consists of two key approaches: a Reputation-based Truth Discovery (RTD) approach, which integrates the weight of current-round data with workers' reputation values to estimate the truth, thereby achieving more accurate results, and a Reputation and Data Privacy-Preserving (RDPP) approach, which ensures privacy preservation for sensing data and reputation values. First, the RDPP approach, when seamlessly integrated with RTD, can effectively evaluate the reliability of workers and their sensing data in a privacy-preserving manner. Second, the RDPP scheme supports reputation-based worker recruitment and rewards, ensuring high-quality data collection while incentivizing workers to provide accurate information. Comprehensive theoretical analysis and extensive experiments based on real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed RDPP-TD scheme provides strong privacy protection and improves data quality by up to 33.3%.</description>

      <title>Execution Welfare Across Solver-based DEXes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00738v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decentralized exchanges (DEXes) have evolved dramatically since the introduction of Automated Market Makers (AMMs). In recent years, solver-based protocols have emerged as an alternative venue aiming to introduce competition for routing, access to offchain liquidity, and thereby improve end-user execution. Currently, these solver auctions are hosted on opaque backends, and the extent of price improvement they provide to end users remains unclear.
  We conduct an empirical study of the execution welfare that these protocols bring to users by analyzing data across different asset profiles (USDC-WETH and PEPE-WETH). Our results indicate that, compared to vanilla routing through Uniswap V2 or V3, solver-based protocols effectively enhance execution welfare for end users on DEXes within certain trade size ranges. This effect is most pronounced with USDC-WETH, a short-tail asset, and somewhat less significant with PEPE-WETH, a long-tail asset.
  Additionally, we identify execution welfare discrepancies across solver-based platforms (e.g., CoWSwap, 1inchFusion, UniswapX), revealing potential inefficiencies due to solver market structure, variations in liquidity profile and inventory depth among solvers. These insights highlight both the advantages and challenges of solver-based trading, underscoring its role in improving execution outcomes while raising concerns about market concentration and competition dynamics.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Subspace via Probabilistic Principal Component Analysis for Characterizing Model Error</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19963v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a probabilistic model of subspaces based on the probabilistic principal component analysis (PCA). Given a sample of vectors in the embedding space -- commonly known as a snapshot matrix -- this method uses quantities derived from the probabilistic PCA to construct distributions of the sample matrix, as well as the principal subspaces. It is applicable to projection-based reduced-order modeling methods, such as proper orthogonal decomposition and related model reduction methods. The stochastic subspace thus constructed can be used, for example, to characterize model-form uncertainty in computational mechanics. The proposed method has multiple desirable properties: (1) it is naturally justified by the probabilistic PCA and has analytic forms for the induced random matrix models; (2) it satisfies linear constraints, such as boundary conditions of all kinds, by default; (3) it has only one hyperparameter, which significantly simplifies training; and (4) its algorithm is very easy to implement. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed method via several numerical examples in computational mechanics and structural dynamics.</description>

      <title>Implementation and Security Analysis of Cryptocurrencies Based on Ethereum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21367v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Blockchain technology has set off a wave of decentralization in the world since its birth. The trust system constructed by blockchain technology based on cryptography algorithm and computing power provides a practical and powerful solution to solve the trust problem in human society. In order to make more convenient use of the characteristics of blockchain and build applications on it, smart contracts appear. By defining some trigger automatic execution contracts, the application space of blockchain is expanded and the foundation for the rapid development of blockchain is laid. This is blockchain 2.0. However, the programmability of smart contracts also introduces vulnerabilities. In order to cope with the insufficient security guarantee of high-value application networks running on blockchain 2.0 and smart contracts, this article will be represented by Ethereum to introduce the technical details of understanding blockchain 2.0 and the operation principle of contract virtual machines, and explain how cryptocurrencies based on blockchain 2.0 are constructed and operated. The common security problems and solutions are also discussed. Based on relevant research and on-chain practice, this paper provides a complete and comprehensive perspective to understanding cryptocurrency technology based on blockchain 2.0 and provides a reference for building more secure cryptocurrency contracts.</description>

      <title>Auto.gov: Learning-based Governance for Decentralized Finance (DeFi)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.09551v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decentralized finance (DeFi) is an integral component of the blockchain ecosystem, enabling a range of financial activities through smart-contract-based protocols. Traditional DeFi governance typically involves manual parameter adjustments by protocol teams or token holder votes, and is thus prone to human bias and financial risks, undermining the system's integrity and security. While existing efforts aim to establish more adaptive parameter adjustment schemes, there remains a need for a governance model that is both more efficient and resilient to significant market manipulations. In this paper, we introduce "Auto$.$gov", a learning-based governance framework that employs a deep Qnetwork (DQN) reinforcement learning (RL) strategy to perform semi-automated, data-driven parameter adjustments. We create a DeFi environment with an encoded action-state space akin to the Aave lending protocol for simulation and testing purposes, where Auto$.$gov has demonstrated the capability to retain funds that would have otherwise been lost to price oracle attacks. In tests with real-world data, Auto$.$gov outperforms the benchmark approaches by at least 14% and the static baseline model by tenfold, in terms of the preset performance metric--protocol profitability. Overall, the comprehensive evaluations confirm that Auto$.$gov is more efficient and effective than traditional governance methods, thereby enhancing the security, profitability, and ultimately, the sustainability of DeFi protocols.</description>
