      <title>xDevSM: Streamlining xApp Development With a Flexible Framework for O-RAN E2 Service Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: RAN Intelligent Controllers (RICs) are programmable platforms that enable data-driven closed-loop control in the O-RAN architecture. They collect telemetry and data from the RAN, process it in custom applications, and enforce control or new configurations on the RAN. Such custom applications in the Near-Real-Time (RT) RIC are called xApps, and enable a variety of use cases related to radio resource management. Despite numerous open-source and commercial projects focused on the Near-RT RIC, developing and testing xApps that are interoperable across multiple RAN implementations is a time-consuming and technically challenging process. This is primarily caused by the complexity of the protocol of the E2 interface, which enables communication between the RIC and the RAN while providing a high degree of flexibility, with multiple Service Models (SMs) providing plug-and-play functionalities such as data reporting and RAN control. In this paper, we propose xDevSM, an open-source flexible framework for O-RAN service models, aimed at simplifying xApp development for the O-RAN Software Community (OSC) Near-RT RIC. xDevSM reduces the complexity of the xApp development process, allowing developers to focus on the control logic of their xApps and moving the logic of the E2 service models behind simple Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). We demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework by deploying and testing xApps across various RAN software platforms, including OpenAirInterface and srsRAN. This framework significantly facilitates the development and validation of solutions and algorithms on O-RAN networks, including the testing of data-driven solutions across multiple RAN implementations.</description>

      <title>Joint Mobile Cell Positioning and Scheduler Selection in Locations Characterised by Substantial Obstacles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Positioning a mobile cell in a seaport environment presents unique challenges due to the high density of User Equipments (UEs) and obstacles causing shadowing effects. This paper addresses the problem of optimal positioning for a mobile cell within a defined area containing UEs, fixed cells, and obstacles. By formulating an optimisation problem, we consider variables including user associations and different types of scheduling for packet transmission. The mobile cell wireless backhaul is designed to meet the total capacity requirements of the UEs it serves, based on the optimal positioning determined by our solution approach. Using a Genetic Algorithm (GA) solver, we achieve significant gains, with objective capacity improvements of up to 200% for the 90th percentile. The proposed solution enhances network performance, especially in scenarios requiring increased capacity for emergency situations.</description>

      <title>NetScaNDN: A Scalable and Flexible Testbed To Evaluate NDN on Multiple Infrastructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution from traditional IP-based networking to Named Data Networking (NDN) represents a paradigm shift to address the inherent limitations of current network architectures, such as scalability, mobility, and efficient data distribution. NDN introduces an information-centric approach where data is identified and retrieved based on names rather than locations, offering more efficient data dissemination and enhanced security. However, the transition to NDN, alongside the need to integrate it with existing IP infrastructures, necessitates the development of flexible and scalable testbeds that support diverse experimental scenarios across various physical media and networking protocol stacks.
  In this paper, we present NetScaNDN, a scalable, flexible, and plug-and-play testbed designed to facilitate such experiments. NetScaNDNl employs an automated process for node discovery, configuration, and installation, enabling seamless setup and execution of experiments on both wired and wireless infrastructures simultaneously. Additionally, it incorporates a central log repository using the syslog protocol, allowing comprehensive measurement and evaluation of user-defined metrics across different network layers. NetScaNDN offers a robust platform for researchers to explore and validate various networking scenarios, advancing the study of IP and NDN-based applications.</description>

      <title>Asynchronous Fractional Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning for Age-Minimal Mobile Edge Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the realm of emerging real-time networked applications like cyber-physical systems (CPS), the Age of Information (AoI) has merged as a pivotal metric for evaluating the timeliness. To meet the high computational demands, such as those in intelligent manufacturing within CPS, mobile edge computing (MEC) presents a promising solution for optimizing computing and reducing AoI. In this work, we study the timeliness of computational-intensive updates and explores jointly optimize the task updating and offloading policies to minimize AoI. Specifically, we consider edge load dynamics and formulate a task scheduling problem to minimize the expected time-average AoI. The fractional objective introduced by AoI and the semi-Markov game nature of the problem render this challenge particularly difficult, with existing approaches not directly applicable. To this end, we present a comprehensive framework to fractional reinforcement learning (RL). We first introduce a fractional single-agent RL framework and prove its linear convergence. We then extend this to a fractional multi-agent RL framework with a convergence analysis. To tackle the challenge of asynchronous control in semi-Markov game, we further design an asynchronous model-free fractional multi-agent RL algorithm, where each device makes scheduling decisions with the hybrid action space without knowing the system dynamics and decisions of other devices. Experimental results show that our proposed algorithms reduce the average AoI by up to 52.6% compared with the best baseline algorithm in our experiments.</description>

      <title>Bridge to Real Environment with Hardware-in-the-loop for Wireless Artificial Intelligence Paradigms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nowadays, many machine learning (ML) solutions to improve the wireless standard IEEE802.11p for Vehicular Adhoc Network (VANET) are commonly evaluated in the simulated world. At the same time, this approach could be cost-effective compared to real-world testing due to the high cost of vehicles. There is a risk of unexpected outcomes when these solutions are implemented in the real world, potentially leading to wasted resources. To mitigate this challenge, the hardware-in-the-loop is the way to move forward as it enables the opportunity to test in the real world and simulated worlds together. Therefore, we have developed what we believe is the pioneering hardware-in-the-loop for testing artificial intelligence, multiple services, and HD map data (LiDAR), in both simulated and real-world settings.</description>

      <title>Space-Based Quantum Internet: Entanglement Distribution in Time-Varying LEO Constellations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the complexities of entanglement distribution in LEO satellite networks, particularly those arising from their dynamic topology. Traditional static and dynamic entanglement distribution methods often result in high entanglement drop rates and reduced end-to-end throughput. We introduce a novel framework that leverages the dynamic nature of LEO satellite networks to enhance entanglement distribution efficiency. Employing a space-time graph model to represent the network's temporal evolution, we propose an entanglement distribution strategy based on path utility, incorporating pointing errors, non-ideal link transmittance for intersatellite links, and atmospheric effects for downlinks. Our approach demonstrates superior performance in reducing entanglement drop rates and improving throughput compared to conventional methods. This study advances the field of quantum communication in satellite networks, offering resilient and efficient entanglement distribution strategies that support practical applications such as distributed computing, quantum multipartite cryptography, and distributed quantum sensing. The findings underscore the potential of integrating dynamic satellite networks with quantum technologies to create a reliable and secure quantum internet.</description>

      <title>Predictive Covert Communication Against Multi-UAV Surveillance Using Graph Koopman Autoencoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low Probability of Detection (LPD) communication aims to obscure the presence of radio frequency (RF) signals to evade surveillance. In the context of mobile surveillance utilizing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), achieving LPD communication presents significant challenges due to the UAVs' rapid and continuous movements, which are characterized by unknown nonlinear dynamics. Therefore, accurately predicting future locations of UAVs is essential for enabling real-time LPD communication. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework termed predictive covert communication, aimed at minimizing detectability in terrestrial ad-hoc networks under multi-UAV surveillance. Our data-driven method synergistically integrates graph neural networks (GNN) with Koopman theory to model the complex interactions within a multi-UAV network and facilitating long-term predictions by linearizing the dynamics, even with limited historical data. Extensive simulation results substantiate that the predicted trajectories using our method result in at least 63%-75% lower probability of detection when compared to well-known state-of-the-art baseline approaches, showing promise in enabling low-latency covert operations in practical scenarios.</description>

      <title>Learning with Dynamics: Autonomous Regulation of UAV Based Communication Networks with Dynamic UAV Crew</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) based communication networks (UCNs) are a key component in future mobile networking. To handle the dynamic environments in UCNs, reinforcement learning (RL) has been a promising solution attributed to its strong capability of adaptive decision-making free of the environment models. However, most existing RL-based research focus on control strategy design assuming a fixed set of UAVs. Few works have investigated how UCNs should be adaptively regulated when the serving UAVs change dynamically. This article discusses RL-based strategy design for adaptive UCN regulation given a dynamic UAV set, addressing both reactive strategies in general UCNs and proactive strategies in solar-powered UCNs. An overview of the UCN and the RL framework is first provided. Potential research directions with key challenges and possible solutions are then elaborated. Some of our recent works are presented as case studies to inspire innovative ways to handle dynamic UAV crew with different RL algorithms.</description>

      <title>Semi-Supervised Learning Approach for Efficient Resource Allocation with Network Slicing in O-RAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08861v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces an innovative approach to the resource allocation problem, aiming to coordinate multiple independent x-applications (xAPPs) for network slicing and resource allocation in the Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN). Our approach maximizes the weighted throughput among user equipment (UE) and allocates physical resource blocks (PRBs). We prioritize two service types: enhanced Mobile Broadband and Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communication. Two xAPPs have been designed to achieve this: a power control xAPP for each UE and a PRB allocation xAPP. The method consists of a two-part training phase. The first part uses supervised learning with a Variational Autoencoder trained to regress the power transmission, UE association, and PRB allocation decisions, and the second part uses unsupervised learning with a contrastive loss approach to improve the generalization and robustness of the model. We evaluate the performance by comparing its results to those obtained from an exhaustive search and deep Q-network algorithms and reporting performance metrics for the regression task. The results demonstrate the superior efficiency of this approach in different scenarios among the service types, reaffirming its status as a more efficient and effective solution for network slicing problems compared to state-of-the-art methods. This innovative approach not only sets our research apart but also paves the way for exciting future advancements in resource allocation in O-RAN.</description>

      <title>DarkDNS: Revisiting the Value of Rapid Zone Update</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12010v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Malicious actors exploit the DNS namespace to launch spam campaigns, phishing attacks, malware, and other harmful activities. Combating these threats requires visibility into domain existence, ownership and nameservice activity that the DNS protocol does not itself provide. To facilitate visibility and security-related study of the expanding gTLD namespace, ICANN introduced the Centralized Zone Data Service (CZDS) that shares daily zone file snapshots of new gTLD zones. However, a remarkably high concentration of malicious activity is associated with domains that do not live long enough make it into these daily snapshots. Using public and private sources of newly observed domains, we discover that even with the best available data there is a considerable visibility gap in detecting short-lived domains. We find that the daily snapshots miss at least 1% of newly registered and short-lived domains, which are frequently registered with likely malicious intent. In reducing this critical visibility gap using public sources of data, we demonstrate how more timely access to TLD zone changes can provide valuable data to better prevent abuse. We hope that this work sparks a discussion in the community on how to effectively and safely revive the concept of sharing Rapid Zone Updates for security research. Finally, we release a public live feed of newly registered domains, with the aim of enabling further research in abuse identification.</description>

      <title>GenOnet: Generative Open xG Network Simulation with Multi-Agent LLM and ns-3</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13781v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The move toward Sixth-Generation (6G) networks relies on open interfaces and protocols for seamless interoperability across devices, vendors, and technologies. In this context, open 6G development involves multiple disciplines and requires advanced simulation approaches for testing. In this demo paper, we propose a generative simulation approach based on a multi-agent Large Language Model (LLM) and Network Simulator 3 (ns-3), called Generative Open xG Network Simulation (GenOnet), to effectively generate, debug, execute, and interpret simulated Open Fifth-Generation (5G) environments. The first version of GenOnet application represents a specialized adaptation of the OpenAI GPT models. It incorporates supplementary tools, agents, 5G standards, and seamless integration with ns-3 simulation capabilities, supporting both C++ variants and Python implementations. This release complies with the latest Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) and 3GPP standards.</description>

      <title>An Alternative to Multi-Factor Authentication with a Triple-Identity Authentication Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19459v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The existing authentication system has two entry points (i.e., username and password fields) to interact with the outside, but neither of them has a gatekeeper, making the system vulnerable to cyberattacks. In order to ensure the authentication security, the system sets a third entry point and use an external MFA service to guard it. The crux of the problem is that the system has no internal mechanism to guard its own entry points as no identifiers can be defined for the username and password without using any personal information. To solve this problem, we open the hash algorithm of a dual-password login-authentication system to three login credentials. Therefore, the intermediate elements of the algorithm can be used to define an identifier to verify the user identity at each entry point of the system. As a result of the above setup, a triple-identity authentication is established, the key of which is that the readily available user's login name and password are randomly converted into a matrix of meaningless hash elements which are concealed, incommunicable, inaccessible, and independent of personal information. So the identifiers defined using such elements can be used by the system to verify the identities of the user at all the entry points of the system, thereby ensuring the authentication security without relying on MFA services.</description>
