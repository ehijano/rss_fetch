      <title>Multiple mixing and fractional cohomological equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08392v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of the (multiple) fractional cohomological equation and, by studying its solutions, develop a novel framework to obtain the decay of matrix coefficients for partially hyperbolic algebraic actions. In particular, we show that mere partial H\"older regularity of \(L^2\) vectors is sufficient for exponential decay of matrix coefficients.
  As an application, under the assumption of ergodicity, we obtain explicit and sharp exponential mixing rates of all orders for a large class of partially hyperbolic algebraic actions. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of irrational automorphisms on nilmanifolds and prove that these automorphisms exhibit super-exponential mixing of all orders, marking the first such example in the literature.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Reduced Order Modelling of Discrete-Time Systems with Input-Output Dead Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While many acoustic systems are well-modelled by linear time-invariant dynamical systems, high-fidelity models often become computationally expensive due the complexity of dynamics. Reduced order modelling techniques, such as the Eigensystem Realization Algorithm (ERA), can be used to create efficient surrogate models from measurement data, particularly impulse responses. However, practical challenges remain, including the presence of input-output dead times, i.e. propagation delays, in the data, which can increase model order and introduce artifacts like pre-ringing. This paper introduces an improved technique for the extraction of dead times, by formulating a linear program to separate input and output dead times from the data. Additionally, the paper presents an adaptive randomized ERA pipeline that leverages recent advances in numerical linear algebra to reduce computational complexity and enabling scalable model reduction. Benchmarking on large-scale datasets of measured room impulse responses demonstrates that the propsed dead time extraction scheme yields more accurate and efficient reduced order models compared to previous approaches. The implementation is made available as open-source Python code, facilitating reproducibility and further research.</description>

      <title>Solvability of the Korteweg-de Vries equation under meromorphic initial conditions by quadrature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the solvability of the Korteweg-de Vries equation under meromorphic initial conditions by quadrature when the inverse scattering transform (IST) is applied. It is a key to solve the Schr\"odinger equation appearing in the Lax pair in application of the IST. We show that the Schr\"odinger equation is always integrable in the sense of differential Galois theory, i.e., solvable by quadrature, if and only if the meromporphic potential is reflectionless, under the condition that the potential is absolutely integrable on $\mathbb{R}\setminus(-R_0,R_0)$ for some $R_0&gt;0$.This statement was previously proved to be true by the author for a limited class of potentials. We also show that the Schr\"odinger equation is not integrable in this sense for rational potentials that decay at infinity but do not satisfy the weak condition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discrete part of the Markoff spectrum on the 6th Hecke group $\mathbf H_6$ was known by A. Schmidt. In this paper, we study the Markoff and Lagrange spectra on $\mathbf H_6$ after the smallest accumulation point $4/\sqrt{3}$. We show that both spectra below $4/\sqrt{3} + \epsilon$ have positive Hausdorff dimension for any positive $\epsilon$. We also find maximal gaps and an isolated point in the spectra.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08481v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We exhibit a family of second-order hyperbolic differential operators presenting spectral transition of the Hamilton map. As a consequence we prove that the Cauchy problem is not locally solvable at the origin in Gevrey classes of order greater than some fixed value. The main feature of these operators is that they may all have bicharacteristics tangent to the double manifold.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Higher-Order Dynamic Equation with Polynomial Growth and Mixed Boundary Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the existence of solutions for a class of nonlinear higher-order dynamic equations subject to mixed boundary conditions. We consider boundary value problems in which the nonlinear reaction functions satisfy polynomial growth conditions both in the interior of the domain and on the boundary. Our analysis employs a systematic approach based on fixed-point theorems for expansive mappings combined with completely continuous operators to establish stronger existence results. Under appropriate growth conditions on the nonlinear terms, we first prove the existence of at least one classical solution, which is not guaranteed to be nonnegative. We then strengthen our hypotheses to establish the existence of at least three nonnegative solutions. The theoretical framework relies on cone theory and carefully constructed open bounded subsets within function spaces equipped with appropriate norms. Our methodology provides a unified approach to multiple solution problems for higher-order</description>

      <title>Enhancing generalizability of model discovery across parameter space with multi-experiment equation learning (ME-EQL)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Agent-based modeling (ABM) is a powerful tool for understanding self-organizing biological systems, but it is computationally intensive and often not analytically tractable. Equation learning (EQL) methods can derive continuum models from ABM data, but they typically require extensive simulations for each parameter set, raising concerns about generalizability. In this work, we extend EQL to Multi-experiment equation learning (ME-EQL) by introducing two methods: one-at-a-time ME-EQL (OAT ME-EQL), which learns individual models for each parameter set and connects them via interpolation, and embedded structure ME-EQL (ES ME-EQL), which builds a unified model library across parameters. We demonstrate these methods using a birth--death mean-field model and an on-lattice agent-based model of birth, death, and migration with spatial structure. Our results show that both methods significantly reduce the relative error in recovering parameters from agent-based simulations, with OAT ME-EQL offering better generalizability across parameter space. Our findings highlight the potential of equation learning from multiple experiments to enhance the generalizability and interpretability of learned models for complex biological systems.</description>

      <title>On the connectedness of the singular set of holomorphic foliations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08942v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a codimension 1 singular holomorphic foliation on $\mathbb{P}^3$ and let $Z$ be the union of the 1-dimensional connected components of its singular set; Dominique Cerveau asked in 2013 whether $Z$ is necessarily connected. We prove that if a $k$-dimensional holomorphic foliation on a projective manifold whose determinant bundle of the normal sheaf is ample has a singular set $Z$ of dimension $k-1$, then $Z$ is connected. This can be regarded as providing an obstruction for the integrability of singular holomorphic distributions in the spirit of Bott's work.</description>

      <title>Mixed phases in feedback Ising models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study mean-field Ising models whose coupling depends on the magnetization via a feedback function. We identify mixed phases (MPs) and show that they can be stable at zero temperature for sufficiently strong feedback. Moreover, stable MPs are always super-stable with perturbation decaying linearly in time. We argue that such feedback Ising models (FIMs) provide a useful framework for phase transformations between aligned phases via stable and unstable intermediate phases in multistable systems. We also analyze the dynamical behavior of FIMs driven by a time-varying magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Dispersal-induced growth or decay in a time-periodic environment. The case of reducible migration matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07553v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is a follow-up to a previous work where we considered populations with time-varying growth rates living in patches and irreducible migration matrix between the patches. Each population, when isolated, would become extinct. Dispersal-induced growth (DIG) occurs when the populations are able to persist and grow exponentially when dispersal among the populations is present. In this paper, we consider the situation where the migration matrix is not necessarily irreducible. We provide a mathematical analysis of the DIG phenomenon, in the context of a deterministic model with periodic variation of growth rates and migration. Our results apply in the case, important for applications, where there is migration in one direction in one season and in the other direction in another season. We also consider dispersal-induced decay (DID), where each population, when isolated, grows exponentially, while populations die out when dispersal between populations is present.</description>

      <title>Deciphering culprits for cyanobacterial blooms and lake vulnerability in north-temperate lakes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20757v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Harmful cyanobacterial blooms (CBs) are increasingly prevalent worldwide, posing significant environmental and health concerns. We derive a stoichiometric model describing the population dynamics and toxicity of cyanobacteria in north-temperate freshwater ecosystems. Our model quantifies the hypoxic effects of CBs on fish mortality and evaluates the impact of microcystin-LR (MC-LR) on aquatic macro-invertebrates, phytoplankton, and fish species. Analyzing data from diverse north-temperate lakes with varying physical characteristics, we identify eutrophication as a pivotal catalyst in bloom proliferation. Under predicted warming scenarios coupled with increased eutrophication, peak MC-LR concentrations will surge dramatically, and blooms will occur earlier in the year. We uncover severe bioaccumulation of MC-LR in higher trophic species; the response to CBs among fish at intermediate trophic levels was heterogeneous across lakes. We compare our model against observations from several north-temperate lakes, demonstrating its robustness and applicability. Our insights are critical for informing targeted interventions to mitigate CBs.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we establish the quasi-compactness of the transfer operator associated with skew product systems that are semi-conjugate to piecewise convex maps with a countably infinite number of branches. These non-invertible skew products admit discontinuities, with the critical set confined to a countable collection of fibers. Furthermore, we demonstrate that such systems possess an invariant measure whose disintegration along the fibers exhibits bounded variation; a concept introduced and developed in this work.</description>

      <title>On the holomorphic foliations admitting a common invariant algebraic set</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11172v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the holomorphic foliations admitting a common invariant algebraic set $C$ defined by a polynomial $f$ in $ \mathbb{K}[x_1,x_2,...,x_n]$ over any characteristic $0$ subfield $\mathbb{K}\subseteq\mathbb{C}$. For the $\mathbb{K}[x_1,x_2,...,x_n]$-module $V_f$ of vector fields inducing foliations admitting $C$ as an invariant set, we present several conditions for $V_f$ to be freely generated by $n$ generators. In particular, when $n=2$ and $f$ is a weakly tame polynomial, we show that the $\mathbb{K}[x,y]$-module $V_f$ is freely generated by two polynomial vector fields, one of which is the Hamiltonian vector field induced by $f$, if and only if, $f$ belongs to the Jacobian ideal $\langle f_x, f_y\rangle$ in $\mathbb{K}[x,y]$. Our proof employs a purely elementary method.</description>

      <title>Identifiable specializations for ODE models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.16273v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The parameter identifiability problem for a dynamical system is to determine whether the parameters of the system can be found from data for the outputs of the system. Verifying whether the parameters are identifiable is a necessary first step before a meaningful parameter estimation can take place. Non-identifiability occurs in practical models. To reparametrize a model to achieve identifiability is a challenge. The existing approaches have been shown to be useful for many important examples. However, these approaches are either limited to linear models and scaling parametrizations or are not guaranteed to find a reparametrization even if it exists. In the present paper, we prove that there always exists a locally identifiable model with the same input-output behaviour as the original one obtained from a given one by a partial specialization of the parameters. As an extra feature of our approach, the resulting (at least) locally identifiable reparameterization has the same shape: the monomials in the new state variables in the new model are formed in the same way as in the original model. Furthermore, we give a sufficient observability condition for the existence of a state space transformation from the original model to the new one. Our proof is constructive and can be translated to an algorithm, which we illustrate by several examples.</description>

      <title>Algorithm to find new identifiable reparametrizations of parametric rational ODE models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03057v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Structural identifiability concerns the question of which unknown parameters of a model can be recovered from (perfect) input-output data. If all of the parameters of a model can be recovered from data, the model is said to be identifiable. However, in many models, there are parameters that can take on an infinite number of values but yield the same input-output data. In this case, those parameters and the model are called unidentifiable. The question is then what to do with an unidentifiable model. One can try to add more input-output data or decrease the number of unknown parameters, if experimentally feasible, or try to find a reparametrization to make the model identifiable. In this paper, we take the latter approach. While existing approaches to find identifiable reparametrizations were limited to scaling reparametrizations or were not guaranteed to find a globally identifiable reparametrization even if it exists, we significantly broaden the class of models for which we can find a globally identifiable model with the same input-output behavior as the original one. We also prove that, for linear models, a globally identifiable reparametrization always exists and show that, for a certain class of linear compartmental models, with and without inputs, an explicit reparametrization formula exists. We illustrate our method on several examples and provide detailed analysis in supplementary material on github.</description>

Abstract: In this informal expository note, we quickly introduce and survey compactifications of strata of holomorphic 1-forms on Riemann surfaces, i.e. spaces of translation surfaces. In the last decade, several of these have been constructed, studied, and successfully applied to problems. We discuss relations between their definitions and properties, focusing on the different notions of convergence from a flat geometric perspective.</description>

      <title>Zariski dense non-tempered subgroups in higher rank of nearly optimal growth</title>

Abstract: We construct the first example of a Zariski-dense, discrete, non-lattice subgroup $\Gamma_0$ of a higher rank simple Lie group $G$, which is non-tempered in the sense that the quasi-regular representation $L^2(\Gamma_0\backslash G)$ is non-tempered. More precisely, let $n\ge 3$ and let $\Gamma$ be the fundamental group of a closed hyperbolic $n$-manifold that contains a properly embedded totally geodesic hyperplane. We show that there exists a non-empty open subset $\mathcal O$ of $\operatorname{Hom}(\Gamma, \operatorname{SO}(n,2))$ such that for any $\sigma\in \mathcal O$, the subgroup $\sigma(\Gamma)$ is a Zariski-dense and non-tempered Anosov subgroup of $\operatorname{SO}(n,2)$. In addition, the growth indicator of $\sigma(\Gamma)$ is nearly optimal: it almost realizes the supremum of growth indicators among all non-lattice discrete subgroups, a bound imposed by property $(T)$ of $\operatorname{SO}(n,2)$.</description>

      <title>Continuous Temporal Learning of Probability Distributions via Neural ODEs with Applications in Continuous Glucose Monitoring Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08698</link>

Abstract: Modeling the dynamics of probability distributions from time-dependent data samples is a fundamental problem in many fields, including digital health. The goal is to analyze how the distribution of a biomarker, such as glucose, changes over time and how these changes may reflect the progression of chronic diseases like diabetes. We introduce a probabilistic model based on a Gaussian mixture that captures the evolution of a continuous-time stochastic process. Our approach combines a non-parametric estimate of the distribution, obtained with Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), and a Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (Neural ODE) that governs the temporal evolution of the mixture weights. The model is highly interpretable, detects subtle distribution shifts, and remains computationally efficient. Simulation studies show that our method matches or surpasses the estimation accuracy of state-of-the-art, less interpretable techniques such as normalizing flows and non-parametric kernel density estimators. We further demonstrate its utility using data from a digital clinical trial, revealing how interventions affect the time-dependent distribution of glucose levels. The proposed method enables rigorous comparisons between control and treatment groups from both mathematical and clinical perspectives, offering novel longitudinal characterizations that existing approaches cannot achieve.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of rotationally invariant polynomial root sets under iterated differentiations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06263v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We associate to an $N$-sample of a given rotationally invariant probability measure $\mu_0$ with compact support in the complex plane, a polynomial $P_N$ with roots given by the sample. Then, for $t \in (0,1)$, we consider the empirical measure $\mu_t^{N}$ associated to the root set of the $\lfloor t N\rfloor$-th derivative of $P_N$. A question posed by O'Rourke and Steinerberger [21], reformulated as a conjecture by Hoskins and Kabluchko [10], and recently reaffirmed by Campbell, O'Rourke and Renfrew [5], states that under suitable conditions of regularity on $\mu_0$, for an i.i.d. sample, $\mu_t^{N}$ converges to a rotationally invariant probability measure $\mu_t$ when $N$ tends to infinity, and that $(1-t)\mu_t$ has a radial density $x \mapsto \psi(x,t)$ satisfying the following partial differential equation:
  \begin{equation} \label{PDErotational}
  \frac{ \partial \psi(x,t) }{\partial t} = \frac{ \partial}{\partial x} \left( \frac{ \psi(x,t) }{ \frac{1}{x} \int_0^x \psi(y,t) dy } \right).
  \end{equation} In [10], this equation is reformulated as an equation on the distribution function $\Psi_t$ of the radial part of $(1-t) \mu_t$: \begin{equation} \label{equationPsixtabstract} \frac{\partial \Psi_t (x)}{\partial t} = x \frac{\frac{\partial \Psi_t (x)}{\partial x} } {\Psi_t(x)} - 1. \end{equation} Restricting our study to a specific family of $N$-samplings, we are able to prove a variant of the conjecture above. We also emphasize the important differences between the two-dimensional setting and the one-dimensional setting, illustrated in our Theorem 2.1.</description>
