      <title>Construct to Commitment: The Effect of Narratives on Economic Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study how government-led narratives through mass media evolve from construct, a mechanism for framing expectations, into commitment, a sustainable pillar for growth. We propose the ``Narratives-Construct-Commitment (NCC)" framework outlining the mechanism and institutionalization of narratives, and formalize it as a dynamic Bayesian game. Using the Innovation-Driven Development Strategy (2016) as a case study, we identify the narrative shock from high-frequency financial data and trace its impact using local projection method. By shaping expectations, credible narratives institutionalize investment incentives, channel resources into R\&amp;D, and facilitate sustained improvements in total factor productivity (TFP). Our findings strive to provide insights into the New Quality Productive Forces initiative, highlighting the role of narratives in transforming vision into tangible economic growth.</description>

      <title>Economic Inequality between Groups in an a priori Stratified Society</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an agent-based model of economic exchange in a society composed of two groups, representing two social groups and with different internal protection rules for the poor agents. The goal is to address the emerging wealth distribution when economic rules are not the same for all individuals. Individuals exchange wealth in pairwise interactions with no underlying lattice. The wealth, risk aversion factor, and group of the agents characterize their state. The wealth exchanged between two agents obeys a fair rule: the quantities put at stake by them are the same regardless of who wins. One agent can interact with another agent in the same or the other group, controlled by a rate which is a parameter of the model. Inter-group exchanges obey an exclusive protection rule, which can be understood as a public policy to reduce inequality. We show that the most protected group accumulates more wealth, has less inequality, and has higher mobility than the other group. The results of simulations are compared with income distribution in Brazil discriminated by race as an example of the application our model.</description>

      <title>Time-dependent influence metric for cascade dynamics on networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16978v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An algorithm for efficiently calculating the expected size of single-seed cascade dynamics on networks is proposed and tested. The expected size is a time-dependent quantity and so enables the identification of nodes who are the most influential early or late in the spreading process. The measure is accurate for both critical and subcritical dynamic regimes and so generalises the nonbacktracking centrality that was previously shown to successfully identify the most influential single spreaders in a model of critical epidemics on networks.</description>

      <title>Temporal network restructuring improves control of indecisive collectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06912v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Controlling multi-agent systems is a persistent challenge in organismal, robotic and social collectives, especially when agents exhibit stochastic indecisiveness -- frequently switching between conflicting behavioral rules. Here, we investigate the control of such noisy indecisive collectives through the lens of century-old sheepdog trials, where small groups of sheep exhibit unpredictable switching between fleeing and following behaviors. Unlike cohesive large flocks, these small indecisive groups are difficult to control, yet skilled dog-handler teams excel at both herding and precisely splitting them (shedding) on demand. Using a stochastic model, we introduce two central parameters -- pressure (stimulus intensity) and lightness (response isotropy) -- to simulate and quantify herding and shedding dynamics. Surprisingly, we find that stochastic indecisiveness, typically perceived as a challenge, can be leveraged as a critical tool for efficient control, enabling controlled herding and splitting of noisy groups. Building on these insights, we develop the Indecisive Swarm Algorithm (ISA) for artificial agents and benchmark its performance against standard algorithms, including the Averaging-Based Swarm Algorithm (ASA) and the Leader-Follower Swarm Algorithm (LFSA). ISA minimizes control energy in trajectory-following tasks, outperforming alternatives under noisy conditions. By framing these results within a stochastic temporal network framework, we show that even with a probabilistic description of the future dynamics, network restructuring (temporality) enhances control efficiency in a specific class of control problems. These insights establish a scalable framework for controlling noisy, behavior-switching collectives, with applications in swarm robotics, cellular engineering, opinion dynamics, and temporal networks.</description>

      <title>Topological Graph Simplification Solutions to the Street Intersection Miscount Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00258v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Street intersection counts and densities are ubiquitous measures in transport geography and planning. However, typical street network data and typical street network analysis tools can substantially overcount them. This article explains the three main reasons why this happens and presents solutions to each. It contributes algorithms to automatically simplify spatial graphs of urban street networks -- via edge simplification and node consolidation -- resulting in faster parsimonious models and more accurate network measures like intersection counts and densities, street segment lengths, and node degrees. These algorithms' information compression improves downstream graph analytics' memory and runtime efficiency, boosting analytical tractability without loss of model fidelity. Finally, this article validates these algorithms and empirically assesses intersection count biases worldwide to demonstrate the problem's widespread prevalence. Without consolidation, traditional methods would overestimate the median urban area intersection count by 14\%. However, this bias varies drastically across regions, underscoring these algorithms' importance for consistent comparative empirical analyses.</description>

      <title>Complex networks approach to curriculum analysis and subject integration: a case study on Physics and Mathematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15929v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a methodological approach based on the use of complex networks to analyze the structure and content of curricula. We analyze the concept network built from the final year of a particular high school Physics curriculum, as well as that of Mathematics. We examine the most central nodes in each case, the community structures (coherent units or groupings), and the changes that occurred when the network was considered in isolation or integrated with Mathematics. The results show that the integrated Physics and Mathematics network has a higher average degree compared to the individual networks, driven by numerous interdisciplinary connections. The modularity analysis indicates similarities with the original curriculum layout, but also interesting differences that may suggest alternative ways of organizing the content. The differences between separated and integrated networks also highlights the prominence of certain key concepts.</description>

      <title>Zero-determinant strategies in repeated continuously-relaxed games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11219v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mixed extension has played an important role in game theory, especially in the proof of the existence of Nash equilibria in strategic form games. Mixed extension can be regarded as continuous relaxation of a strategic form game. Recently, in repeated games, a class of behavior strategies, called zero-determinant strategies, was introduced. Zero-determinant strategies control payoffs of players by unilaterally enforcing linear relations between payoffs. There are many attempts to extend zero-determinant strategies so as to apply them to broader situations. Here, we extend zero-determinant strategies to repeated games where action sets of players in stage game are continuously relaxed. We see that continuous relaxation broadens the range of possible zero-determinant strategies, compared to the original repeated games. Furthermore, we introduce a special type of zero-determinant strategies, called one-point zero-determinant strategies, which repeat only one continuously-relaxed action in all rounds. By investigating several examples, we show that some property of mixed-strategy Nash equilibria can be reinterpreted as a payoff-control property of one-point zero-determinant strategies.</description>

      <title>Statistically validated projection of bipartite signed networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08567v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bipartite networks provide a major insight into the organisation of many real-world systems. One of the most relevant issues encountered when modelling a bipartite network is that of facing the information shortage concerning intra-layer linkages. In the present contribution, we propose an unsupervised algorithm to obtain statistically validated projections of bipartite signed networks, according to which any two nodes sharing a statistically significant number of concordant (discordant) relationships are connected by a positive (negative) edge. Our algorithm outputs a matrix of link-specific $p-$values, from which a validated projection can be obtained upon running a multiple-hypothesis testing procedure. After testing our method on synthetic configurations output by a fully controllable generative model, we apply it to several real-world configurations: in all cases, non-trivial mesoscopic structures, induced by relationships that cannot be traced back to the constraints defining the employed benchmarks, hence revealing genuine traces of self-organisation, are detected.</description>

      <title>Structural predictability of large-scale aircraft interaction networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07649v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Complex network theory has recently been proposed as a promising tool for characterising interactions between aircraft, and their downstream effects. We here explore the problem of networks' topological predictability, i.e. the dependence of their structure on the traffic level, but the apparent absence of significant inter-day variability. By considering smaller spatial scales, we show that the sub-networks corresponding to individual FIRs are highly heterogeneous and of low predictability; this is nevertheless modulated by the structure of airways, and specifically by the complexity in airspace usage. We further discuss initial results of the evolution of such properties across multiple spatial scales; and draw conclusions on the operational implications, specifically on efforts to limit downstream effects.</description>

      <title>Systemic risk mitigation in supply chains through network rewiring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12955v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The networked nature of supply chains makes them susceptible to systemic risk, where local firm failures can propagate through firm interdependencies that can lead to cascading supply chain disruptions. The systemic risk of supply chains can be quantified and is closely related to the topology and dynamics of supply chain networks (SCN). How different network properties contribute to this risk remains unclear. Here, we ask whether systemic risk can be significantly reduced by strategically rewiring supplier-customer links. In doing so, we understand the role of specific endogenously emerged network structures and to what extent the observed systemic risk is a result of fundamental properties of the dynamical system. We minimize systemic risk through rewiring by employing a method from statistical physics that respects firm-level constraints to production. Analyzing six specific subnetworks of the national SCNs of Ecuador and Hungary, we demonstrate that systemic risk can be considerably mitigated by 16-50% without reducing the production output of firms. A comparison of network properties before and after rewiring reveals that this risk reduction is achieved by changing the connectivity in non-trivial ways. These results suggest that actual SCN topologies carry unnecessarily high levels of systemic risk. We discuss the possibility of devising policies to reduce systemic risk through minimal, targeted interventions in supply chain networks through market-based incentives.</description>
