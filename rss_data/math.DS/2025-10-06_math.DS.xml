      <title>The shrinking target and recurrence problem for non-autonomous systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the shrinking target and recurrence set associated to non-autonomous measure-preserving systems on compact metric spaces, establishing zero-one criteria in the spirit of classical Borel-Cantelli results. Our first main theorem gives a quantitative shrinking target result for non-autonomous systems under a uniform mixing condition, providing asymptotics with an optimal error term. This general result is applicable to certain families of inner functions, yielding concrete applications such as digit patterns in multi-base expansions. Turning to recurrence, we establish new zero-measure laws for non-autonomous systems. In the autonomous case, we prove a zero-one criterion for recurrence sets of centred, one-component inner functions via Markov partitions and distortion estimates. Together, these results provide a unified framework for shrinking target and recurrence problems in both autonomous and non-autonomous dynamics.</description>

      <title>Explicit formulae and topological descriptions of action-minimizing sets for 2-locally potentials of the XY model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider ergodic optimization of a symbolic dynamics with uncountable alphabet $[0,1]$ for 2-locally constant potentials with the twist condition, and give explicit formulae of the associated Mather set and the Aubry set. Moreover, we investigate the total disconnectedness of the (quotient) Aubry set, in which case the differentiability of the potential function makes a remarkable difference. Although these results imply that the (quotient) Aubry set is small enough, we give a complete characterization of an analogical object of the Aubry set, called the Ma\~{n}\'e set, and show that it is much larger than the Aubry set so that it contains cubes of any finite dimension.</description>

      <title>Nonsingular structural stable chaotic 3-flows of attractor-repeller type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that any orientable closed 3-manifold $M$ admits structurally stable non-singular flow $f^t$ whose non-wandering set $NW(f^t)$ consists of a 2-dimensional expanding attractor and finitely many repelling periodic trajectories. For $M=\mathbb{S}^3$, we prove that the set of repelling periodic trajectories can be an arbitrary link provided that this link contains the figure eight knot. When a link consists of a unique repelling periodic trajectory (not necessarily a figure eight knot), we prove that this trajectory cannot be a torus knot. For any closed 3-manifold $M$, we show that there does not admit any structurally stable non-singular flow $f^t$ whose non-wandering set $NW(f^t)$ consists of a 2-dimensional expanding attractor and a repelling periodic trajectory so that the repelling periodic trajectory is a trivial knot (i.e., it bounds a disk in $M$).</description>

      <title>On entry-exit formulas for degenerate turning point problems in planar slow-fast systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study degenerate entry-exit problems associated with planar slow-fast systems having an invariant line $\{(x,y)\,:\,y=0\}$ with a turning point at $x=0$. The degeneracy stems from the fact that the slow flow has a saddle-node of even order $2n$, $n\in \mathbb N$, at the turning point, i.e. $x' = -x^{2n}(1+o(1))$ for $\epsilon=0$. We are motivated by the appearance of such turning point problems (for $n=1$) in the graphics $(I_2^1)$ and $(I_4^1)$, through a nilpotent saddle-node singularity at infinity, in the Dumortier-Roussarie-Rousseau program (for solving the finiteness part of Hilbert's 16th problem for quadratic polynomial systems). Our results show, under additional hypothesis, that in the case $n=1$ there is a well-defined entry-exit relation for $\epsilon\rightarrow 0$. The associated Dulac map is smooth w.r.t. $(\epsilon,\epsilon \log \epsilon^{-1})$. On the other hand for the cases $n\ge 2$, we show that the entry-exit relation requires additional control parameters. Our approach follows the one used by De Maesschalck, P. and Schecter, S. (JDE 2016) for a different type of degenerate entry-exit problem. In particular, we apply blow-up {after} having first performed a singular coordinate transformation of $y$. The degeneracy at $x=0$ requires an additional blow-up. We finally apply the result for $n=1$ to a normal form for the unfolding of the \NEW{relevant} graphics in the Dumortier-Roussarie-Rousseau program. Here we also demonstrate that the singular transformation of $y$ due to De Maesschalck, P. and Schecter, S. (JDE 2016) has practical significance in numerical computations.</description>

      <title>A functional analytic theory for differential equations on Banach spaces with slowly evolving parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides a functional analytic approach to differential equations on Banach space with slowly evolving parameters. We develop a Fenichel-like theory for attracting subsets of critical manifolds via a Lyapunov-Perron method. This functional analytic approach to invariant manifold theory for fast-slow systems of differential equations has not been fully developed before, especially for the case that the fast subsystem lives on an infinite-dimensional Banach space. We provide rigorous functional analytic proofs for both the persistence of attracting critical manifolds as smooth slow manifolds, as well as the validity of slow manifold reduction near slow manifolds. Several aspects of our proofs are new in the literature even for the finite-dimensional case. The theory as developed here provides a rigorous framework that allows one (for example) to derive formal statements on the dynamics of biologically meaningful spatially extended models with slowly varying parameters.</description>

      <title>A Mathematical Framework for Quantifying Nonlinear Uncertainty Propagation in Eddy Identification Criteria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ocean eddies are swirling mesoscale features that play a fundamental role in oceanic transport and mixing. Eddy identification relies on diagnostic criteria that are inherently nonlinear functions of the flow variables. However, estimating the ocean flow field is subject to uncertainty due to its turbulent nature and the use of sparse and noisy observations. This uncertainty interacts with nonlinear diagnostics, complicating its quantification and limiting the accuracy of eddy identification. In this paper, an analytically tractable mathematical and computational framework for studying eddy identification is developed. It aims to address how uncertainty interacts with the nonlinearity in the eddy diagnostics and how the uncertainty in the eddy diagnostics is reduced when additional information from observations is incorporated. The framework employs a simple stochastic model for the flow field that mimics turbulent dynamics, allowing closed-form solutions for assessing uncertainty in eddy statistics. It also leverages a nonlinear, yet analytically tractable, data assimilation scheme to incorporate observations, facilitating the study of uncertainty reduction in eddy identification, which is quantified rigorously using information theory. Applied to the Okubo-Weiss (OW) parameter, a widely used eddy diagnostic criterion, the framework leads to three key results. First, closed formulae reveal inhomogeneous spatial patterns in the OW uncertainty despite homogeneous flow field uncertainty. Second, it shows a close link between local minima of the OW expectation (eddy centers) and local maxima of its uncertainty. Third, it reveals a practical information barrier: the reduction in uncertainty in diagnostics asymptotically saturates, limiting the benefit of additional observations.</description>

      <title>Variation of algebraically integrable adjoint foliated structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a canonical algebraically integrable foliation on a klt projective variety, we study the variation of the ample models of the associated adjoint foliated structures with respect to the parameter. When the foliation is of general type, we show the finiteness of ample models if the parameter is sufficiently close to $1$. When the ambient variety is of general type, we show the finiteness of ample models for all parameters. A key ingredient in our proof is the equivalence between the existence of minimal models and the termination of MMP with scaling for algebraically integrable adjoint foliated structures.</description>

      <title>Efficient Optimal Path Planning in Dynamic Environments Using Koopman MPC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a data-driven model predictive control framework for mobile robots navigating in dynamic environments, leveraging Koopman operator theory. Unlike the conventional Koopman-based approaches that focus on the linearization of system dynamics only, our work focuses on finding a global linear representation for the optimal path planning problem that includes both the nonlinear robot dynamics and collision-avoidance constraints. We deploy extended dynamic mode decomposition to identify linear and bilinear Koopman realizations from input-state data. Our open-loop analysis demonstrates that only the bilinear Koopman model can accurately capture nonlinear state-input couplings and quadratic terms essential for collision avoidance, whereas linear realizations fail to do so. We formulate a quadratic program for the robot path planning in the presence of moving obstacles in the lifted space and determine the optimal robot action in an MPC framework. Our approach is capable of finding the safe optimal action 320 times faster than a nonlinear MPC counterpart that solves the path planning problem in the original state space. Our work highlights the potential of bilinear Koopman realizations for linearization of highly nonlinear optimal control problems subject to nonlinear state and input constraints to achieve computational efficiency similar to linear problems.</description>

      <title>Lyapunov exponents, entropy and mixing for DiPerna-Lions flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The main goal of this work is to establish an asymptotic form of Bressan's mixing conjecture. To this end, we develop an ergodic-theoretic framework for incompressible DiPerna-Lions flows. Lyapunov exponents are defined via an Oseledets-type decomposition and related to metric entropy through a version of Ruelle's inequality in this low-regularity setting. These tools yield sharp bounds on asymptotic regularity propagation and mixing rates, leading to our main result.</description>

Abstract: Everyone can see that over the last 150 years, theoretical ecology has become considerably more mathematical. But what is the nature of this phenomenon? Are mathematics applied, as in the use of statistical tests, for example, or are they involved, as in physics, where laws cannot be expressed without them? Through the history of the {\em Competitive Exclusion Principle} formulated at the very beginning of the 20th century by the naturalist Grinnell concerning the distribution of brown-backed chickadees, up to its modern integration into what is known in mathematics as population dynamics, I highlight the effectiveness of what could be called the mathematical novel in clarifying certain concepts in theoretical ecology.</description>

      <title>Random Hamiltonians I: Probability measures and random walks on the Hamiltonian diffeomorphism group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a family of probability measures on the group of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms of a closed symplectic manifold $(M,\omega)$. We show that these measures are Borel measures with respect to the topology induced by the Hofer metric. Further, we show that these measures turn any Hofer-Lipschitz function into a random variable with finite expectation. These measures have (for suitable choices of parameters) several desirable properties, such as full support on $\text{Ham}(M,\omega)$, explicit estimates of the measure of Hofer-balls, and certain controls under the action of the group. We also define a family of probability measures on the space of autonomous Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms. These measures have similar properties and give rise to a random walk on the group $\text{Ham}(M,\omega)$. Finally, we show that under certain limits this construction gives rise to probability measures on the space of Hamiltonian homeomorphisms and on the metric completion of $\text{Ham}(M,\omega)$ with respect to the Hofer metric and the spectral metric.</description>

Abstract: In the present article we study the periodic structure of some well-known classes of $C^1$ self-maps on the product of spheres of different dimensions: transversal maps, Morse-Smale diffeomorphisms and maps with all its periodic points hyperbolic. Our approach is via the Lefschetz fixed point theory. We give a complete characterization of the minimal set of Lefschetz periods for Morse-Smale diffeomorphisms on these spaces. We also consider $C^1$ maps with all its periodic points hyperbolic and we give conditions for these maps to have infinitely many periodic points. We describe the period set of the transversal maps on these spaces. Finally we applied these results to describe the periodic structure of similar classes of maps on compact, connected, simple connected and simple Lie groups.</description>

Abstract: We present some computer assisted methods to prove the existence of spectral gaps for the Almost Mathieu operator at critical coupling and give rigorous numerical estimates on their size. As an example we show that the first 8 gaps predicted by the Gap Labelling theorem are open when $\omega=(\sqrt{5}-1)/2$ and 12 of them are open when $\omega=e-2$. A dynamical method based on the constructive conjugation to a hyperbolic cocycle and a spectral method based on the rigorous computation of the eigenvalues of finite-dimensional matrices are presented. We also present some experiments and conjectures on gap size for the associated peridodic problems.</description>

      <title>Separatrix configurations in holomorphic flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14594v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate properties of boundary orbits (separatrices) of canonical regions in holomorphic flows with real-valued time. We establish the continuity of transit times along these boundary orbits and classify possible path components of the boundary of flow-invariant domains. Thus, we provide central tools for geometric constructions aimed at examining the role of blow-up scenarios in separatrix configurations of basins of simple equilibria and global elliptic sectors:
  First, we prove that the separatrices of basins of centers is entirely composed of double-sided separatrices with a blow-up in finite positive and finite negative time.
  Second, we show that the separatrices of node and focus basins (sinks and sources) exhibit a finite-time blow-up in the same time direction in which the orbits within the basin tend towards the equilibrium. Additionally, we propose a counterexample to the claim in Theorem 4.3 (3) in [The structure of sectors of zeros of entire flows, K. Broughan (2003)], demonstrating that a blow-up does not necessarily have to occur in both time directions.
  Third, we describe the boundary structure of global elliptic sectors. It consists of the multiple equilibrium, one incoming and one outgoing separatrix attached to it, and at most countably many double-sided separatrices.</description>

Abstract: The paper deals with the problem of long-time asymptotic behaviour of solutions for classes of ODEs and PDEs, perturbed by stationary noises. The latter are not assumed to be $\delta$-correlated in time, so that the evolution in question is not necessarily Markovian. We first prove an abstract result which imply the mixing for random dynamical systems satisfying appropriate dissipativity and controllability conditions. It is applicable to a large class of evolution equations, and we illustrate it on the examples of a chain of anharmonic oscillators coupled to heat reservoirs, the 2d Navier-Stokes system, and a complex Ginzburg-Landau equation. Our results also apply to the general theory of random processes on the 1d lattice and allow one to get for them results related to Dobrushin's theorems on reconstructing processes via their conditional distributions. The proof is based on an iterative construction with quadratic convergence. It uses the method of Kantorovich functional, introduced in [KPS02, Kuk02, Kuk06] in the context of randomly forced PDEs, and some ideas suggested in [Shi15, KNS20] to prove mixing with the help of controllability properties of an associated system</description>

Abstract: This paper, based upon an unpublished manuscript by Maurice Heins, answers a question posed by Valiron about the dynamics of parabolic self-maps of the unit disk in the complex plane, considerably simplifying arguments previously used for answering the same question. The main new tool introduced is the notion of left straightening of a sequence of iterates, that can be effectively employed for studying the hyperbolic step of a parabolic map.</description>
