      <title>Modeling flux-quantizing Josephson junction circuits in Keysight ADS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Josephson junction and inductor models in Keysight ADS that feature an auxiliary flux port, and facilitate the expression of flux quantization conditions in simulation of superconducting microwave circuits. We present several examples that illustrate our methodology for constructing flux-quantizing circuits, including dc- and rf-SQUIDs, tunable couplers, and parametric amplifiers using SNAIL and rf-SQUID arrays. We perform DC, S-parameter, and harmonic balance simulations to validate our models and methods against theory and published experimental results.</description>

      <title>Optimized waveguides for mid-infrared lab-on-chip systems: A rigorous design approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mid-infrared absorption spectroscopy is a well-established technique for non-destructive quantitative molecular analysis. Waveguide-integrated sensors provide a particularly compact solution operating with reduced sample volumes while exhibiting exquisite molecular selectivity, sensitivity, and ultra-low limits of detection. Recent advances in mid-infrared technologies along with the integration of on-chip sources, detectors and microfluidics, have brought mid-infrared lab-on-chip systems closer to reality. A variety of material platforms has been proposed for the implementation of such systems. However, the lack of a consistent waveguide design approach renders a fair comparison between different alternatives - and a deliberate material selection - challenging, limiting the development of optimized on-chip spectroscopic devices. In the present study, a systematic waveguide design approach has been developed, facilitating evanescent field absorption-based sensing, in particular for aqueous analytes. Our strategy enables a rigorous comparison of several state-of-the-art thin-film waveguides using parametric expressions to predict the achievable limits of detection of the sensing system, while indicating optimum waveguide dimensions and absorption pathlengths, pivotal for the development of next-generation mid-infrared lab-on-chip devices.</description>

      <title>Study of non-diffusive thermal behaviors in nanoscale transistors under different heating strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the phonon transport mechanisms and efficiently capturing the spatiotemporal distributions of temperature is of great significance for alleviating hotspot issues in the electronic devices. Most previous simulations mainly focused on the steady-state problem with continuous heating, and the effective Fourier's law (EFL) is widely used for practical multiscale thermal engineering due to its simplicity and efficiency although it still follows the diffusive rule. However, non-continuous heating is more common in the electronic devices, and few comparative study is conducted to estimate how much deviation the EFL would produce. To answer above questions, the heat conduction in nanoscale bulk or silicon-on-insulator (SOI) transistors is investigated by the phonon Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) under three heating strategies, namely, `Continuous', `Intermittent' and `Alternating' heating. Numerical results in the quasi-2D or 3D hotspot systems show that it is not easy to accurately capture the micro/nano scale heat conduction by the EFL, especially near the hotspot regions. Different heating strategies have great influence on the temperature rise and transient thermal dissipation process. Compared to `Intermittent' heating, the temperature variance of `Alternating' heating is smaller.</description>

      <title>Picosecond laser pulses for quantum dot-microcavity based single photon generation by cascaded electro-optic modulation of a narrow-linewidth laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent developments in integrated optics have made it possible to fabricate high-bandwidth electro-optic modulators (EOMs). Here we show cascaded operation of two of such modulators driven by custom-built electronics delivering on-demand picosecond pulses and application to a quantum dot cavity-QED single photon source. We implement an EOM-based correlation technique and demonstrate light pulses as short as 24$\pm$2 ps with a single EOM. The EOMs can be synchronized and operated in series, we then produce optical pulses down to 17 ps. To optimize the pulse contrast, we analyze for two different EOM devices the transmission as a function of EOM bias, wavelength and temperature, and we show that by temperature tuning and stabilization, a pulse contrast above 25 dB can be obtained at the targeted wavelength. With this high contrast we demonstrate resonant excitation of an InGaAs quantum dot - microcavity based single photon source, demonstrating a crucial technology for scalability and synchronization of large scale photonic quantum applications.</description>

      <title>All-Optical Azimuthal Trapping of Dissipative Kerr Multi-Solitons for Relative Noise Suppression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Temporal cavity solitons, or dissipative Kerr solitons (DKS) in integrated microresonators, are essential for deployable metrology technologies. Such applications favor the lowest noise state, typically the single-DKS state where one soliton is in the resonator. Other multi-DKS states can also be reached, offering better conversion efficiency and thermal stability, potentially simplifying DKS-based technologies. Yet they exhibit more noise due to relative soliton jitter, and are usually not compatible with targeted applications. We demonstrate that Kerr-induced synchronization, an all-optical trapping technique, can azimuthally pin the multi-DKS state to a common reference field. This method ensures repetition rate noise independent of the number of solitons, making a multi-DKS state indistinguishable from a single-DKS state in that regard, akin to trapped-soliton molecule behavior. Supported by theoretical analysis and experimental demonstration in an integrated microresonator, this approach provides metrological capacity regardless of the number of cavity solitons, benefiting numerous DKS-based metrology applications.</description>

      <title>Design and Fabrication of Ultrahigh Q Chip-Based Silica WGM Micro-resonators for Single-Atom Cavity-QED</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Of the many applications of whispering-gallery mode (WGM) microresonators, Single-atom cavity-QED poses the most extreme demands on mode-volume and quality factor. Here we present a model-based procedure for the fabrication of small mode-volume ultrahigh Q silica WGM microresonators of varying geometries, from toroidal to micro-spheres. We experimentally demonstrate WGM resonators with ultra-high qualities as high as $1.7\times 10^8$ at 780nm. We present a theoretical model that allows tailoring the recipe to attain the desired geometry of the fabricated WGM microresonators.</description>

      <title>Effect of particle oxidation, size and material on deformation, bonding and deposition during cold spray: a peridynamic investigation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01311v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cold spray (CS) has emerged as an important additive manufacturing technology over the past decade. This study investigates the effect of oxide layers on the CS process, focusing on the deformation behavior of copper (Cu) and iron (Fe) particles upon collision with a matching substrate. Using a peridynamics-based approach, we examine the effects of oxide thickness, particle size, and particle/substrate material on material deformation and oxide fracture processes. Our results show that thicker oxide films restrict particle deformation, delay oxide discontinuities and material jetting, and increase the critical velocity required for metal to metal contact. Larger particles, despite uniform deformation across sizes, require lower velocities to initiate jetting and oxide separation because of their higher kinetic energy, leading to metallurgical bonding at lower velocities. Soft to soft impacts induce oxide film cracking at lower velocities, resulting in larger interface areas and more oxide-free contact zones, thereby reducing the critical velocity. Furthermore, the volume of residual oxide has a power-law relationship with the particle size, indicating that the oxide-cleaning ability of the particles affects the critical velocity. This study highlights the importance of oxide deformation and fracture during CS processes and provides valuable insights into the breakage and removal of oxides and subsequent metallic bond formation. These findings offer beneficial new knowledge for the rational design and optimization of CS processes.</description>

      <title>Triboelectric Pixels as building blocks for microscale and large area integration of drop energy harvesters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02464v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ultimate step towards the exploitation of water as a clean and renewable energy source addresses the energies stored in the low frequencies of liquid flows, which demands flexible solutions to adapt to multiple scenarios, from raindrops to waves, including water moving in pipelines and microdevices. Thus, harvesting low-frequency flows is a young concept compared to solar and wind powers, where triboelectric nanogenerators have been revealed as the most promising relevant actors. However, despite widespread attempts by researchers, the drop energy harvesters' output power is still low, mainly because of the limitations in candidates endowed with ideal triboelectric and wetting properties and also the non-optimal and centimetre-scale device architecture that prevents the conversion of the complete kinetic energy of impinging drops. Herein, we disclose a microscale triboelectric nanogenerator that can harvest a high density of electrical power from drops through a single, submillisecond, long-lasting step. The mechanism relies on an instantaneous electrical capacitance variation owing to the high-speed contact of the drops with the electrodes' active area. We discuss the role of the precharged effect of the triboelectric surface in the time characteristic of the conversion event. The capacitive and microscale structure of the device is endowed with a small form factor that allows for the production of densely packed arrays. The proposed architecture can be adjusted to different liquids and scales and is compatible with a variety of triboelectric surfaces, including flexible, transparent, and thin-film approaches.</description>

      <title>Scale-bridging within a complex model hierarchy for investigation of a metal-fueled circular energy economy by use of Bayesian model calibration with model error quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13092v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Metal energy carriers recently gained growing interest in research as a promising storage and transport material for renewable electricity. Within the development of a metal-fueled circular energy economy, research involves a model hierarchy spanning from micro to macro scales, making the transfer of information among different levels of complexity a crucial task for the implementation of the new technology. Chemical reactor networks (CRNs) are models of reduced complexity and a promising approach to accomplish the scale-bridging task. This holds if valid information from CRNs can be obtained on a much denser set of operating conditions than available from experiments and elaborated simulation methods like Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). An approach for CRN calibration from recent literature, including model error quantification, is further developed to construct a CRN model of a laboratory reactor for flash ironmaking, using data from the literature. By introducing a meta model of a CRN parameter, a simple CRN model on an extended set of operating conditions has successfully been calibrated. This way, the employed coupled calibration and uncertainty quantification framework has proven promising for the task of scale-bridging in the model hierarchy under investigation.</description>

      <title>Fabrication and characterization of optical micro/nanofibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01761v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate the fabrication of optical micro/nanofibers (MNFs) using chemical etching and gas-flame techniques. In the chemical etching technique, a two-step process involves 40% and 24% of hydrofluoric acid solutions for the first and second steps, respectively. The measured diameters of MNFs range is 0.34 $\mu$m - 1.4 $\mu$m. In the gas-flame technique, we design the pulling parameters in a four-step process to achieve the desired diameter of MNFs. The single-mode fiber is adiabatically tapered using high-precision stages while heating the fiber with hydrogen-oxygen flame. The measured diameters of pulled MNFs range is 0.48 $\mu$m - 0.53 $\mu$m, showing good correspondence with the designed diameters. Due to the strong confinement of the field around the MNF, it has diverse applications in various fields, such as sensing, nanophotonics, quantum optics, quantum photonics, and nonlinear optics.</description>

      <title>Influence of Point Defects on Laser-Induced Excitation in Silicon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06560v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We studied the influence of defect states on the laser excitation process in silicon using time-dependent density functional theory. We assumed two types of point defects: interstitial oxygen and silicon vacancies. We found that the photoabsorption efficiency increased with defect density in both cases owing to the color center. These defects distorted the crystal structure, thereby relaxing the selection rules and changing the indirect gap to direct. At low laser intensities, the defect states dominated the absorption process. However, as the laser intensity increased, the excitation efficiency approached that of crystalline silicon. In addition, we observed that the excitation efficiency did not scale linearly with the pulse length. Notably, in the case of Si vacancies, saturable absorption significantly reduced photoabsorption. Our results suggest that the existence of a defect and its density could be detected by even-order high-harmonics generation.</description>
