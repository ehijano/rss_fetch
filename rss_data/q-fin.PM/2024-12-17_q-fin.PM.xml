      <title>PolyModel for Hedge Funds' Portfolio Construction Using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The domain of hedge fund investments is undergoing significant transformation, influenced by the rapid expansion of data availability and the advancement of analytical technologies. This study explores the enhancement of hedge fund investment performance through the integration of machine learning techniques, the application of PolyModel feature selection, and the analysis of fund size. We address three critical questions: (1) the effect of machine learning on trading performance, (2) the role of PolyModel feature selection in fund selection and performance, and (3) the comparative reliability of larger versus smaller funds.
  Our findings offer compelling insights. We observe that while machine learning techniques enhance cumulative returns, they also increase annual volatility, indicating variability in performance. PolyModel feature selection proves to be a robust strategy, with approaches that utilize a comprehensive set of features for fund selection outperforming more selective methodologies. Notably, Long-Term Stability (LTS) effectively manages portfolio volatility while delivering favorable returns. Contrary to popular belief, our results suggest that larger funds do not consistently yield better investment outcomes, challenging the assumption of their inherent reliability.
  This research highlights the transformative impact of data-driven approaches in the hedge fund investment arena and provides valuable implications for investors and asset managers. By leveraging machine learning and PolyModel feature selection, investors can enhance portfolio optimization and reassess the dependability of larger funds, leading to more informed investment strategies.</description>

      <title>Cost-aware Portfolios in a Large Universe of Assets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper considers the finite horizon portfolio rebalancing problem in terms of mean-variance optimization, where decisions are made based on current information on asset returns and transaction costs. The study's novelty is that the transaction costs are integrated within the optimization problem in a high-dimensional portfolio setting where the number of assets is larger than the sample size. We propose portfolio construction and rebalancing models with nonconvex penalty considering two types of transaction cost, the proportional transaction cost and the quadratic transaction cost. We establish the desired theoretical properties under mild regularity conditions. Monte Carlo simulations and empirical studies using S&amp;P 500 and Russell 2000 stocks show the satisfactory performance of the proposed portfolio and highlight the importance of involving the transaction costs when rebalancing a portfolio.</description>

      <title>Optimal investment with insider information using Skorokhod &amp; Russo-Vallois integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.07471v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the maximization of the logarithmic utility for an insider with different anticipating techniques. Our aim is to compare the utilization of Russo-Vallois forward and Skorokhod integrals in this context. Theoretical analysis and illustrative numerical examples showcase that the Skorokhod insider outperforms the forward insider. This remarkable observation stands in contrast to the scenario involving risk-neutral traders. Furthermore, an ordinary trader could surpass both insiders if a significant negative fluctuation in the driving stochastic process leads to a sufficiently negative final value. These findings underline the intricate interplay between anticipating stochastic calculus and nonlinear utilities, which may yield non-intuitive results from the financial viewpoint.</description>

      <title>Market-Based Probability of Stock Returns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.07935v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper describes the dependence of market-based statistical moments of returns on statistical moments and correlations of the current and past trade values. We use Markowitz's definition of value weighted return of a portfolio as the definition of market-based average return of trades during the averaging period. Then we derive the dependence of market-based volatility and higher statistical moments of returns on statistical moments, volatilities, and correlations of the current and past trade values. We derive the approximations of the characteristic function and the probability of returns by a finite number q of market-based statistical moments. To forecast market-based average and volatility of returns at horizon T, one should predict the first two statistical moments and correlation of current and past trade values at the same horizon. We discuss the economic reasons that limit the number of predicted statistical moments of returns by the first two. That limits the accuracy of the forecasts of probability of returns by the accuracy of the Gaussian approximations. To improve the reliability of large macroeconomic and market models like BlackRock's Aladdin, JP Morgan, and the U.S. Fed., the developers should use market-based statistical moments of returns.</description>
