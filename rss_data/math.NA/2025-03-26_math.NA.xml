      <title>Observations on Recurrent Loss in the Neural Network Model of a Partial Differential Equation: the Advection-Diffusion Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A growing body of literature has been leveraging techniques of machine learning (ML) to build novel approaches to approximating the solutions to partial differential equations. Noticeably absent from the literature is a systematic exploration of the stability of the solutions generated by these ML approaches. Here, a recurrent network is introduced that matches precisely the evaluation of a multistep method paired with a collocation method for approximating spatial derivatives in the advection diffusion equation. This allows for two things: 1) the use of traditional tools for analyzing the stability of a numerical method for solving PDEs and 2) bringing to bear efficient techniques of ML for the training of approximations for the action of (spatial) linear operators. Observations on impacts of varying the large number of parameters in even this simple linear problem are presented. Further, it is demonstrated that stable solutions can be found even where traditional numerical methods may fail.</description>

      <title>On the numerical stability of sketched GMRES</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a backward stability analysis of preconditioned sketched GMRES [Nakatsukasa and Tropp, SIAM J. Matrix Anal. Appl, 2024] for solving linear systems $Ax=b$, and show that the backward stability at iteration $i$ depends on the conditioning of the Krylov basis $B_{1:i}$ as long as the condition number of $A B_{1:i}$ can be bounded by $1/O(u)$, where $u$ is the unit roundoff. Under this condition, we show that sketched GMRES is backward stable as long as the condition number of $B_{1:i}$ is not too large. Under additional assumptions, we then show that the stability of a restarted implementation of sketched GMRES can be independent of the condition number of $B_{1:i}$, and restarted sketched GMRES is backward stable. We also derive sharper bounds that explain why the backward error can be small even in cases when the basis $B_{1:i}$ is very ill-conditioned, which has been observed in the literature but not yet explained theoretically. We present numerical experiments to demonstrate the conclusions of our analysis, and also show that adaptively restarting where appropriate allows us to recover backward stability in sketched GMRES.</description>

      <title>Block Gauss-Seidel methods for t-product tensor regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Randomized iterative algorithms, such as the randomized Kaczmarz method and the randomized Gauss-Seidel method, have gained considerable popularity due to their efficacy in solving matrix-vector and matrix-matrix regression problems. Our present work leverages the insights gained from studying such algorithms to develop regression methods for tensors, which are the natural setting for many application problems, e.g., image deblurring. In particular, we extend two variants of the block-randomized Gauss-Seidel method to solve a t-product tensor regression problem. We additionally develop methods for the special case where the measurement tensor is given in factorized form. We provide theoretical guarantees of the exponential convergence rate of our algorithms, accompanied by illustrative numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Least Squares with Equality constraints Extreme Learning Machines for the resolution of PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the use of single hidden-layer neural networks as a family of ansatz functions for the resolution of partial differential equations (PDEs). In particular, we train the network via Extreme Learning Machines (ELMs) on the residual of the equation collocated on -eventually randomly chosen- points. Because the approximation is done directly in the formulation, such a method falls into the framework of Physically Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and has been named PIELM. Since its first introduction, the method has been refined variously, and one successful variant is the Extreme Theory of Functional Connections (XTFC). However, XTFC strongly takes advantage of the description of the domain as a tensor product. Our aim is to extend XTFC to domains with general shapes. The novelty of the procedure proposed in the present paper is related to the treatment of boundary conditions via constrained imposition, so that our method is named Least Squares with Equality constraints ELM (LSEELM). An in-depth analysis and comparison with the cited methods is performed, again with the analysis of the convergence of the method in various scenarios. We show the efficiency of the procedure both in terms of computational cost and in terms of overall accuracy.</description>

      <title>Numerical Stability Revisited: A Family of Benchmark Problems for the Analysis of Explicit Stochastic Differential Equation integrators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we revisit the numerical stability of four well-established explicit stochastic integration schemes through a new generic benchmark stochastic differential equation (SDE) designed to assess asymptotic statistical accuracy and stability properties. This one-parameter benchmark equation is derived from a general one-dimensional first-order SDE using spatio-temporal nondimensionalization and is employed to evaluate the performance of (1) Euler-Maruyama (EM), (2) Milstein (Mil), (3) Stochastic Heun (SH), and (4) a three-stage Runge-Kutta scheme (RK3).
  Our findings reveal that lower-order schemes can outperform higher-order ones over a range of time step sizes, depending on the benchmark parameters and application context. The theoretical results are validated through a series of numerical experiments, and we discuss their implications for more general applications, including a nonlinear example of particle transport in porous media under various conditions. Our results suggest that the insights obtained from the linear benchmark problem provide reliable guidance for time-stepping strategies when simulating nonlinear SDEs.</description>

      <title>Parameter-robust preconditioner for Stokes-Darcy coupled problem with Lagrange multiplier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a parameter-robust preconditioner for the coupled Stokes-Darcy problem equipped with various boundary conditions, enforcing the mass conservation at the interface via a Lagrange multiplier. We rigorously establish that the coupled system is well-posed with respect to physical parameters and mesh size and provide a framework for constructing parameter-robust preconditioners. Furthermore, we analyze the convergence behavior of the Minimal Residual method in the presence of small outlier eigenvalues linked to specific boundary conditions, which can lead to slow convergence or stagnation. To address this issue, we employ deflation techniques to accelerate the convergence. Finally, Numerical experiments confirm the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>A Wong--Zakai resonance-based integrator for nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with white noise dispersion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel approach to numerical approximation of nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with white noise dispersion in the regime of low-regularity solutions. Approximating such solutions in the stochastic setting is particularly challenging due to randomized frequency interactions and presents a compelling challenge for the construction of tailored schemes. In particular, we design the first resonance-based schemes for this equation, which achieve provable convergence for solutions of much lower regularity than previously required. A crucial ingredient in this construction is the Wong--Zakai approximation of stochastic dispersive system, which introduces piecewise linear phases that capture nonlinear frequency interactions and can subsequently be approximated to construct resonance-based schemes. We prove the well-posedness of the Wong--Zakai approximated equation and establish its proximity to the original full stochastic dispersive system. Based on this approximation, we demonstrate an improved strong convergence rate for our new scheme, which exploits the stochastic nature of the dispersive terms. Finally, we provide numerical experiments underlining the favourable performance of our novel method in practice.</description>

      <title>Kernel compensation method for Maxwell eigenproblem with mimetic finite difference discretization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a kernel compensation method for Maxwell eigenproblem for photonic crystals to avoid the infinite-dimensional kernels that cause many difficulties in the calculation of energy gaps. The quasi-periodic problem is first transformed into a periodic one on the cube by the Floquet-Bloch theory. Then the compensation operator is introduced in Maxwell's equation with the shifted curl operator. The discrete problem depends on the compatible discretization of the de Rham complex, which is implemented by the mimetic finite difference method in this paper. We prove that the compensation term exactly fills up the kernel of the original problem and avoids spurious eigenvalues. Also, we propose an efficient preconditioner and its FFT and multigrid solvers, which allow parallel computing. Numerical experiments for different three-dimensional lattices are performed to validate the accuracy and effectiveness of the method.</description>

      <title>Empirical Hyper Element Integration Method (EHEIM) with Unified Integration Criteria for Efficient Hyper Reduced FE$^2$ Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical homogenization for mechanical multiscale modeling by means of the finite element method (FEM) is an elegant way of obtaining structure-property relations, if the behavior of the constituents of the lower scale is well understood. However, the computational costs of this so-called FE$^2$ method are so high that reduction methods are essential. While the construction of a reduced basis for the microscopic nodal displacements using proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) has become a standard technique, the reduction of the computational effort for the projected nodal forces, the so-called hyper reduction, is an additional challenge, for which different strategies have been proposed in the literature. The empirical cubature method (ECM), which has been proven to be very robust, implemented the conservation of the total volume is used as a constraint in the resulting optimization problem, while energy-based criteria have been proposed in other contributions.
  The present contribution presents a unified integration criteria concept, involving the aforementioned criteria, among others. These criteria are used both with a Gauss point-based as well as with an element-based hyper reduction scheme, the latter retaining full compatibility with the common modular finite element framework. The methods are combined with a previously proposed clustered training strategy and a monolithic solver. Numerical examples empirically demonstrate that the additional criteria improve the accuracy for a given number of modes. Vice verse, less modes and thus lower computational costs are required to reach a given level of accuracy.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic-preserving and positivity-preserving discontinuous Galerkin method for the semiconductor Boltzmann equation in the diffusive scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop an asymptotic-preserving and positivity-preserving discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method for solving the semiconductor Boltzmann equation in the diffusive scaling. We first formulate the diffusive relaxation system based on the even-odd decomposition method, which allows us to split into one relaxation step and one transport step. We adopt a robust implicit scheme that can be explicitly implemented for the relaxation step that involves the stiffness of the collision term, while the third-order strong-stability-preserving Runge-Kutta method is employed for the transport step. We couple this temporal scheme with the DG method for spatial discretization, which provides additional advantages including high-order accuracy, $h$-$p$ adaptivity, and the ability to handle arbitrary unstructured meshes. A positivity-preserving limiter is further applied to preserve physical properties of numerical solutions. The stability analysis using the even-odd decomposition is conducted for the first time. We demonstrate the accuracy and performance of our proposed scheme through several numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Characteristic boundary conditions for Hybridizable Discontinuous Galerkin methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we introduce the concept of characteristic boundary conditions (CBCs) within the framework of Hybridizable Discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) methods, including both the Navier-Stokes characteristic boundary conditions (NSCBCs) and a novel approach to generalized characteristic relaxation boundary conditions (GRCBCs). CBCs are based on the characteristic decomposition of the compressible Euler equations and are designed to prevent the reflection of waves at the domain boundaries. We show the effectiveness of the proposed method for weakly compressible flows through a series of numerical experiments by comparing the results with common boundary conditions in the HDG setting and reference solutions available in the literature. In particular, HDG with CBCs show superior performance minimizing the reflection of vortices at artificial boundaries, for both inviscid and viscous flows.</description>

      <title>Enhanced gradient recovery-based a posteriori error estimator and adaptive finite element method for elliptic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recovery type a posteriori error estimators are popular, particularly in the engineering community, for their computationally inexpensive, easy to implement, and generally asymptotically exactness. Unlike the residual type error estimators, one can not establish upper and lower a posteriori error bounds for the classical recovery type error estimators without the saturation assumption. In this paper, we first present three examples to show the unsatisfactory performance in the practice of standard residual or recovery-type error estimators, then, an improved gradient recovery-based a posteriori error estimator is constructed. The proposed error estimator contains two parts, one is the difference between the direct and post-processed gradient approximations, and the other is the residual of the recovered gradient. The reliability and efficiency of the enhanced estimator are derived. Based on the improved recovery-based error estimator and the newest-vertex bisection refinement method with a tailored mark strategy, an adaptive finite element algorithm is designed. We then prove the convergence of the adaptive method by establishing the contraction of gradient error plus oscillation. Numerical experiments are provided to illustrate the asymptotic exactness of the new recovery-based a posteriori error estimator and the high efficiency of the corresponding adaptive algorithm.</description>

      <title>Adaptive refinement in defeaturing problems via an equilibrated flux a posteriori error estimator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An adaptive refinement strategy, based on an equilibrated flux a posteriori error estimator, is proposed in the context of defeaturing problems. Defeaturing consists in removing features from complex domains in order to ease the meshing process, and to reduce the computational burden of simulations. It is a common procedure, for example, in computer aided design for simulation based manufacturing. However, depending on the problem at hand, the effect of geometrical simplification on the accuracy of the solution may be detrimental. The proposed adaptive strategy is hence twofold: starting from a defeatured geometry it allows both for standard mesh refinement and geometrical refinement, which consists in choosing, at each step, which features need to be included into the geometry in order to significantly increase the accuracy of the solution. With respect to other estimators that were previously proposed in the context of defeaturing, the use of an equilibrated flux reconstruction allows us to avoid the evaluation of the numerical flux on the boundary of features. This makes the estimator and the adaptive strategy particularly well-suited for finite element discretizations, in which the numerical flux is typically discontinuous across element edges. The inclusion of the features during the adaptive process is tackled by a CutFEM strategy, in order to preserve the non conformity of the mesh to the feature boundary and never remesh the computational domain as the features are added. Hence, the estimator also accounts for the error introduced by weakly imposing the boundary conditions on the boundary of the added features.</description>

      <title>High Probability Complexity Bounds of Trust-Region Stochastic Sequential Quadratic Programming with Heavy-Tailed Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider nonlinear optimization problems with a stochastic objective and deterministic equality constraints. We propose a Trust-Region Stochastic Sequential Quadratic Programming (TR-SSQP) method and establish its high-probability iteration complexity bounds for identifying first- and second-order $\epsilon$-stationary points. In our algorithm, we assume that exact objective values, gradients, and Hessians are not directly accessible but can be estimated via zeroth-, first-, and second-order probabilistic oracles. Compared to existing complexity studies of SSQP methods that rely on a zeroth-order oracle with sub-exponential tail noise (i.e., light-tailed) and focus mostly on first-order stationarity, our analysis accommodates irreducible and heavy-tailed noise in the zeroth-order oracle and significantly extends the analysis to second-order stationarity. We show that under weaker noise conditions, our method achieves the same high-probability first-order iteration complexity bounds, while also exhibiting promising second-order iteration complexity bounds. Specifically, the method identifies a first-order $\epsilon$-stationary point in $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$ iterations and a second-order $\epsilon$-stationary point in $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-3})$ iterations with high probability, provided that $\epsilon$ is lower bounded by a constant determined by the irreducible noise level in estimation. We validate our theoretical findings and evaluate the practical performance of our method on CUTEst benchmark test set.</description>

Abstract: Classically, to solve differential equation problems, it is necessary to specify sufficient initial and/or boundary conditions so as to allow the existence of a unique solution. Well-posedness of differential equation problems thus involves studying the existence and uniqueness of solutions, and their dependence to such pre-specified conditions. However, in part due to mathematical necessity, these conditions are usually specified "to arbitrary precision" only on (appropriate portions of) the boundary of the space-time domain. This does not mirror how data acquisition is performed in realistic situations, where one may observe entire "patches" of solution data at arbitrary space-time locations; alternatively one might have access to more than one solutions stemming from the same differential operator. In our short work, we demonstrate how standard tools from machine and manifold learning can be used to infer, in a data driven manner, certain well-posedness features of differential equation problems, for initial/boundary condition combinations under which rigorous existence/uniqueness theorems are not known. Our study naturally combines a data assimilation perspective with an operator-learning one.</description>

      <title>E-PINNs: Epistemic Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have demonstrated promise as a framework for solving forward and inverse problems involving partial differential equations. Despite recent progress in the field, it remains challenging to quantify uncertainty in these networks. While approaches such as Bayesian PINNs (B-PINNs) provide a principled approach to capturing uncertainty through Bayesian inference, they can be computationally expensive for large-scale applications. In this work, we propose Epistemic Physics-Informed Neural Networks (E-PINNs), a framework that leverages a small network, the \emph{epinet}, to efficiently quantify uncertainty in PINNs. The proposed approach works as an add-on to existing, pre-trained PINNs with a small computational overhead. We demonstrate the applicability of the proposed framework in various test cases and compare the results with B-PINNs using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) posterior estimation and dropout-equipped PINNs (Dropout-PINNs). Our experiments show that E-PINNs provide similar coverage to B-PINNs, with often comparable sharpness, while being computationally more efficient. This observation, combined with E-PINNs' more consistent uncertainty estimates and better calibration compared to Dropout-PINNs for the examples presented, indicates that E-PINNs offer a promising approach in terms of accuracy-efficiency trade-off.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: All squigonometric functions admit derivatives that can be expressed as polynomials of the squine and cosquine. We introduce a general framework that allows us to determine these polynomials recursively. We also provide an explicit formula for all coefficients of these polynomials. This also allows us to provide an explicit expression for the MacLaurin series coefficients of all squigonometric functions. We further discuss some methods that can compute the squigonometric functions up to any given tolerance over all of the real line.</description>

      <title>A Direct Sampling Method and Its Integration with Deep Learning for Inverse Scattering Problems with Phaseless Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02584v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider in this work an inverse acoustic scattering problem when only phaseless data is available. The inverse problem is highly nonlinear and ill-posed due to the lack of the phase information. Solving inverse scattering problems with phaseless data is important in applications as the collection of physically acceptable phased data is usually difficult and expensive. A novel direct sampling method (DSM) will be developed to effectively estimate the locations and geometric shapes of the unknown scatterers from phaseless data generated by a very limited number of incident waves. With a careful theoretical analysis of the behavior of the index function and some representative numerical examples, the new DSM is shown to be computationally efficient, easy to implement, robust to large noise, and does not require any prior knowledge of the unknown scatterers. Furthermore, to fully exploit the index functions obtained from the DSM, we also propose to integrate the DSM with a deep learning technique (DSM-DL) to achieve high-quality reconstructions. Several challenging and representative numerical experiments are carried out to demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of reconstructions by DSM-DL. The DSM-DL networks trained by phased data are further theoretically and numerically shown to be able to solve problems with phaseless data. Additionally, our numerical experiments also show the DSM-DL can solve inverse scattering problems with mixed types of scatterers, which renders its applications in many important practical scenarios.</description>

      <title>Skewness of a randomized quasi-Monte Carlo estimate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06136v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Some recent work on confidence intervals for randomized quasi-Monte Carlo (RQMC) sampling found a surprising result: ordinary Student $t$ 95% confidence intervals based on a modest number of replicates were seen to be very effective and even more reliable than some bootstrap $t$ intervals that were expected to be best. One potential explanation is that those RQMC estimates have small skewness. In this paper we give conditions under which the skewness is $O(n^\epsilon)$ for any $\epsilon&gt;0$, so 'almost $O(1)$'. Under a random generator matrix model, we can improve this rate to $O(n^{-1/2+\epsilon})$ with very high probability. We also improve some probabilistic bounds on the distribution of the quality parameter $t$ for a digital net in a prime base under random sampling of generator matrices.</description>

Abstract: In the present work, we focus on the space-time isogeometric discretization of a parabolic problem with a nonlocal diffusion coefficient. The existence and uniqueness of the solution for the continuous space-time variational formulation are proven. We prove the existence of the discrete solution and also establish the a priori error estimate for the space-time isogeometric scheme. The non-linear system is linearized through Picards method and a suitable preconditioner for the linearized system is provided. Finally, to confirm the theoretical findings, results of some numerical experiments are presented.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty quantification for electrical impedance tomography using quasi-Monte Carlo methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11538v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The theoretical development of quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) methods for uncertainty quantification of partial differential equations (PDEs) is typically centered around simplified model problems such as elliptic PDEs subject to homogeneous zero Dirichlet boundary conditions. In this paper, we present a theoretical treatment of the application of randomly shifted rank-1 lattice rules to electrical impedance tomography (EIT). EIT is an imaging modality, where the goal is to reconstruct the interior conductivity of an object based on electrode measurements of current and voltage taken at the boundary of the object. This is an inverse problem, which we tackle using the Bayesian statistical inversion paradigm. As the reconstruction, we consider QMC integration to approximate the unknown conductivity given current and voltage measurements. We prove under moderate assumptions placed on the parameterization of the unknown conductivity that the QMC approximation of the reconstructed estimate has a dimension-independent, faster-than-Monte Carlo cubature convergence rate. Finally, we present numerical results for examples computed using simulated measurement data.</description>

      <title>A quantitative comparison of high-order asymptotic-preserving and asymptotically-accurate IMEX methods for the Euler equations with non-ideal gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12733v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a quantitative comparison between two different Implicit-Explicit Runge-Kutta (IMEX-RK) approaches for the Euler equations of gas dynamics, specifically tailored for the low Mach limit. In this regime, a classical IMEX-RK approach involves an implicit coupling between the momentum and energy balance so as to avoid the acoustic CFL restriction, while the density can be treated in a fully explicit fashion. This approach leads to a mildly nonlinear equation for the pressure, which can be solved according to a fixed point procedure. An alternative strategy consists of employing a semi-implicit temporal integrator based on IMEX-RK methods (SI-IMEX-RK). The stiff dependence is carefully analyzed, so as to avoid the solution of a nonlinear equation for the pressure also for equations of state (EOS) of non-ideal gases. The spatial discretization is based on a Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method, which naturally allows high-order accuracy. The asymptotic-preserving (AP) and the asymptotically-accurate (AA) properties of the two approaches are assessed on a number of classical benchmarks for ideal gases and on their extension to non-ideal gases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03369v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is demonstrated that one of the equations from the Lie classification list of second-order ODEs is a first integral of the Schwarz equation. As symmetry-preserving finite-difference schemes have been previously constructed for both equations, the preservation of a similar connection between these schemes is studied. It is shown that the schemes for the Schwarz equation and the second-order ODE (with an arbitrary constant $C$) can be related through a B\"acklund-type difference transformation. In addition, previously unexamined aspects of the difference scheme for the second-order ODE are discussed, including its singular solution and the complete set of difference first integrals for the case $C^2=4$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18844v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a class of high-order and energy-stable implicit-explicit relaxation Runge-Kutta (IMEX RRK) schemes for solving the phase-field gradient flow models. By incorporating the scalar auxiliary variable (SAV) method, the original equations are reformulated into equivalent forms, and the modified energy is introduced. Then, based on the reformulated equations, we propose a kind of IMEX RRK methods, which are rigorously proved to preserve the energy dissipation law and achieve high-order accuracy for both Allen-Cahn and Cahn-Hilliard equations. Numerical experiments are conducted to validate the theoretical results, including the accuracy of the approximate solution and the efficiency of the proposed scheme. Furthermore, the schemes are extended to multi-component gradient flows, with the vector-valued Allen-Cahn equations serving as a representative example.</description>

Abstract: The heat equation is often used in order to inpaint dropped data in inpainting-based lossy compression schemes. We propose an alternative way to numerically solve the heat equation by an extended Krylov subspace method. The method is very efficient with respect to the direct computation of the solution of the heat equation at large times. And this is exactly what is needed for decoding edge-compressed pictures by homogeneous diffusion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11295v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rolling shutter (RS) cameras dominate consumer and smartphone markets. Several methods for computing the absolute pose of RS cameras have appeared in the last 20 years, but the relative pose problem has not been fully solved yet. We provide a unified theory for the important class of order-one rolling shutter (RS$_1$) cameras. These cameras generalize the perspective projection to RS cameras, projecting a generic space point to exactly one image point via a rational map. We introduce a new back-projection RS camera model, characterize RS$_1$ cameras, construct explicit parameterizations of such cameras, and determine the image of a space line. We classify all minimal problems for solving the relative camera pose problem with linear RS$_1$ cameras and discover new practical cases. Finally, we show how the theory can be used to explain RS models previously used for absolute pose computation.</description>

      <title>Convergence of Markov Chains for Constant Step-size Stochastic Gradient Descent with Separable Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12243v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is a popular algorithm for minimizing objective functions that arise in machine learning. For constant step-sized SGD, the iterates form a Markov chain on a general state space. Focusing on a class of separable (non-convex) objective functions, we establish a "Doeblin-type decomposition," in that the state space decomposes into a uniformly transient set and a disjoint union of absorbing sets. Each of the absorbing sets contains a unique invariant measure, with the set of all invariant measures being the convex hull. Moreover the set of invariant measures are shown to be global attractors to the Markov chain with a geometric convergence rate. The theory is highlighted with examples that show: (1) the failure of the diffusion approximation to characterize the long-time dynamics of SGD; (2) the global minimum of an objective function may lie outside the support of the invariant measures (i.e., even if initialized at the global minimum, SGD iterates will leave); and (3) bifurcations may enable the SGD iterates to transition between two local minima. Key ingredients in the theory involve viewing the SGD dynamics as a monotone iterated function system and establishing a "splitting condition" of Dubins and Freedman 1966 and Bhattacharya and Lee 1988.</description>

      <title>Constructing optimal Wannier functions via potential theory: isolated single band for matrix models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08641v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a rapidly convergent scheme for computing globally optimal Wannier functions of isolated single bands for matrix models in two dimensions. The scheme proceeds first by constructing provably exponentially localized Wannier functions directly from parallel transport (with simple analytically computable corrections) when topological obstructions are absent. We prove that the corresponding Wannier functions are real when the matrix model possesses time-reversal symmetry. When a band has a nonzero Berry curvature, the resulting Wannier function is not optimal, but it is transformed into the global optimum by a single gauge transformation that eliminates the divergence of the Berry connection. Complete analysis of the construction is presented, paving the way for further improvements and generalizations. The performance of the scheme is illustrated with several numerical examples.</description>
