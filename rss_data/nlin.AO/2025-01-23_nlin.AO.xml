      <title>Weighted Point Configurations with Hyperuniformity: An Ecological Example and Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Random point configurations are said to be in hyperuniform states, if density fluctuations are anomalously suppressed in large-scale. Typical examples are found in Coulomb gas systems in two dimensions especially called log-gases in random matrix theory, in which points are repulsively correlated by long-range potentials. In infertile lands like deserts continuous survival competitions for water and nutrition will cause long-ranged repulsive interactions among plants. We have prepared digital data of spatial configurations of center-of-mass for bushes weighted by bush sizes which we call masses. Data analysis shows that such ecological point configurations do not show hyperuniformity as unmarked point processes, but are in hyperuniform states as marked point processes in which mass distributions are taken into account. We propose the non-equilibrium statistical-mechanics models to generate marked point processes having hyperuniformity, in which iterations of random thinning of points and coalescing of masses transform initial uncorrelated point processes into non-trivial point processes with hyperuniformity. Combination of real data-analysis and computer simulations shows the importance of strong correlations in probability law between spatial point configurations and mass distributions of individual points to realize hyperuniform marked point processes.</description>

      <title>Bailout Embedding and Stability Analysis of a Dynamical Mean-Field Ising Model of Opinion Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the stability of a discrete-time dynamical mean-field Ising model to perturbations. This model belongs to a broader class of models often used in the study of opinion dynamics in financial markets. In the presence of noise, these iterated maps are known to exhibit dynamics which resemble empirically observed behavior of financial markets, such as volatility clustering. Research in the recent past has identified attractor bubbling as one of the underlying mechanisms that lead to clustering of high volatility events in models of opinion dynamics. In this work, we employ the method of bailout embedding to create an extended, higher-dimensional system of iterated maps where the bubbling dynamics is isolated from dynamics in the original lower-dimensional space. The bailout embedding technique also introduces a bailout parameter and an associated bailout function which allows us to systematically induce several regimes of stability in the opinion dynamics and thus enables us to better understand the onset of attractor bubbling in this system. We demonstrate the occurrence of intermittency in opinion dynamics under appropriate conditions, with the discrete opinion dynamics sharing characteristics of empirically observed financial time series with volatility clustering. Inspired by the original context under which bailout embeddings were introduced, we propose an interpretation of the bailout function as a measure of investor inertia in the markets. This work hopes to demonstrate the usefulness of bailout embeddings as a tool to study mathematical models of financial market dynamics.</description>
