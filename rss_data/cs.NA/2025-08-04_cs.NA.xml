      <title>Zeroing Diagonals, Conjugate Hollowization, and Characterizing Nondefinite Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the conjecture by Damm and Fassbender that, for any pair $L,M$ of real traceless matrices, there exists an orthogonal $V$ such that $V^{-1} L \, V$ is hollow and $V M V^{-1}$ is almost hollow, where a matrix is hollow if and only if its main diagonal consists only of 0s, and a traceless matrix is almost hollow if and only if all its main diagonal elements are 0 except, at most, the last two.
  The claim is a corollary to our considerably more general theorem, as well as another corollary, revealing conditions on $L,M$ under which 0s can be introduced by $V$ to all but the first or first two diagonal elements of $V^{-1} L \, V$ and to all but the last two diagonal elements of $V M V^{-1}$.
  By setting $L = M$, much is revealed concerning freedom and constraint involved in introducing 0s to the diagonal of a single operator. From this we prove novel characterizations of real traceless matrices, and a stronger version of the seminal theorem by Fillmore that every real matrix is orthogonally similar to a matrix with a constant main diagonal.
  Our results are contextualized in a characterization and classification of nondefinite matrices by, roughly, how many zeros can be introduced to their diagonals, and it what ways.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Operator Learning to Accelerate Convergence of the Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new deflation strategy to accelerate the convergence of the preconditioned conjugate gradient(PCG) method for solving parametric large-scale linear systems of equations. Unlike traditional deflation techniques that rely on eigenvector approximations or recycled Krylov subspaces, we generate the deflation subspaces using operator learning, specifically the Deep Operator Network~(DeepONet). To this aim, we introduce two complementary approaches for assembling the deflation operators. The first approach approximates near-null space vectors of the discrete PDE operator using the basis functions learned by the DeepONet. The second approach directly leverages solutions predicted by the DeepONet. To further enhance convergence, we also propose several strategies for prescribing the sparsity pattern of the deflation operator. A comprehensive set of numerical experiments encompassing steady-state, time-dependent, scalar, and vector-valued problems posed on both structured and unstructured geometries is presented and demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed DeepONet-based deflated PCG method, as well as its generalization across a wide range of model parameters and problem resolutions.</description>

      <title>Partial Floquet Transformation and Model Order Reduction of Linear Time-Periodic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-periodic dynamical systems occur commonly both in nature and as engineered systems. Large-scale linear time-periodic dynamical systems, for example, may arise through linearization of a nonlinear system about a given periodic solution (possibly as a consequence of a baseline periodic forcing) with subsequent spatial discretization. The potential need to simulate responses to a wide variety of input profiles (viewed as perturbations off a baseline periodic forcing) creates a potent incentive for effective model reduction strategies applicable to linear time-periodic (LTP) systems. Classical approaches that take into account the underlying time-periodic system structure often utilize the Floquet transform; however, computation of the Floquet transform is typically intractable for large order systems. In this paper, we develop the notion of a partial Floquet transformation connected to selected invariant subspaces of a time-varying differential operator associated with the LTP system. We modify and repurpose the Dominant Pole Algorithm of Rommes to identify effective invariant subspaces useful for model reduction. We discuss the construction of associated partial Floquet transformations and time-varying reduction bases with which to produce effective reduced-order LTP models and illustrate the process on a simple time-periodic system.</description>

      <title>A reduced-IRKA method for large-scale $\mathcal{H}_2$-optimal model order reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $\mathcal{H}_2$-optimal Model Order Reduction (MOR) is one of the most significant frameworks for reduction methodologies for linear dynamical systems. In this context, the Iterative Rational Krylov Algorithm (\IRKA) is a well established method for computing an optimal projection space of fixed dimension $r$, when the system has small or medium dimensions. However, for large problems the performance of \IRKA\ is not satisfactory. In this paper, we introduce a new rational Krylov subspace projection method with conveniently selected shifts, that can effectively handle large-scale problems. The projection subspace is generated sequentially, and the \IRKA\ procedure is employed on the projected problem to produce a new optimal rational space of dimension $r$ for the reduced problem, and the associated shifts. The latter are then injected to expand the projection space. Truncation of older information of the generated space is performed to limit memory requirements. Numerical experiments on benchmark problems illustrate the effectiveness of the new method.</description>

      <title>A COGENT case study: Supporting Applications with Chombo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a case study of how a software framework (Chombo) supported the specific needs of a scientific application (COGENT). Since its inception in 2000, the Chombo framework has supported various applications. One example of such support has been the collaboration with the Edge Simulation Laboratory to build the COGENT model. The specific needs of the COGENT effort required the design and implementation of a set of new capabilities in the Chombo framework, such as higher-order mapped-multiblock discretizations and multi-dimensional code organization. These capabilities allowed COGENT to develop a unique simulation capability for modeling the edge layers in tokamaks. Once developed, these capabilities were able to support other applications which had similar needs.</description>

      <title>A new addition theorem for the 3-D Navier-Lam\'e system and its application to the method of fundamental solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain a new addition theorem for the fundamental solution of the Navier-Lam\'e system in dimension 3 satisfying the Kupradze radiation conditions. This provides an expansion of this fundamental solution that involves only the evaluation of Bessel functions and scalar spherical harmonics. This is particularly useful in collocation numerical methods based on fundamental solutions, such as the boundary element method or the method of fundamental solutions. For this last method, we show its efficiency when approximating the Navier-Lam\'e system in exterior domains.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present paper is a numerical study of the dynamics of solitary wave solutions of the fractional nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation, whose existence was analyzed by the authors in the first part of the project. The computational study will be made from the approximation of the periodic initial-value problem with a fully discrete scheme consisting of a Fourier spectral method for the spatial discretization and a fourth-order, Runge-Kutta-Composition method as time integrator. Several issues regarding the stability of the waves, such as the effects of small and large perturbations, interactions of solitary waves and the resolution of initial data into trains of waves are discussed.</description>

      <title>Towards a mixed-precision ADI method for Lyapunov equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply mixed-precision to the low-rank Lyapunov ADI (LR-ADI) by performing certain aspects of the algorithm in a lower working precision. Namely, we accumulate the overall solution, solve the linear systems comprising the ADI iteration, and store the inner low-rank factors of the residuals in various combinations of IEEE 754 single and double precision. We empirically test our implementation on Lyapunov equations arising from first- and second-order descriptor systems. For the first-order examples, accumulating the solution in single-precision yields an almost-as-small residual as for the double-precision solution. For certain applications, like computing the H2 norm of a descriptor system, low- or mixed-precision variants of the ADI can be quite competitive</description>

      <title>Scalable Spectrum Availability Prediction using a Markov Chain Framework and ITU-R Propagation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spectrum resources are often underutilized across time and space, motivating dynamic spectrum access strategies that allow secondary users to exploit unused frequencies. A key challenge is predicting when and where spectrum will be available (i.e., unused by primary licensed users) in order to enable proactive and interference-free access. This paper proposes a scalable framework for spectrum availability prediction that combines a two-state Markov chain model of primary user activity with high-fidelity propagation models from the ITU-R (specifically Recommendations P.528 and P.2108). The Markov chain captures temporal occupancy patterns, while the propagation models incorporate path loss and clutter effects to determine if primary signals exceed interference thresholds at secondary user locations. By integrating these components, the proposed method can predict spectrum opportunities both in time and space with improved accuracy. We develop the system model and algorithm for the approach, analyze its scalability and computational efficiency, and discuss assumptions, limitations, and potential applications. The framework is flexible and can be adapted to various frequency bands and scenarios. The results and analysis show that the proposed approach can effectively identify available spectrum with low computational cost, making it suitable for real-time spectrum management in cognitive radio networks and other dynamic spectrum sharing systems.</description>

      <title>Graph Lineages and Skeletal Graph Products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graphs, and sequences of growing graphs, can be used to specify the architecture of mathematical models in many fields including machine learning and computational science. Here we define structured graph "lineages" (ordered by level number) that grow in a hierarchical fashion, so that: (1) the number of graph vertices and edges increases exponentially in level number; (2) bipartite graphs connect successive levels within a graph lineage and, as in multigrid methods, can constrain matrices relating successive levels; (3) using prolongation maps within a graph lineage, process-derived distance measures between graphs at successive levels can be defined; (4) a category of "graded graphs" can be defined, and using it low-cost "skeletal" variants of standard algebraic graph operations and type constructors (cross product, box product, disjoint sum, and function types) can be derived for graded graphs and hence hierarchical graph lineages; (5) these skeletal binary operators have similar but not identical algebraic and category-theoretic properties to their standard counterparts; (6) graph lineages and their skeletal product constructors can approach continuum limit objects. Additional space-efficient unary operators on graded graphs are also derived: thickening, which creates a graph lineage of multiscale graphs, and escalation to a graph lineage of search frontiers (useful as a generalization of adaptive grids and in defining "skeletal" functions). The result is an algebraic type theory for graded graphs and (hierarchical) graph lineages. The approach is expected to be well suited to defining hierarchical model architectures - "hierarchitectures" - and local sampling, search, or optimization algorithms on them. We demonstrate such application to deep neural networks (including visual and feature scale spaces) and to multigrid numerical methods.</description>

      <title>Sinusoidal Approximation Theorem for Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem states that any continuous multivariable function can be exactly represented as a finite superposition of continuous single variable functions. Subsequent simplifications of this representation involve expressing these functions as parameterized sums of a smaller number of unique monotonic functions. These developments led to the proof of the universal approximation capabilities of multilayer perceptron networks with sigmoidal activations, forming the alternative theoretical direction of most modern neural networks.
  Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have been recently proposed as an alternative to multilayer perceptrons. KANs feature learnable nonlinear activations applied directly to input values, modeled as weighted sums of basis spline functions. This approach replaces the linear transformations and sigmoidal post-activations used in traditional perceptrons. Subsequent works have explored alternatives to spline-based activations. In this work, we propose a novel KAN variant by replacing both the inner and outer functions in the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation with weighted sinusoidal functions of learnable frequencies. Inspired by simplifications introduced by Lorentz and Sprecher, we fix the phases of the sinusoidal activations to linearly spaced constant values and provide a proof of its theoretical validity. We also conduct numerical experiments to evaluate its performance on a range of multivariable functions, comparing it with fixed-frequency Fourier transform methods and multilayer perceptrons (MLPs). We show that it outperforms the fixed-frequency Fourier transform and achieves comparable performance to MLPs.</description>

Abstract: In 1954, Alston S. Householder published Principles of Numerical Analysis, one of the first modern treatments on matrix decomposition that favored a (block) LU decomposition-the factorization of a matrix into the product of lower and upper triangular matrices. And now, matrix decomposition has become a core technology in machine learning, largely due to the development of the backpropagation algorithm in fitting a neural network. The sole aim of this survey is to give a self-contained introduction to concepts and mathematical tools in numerical linear algebra and matrix analysis in order to seamlessly introduce matrix decomposition techniques and their applications in subsequent sections. However, we clearly realize our inability to cover all the useful and interesting results concerning matrix decomposition, given the paucity of scope to present this discussion, e.g., the separated analysis of the Euclidean space, Hermitian space, Hilbert space, and things in the complex domain. We refer the reader to literature in the field of linear algebra for a more detailed introduction to the related fields.</description>

      <title>Propagation of chaos in infinite horizon and numerical stability for stochastic McKean-Vlasov equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12699v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the numerical stability of stochastic McKean-Vlasov equations (SMVEs) via the stochastic particle method. Firstly, the long-time propagation of chaos in the mean-square sense is obtained, and the almost sure propagation in infinite horizon is also proved. Next, when the coefficients satisfy linear growth conditions, the mean-square and almost sure exponential stabilities of the Euler-Maruyama (EM) scheme associated with the corresponding interacting particle system are shown through an ingenious manipulation of empirical measure. Then, for the case that the state variables in drift and diffusion are both superlinear, the mean-square exponential stability of the backward EM scheme for the interacting system is achieved without the particle corruption, which is a novel conclusion. Moreover, under the linear growth condition on the diffusion coefficient, the almost sure stability of the backward EM scheme is studied. Combining these assertions enables the numerical solutions to reproduce the stabilities of the original SMVEs. The examples, including a feedback control problem and a stochastic opinion dynamics model, are provided to demonstrate the importance of theoretical analysis of numerical stability.</description>

      <title>A fully segregated and unconditionally stable IMEX scheme for dispersed multiphase flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02629v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Euler--Euler or volume-averaged Navier--Stokes equations are used in various applications to model systems with two or more interpenetrating phases. Each fluid obeys its own momentum and mass equations, and the phases are typically coupled via drag forces and a shared pressure. Monolithic solvers can therefore be very expensive and difficult to implement, so there is great computational appeal for decoupled methods. However, splitting the subproblems requires treating the coupling terms (pressure and drag) explicitly, which must be done carefully to avoid time-step restrictions. In this context, we derive a new first-order pressure-correction method based on the incompressibility of the mean velocity field, combined with an explicit treatment of the drag forces. Furthermore, both the convective and viscous terms are treated semi-implicitly. This gives us an implicit-explicit (IMEX) method that is very robust not only due to its unconditional energy stability, but also because it does not require any type of fixed-point iterations. Each time step has only linear, scalar transport equations and a single pressure Poisson problem as building blocks. We rigorously prove temporal stability without any CFL-like conditions, and the theory is confirmed through two-phase numerical examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01762v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quality of simplex mesh is crucial for the stability and accuracy of numerical simulations in finite element analysis and computational geometry. However, the presence of sliver elements in 3D simplex mesh can severely impact the results. This paper presents a novel method based on a radius ratio energy function to optimize the quality of simplex mesh elements. This method can effectively eliminate sliver elements, thereby enhancing mesh quality.The gradient of the proposed energy function can be decomposed into a matrix-vector product. With minor processing, the matrix becomes symmetric positive definite, and this symmetric positive definite matrix can serve as a preconditioner to significantly accelerate the optimization process. Experimental results demonstrate that this method has significant advantages in eliminating sliver elements and improving mesh quality.</description>

      <title>Dynamic analysis of free-free Timoshenko beams on elastic foundation under transverse transient ground deformation</title>

Abstract: Underground infrastructure, such as pipelines and tunnels, can be vulnerable to the effect of transient ground deformation (TGD) caused by different vibration sources, including earthquakes and traffic loads. Current design methods are based on simple analytical models that idealize the soil movement as a traveling sinusoidal wave, neglecting both the system inertia and the relative displacement at the soil-structure interface. However, this assumption may not be valid for buried large diameter pipelines and tunnels requiring accurate dynamic analysis. To analyse the dynamic response of a buried straight beam subjected to transverse TGD, this study introduces a new semi-analytical model based on the Timoshenko beam on Winkler foundation theory. The closed-form analytical solution revealed that the vibration spectrum is divided in four parts, separated by three transition frequencies. Across each transition frequency, the oscillatory characteristics of the vibration modes change, significantly affecting the dynamic response of the system. To verify the validity of the proposed model, this work analyses the case study of a buried steel water pipeline of varying lengths and operating conditions, subjected to transverse TGD. Comparison of the obtained analytical solutions with the finite element analysis results showed excellent agreement between the two approaches. The frequency response analysis revealed dynamic amplification of the soil-structure interaction for forcing frequencies near the system's fundamental frequency. These may fall within the range of dominant frequencies characterizing seismic waves, requiring accurate dynamic analysis. The proposed methodology provides a robust analytical framework for evaluating the primary factors impacting the dynamic behavior of buried beams, giving a deeper understanding of the system response under various sources of ground vibration.</description>

      <title>The algebraic structure of hyperinterpolation class on the sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00523v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the algebraic properties of the hyperinterpolation class $\mathbf{HC}(\mathbb{S}^d)$ on the unit sphere $ \mathbb{S}^d $. We focus on operators derived from the classical hyperinterpolation with bounded $ L_2 $ operator norms. By utilizing a discrete (semi) inner product framework, we develop the theory of hyper self-adjoint operators, hyper projection operators, and hyper semigroups. We analyze four specific operators: filtered, Lasso, hard thresholding, and generalized hyperinterpolations. We prove that the generalized hyperinterpolation operator is hyper self-adjoint and commutative with the hyperinterpolation operator. Additionally, we demonstrate that hard thresholding and classical hyperinterpolation operators form a hyper semigroup, with hard thresholding hyperinterpolation constituting the minimal prime hyper ideal. Finally, we establish that hyperinterpolation operators act as hyper homomorphisms on the hyper semigroup.</description>

      <title>A potential theory on weighted graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07961v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an analog to classic potential theory on weighted graphs. With nodes partitioned into exterior, boundary and interior nodes and an appropriate decomposition of the Laplacian, we define discrete analogues to the trace operators, the single and double layer potential operators, and the boundary layer operators. As in the continuum, these operators can represent exterior or interior harmonic functions with different boundary conditions. The formalism we introduce includes a discrete Calder\'on calculus and brings some well known results from potential theory to weighted graphs, e.g. on the spectrum of the Neumann-Poincar\'e operator. We illustrate the formalism with a cloaking strategy on weighted graphs which allows to hide an anomaly from the perspective of electrical measurements made away from the anomaly.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Mesh Refinement for Two-Phase Viscoelastic Fluid Mixture Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19974v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multiphase flows are an important class of fluid flow and their study facilitates the development of diverse applications in industrial, natural, and biomedical systems. We consider a model that uses a continuum description of both phases in which separate momentum equations are used for each phase along with a co-incompressibility condition on the velocity fields. The resulting system of equations poses numerical challenges due to the presence of multiple non-linear terms and the co-incompressibility condition, and the resulting fluid dynamics motivate the development of an adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) technique to accurately capture regions of high stresses and large material gradients while keeping computational costs low. We present an accurate, robust, and efficient computational method for simulating multiphase mixtures on adaptive grids, and utilize a multigrid solver to precondition the saddle-point system. We demonstrate that the AMR discretization asymptotically approaches second order accuracy in $L^1$, $L^2$ and $L^\infty$ norms. The solver can accurately resolve sharp gradients in the solution and, with the multigrid preconditioning strategy introduced herein, the linear solver iterations are independent of grid spacing. Our AMR solver offers a major cost savings benefit, providing up to ten fold speedup over a uniform grid in the numerical experiments presented here, with greater speedup possible depending on the problem set-up.</description>

      <title>Nystr\"om Type Exponential Integrators for Strongly Magnetized Charged Particle Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00288v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Calculating the dynamics of charged particles in electromagnetic fields (i.e. the particle pushing problem) is one of the most computationally intensive components of particle-in-cell (PIC) methods for plasma physics simulations. This task is especially challenging when the plasma is strongly magnetized, since in this case the particle motion consists of a wide range of temporal scales from highly oscillatory fast gyromotion to slow macroscopic behavior and the resulting numerical model is very stiff. Current state-of-the-art time integrators used to simulate particle motion have limitations given the severe numerical stiffness of the problem and more efficient methods are of interest. Recently, exponential integrators have been proposed as a promising new approach for these simulations and shown to offer computational advantages over commonly used schemes. Exponential methods can solve linear problems exactly and are A-stable. In this paper, the standard exponential algorithms framework is extended to derive Nystr\"om-type exponential methods that integrate the Newtonian equations of motion as a second-order differential equation. Specific Nystr\"om-type schemes of second and third orders are derived and applied to strongly magnetized particle pushing problems. Numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate that the Nystr\"om-type exponential integrators can provide significant improvement in computational efficiency over the standard exponential methods.</description>

      <title>Hybrid High-Order formulations with turbulence modelling capabilities for incompressible flow problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22480v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a Hybrid High-Order (HHO) formulation of the incompressible Navier--Stokes equations, that is well suited to be employed for the simulation of turbulent flows. The spatial discretization relies on hybrid velocity and pressure spaces and the temporal discretization is based on Explicit Singly Diagonal Implicit Runge-Kutta (ESDIRK) methods. The formulation possesses some attractive features that can be fruitfully exploited when high-fidelity computations are required, namely: pressure-robustness, conservation of mass enforced cell-by-cell up to machine precision, robustness in the inviscid limit, implicit high-order accurate time stepping with local time step adaptation, reduced memory footprint thanks to static condensation of both velocity and pressure, possibility to exploit inherited $p$-multilevel solution strategies to improve performance of iterative solvers. After demonstrating the relevant properties of the scheme in practice, performing challenging 2D and 3D test cases, we consider the simulation of the Taylor--Green Vortex flow problem at Reynolds 1600.</description>
