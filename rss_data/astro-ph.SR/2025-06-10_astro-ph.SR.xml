      <title>Anomalously fast core and envelope rotation in red giants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Red giants undergo dramatic and complex structural transformations as they evolve. Angular momentum is transported between the core and envelope during this epoch, a poorly understood process. Here, we infer envelope and core rotation rates from Kepler observations of $\sim$1517 red giants. While many measurements are consistent with the existing studies, our investigation reveals systematic changes in the envelope-to-core rotation ratio and we report the discovery of anomalies such as clump stars with rapidly rotating cores, and red giants with envelopes rotating faster than their cores. We propose binary interactions as a possible mechanism by which some of these cores and envelopes are spun up. These results pose challenges to current theoretical expectations and can have major implications for compact remnants born from stellar cores.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new framework for massive star evolution that is no longer driven by Dutch or other mass-loss rate Recipes, but which take the physics of Gamma or L/M dependent mass loss consistently into account. We first discuss the hot-star mass-loss kink and the transition mass loss rate between optically thin and thick winds, before discussing vertical stellar evolution, mass evaporation, and the maximum black hole (BH) mass. We end with a suggestion that a recently uncovered red supergiant (RSG) kink might be related to similar underlying L/M physics as the hot-star kink.</description>

      <title>Constraining Nuclear Mass Models Using r-process Observables with Multi-objective Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting nuclear masses is a longstanding challenge. One path forward is machine learning (ML) which trains on experimental data, but can suffer large errors when extrapolating toward neutron-rich species. In nature, such masses shape observables for the rapid neutron capture process (r-process), which in principle could inform ML models. Here we introduce a multi-objective optimization approach using the Pareto Front algorithm. We show that this technique, capable of identifying models which generate r-process abundances aligning with both Solar and stellar data, is a promising method to select ML models with reliable extrapolation power.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic orbit and variability of the Be star V1624 Cyg = 28 Cyg</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years the idea, first formulated many decades ago, that the Be phenomenon could be causally related to the duplicity of Be stars, has been repeatedly reconsidered from various perspectives. It is important, therefore, to have reliable information on Be stars, which are confirmed members of binary systems. This study is devoted to V1624 Cyg = 28 Cygni, which was recently identified as a binary with a compact secondary. By measuring the radial velocities (RVs) of the wings of the H alpha emission line and using archival data and published RVs from the International Ultraviolet Explorer, we demonstrate that the Be primary moves in the 359.26 d orbit found recently from interferometry. Our preliminary radial-velocity solution leads to binary masses of 5.6, and 0.66 solar masses. Moreover, we documented large and irregular spectral, brightness, and colour changes over a time interval of several decades to show that the object never completely lost its circumstellar matter.</description>

      <title>A Novel Fine Spectral Structure of Solar Radio Bursts with Periodic Beaded Stripes Observed by CBSm of CMP-II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel fine spectral structure in solar radio bursts has been discovered using the Chashan broadband solar radio spectrometer at meter wavelengths (CBSm), an instrument of the Chinese Meridian Project-Phase II (CMP-II). The structure features periodic narrow-band stripes with a typical recurrence time $&lt; 1 $ s (occasionally reaches 8 s), often drifting from high to low frequencies and accompanied by absorptions, with trailing stripes appearing at the end of preceding ones. Some stripes exhibit periodic beaded enhancements with a periodicity of $\sim$0.1 s. The beaded stripes are reported for the first time ever. Data from the DAocheng Radio Telescope (DART) indicate a radio emission brightness temperature exceeding $10^{9}$ K, originating above brightening loops in active region AR 13664. We proposed a novel generation mechanism of the periodic stripes on the basis of the double plasma resonance (DPR) instability, and explained the beaded substructure in terms of modulation by low-frequency magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves. The study highlights the CBSm's capability to detect high-resolution fine spectral structures and offers novel insights into the emission mechanism and source characteristics of solar radio bursts.</description>

      <title>FAUST XXVI. The dust opacity spectral indices of protostellar envelopes bridge the gap between interstellar medium and disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sub-millimetre dust opacity spectral index is a critical observable to constrain dust properties, such as the maximum grain size of an observed dust population. It has been widely measured at galactic scales and down to protoplanetary disks. However, because of observational and analytical challenges, quite a gap exists in measuring dust properties in the envelopes that feed newborn protostars and their disks. To fill this gap, we use sensitive dust continuum emission data at 1.2 and 3.1 mm from the ALMA FAUST Large Program and constrain the dust opacity millimetre spectral index around a sample of protostars. Our high-resolution data, along with a more refined methodology with respect to past efforts, allow us to disentangle disk and envelope contributions in the uv-plane, and thus measure spectral indices for the envelopes uncontaminated by the optically thick emission of the inner regions. First, we find that the young disks are small and optically thick. Secondly, we measure the dust opacity spectral index at envelope scales for n=11 sources: the beta of n=9 sources had never been constrained in the literature. We effectively double the number of sources for which the dust opacity spectral index beta has been measured at these scales. Third, combining the available literature measurements with our own (total n=18), we show how envelope spectral indices distribute between ISM-like and disk-like values, bridging the gap in the inferred dust evolution. Finally, we statistically confirm a significant correlation between beta and the mass of protostellar envelopes, previously suggested in the literature. Our findings indicate that the dust optical properties smoothly vary from the ISM, through envelopes and all the way down to disks. Multi-wavelength surveys are needed to further this study and make more general claims on dust evolution in its pathway from cloud to disks.</description>

      <title>Circumbinary disc interactions and stochastic dust obscuration in the post-asymptotic-giant-branch binary HD 213985</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: HD 213985 is an eccentric binary system with a post-AGB primary and a jet-launching secondary star. We confirm that the system photometric variability is likely due to obscuration by the inner edge of a circumbinary disc, similar to RVb-type RV Tau stars. The system has shown an increase in the orbital variability amplitude in optical photometric bands, along with irregular changes in its shape that often started to appear skewed. Variability in the Na D lines suggests that this behaviour may be driven by interactions between the circumbinary disc and outflows through the L2 Lagrange point. Moreover, HD 213985 has exhibited episodes of short-term fluctuations whose appearance is not strictly related to the orbital phase. This variability is consistent with obscuration by transient dust structure leading to weather-like variability patterns.</description>

      <title>Limb-Darkening Coefficients for the 4-Term and Power-2 Laws for the JWST Space Mission, Adopting PHOENIX Spherical Models at High Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling observations of transiting exoplanets or close binary systems by comparing the observations with theoretical light curves requires precise knowledge of the distribution of specific intensities across the stellar disk. We aim to facilitate this type of research by providing extensive tabulations of limb-darkening coefficients for 11 frequently used near- and mid-infrared passbands on the NIRCam, NIRISS, and NIRSpec instruments installed on board the James Webb Space Telescope. The calculation of the limb-darkening coefficients was based on spherically symmetric atmosphere models from the PHOENIX series, with high spectral resolution (approximately $10^{6}$ wavelengths), and covering the wavelength range $0.1-6.0~\mu$m. The models were computed for solar composition, and a microturbulent velocity of 1.0 km s$^{-1}$. We adopted two of the more accurate parametrizations for the coefficients: the 4-term law, and the power-2 law. We applied the Levenberg-Marquardt least-squares minimization method, with a strategy to determine the critical value $\mu_{\rm crit}$ of the cosine of the viewing angle near the limb that is designed to improve numerical accuracy. The limb-darkening coefficients were derived based on a total of 306 atmosphere models covering an effective temperature range of $2400-7800$ K, and a $\log g$ interval between 3.0 and 5.5. We discuss the quality of the fits to the specific intensities provided by the power-2 and 4-term laws, as well as by the often used quadratic law. Based on a comparison, we recommend the use of the 4-term or power-2 laws, in that order of preference.</description>

      <title>Four ages of rotating stars in the rotation--activity relationship and gyrochronology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Both of gyrochronology and the rotation-activity relationship are standard techniques to determine the evolution phase.The mismatch in the definition of the evolutionary phases has so far raised many issues in physics and mathematics and hampered the understanding of how the internal dynamo processes affect the observable properties.To address this problem, we seek a unified scheme that shows a one-to-one mapping from gyrochronology to the rotation--activity relationship.We obtained the chromospheric activity $R'_{\rm HK}$ of 6846 stars and their rotation periods to investigate the rotation--activity relationship.We apply a three-interval model to fit the relationship and find that it is best fitted by three intervals in the range of Ro$&lt;0.7$.We associate those intervals to the convective, gap and interface phases of gyrochronology.Furthermore,we suggest an additional epoch at late times of the I phase.We further use the three-interval models to fit the period--activity relationship in temperature bins and determine the duration of the transition phase as a function of effective temperature.By comparing the critical temperature and period of the g-to-I transition with the slowly rotating sequence of 10 young open clusters whose ages range from 1 Myr to 2.5 Gyr, we conclude that our new model finds the pure I sequence without fast rotating outliers, which defines the zero-age I sequence (ZAIS).We propose that there is an ambiguous consensus on when the I sequence starts to work.This ambiguity is from the visually convergent sequence of the color--period diagrams in open clusters.This visually convergent sequence is younger than the ZAIS and is actually the pre-I sequence that can be associated with the stall of the spin-down. Our results unify the rotation--activity relationship and gyrochonology for the stellar evolution of low-mass stars, for which we coined the ``CgIW" scenario.</description>

      <title>Heating Mechanisms and Radio Response from the Solar Chromosphere to Corona</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heating mechanism in the solar atmosphere (from chromosphere to corona) is one of the top-challenges in modern astronomy. The classic mechanisms can be divided into two categories: wave heating (W) and magnetic reconnection heating (X). Both of them still face some problems currently difficult to overcome. Recently, we proposed a new mechanism, called magnetic-gradient pumping heating (MGP, or P) which seems to overcome those difficulties, but still lacks sufficient observational evidence. Which one really explained the physics of hot corona exactly? How can observations be used to identify and verify the heating mechanism? Since different heating mechanism will generate non-thermal particles from different accelerations and experience different propagations, they will have different response on the broadband spectral radio observations. Among them, the non-thermal electrons from W mechanisms are closely related to shock-wave acceleration, and their radio response should be group of spike bursts with random distribution of drifting rates; the non-thermal electrons from X mechanisms are accelerated by reconnecting electric field with bidirectional flow, and their radio response should be type III pairs or spike pairs; P mechanism will produce energetic particle upflows, and their radio response should be unidirectional fiber bursts with moderate negative drifting rates. Therefore, the heating mechanism can be identified and verified from the the broadband dynamic spectral radio observations. Additionally, using high-resolution radioheliographs and spectral-imaging observations, the heating mechanisms in different regions can be identified and verified separately, thereby demonstrating the physical essence of hot corona.</description>

      <title>Variations in Dominant Wave Period in the Solar Atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Waves are an integral part of the solar atmosphere, and their characteristics (e.g., dominant period, range of periods, power, and phase angle) change on a diverse spatio-temporal scale. It is well well-established observationally that the dominant periods of solar oscillations are 5-min and 3-min in the photosphere and chromosphere, respectively. This shows that the wave spectra and their dominant periods evolve between these two layers. We present observational results that demonstrate variations of the dominant period with heights in the photosphere and chromosphere. Six photospheric absorption lines and one chromospheric line are analyzed by using the IRIS data, and the Doppler velocity time series at seven different atmospheric heights are determined. The wavelet analysis is applied to these time series, and the resulting spectrum of wave periods and its dominant period are deduced at these heights, which gives height variations of the dominant period. The obtained data shows that the dominant period decreases with height, and that there are also changes in the range of wave periods within the spectrum. Numerical simulations of filtered wave spectra through the solar atmosphere are also performed, and the obtained results match the observational data.</description>

      <title>Resolving the Unresolved: Using NESSI to Search for Unresolved Companions in Low-mass Disk Wide Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar systems consisting of three or more stars are not an uncommon occurrence in the Galaxy. Nearly 50% of solar-type wide binaries with separations &gt;1000 au are actually higher-order multiples with one component being a close binary. Additionally, the higher-order multiplicity fraction appears to be correlated with the physical separation of the widest component. These facts have motivated some of our current theories behind how the widest stellar systems formed, which can have separations on the order of or larger than protostellar cores. However, it is unclear if the correlation between wide binary separation and higher-order multiplicity extends to low-mass binaries. We present initial results of an ongoing speckle imaging survey of nearby low-mass wide binaries. We find an overall higher-order multiplicity fraction for our sample of $42.0\% \pm 10.9\%$. If we include systems where Gaia indicates that a companion is likely present, this fraction increases to $62.0\% \pm 14.2\%$. This is consistent with previous results from both higher-mass stars and a previous result for low-mass wide binaries. However, we do not detect the expected increase in higher-order multiplicity fraction with separation, as was seen with previous studies. We briefly explore why higher-order multiplicity statistics could be different in low-mass stars, and what the significance might be for models of wide binary formation.</description>

      <title>Why Do Stars Turn Red? II. Solutions of Steady-State Stellar Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To investigate the physical origin of red giants (RGs) and red supergiants (RSGs), we construct steady-state models of stellar envelopes by explicitly solving the stellar structure equations, with boundary conditions set at the stellar surface and the hydrogen burning shell. For comparison, we consider both polytropic and realistic models. Polytropic models adopt a polytropic equation of state (EOS) and neglect energy transport, while realistic models incorporate radiative and convective energy transport, along with tabulated EOS and opacities. Our steady-state solutions reproduce three key features relevant to the evolution toward the RG/RSG phase. First, the refined mirror principle of \cite{Ou2024} is reproduced: the stellar radius varies inversely with the radius of the envelope's inner boundary, defined by the burning shell's surface. This feature arises purely from hydrostatic equilibrium, as it appears in both polytropic and realistic models. Second, realistic models reveal an upper limit to envelope expansion, corresponding to an effective temperature of $\sim4,000\,{\rm K}$, which is characteristic of RG/RSG stars and consistent with the classical Hayashi limit. Approaching this limit, the envelope undergoes a structural transition marked by a significant change in the density profile and the formation of an extended convective zone. The location of this limit is governed by the sharp drop in H$^{-}$ opacity as the envelope cools below $\sim10,000\,{\rm K}$. Finally, our solutions show that even a small shift in the envelope's inner boundary can induce substantial envelope expansion throughout the yellow regime, naturally explaining the bifurcation of giants and supergiants into red and blue branches.</description>

      <title>Blue Stragglers prefer peaceful environments because binaries do the same</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blue straggler stars (BSSs) are core hydrogen-burning stars routinely observed in resolved stellar systems. According to the theory of single star evolution they should not exist because, due to their large mass, they should have already evolved to stellar remnants. Hence, they are suspected to be the result of mass-enhancement processes, like mass-transfer activity in binary systems, mergers in binary or higher order systems, or direct stellar collisions, possibly mediated by dynamical interactions. Galactic globular clusters (GGCs) are templates of collisional stellar systems, where frequent gravitational interactions among stars occur on timescales shorter than their age. Thus, in these systems the number of BSSs originated by stellar collisions is expected to increase with the local stellar density and the collision rate. Here we analyse a sample of more than 3000 BSSs homogeneously observed in 48 GGCs with different structures, and we find that the number of BSSs normalized to the sampled luminosity anti-correlates (instead of correlating) with the central density, the collision rate, and the dynamical age of the parent cluster. We also find strikingly similar trends between these environmental properties and the cluster binary fraction, indicating that the latter decreases in high density/high collisional regions. We finally demonstrate that the correlations found between BSSs and the environmental parameters are explained by an underlying dependence of the BSS specific frequency on binary fraction. Once inserted in the context of the current knowledge of the BSS phenomenon, these correlations indicate that low-density regions (possibly because of a higher binary production/survival rate) are the natural habitat of both BSSs and binary systems, and the observed BSSs mostly have a binary-related origin mediated by the environmental conditions.</description>

      <title>Determining the methanol deuteration in the disk around V883 Orionis with laboratory measured spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deuterium fractionation, as studied through mono-deuterated methanol, is frequently used as a diagnostic tool to trace the physical conditions and chemical evolution of interstellar sources. This study investigates methanol deuteration in the disk around V883 Ori, utilising recent laboratory spectroscopic data for CH$_2$DOH and CH$_3$OD along with ALMA observations. The derived column densities for CH$_2$DOH and CH$_3$OD are (5.14$\pm$0.08) $\times $10$^{16}$ cm$^{-2}$ and (4.22$\pm$0.06) $\times$ 10$^{16}$ cm$^{-2}$, respectively. The analysis demonstrates the influence of spectroscopic data on determining molecular column density, excitation temperature, and, most importantly, the inferred D/H ratio. The D/H ratio for CH$_2$DOH is calculated to be (7.3$\pm$1.5) $\times$ 10$^{-3}$ after applying a statistical correction, whilst the D/H ratio for CH$_3$OD is (1.79$\pm$0.36) $\times$ 10$^{-2}$. The discovery of an unexpectedly low CH$_2$DOH/CH$_3$OD ratio (1.22$\pm$0.02) in V883 Ori, however, raises further questions about the synthesis and chemical processes involved in CH$_3$OD formation. Overall, this study underscores the importance of accurate spectroscopic data for studies of isotopic fractionation and provides new insights into methanol deuteration chemistry in star-forming regions. Future research, combining updated spectroscopy and chemical modelling, will help further constrain these processes across different masses and evolutionary stages.</description>

      <title>SDSS-V Milky Way Mapper (MWM): ASPCAP Stellar Parameters and Abundances in SDSS-V Data Release 19</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to describe the science verification of Milky Way Mapper (MWM) ASPCAP data products published in Data Release 19 (DR19) of the fifth phase of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-V). We compare MWM ASPCAP atmospheric parameters T$_{\rm eff}$, log g, 24 abundances of 21 elements (carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen have multiple sources for deriving their abundance values) and their uncertainties determined from APOGEE spectrograph spectra with those of the literature and evaluate their accuracy and precision. We also test the zero-point calibration of the v$_{\rm rad}$ derived by the APOGEE Data Reduction Pipeline. This data release contains ASPCAP parameters for 964,989 stars, including all APOGEE-2 targets expanded with new observations of 336,511 stars from the Apache Point Observatory (APO) observed until 4 July 2023. Overall, the new T$_{\rm eff}$ values show excellent agreement with the IRFM scale, while the surface gravities exhibit slight systematic offsets compared to asteroseisimic gravities. The estimated precision of T$_{\rm eff}$ is between 50 and 70 K for giants and 70$-$100 K for dwarfs, while surface gravities are measured with a precision of 0.07$-$0.09 dex for giants. We achieve an estimated precision of 0.02$-$0.04 dex for multiple elements, including metallicity, $\alpha$, Mg, and Si, while the precision of at least 10 elements is better than 0.1 dex.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Parameters for Central Stars of 103 Infrared Bowshock Nebulae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar bowshock nebulae are arcuate shock fronts formed by the interaction of radiation-driven stellar winds and the relative motion of the ambient interstellar material. Stellar bowshock nebulae provide a promising means to measure wind-driven mass loss, independent of other established methods. In this work, we characterize the stellar sources at the center of bowshock nebulae drawn from all-sky catalogs of 24 $\mu$m-selected nebulae. We obtain new, low-resolution blue optical spectra for \numstars~stars and measure stellar parameters temperature \teff, surface gravity \logg, and projected rotational broadening \vsini. We perform additional photometric analysis to measure stellar radius \rstar, luminosity \lstar, and visual-band extinction $A_V$. All but one of our targets are O and early B stars, with temperatures ranging from $T$=16.5--46.8~k\kelvin, gravities $\log g=$2.57--4.60, and \vsini~from $&lt;$100--400~\kms. With the exception of rapid rotator $\zeta$ Oph, bowshock stars do not rotate at or near critical velocities. At least 60 of 103 (60\%) OB bowshock stars are binaries, consistent with the multiplicity fraction of other OB samples. The sample shows a runaway fraction of 23\%, with \numrunaway~stars having $v_{\text{2D}}\geq25$~\kms. Of the 19 runaways, at least 15 ($\geq$79\%) are binaries, favoring dynamical ejection over the binary supernova channel for producing runaways. We provide a comprehensive census of stellar parameters for bowshock stars, useful as a foundation for determining the mass-loss rates for OB-type stars -- one of the single most critical factors in stellar evolution governing the production of neutron stars and black holes.</description>

      <title>New Insights into the T Tauri Binary Separation Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For three decades, adaptive optic surveys have revealed an excess of T Tauri binaries across a = 10-100 au in nearby star-forming regions compared to the field population of main-sequence (MS) stars. Such an excess requires that most stars are born in dense clusters and subjected to significant dynamical processing that disrupts such binaries across intermediate separations. However, we demonstrate that the apparent excess is due to an observational selection bias. Close binaries within a &lt; 100 au clear out their dusty circumstellar disks on faster timescales compared to wide binaries and single stars. A magnitude-limited sample is therefore biased toward close binaries that have preferentially cleared out their obscuring disks. We re-examine the separation distribution of pre-MS binaries in low-density Taurus, moderately dense Upper Scorpius, and the extremely dense Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC). By limiting the samples to primary spectral type / mass instead of magnitude, the artificial excess across a = 10-100 au disappears in all three environments. Across wider separations a = 100-4,000 au, Taurus exhibits an excess of companions (mostly tertiaries), the ONC displays a deficit, and Upper Scorpius matches the field MS population. The field derives from an amalgam of all three environments, where Upper Scorpius corresponds to the average birth environment of solar-type stars. The total binary fraction within a &lt; 10,000 au in Taurus is only 52% +/- 7%, substantially lower than the 100% inferred from the biased observations and only slightly higher than the field MS value of 45%. N-body interactions preferentially disrupt outer tertiaries with only marginal dynamical processing of the inner binaries, especially those within a &lt; 100 au.</description>

      <title>A Detection of Helium in the Bright Superluminous Supernova SN 2024rmj</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present extensive ultraviolet (UV), optical, and near-infrared (NIR) photometric and spectroscopic observations of the nearby hydrogen-poor superluminous supernova (SLSN-I) SN2024rmj at z = 0.1189. SN 2024rmj reached a peak absolute magnitude of Mg $\approx$ -21.9, placing it at the luminous end of the SLSN-I distribution. The light curve exhibits a pronounced pre-peak bump ($\approx$ 60 d before the main peak) and a post-peak bump ($\approx$ 55 d after the main peak). The bulk of the light curve is otherwise well fit by a magnetar spin-down model, with typical values (spin: $\approx$ 2.1 ms; magnetic field: $\approx$ 6 $\times$ 10$^{13}$ G; ejecta mass: $\approx$ 12 M$_\odot$). The optical spectra exhibit characteristic SLSN-I features and evolution, but with a relatively high velocity of $\approx$ 8,000 km s$^{-1}$ post-peak. Most significantly, we find a clear detection of helium in the NIR spectra at He I $\lambda$1.083 $\mu$m and $\lambda$2.058 $\mu$m, blueshifted by $\approx$ 15,000 km s$^{-1}$ (13 d before peak) and $\approx$ 13,000 km s$^{-1}$ (40 d after peak), indicating that helium is confined to the outermost ejecta; based on these NIR detections, we also identify likely contribution from He I $\lambda$5876 \r{A} in the optical spectra on a similar range of timescales. This represents the most definitive detection of helium in a bright SLSN-I to date, and indicates that progenitors with a thin helium layer can still explode as SLSNe.</description>

      <title>Grand Design Spiral Arms in the Compact, Embedded Protoplanetary Disk of Haro 6-13</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Millimeter continuum spiral arms have so far only been detected in a handful of protoplanetary disks, and thus we have a limited understanding of the circumstances in which they can form. In particular, substructures in small disks ($R\lessapprox 50$ au) have not been well-characterized in comparison with large disks. We present ALMA 1.3 mm continuum observations of the disk around the T Tauri star Haro 6-13 at a resolution of $\sim0.04''$ ($\sim5$ au). A pair of low-contrast spiral arms are detected at disk radii from $\sim10-35$ au. They can be approximated as Archimedean spirals with pitch angles ranging from $\sim10-30^\circ$. The low value of the disk-averaged spectral index between 1.3 and 3 mm ($\alpha=2.1$) and the high brightness temperatures suggest that the millimeter continuum is likely optically thick and thus may hide sufficient mass for the disk to become gravitationally unstable and form spiral arms. CO observations have shown that Haro 6-13 is surrounded by an envelope, raising the possibility that infall is facilitating spiral arm formation.</description>

      <title>Multi-band, Multi-epoch Photometry of the Spot-crossing System TOI-3884: Refined System Geometry and Spot Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spot-crossing transits offer a unique opportunity to probe spot properties such as temperature, size, and surface distribution. TOI-3884 is a rare system in which spot-crossing features are persistently observed during every transit. This is due to its unusual configuration: a polar-orbiting super-Neptune transits a pole-on mid-M dwarf, repeatedly crossing a polar spot. However, previous studies have reported discrepant values in key system parameters, such as stellar inclination and obliquity. To address this, we conducted multi-band, multi-epoch transit observations of TOI-3884b using the MuSCAT instrument series, along with photometric monitoring with the LCO 1m telescopes/Sinistro. We detected time-dependent variations in the spot-crossing signals, indicating that the spot is not exactly on the pole. From the monitoring data, we measured a stellar rotation period of $11.043_{-0.053}^{+0.054}$ days with a modulation amplitude of $\sim$5% in the r-band, consistent with the time variability in the spot-crossing features. Our analysis reconciles previous discrepancies and improves the constraints on the parameters of the system geometry ($i_\star = 40.1^{+2.0}_{-1.2}$ deg and $\lambda =139.0^{+9.0}_{-3.7}$ deg) and those of the spot properties (spot radius of $0.425_{-0.011}^{+0.018} R_\star$ and spot-photosphere temperature difference of $200_{-9}^{+11}$ K). These results provide a critical context for interpreting upcoming transmission spectroscopy of TOI-3884b, as well as yielding new insights into the magnetic activity and spin-orbit geometry of M dwarfs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use a simple and straightforward method to derive the energy partition in magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) turbulence that was first studied by Lee and then more rigorously by Chandrasekhar. By investigating the energy equation we find that the turbulent viscous and ohmic dissipations are comparable to each other. Under the condition that turbulent viscosity and turbulent magnetic diffusivity are comparable, we deduce that the ratio of kinetic to magnetic energies depends on the ratio of the turbulent magnetic lengthscale to turbulent velocity lengthscale of the largest eddies. When the two largest lengthscales are comparable, the two energies are in equipartition.</description>

Abstract: We present a study of LLM integration in final-year undergraduate astronomy education, examining how students develop AI literacy through structured guidance and documentation requirements. We developed AstroTutor, a domain-specific astronomy tutoring system enhanced with curated arXiv content, and deployed it alongside general-purpose LLMs in the course. Students documented their AI usage through homework reflections and post-course surveys. We analyzed student evolution in AI interaction strategies and conducted experimental comparisons of LLM-assisted versus traditional grading methods. LLM grading showed strong correlation with human evaluation while providing more detailed and consistent feedback. We also piloted LLM-facilitated interview-based examinations as a scalable alternative to traditional assessments, demonstrating potential for individualized evaluation that addresses common testing limitations. Students experienced decreased rather than increased reliance on LLMs over the semester, developing critical evaluation skills and strategic tool selection. They evolved from basic assistance-seeking to verification workflows, with documentation requirements fostering metacognitive awareness. Students developed effective prompting strategies, contextual enrichment techniques, and cross-verification practices. Our findings suggest that structured LLM integration with transparency requirements and domain-specific tools can enhance astronomy education while building essential AI literacy skills. We provide implementation guidelines for educators and make our AstroTutor repository freely available.</description>

      <title>Candidate red supergiants from Gaia DR3 BPRP spectra: From the Perseus to the Scutum-Crux spiral arms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. Our position within the Galactic plane and the dust obscuration make it challenging to retrieve a true picture of the Milky Way's morphology. While the Milky Way has been recognized as a barred spiral galaxy since the 1960s, there is still uncertainty about the exact number of spiral arms it contains. Currently, our understanding of the Galaxy is evolving thanks to the unprecedented detail provided by Gaia's parallactic distances. Aims. To shed light on the spatial distribution of red supergiants (RSGs) on the Disk and their uniformity of parameters across it, a census of Galactic RSGs detected by Gaia is needed. Methods. Candidate RSGs were extracted from the combined Gaia DR3 and 2MASS catalogs using color criteria and parallactic distances. The sample includes 335 stars that were not included in catalogs of previously known RSGs detected by Gaia DR3. Interstellar and circumstellar extinction values were estimated from the infrared bands. Spectral types were collected from Simbad or VIZIER databases and, for 135 candidates, were inferred from the Gaia DR3 BPRP spectra. Stellar luminosities were inferred using photometric measurements and the Gaia DR3 distances. Results. The analysis yielded a genuine sample of O-rich late-type stars, and the calculated luminosities confirm that the sample is mostly made of stars brighter than Mbol=-5 mag. This new sample represents a 40% increase in the number of highly probable RSGs compared to previous studies. When looking at the X and Y distribution on the Galactic plane, beside the populous Perseus associations of RSGs and the Sagittarius group of RSGs, a novel population of highly probable RSGs populating the more distant Scutum-Centaurus arm appears.</description>

      <title>Main-sequence Turnoff Stars as Probes of the Ancient Galactic Relic: Chemo-dynamical Analysis of a Pilot Sample</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The main-sequence turnoff (MSTO) stars well preserve the chemical properties where they were born, making them ideal tracers for studying the stellar population. We perform a detailed chemo-dynamical analysis on moderately metal-poor ($-2.0&lt;\mathrm{[Fe/H]}&lt;-1.0$) MSTO stars to explore the early accretion history of the Milky Way. Our sample includes four stars observed with high-resolution spectroscopy using CFHT/ESPaDOnS and 163 nearby MSTO stars selected from the SAGA database with high-resolution results. Within the action-angle spaces, we identified Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE, 35), stars born in the Milky Way (in situ, 31), and other substructures (21). We find that both GSE and in-situ stars present a similar Li plateau around $A(\mathrm{Li)}\sim 2.17$. GSE shows a clear $\alpha$-knee feature in Mg at $\mathrm{[Fe/H]}\sim-1.60\pm 0.06$, while the $\alpha$-elements of in-situ stars remain nearly constant within the metallicity range. The iron-peak elements show little difference between GSE and in-situ stars except for Zn and Ni, which decrease in GSE at $\mathrm{[Fe/H]}&gt;-1.6$, while they remain constant in in-situ stars. Among heavy elements, GSE shows overall enhancement in Eu, with [Ba/Eu] increasing with the metallicity, while this ratio remains almost constant for in-situ stars, suggesting the contribution of longer time-scale sources to the $s$-process in GSE. Moreover, for the first time, we present the $r$-process abundance pattern for an extremely $r$-process enhanced ($r$-II) GSE star, which appears consistent with the solar $r$-process pattern except for Pr. Further investigation of larger GSE samples using high-resolution spectra is required to explore the reason for the significantly higher Pr in the GSE r-II star.</description>

      <title>A circularly polarized low-frequency radio burst from the exoplanetary system HD 189733</title>

Abstract: We aim to detect low-frequency radio emission from exoplanetary systems, which can provide insights into planetary magnetic fields, star-planet interactions, stellar activity, and exo-space weather. The HD 189733 system, hosting a well-studied hot Jupiter, is a prime target for such searches. We conducted NenuFAR imaging observations in the 15-62 MHz range, in order to cover the entire orbital phase of HD 189733 b. Dynamic spectra were generated for the target and other sources in the field, followed by a transient search in the time-frequency plane. The data processing pipeline incorporated direction-dependent calibration and noise characterization to improve sensitivity. We also searched for periodic signals using Lomb-Scargle analysis. A highly circularly polarized radio burst was detected at 50 MHz with a flux density of 1.5 Jy and a significance of 6 sigma at the position of HD 189733. No counterpart was found in Stokes I, likely because the emission is embedded in confusion noise and remains below the detection threshold. The estimated minimum fractional circular polarization of 38% suggests a coherent emission process. A periodicity search revealed no weaker signals linked to the planet's orbital period, the star's rotational period, or the synodic period and harmonic period between them. The burst's properties are consistent with cyclotron maser instability (CMI) emission, but the origin is still ambiguous. The comparison with theoretical models suggests star-planet interaction or stellar activity as potential origins. However, alternative explanations such as contamination from other sources along the line of sight (e.g. the companion M dwarf) or noise fluctuation cannot be ruled out.</description>

      <title>A giant planet transiting a 0.2 solar mass host star</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Planet formation models suggest that the formation of giant planets is significantly harder around low-mass stars, due to the scaling of protoplanetary disc masses with stellar mass. The discovery of giant planets orbiting such low-mass stars thus imposes strong constraints on giant planet formation processes. Here, we report the discovery of a transiting giant planet orbiting a $0.207 \pm 0.011 M_{\odot}$ star. The planet, TOI-6894 b, has a mass and radius of $M_P = 0.168 \pm 0.022 M_J (53.4 \pm 7.1 M_{\oplus})$ and $R_P = 0.855 \pm 0.022 R_J$, and likely includes $12 \pm 2 M_{\oplus}$ of metals. The discovery of TOI-6894 b highlights the need for a better understanding of giant planet formation mechanisms and the protoplanetary disc environments in which they occur. The extremely deep transits (17% depth) make TOI-6894 b one of the most accessible exoplanetary giants for atmospheric characterisation observations, which will be key for fully interpreting the formation history of this remarkable system and for the study of atmospheric methane chemistry.</description>

      <title>Density jump as a function of the field for parallel relativistic collisionless shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collisionless shocks are frequently analyzed using the magnetohydrodynamic formalism (MHD), even though the required collisionality hypothesis is not fulfilled. In a previous work \citep{BretJPP2018}, we presented a model of collisionless shock displaying an important departure from the expected MHD behavior, in the case of a strong flow aligned magnetic field. This model was non-relativistic. Here, it is extended to the relativistic regime, considering zero upstream pressure and upstream Lorentz factor $\gg 1$. The result agrees satisfactorily with Particle-in-Cell simulations and shows a similar, and important, departure from the MHD prediction. In the strong field regime, the density jump $r$, seen in the downstream frame, behaves like $r \sim 2 + 1/\gamma_{\mathrm{up}}$ while MHD predicts 4 ($\gamma_{\mathrm{up}}$ is the Lorentz factor of the upstream measured in the downstream frame). Only pair plasmas are considered.</description>

      <title>Energy partitioning between thermal and non-thermal electrons and ions in magnetotail reconnection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17928v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic reconnection is an explosive energy release event. It plays an important role in accelerating particles to high non-thermal energies. These particles often exhibit energy spectra characterized by a power-law distribution. However, the partitioning of energy between thermal and non-thermal components, and between ions and electrons, remains unclear. This study provides estimates of energy partition based on a statistical analysis of magnetic reconnection events in Earth's magnetotail using data from the Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission. Ions are up to ten times more energetic than electrons but have softer spectra. We found for both ions and electrons that, as the average energy of particles (temperature) increases, their energy spectra become \textit{softer} (steeper) and thus, the fraction of energy carried by the non-thermal components decreases. These results challenge existing theories of particle acceleration through magnetotail reconnection.</description>

      <title>A post-common-envelope binary with double-peaked Balmer emission lines from TMTS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18202v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dynamical method provides an efficient way to discover post-common-envelope binaries (PCEB) with faint white dwarfs (WDs), thanks to the development of time-domain survey projects. We perform a comprehensive analysis of the PCEB system TMTS J15530469+4457458 (J1553), discovered by the Tsinghua University-Ma Huateng Telescopes for Survey, to explore its physical origin and evolutionary fate. This system is characterized by double-peaked Balmer emission lines, and a cross-correlation function is applied to derive its radial velocity (RV) from a series of phase-resolved Keck spectra. Analyses with the cross-correlation function suggest that this system is a single-lined spectroscopic binary and only one star is optically visible. Further analysis through Doppler tomography indicates that J1553 is a detached binary without an accretion disk. Under such a configuration, the simultaneous light-curve and RV fitting reveal that this system contains an unseen WD with mass $M_{\rm A}=0.56\pm 0.09\, M_{\odot}$, and an M4 dwarf with mass $M_{\rm B}=0.37\pm 0.02\,M_{\odot}$ and radius $R_{\rm B}=0.403^{+0.014}_{-0.015}\,R_{\odot}$. The extra prominent Balmer emission lines seen in the spectra can trace the motion of the WD, which are likely formed near the WD surface as a result of wind accretion. According to the MESA simulation, J1553 could have evolved from a binary consisting of a 2.0-4.0 ${M}_{\odot}$ zero-age-main-sequence star and an M dwarf with an initial orbital period $P_i\approx 201-476$ d, and the system has undergone a common-envelope (CE) phase. After about $3.3\times10^6$ yr, J1553 should evolve into a cataclysmic variable, with a transient state as a supersoft X-ray source at the beginning. J1553 is an excellent system for studying wind accretion, CE ejection physics, and binary evolution theory.</description>

      <title>Determination of Light Curve Parameters of Poorly Studied Eclipsing Variables Using Data from Tess and Other Sky Surveys</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21843v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A group of poorly studied eclipsing variables (the classification of which is marked as uncertain and/or the period of brightness changes is uncertain) has been studied with the using of the photometric observations of the TESS mission and NSVS, ASAS-SN sky surveys. We also obtained some observations covering the brightness minima of our variables by our group using the telescopes at Astronomical Observatory on Kolonica Saddle (Slovakia) and Observatory and Planetarium in Hlohovec (Slovakia) during the "Variable-2024" astrocamp. The periods and classification were corrected. For NSV 575 and NSV 014 the periods were found for the first time, but it is doubtful that NSV 014 is an eclipsing variable, because there are no eclipses but the asymmetric wave is present, which indicates that the variable star can be re-classified as a low-amplitude pulsating one. Different methods were used for approximation of the light curves and further calculation of stellar system's parameters such as eclipse depths and durations, values of reflection effect and effect of ellipticity of stars. The initial period was estimated using the periodogram based on the trigonometrical polynomial fit of high order (up to 10). For better approximation of the complete eclipsing phase curve, the "New Algol Variable" (NAV) software was used. The methods of "asymptotic parabolas" and "wall-supported asymptotic parabolas" were used for calculation of moments of eclipses, which use only near-eclipse part of the observations instead of a complete curve. These methods were implemented in the software MAVKA among a larger set of features. For the variables NSV 489 and NSV 1884, our moments of eclipses and the ones found in the literature, were used for the O-C curves. For NSV 489, the period was adjusted taking into account the slope of the O-C diagram.</description>

      <title>Benchmark brown dwarfs -- I. A blue M2 + T5 wide binary and a probable young [M4 + M4] + [T7 + T8] hierarchical quadruple</title>

Abstract: Benchmark brown dwarfs in wide binary systems are crucial for characterizing substellar objects and calibrating atmospheric and evolutionary models. However, brown dwarf benchmarks with subsolar metallicity, very cool temperatures, or suitability for dynamical mass measurements are rare, limiting our understanding across the full range of mass, age, and metallicity. We present the discovery of two new multiple systems containing T dwarf companions, identified through a targeted search using CatWISE2020 and Gaia catalogues. L 122-88 AB is a wide binary comprising a mildly metal-poor M2 dwarf and a T5 dwarf, separated by 215.6 arcsec at a distance of 33.106+/-0.014 pc. Atmospheric model fitting to the near infrared spectrum of L 122-88 A suggests a mildly metal-poor composition ([Fe/H] = -0.2). UPM J1040-3551 AB is a candidate hierarchical quadruple system at 25.283+/-0.013 pc, consisting of a likely astrometric binary of two M4 dwarfs and a probable unresolved spectral binary of T7 and T8 dwarfs, separated by 65.48 arcsec from the primary. The H-alpha emission detected in UPM J1040-3551 A indicates an age range of 0.3-2.0 Gyr. This age estimate suggests that the T8 component has a mass between 9 and 28 Jupiter masses, potentially classifying it as a planetary-mass object. These systems augment the sample of benchmark brown dwarfs, particularly in the underexplored regime of cool temperature, providing valuable opportunities for refining our understanding of substellar objects.</description>

      <title>Homogeneous Stellar Atmospheric Parameters and 22 Elemental Abundances for FGK Stars Derived From LAMOST Low-resolution Spectra with DD-Payne</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02763v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A deep understanding of our Galaxy desires detailed decomposition of its stellar populations via their chemical fingerprints. This requires precise stellar abundances of many elements for a large number of stars. Here we present an updated catalog of stellar labels derived from LAMOST low-resolution spectra in a physics-sensible and rigorous manner with DD-Payne, taking labels from high-resolution spectroscopy as training set. The catalog contains atmospheric parameters for 6.4 million stars released in LAMOST DR9, and abundances for 22 elements, namely, C, N, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Sr, Y, Zr, Ba, La, Ce, Nd, Sm, and Eu, for nearly 3.6 million stars with spectral signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) higher than 20. The [Fe/H] is valid down to $\sim$-4.0, while elemental abundance ratios [X/Fe] are mostly valid for stars with [Fe/H] $\gtrsim-2.0$. Measurement errors in these labels are sensitive to and almost inversely proportional with SNR. For stars with S/N&gt;50, we achieved a typical error of 30 K in Teff, 0.07 dex in $\log g$, $\sim0.05$ dex in abundances for most elements with atomic number smaller than Sr, and 0.1--0.2 dex for heavier elements. Homogenization to the label estimates is carried out via dedicated internal and external calibration. In particular, the non-local thermal equilibrium effect is corrected for the [Fe/H] estimates, the Teff is calibrated to the infrared flux method scale, and the $\log~g$ is validated with asteroseismic measurements. The elemental abundances are internally calibrated using wide binaries, eliminating systematic trend with effective temperature. The catalog is publicly available.</description>

      <title>Analysis of optical spectroscopy and photometry of the type I X-ray bursting system UW CrB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06404v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: UW Coronae Borealis (UW CrB) is a low mass X-ray binary that shows both Type 1 X-ray and optical bursts, which typically last for 20 s. The system has a binary period of close to 2 hours and is thought to have a relatively high inclination due to the presence of an eclipse in the optical light curve. There is also evidence that an asymmetric disc is present in the system, which precesses every 5.5 days based on changes in the depth of the eclipse. In this paper, we present optical photometry and spectroscopy of UW CrB taken over 2 years. We update the orbital ephemeris using observed optical eclipses and refine the orbital period to 110.97680(1) min. A total of 17 new optical bursts are presented, with 10 of these bursts being resolved temporally. The average $e$-folding time of $19\pm3$s for the bursts is consistent with the previously found value. Optical bursts are observed during a previously identified gap in orbital phase centred on $\phi=0.967$, meaning the reprocessing site is not eclipsed as previously thought. Finally, we find that the apparent P-Cygni profiles present in some of the atomic lines in the optical spectra are due to transient absorption.</description>
