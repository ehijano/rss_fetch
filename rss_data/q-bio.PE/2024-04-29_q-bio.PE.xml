      <title>An optimal control study for a two-strain SEIR epidemic model with saturated incidence rates and treatment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work will study an optimal control problem describing the two-strain SEIR epidemic model. The studied model is in the form of six nonlinear differential equations illustrating the dynamics of the susceptibles and the exposed, the infected, and the recovered individuals. The exposed and the infected compartments are each divided into two sub-classes representing the first and the second strain. The model includes two saturated rates and two treatments for each strain. We begin our study by showing the well-posedness of our problem. The basic reproduction number is calculated and depends mainly on the reproduction numbers of the first and second strains. The global stability of the disease-free equilibrium is fulfilled. The optimal control study is achieved by using the Pontryagin minimum principle. Numerical simulations have shown the importance of therapy in minimizing the infection's effect. By administrating suitable therapies, the disease's severity decreases considerably. The estimation of parameters as well as a comparison study with COVID-19 clinical data are fulfilled. It was shown that the mathematical model results fits well the clinical data.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary game dynamics with environmental feedback in a network with two communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17082</link>

Abstract: Recent developments of eco-evolutionary models have shown that evolving feedbacks between behavioral strategies and the environment of game interactions, leading to changes in the underlying payoff matrix, can impact the underlying population dynamics in various manners. We propose and analyze an eco-evolutionary game dynamics model on a network with two communities such that players interact with other players in the same community and those in the opposite community at different rates. In our model, we consider two-person matrix games with pairwise interactions occurring on individual edges and assume that the environmental state depends on edges rather than on nodes or being globally shared in the population. We analytically determine the equilibria and their stability under a symmetric population structure assumption, and we also numerically study the replicator dynamics of the general model. The model shows rich dynamical behavior, such as multiple transcritical bifurcations, multistability, and anti-synchronous oscillations. Our work offers insights into understanding how the presence of community structure impacts the eco-evolutionary dynamics within and between niches.</description>

      <title>Chemotaxis-inspired PDE model for airborne infectious disease transmission: analysis and simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Partial differential equation (PDE) models for infectious disease have received renewed interest in recent years. Most models of this type extend classical compartmental formulations with additional terms accounting for spatial dynamics, with Fickian diffusion being the most common such term. However, while diffusion may be appropriate for modeling vector-borne diseases, or diseases among plants or wildlife, the spatial propagation of airborne diseases in human populations is heavily dependent on human contact and mobility patterns, which are not necessarily well-described by diffusion. By including an additional chemotaxis-inspired term, in which the infection is propagated along the positive gradient of the susceptible population (from regions of low- to high-density of susceptibles), one may provide a more suitable description of these dynamics. This article introduces and analyzes a mathematical model of infectious disease incorporating a modified chemotaxis-type term. The model is analyzed mathematically and the well-posedness of the resulting PDE system is demonstrated. A series of numerical simulations are provided, demonstrating the ability of the model to naturally capture important phenomena not easily observed in standard diffusion models, including propagation over long spatial distances over short time scales and the emergence of localized infection hotspots</description>

      <title>Optimal vaccination strategies on networks and in metropolitan areas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00207v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents a mathematical model for optimal vaccination strategies in interconnected metropolitan areas, considering commuting patterns. It is a compartmental model with a vaccination rate for each city, acting as a control function. The commuting patterns are incorporated through a weighted adjacency matrix and a parameter that selects day and night periods. The optimal control problem is formulated to minimize a functional cost that balances the number of hospitalizations and vaccines, including restrictions of a weekly availability cap and an application capacity of vaccines per unit of time. The key findings of this work are bounds for the basic reproduction number, particularly in the case of a metropolitan area, and the study of the optimal control problem. Theoretical analysis and numerical simulations provide insights into disease dynamics and the effectiveness of control measures. The research highlights the importance of prioritizing vaccination in the capital to better control the disease spread, as we depicted in our numerical simulations. This model serves as a tool to improve resource allocation in epidemic control across metropolitan regions.</description>

      <title>Latent mutations in the ancestries of alleles under selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.08142v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a single genetic locus with two alleles $A_1$ and $A_2$ in a large haploid population. The locus is subject to selection and two-way, or recurrent, mutation. Assuming the allele frequencies follow a Wright-Fisher diffusion and have reached stationarity, we describe the asymptotic behaviors of the conditional gene genealogy and the latent mutations of a sample with known allele counts, when the count $n_1$ of allele $A_1$ is fixed, and when either or both the sample size $n$ and the selection strength $\lvert\alpha\rvert$ tend to infinity. Our study extends previous work under neutrality to the case of non-neutral rare alleles, asserting that when selection is not too strong relative to the sample size, even if it is strongly positive or strongly negative in the usual sense ($\alpha\to -\infty$ or $\alpha\to +\infty$), the number of latent mutations of the $n_1$ copies of allele $A_1$ follows the same distribution as the number of alleles in the Ewens sampling formula. On the other hand, very strong positive selection relative to the sample size leads to neutral gene genealogies with a single ancient latent mutation. We also demonstrate robustness of our asymptotic results against changing population sizes, when one of $\lvert\alpha\rvert$ or $n$ is large.</description>

      <title>The contact process with an asymptomatic state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.00731v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In order to understand the cost of a potentially high infectiousness of symptomatic individuals or, on the contrary, the benefit of social distancing, quarantine, etc. in the course of an infectious disease, this paper considers a natural variant of the popular contact process that distinguishes between asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals. Infected individuals all recover at rate one but infect nearby individuals at a rate that depends on whether they show the symptoms of the disease or not. Newly infected individuals are always asymptomatic and may or may not show the symptoms before they recover. The analysis of the corresponding mean-field model reveals that, in the absence of local interactions, regardless of the rate at which asymptomatic individuals become symptomatic, there is an epidemic whenever at least one of the infection rates is sufficiently large. In contrast, our analysis of the interacting particle system shows that, when the rate at which asymptomatic individuals become symptomatic is small and the asymptomatic individuals are not infectious, there cannot be an epidemic even when the symptomatic individuals are highly infectious.</description>
