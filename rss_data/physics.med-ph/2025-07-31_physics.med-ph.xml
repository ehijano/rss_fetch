      <title>Biocompatibility of Nanomaterials in Medical Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biocompatibility is a critical factor in the application of nanomaterials in medical fields, as these materials must interact safely and effectively with biological systems to be viable for therapeutic and diagnostic use. This article investigates the biocompatibility of nanomaterials, focusing on their interactions with biological cells, tissues, and the immune system. Key properties such as surface chemistry, size, shape, and material composition are examined, as they significantly influence the biological response. The article explores the role of nanomaterials in medical applications, including drug delivery, diagnostic imaging, and tissue engineering, while discussing the challenges involved in enhancing their biocompatibility. A case study on the CaO-CaP binary system is presented, showcasing the use of calcium oxide (CaO) and calcium phosphate (CaP) nanoparticles in bone tissue engineering. This system is widely investigated for its ability to mimic the mineral content of bone and promote osteogenesis, highlighting both its therapeutic potential and challenges in ensuring safe biocompatibility in clinical settings. The article concludes by reviewing strategies to optimize the biocompatibility of nanomaterials and discussing future directions for research in advancing their applications in medical treatments.</description>

      <title>Impact of a Lower Limb Exosuit Anchor Points on Energetics and Biomechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anchor point placement is a crucial yet often overlooked aspect of exosuit design since it determines how forces interact with the human body. This work analyzes the impact of different anchor point positions on gait kinematics, muscular activation and energetic consumption. A total of six experiments were conducted with 11 subjects wearing the XoSoft exosuit, which assists hip flexion in five configurations. Subjects were instrumented with an IMU-based motion tracking system, EMG sensors, and a mask to measure metabolic consumption. The results show that positioning the knee anchor point on the posterior side while keeping the hip anchor on the anterior part can reduce muscle activation in the hip flexors by up to 10.21\% and metabolic expenditure by up to 18.45\%. Even if the only assisted joint was the hip, all the configurations introduced changes also in the knee and ankle kinematics. Overall, no single configuration was optimal across all subjects, suggesting that a personalized approach is necessary to transmit the assistance forces optimally. These findings emphasize that anchor point position does indeed have a significant impact on exoskeleton effectiveness and efficiency. However, these optimal positions are subject-specific to the exosuit design, and there is a strong need for future work to tailor musculoskeletal models to individual characteristics and validate these results in clinical populations.</description>

      <title>MRpro - open PyTorch-based MR reconstruction and processing package</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce MRpro, an open-source image reconstruction package built upon PyTorch and open data formats. The framework comprises three main areas. First, it provides unified data structures for the consistent manipulation of MR datasets and their associated metadata (e.g., k-space trajectories). Second, it offers a library of composable operators, proximable functionals, and optimization algorithms, including a unified Fourier operator for all common trajectories and an extended phase graph simulation for quantitative MR. These components are used to create ready-to-use implementations of key reconstruction algorithms. Third, for deep learning, MRpro includes essential building blocks such as data consistency layers, differentiable optimization layers, and state-of-the-art backbone networks and integrates public datasets to facilitate reproducibility. MRpro is developed as a collaborative project supported by automated quality control. We demonstrate the versatility of MRpro across multiple applications, including Cartesian, radial, and spiral acquisitions; motion-corrected reconstruction; cardiac MR fingerprinting; learned spatially adaptive regularization weights; model-based learned image reconstruction and quantitative parameter estimation. MRpro offers an extensible framework for MR image reconstruction. With reproducibility and maintainability at its core, it facilitates collaborative development and provides a foundation for future MR imaging research.</description>

      <title>A Lightweight Optimization Framework for Estimating 3D Brain Tumor Infiltration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13811v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Glioblastoma, the most aggressive primary brain tumor, poses a severe clinical challenge due to its diffuse microscopic infiltration, which remains largely undetected on standard MRI. As a result, current radiotherapy planning employs a uniform 15 mm margin around the resection cavity, failing to capture patient-specific tumor spread. Tumor growth modeling offers a promising approach to reveal this hidden infiltration. However, methods based on partial differential equations or physics-informed neural networks tend to be computationally intensive or overly constrained, limiting their clinical adaptability to individual patients. In this work, we propose a lightweight, rapid, and robust optimization framework that estimates the 3D tumor concentration by fitting it to MRI tumor segmentations while enforcing a smooth concentration landscape. This approach achieves superior tumor recurrence prediction on 192 brain tumor patients across two public datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines while reducing runtime from 30 minutes to less than one minute. Furthermore, we demonstrate the framework's versatility and adaptability by showing its ability to seamlessly integrate additional imaging modalities or physical constraints.</description>
