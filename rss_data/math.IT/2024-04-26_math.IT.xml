      <title>Learned Pulse Shaping Design for PAPR Reduction in DFT-s-OFDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) is one of the main factors limiting cell coverage for cellular systems, especially in the uplink direction. Discrete Fourier transform spread orthogonal frequency-domain multiplexing (DFT-s-OFDM) with spectrally-extended frequency-domain spectrum shaping (FDSS) is one of the efficient techniques deployed to lower the PAPR of the uplink waveforms. In this work, we propose a machine learning-based framework to determine the FDSS filter, optimizing a tradeoff between the symbol error rate (SER), the PAPR, and the spectral flatness requirements. Our end-to-end optimization framework considers multiple important design constraints, including the Nyquist zero-ISI (inter-symbol interference) condition. The numerical results show that learned FDSS filters lower the PAPR compared to conventional baselines, with minimal SER degradation. Tuning the parameters of the optimization also helps us understand the fundamental limitations and characteristics of the FDSS filters for PAPR reduction.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Grant-Free Protocol in mMTC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper revisits the identity detection problem under the current grant-free protocol in massive machine-type communications (mMTC) by asking the following question: for stable identity detection performance, is it enough to permit active devices to transmit preambles without any handshaking with the base station (BS)? Specifically, in the current grant-free protocol, the BS blindly allocates a fixed length of preamble to devices for identity detection as it lacks the prior information on the number of active devices $K$. However, in practice, $K$ varies dynamically over time, resulting in degraded identity detection performance especially when $K$ is large. Consequently, the current grant-free protocol fails to ensure stable identity detection performance. To address this issue, we propose a two-stage communication protocol which consists of estimation of $K$ in Phase I and detection of identities of active devices in Phase II. The preamble length for identity detection in Phase II is dynamically allocated based on the estimated $K$ in Phase I through a table lookup manner such that the identity detection performance could always be better than a predefined threshold. In addition, we design an algorithm for estimating $K$ in Phase I, and exploit the estimated $K$ to reduce the computational complexity of the identity detector in Phase II. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed two-stage communication protocol and algorithms.</description>

      <title>When does a bent concatenation not belong to the completed Maiorana-McFarland class?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Every Boolean bent function $f$ can be written either as a concatenation $f=f_1||f_2$ of two complementary semi-bent functions $f_1,f_2$; or as a concatenation $f=f_1||f_2||f_3||f_4$ of four Boolean functions $f_1,f_2,f_3,f_4$, all of which are simultaneously bent, semi-bent, or 5-valued spectra-functions. In this context, it is essential to ask: When does a bent concatenation $f$ (not) belong to the completed Maiorana-McFarland class $\mathcal{M}^\#$? In this article, we answer this question completely by providing a full characterization of the structure of $\mathcal{M}$-subspaces for the concatenation of the form $f=f_1||f_2$ and $f=f_1||f_2||f_3||f_4$, which allows us to specify the necessary and sufficient conditions so that $f$ is outside $\mathcal{M}^\#$. Based on these conditions, we propose several explicit design methods of specifying bent functions outside $\mathcal{M}^\#$ in the special case when $f=g||h||g||(h+1)$, where $g$ and $h$ are bent functions.</description>

      <title>Deep Joint CSI Feedback and Multiuser Precoding for MIMO OFDM Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The design of precoding plays a crucial role in achieving a high downlink sum-rate in multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. In this correspondence, we propose a deep learning based joint CSI feedback and multiuser precoding method in frequency division duplex systems, aiming at maximizing the downlink sum-rate performance in an end-to-end manner. Specifically, the eigenvectors of the CSI matrix are compressed using deep joint source-channel coding techniques. This compression method enhances the resilience of the feedback CSI information against degradation in the feedback channel. A joint multiuser precoding module and a power allocation module are designed to adjust the precoding direction and the precoding power for users based on the feedback CSI information. Experimental results demonstrate that the downlink sum-rate can be significantly improved by using the proposed method, especially in scenarios with low signal-to-noise ratio and low feedback overhead.</description>

      <title>Further Investigations on Nonlinear Complexity of Periodic Binary Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear complexity is an important measure for assessing the randomness of sequences. In this paper we investigate how circular shifts affect the nonlinear complexities of finite-length binary sequences and then reveal a more explicit relation between nonlinear complexities of finite-length binary sequences and their corresponding periodic sequences. Based on the relation, we propose two algorithms that can generate all periodic binary sequences with any prescribed nonlinear complexity.</description>

      <title>Generalized Step-Chirp Sequences With Flexible Bandwidth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sequences with low aperiodic autocorrelation sidelobes have been extensively researched in literatures. With sufficiently low integrated sidelobe level (ISL), their power spectrums are asymptotically flat over the whole frequency domain. However, for the beam sweeping in the massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) broadcast channels, the flat spectrum should be constrained in a passband with tunable bandwidth to achieve the flexible tradeoffs between the beamforming gain and the beam sweeping time. Motivated by this application, we construct a family of sequences termed the generalized step-chirp (GSC) sequence with a closed-form expression, where some parameters can be tuned to adjust the bandwidth flexibly. In addition to the application in beam sweeping, some GSC sequences are closely connected with Mow's unified construction of sequences with perfect periodic autocorrelations, and may have a coarser phase resolution than the Mow sequence while their ISLs are comparable.</description>

      <title>A Hypergraph Approach to Distributed Broadcast</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the distributed broadcast problem within the context of network communications, a critical challenge in decentralized information dissemination. We put forth a novel hypergraph-based approach to address this issue, focusing on minimizing the number of broadcasts to ensure comprehensive data sharing among all network users. A key contribution of our work is the establishment of a general lower bound for the problem using the min-cut capacity of hypergraphs. Additionally, we present the distributed broadcast for quasi-trees (DBQT) algorithm tailored for the unique structure of quasi-trees, which is proven to be optimal. This paper advances both network communication strategies and hypergraph theory, with implications for a wide range of real-world applications, from vehicular and sensor networks to distributed storage systems.</description>

      <title>STAR-RIS-Assisted Communication Radar Coexistence: Analysis and Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is expected to play a prominent role among emerging technologies in future wireless communications. In particular, a communication radar coexistence system is degraded significantly by mutual interference. In this work, given the advantages of promising reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), we propose a simultaneously transmitting and reflecting RIS (STAR-RIS)-assisted radar coexistence system where a STAR-RIS is introduced to improve the communication performance while suppressing the mutual interference and providing full space coverage. Based on the realistic conditions of correlated fading, and the presence of multiple user equipments (UEs) at both sides of the RIS, we derive the achievable rates at the radar and the communication receiver side in closed forms in terms of statistical channel state information (CSI). Next, we perform alternating optimization (AO) for optimizing the STAR-RIS and the radar beamforming. Regarding the former, we optimize the amplitudes and phase shifts of the STAR-RIS through a projected gradient ascent algorithm (PGAM) simultaneously with respect to the amplitudes and phase shifts of the surface for both energy splitting (ES) and mode switching (MS) operation protocols. The proposed optimization saves enough overhead since it can be performed every several coherence intervals. This property is particularly beneficial compared to reflecting-only RIS because a STAR-RIS includes the double number of variables, which require increased overhead. Finally, simulation results illustrate how the proposed architecture outperforms the conventional RIS counterpart, and show how the various parameters affect the performance. Moreover, a benchmark full instantaneous CSI (I-CSI) based design is provided and shown to result in higher sum-rate but also in large overhead associated with complexity.</description>

      <title>Event-Triggered Resilient Filtering for 2-D Systems with Asynchronous-Delay: Handling Binary Encoding Decoding with Probabilistic Bit Flips</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the event-triggered resilient filtering problem is investigated for a class of two-dimensional systems with asynchronous-delay under binary encoding-decoding schemes with probabilistic bit flips. To reduce unnecessary communications and computations in complex network systems, alleviate network energy consumption, and optimize the use of network resources, a new event-triggered mechanism is proposed, which focuses on broadcasting necessary measurement information to update innovation only when the event generator function is satisfied. A binary encoding-decoding scheme is used in the communication process to quantify the measurement information into a bit stream, transmit it through a memoryless binary symmetric channel with a certain probability of bit flipping, and restore it at the receiver. In order to utilize the delayed decoded measurement information that a measurement reconstruction approach is proposed. Through generating space equivalence verification, it is found that the reconstructed delay-free decoded measurement sequence contains the same information as the original delayed decoded measurement sequence. In addition, resilient filter is utilized to accommodate possible estimation gain perturbations. Then, a recursive estimator framework is presented based on the reconstructed decoded measurement sequence. By means of the mathematical induction technique, the unbiased property of the proposed estimator is proved. The estimation gain is obtained by minimizing an upper bound on the filtering error covariance. Subsequently, through rigorous mathematical analysis, the monotonicity of filtering performance with respect to triggering parameters is discussed.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider two critical aspects of security in the \textit{distributed computing (DC)} model: \textit{secure data shuffling} and \textit{secure coded computing}. It is imperative that any external entity overhearing the transmissions does not gain any information about the \textit{intermediate values (IVs)} exchanged during the shuffling phase of the DC model. Our approach ensures IV confidentiality during data shuffling. Moreover, each node in the system must be able to recover the IVs necessary for computing its output functions but must also remain oblivious to the IVs associated with output functions not assigned to it. We design secure DC methods and establish achievable limits on the tradeoffs between the communication and computation loads to contribute to the advancement of secure data processing in distributed systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the Bregman divergence defined by the reciprocal function, called the inverse divergence. For the loss function defined by the monotonically increasing function $f$ and inverse divergence, the conditions for the statistical model and function $f$ under which the estimating equation is unbiased are clarified. Specifically, we characterize two types of statistical models, an inverse Gaussian type and a mixture of generalized inverse Gaussian type distributions, to show that the conditions for the function $f$ are different for each model. We also define Bregman divergence as a linear sum over the dimensions of the inverse divergence and extend the results to the multi-dimensional case.</description>

      <title>Towards Symbiotic SAGIN Through Inter-operator Resource and Service Sharing: Joint Orchestration of User Association and Radio Resources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN) is a pivotal architecture to support ubiquitous connectivity in the upcoming 6G era. Inter-operator resource and service sharing is a promising way to realize such a huge network, utilizing resources efficiently and reducing construction costs. Given the rationality of operators, the configuration of resources and services in SAGIN should focus on both the overall system performance and individual benefits of operators. Motivated by emerging symbiotic communication facilitating mutual benefits across different radio systems, we investigate the resource and service sharing in SAGIN from a symbiotic communication perspective in this paper. In particular, we consider a SAGIN consisting of a ground network operator (GNO) and a satellite network operator (SNO). Specifically, we aim to maximize the weighted sum rate (WSR) of the whole SAGIN by jointly optimizing the user association, resource allocation, and beamforming. Besides, we introduce a sharing coefficient to characterize the revenue of operators. Operators may suffer revenue loss when only focusing on maximizing the WSR. In pursuit of mutual benefits, we propose a mutual benefit constraint (MBC) to ensure that each operator obtains revenue gains. Then, we develop a centralized algorithm based on the successive convex approximation (SCA) method. Considering that the centralized algorithm is difficult to implement, we propose a distributed algorithm based on Lagrangian dual decomposition and the consensus alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Finally, we provide extensive numerical simulations to demonstrate the effectiveness of the two proposed algorithms, and the distributed optimization algorithm can approach the performance of the centralized one.</description>

      <title>Multivariate Fidelities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The main contribution of our paper is to introduce a number of multivariate quantum fidelities and show that they satisfy several desirable properties that are natural extensions of those of the Uhlmann and Holevo fidelities. We propose three variants that reduce to the average pairwise fidelity for commuting states: average pairwise $z$-fidelities, the multivariate semi-definite programming (SDP) fidelity, and a multivariate fidelity inspired by an existing secrecy measure. The second one is obtained by extending the SDP formulation of the Uhlmann fidelity to more than two states. All three of these variants satisfy the following properties: (i) reduction to multivariate classical fidelities for commuting states, (ii) the data-processing inequality, (iii) invariance under permutations of the states, (iv) its values are in the interval $[0,1]$; they are faithful, that is, their values are equal to one if and only if all the states are equal, and they satisfy orthogonality, that is their values are equal to zero if and only if the states are mutually orthogonal to each other, (v) direct-sum property, (vi) joint concavity, and (vii) uniform continuity bounds under certain conditions. Furthermore, we establish inequalities relating these different variants, indeed clarifying that all these definitions coincide with the average pairwise fidelity for commuting states. Lastly, we introduce another multivariate fidelity called multivariate log-Euclidean fidelity, which is a quantum generalization of the Matusita multivariate fidelity. We also show that it satisfies most of the desirable properties listed above, it is a function of a multivariate log-Euclidean divergence, and has an operational interpretation in terms of quantum hypothesis testing with an arbitrarily varying null hypothesis.</description>

Abstract: We introduce an assessment procedure for interactive segmentation models. Based on concepts from Bayesian Experimental Design, the procedure measures a model's understanding of point prompts and their correspondence with the desired segmentation mask. We show that Oracle Dice index measurements are insensitive or even misleading in measuring this property. We demonstrate the use of the proposed procedure on three interactive segmentation models and subsets of two large image segmentation datasets.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the impact of data freshness on remote inference systems, where a pre-trained neural network infers a time-varying target (e.g., the locations of vehicles and pedestrians) based on features (e.g., video frames) observed at a sensing node (e.g., a camera). One might expect that the performance of a remote inference system degrades monotonically as the feature becomes stale. Using an information-theoretic analysis, we show that this is true if the feature and target data sequence can be closely approximated as a Markov chain, whereas it is not true if the data sequence is far from Markovian. Hence, the inference error is a function of Age of Information (AoI), where the function could be non-monotonic. To minimize the inference error in real-time, we propose a new "selection-from-buffer" model for sending the features, which is more general than the "generate-at-will" model used in earlier studies. In addition, we design low-complexity scheduling policies to improve inference performance. For single-source, single-channel systems, we provide an optimal scheduling policy. In multi-source, multi-channel systems, the scheduling problem becomes a multi-action restless multi-armed bandit problem. For this setting, we design a new scheduling policy by integrating Whittle index-based source selection and duality-based feature selection-from-buffer algorithms. This new scheduling policy is proven to be asymptotically optimal. These scheduling results hold for minimizing general AoI functions (monotonic or non-monotonic). Data-driven evaluations demonstrate the significant advantages of our proposed scheduling policies.</description>

      <title>Lifts of quantum CSS codes</title>

Abstract: We propose a notion of lift for quantum CSS codes, inspired by the geometrical construction of Freedman and Hastings. It is based on the existence of a canonical complex associated to any CSS code, that we introduce under the name of Tanner cone-complex, and over which we generate covering spaces. As a first application, we describe the classification of lifts of hypergraph product codes (HPC) and demonstrate the equivalence with the lifted product code (LPC) of Panteleev and Kalachev, including when the linear codes, factors of the HPC, are Tanner codes. As a second application, we report several new non-product constructions of quantum CSS codes, and we apply the prescription to generate their lifts which, for certain selected covering maps, are codes with improved relative parameters compared to the initial one.</description>

      <title>Digital Over-the-Air Federated Learning in Multi-Antenna Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.14648v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, the performance optimization of federated learning (FL), when deployed over a realistic wireless multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication system with digital modulation and over-the-air computation (AirComp) is studied. In particular, a MIMO system is considered in which edge devices transmit their local FL models (trained using their locally collected data) to a parameter server (PS) using beamforming to maximize the number of devices scheduled for transmission. The PS, acting as a central controller, generates a global FL model using the received local FL models and broadcasts it back to all devices. Due to the limited bandwidth in a wireless network, AirComp is adopted to enable efficient wireless data aggregation. However, fading of wireless channels can produce aggregate distortions in an AirComp-based FL scheme. To tackle this challenge, we propose a modified federated averaging (FedAvg) algorithm that combines digital modulation with AirComp to mitigate wireless fading while ensuring the communication efficiency. This is achieved by a joint transmit and receive beamforming design, which is formulated as an optimization problem to dynamically adjust the beamforming matrices based on current FL model parameters so as to minimize the transmitting error and ensure the FL performance. To achieve this goal, we first analytically characterize how the beamforming matrices affect the performance of the FedAvg in different iterations. Based on this relationship, an artificial neural network (ANN) is used to estimate the local FL models of all devices and adjust the beamforming matrices at the PS for future model transmission. The algorithmic advantages and improved performance of the proposed methodologies are demonstrated through extensive numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Quantum Coordination Rates in Multi-Partite Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11893v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The optimal coordination rates are determined in three primary settings of multi-partite quantum networks, thus characterizing the minimal resources required in order to simulate a joint quantum state among multiple parties. We study the following models: (1) a cascade network with limited entanglement, (2) a broadcast network, which consists of a single sender and two receivers, (3) a multiple-access network with two senders and a single receiver. We establish the necessary and sufficient conditions on the asymptotically-achievable communication and entanglement rates in each setting. At last, we show the implications of our results on nonlocal games with quantum strategies.</description>

      <title>Private Vector Mean Estimation in the Shuffle Model: Optimal Rates Require Many Messages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10201v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of private vector mean estimation in the shuffle model of privacy where $n$ users each have a unit vector $v^{(i)} \in\mathbb{R}^d$. We propose a new multi-message protocol that achieves the optimal error using $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(\min(n\varepsilon^2,d)\right)$ messages per user. Moreover, we show that any (unbiased) protocol that achieves optimal error requires each user to send $\Omega(\min(n\varepsilon^2,d)/\log(n))$ messages, demonstrating the optimality of our message complexity up to logarithmic factors. Additionally, we study the single-message setting and design a protocol that achieves mean squared error $\mathcal{O}(dn^{d/(d+2)}\varepsilon^{-4/(d+2)})$. Moreover, we show that any single-message protocol must incur mean squared error $\Omega(dn^{d/(d+2)})$, showing that our protocol is optimal in the standard setting where $\varepsilon = \Theta(1)$. Finally, we study robustness to malicious users and show that malicious users can incur large additive error with a single shuffler.</description>
