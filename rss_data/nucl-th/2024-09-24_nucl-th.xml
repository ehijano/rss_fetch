      <title>Description of the first order phase transition region of an equation of state for QCD with a critical point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We map the mean-field Ising model equation of state onto the QCD phase diagram, and reconstruct the full coexistence region in the case of a first order phase transition. Beyond the coexistence line, we maintain access to the spinodal region in the phase diagram, thus providing a description of metastable and unstable phases of matter as well. In this way, our approach includes the super-heated hadronic phase and the super-cooled quark-gluon plasma, which are useful for hydrodynamic simulations of the fireball created in a heavy-ion collision at low collision energy, where a first order phase transition is expected. We discuss the features of the pressure and other thermodynamic observables as functions of temperature and baryonic chemical potential, in particular their behavior in the coexistence region. Finally, we compare our equation of state to other 3D-Ising model ones available in the literature.</description>

      <title>Quark/gluon discrimination of jet quenching with energy-energy correlators in heavy ion collisions at $\sqrt{s}=5.02$ TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The energy-energy correlator is considered a powerful probe of jet substructure, especially a better probe of certain soft and collinear features, to study the utility of such observable for quark/gluon discrimination. This work first predicts the energy-energy correlators of inclusive jets in Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{\rm s}$ = 5.02 TeV for jet transverse momentum interval $40 - 60$ GeV. The Pb+Pb EEC distribution shifts to larger $R_{\rm L}$ and smaller $R_{\rm L}$. The shift toward larger $R_{\rm L}$ is attributed to the energy loss effect when the jet evolves in the hot and dense medium and the shift toward smaller $R_{\rm L}$ is due to the selection bias effects. Moreover, we find the EEC distribution for pure quark jets in A+A will only be suffering even stronger enhancement at $R_{\rm L}&gt; 0.2$, and the EEC distribution for pure gluon jets in A+A will be observed shifting toward smaller and larger $R_{\rm L}$ at the same time. The jet quenching patterns (AA/pp) of the quark jets and the gluon jets can then be separated. We find that the differences are mainly determined by the initial EEC distribution in p+p, and are not affected much by the energy loss differences between quark and gluon. Inclusive jets are dominated by gluon jets, and photon-tagged jets are used to represent quark jets, we propose this double-ratio measurement to demonstrate the quark/gluon discrimination for the jet quenching phenomenon of jet substructures.</description>

      <title>Isospin-symmetry breaking in kaon production: the role of charge-symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An excess of charged versus neutral kaons has been recently reported by the NA61/SHINE collaboration. Similar excesses were also present in previous experiments, even if with larger errors. Models for hadron productions in heavy ion collisions systematically underestimate the measured charge-to-neutral kaon ratio. In this report, we comment on the role of charge-symmetry as a specific isospin transformation. In particular, we show that the ensemble of the initial colliding nuclei being charge-symmetric is sufficient for producing an equal number of charged and neutral kaons in the isospin-symmetry exact limit.</description>

      <title>Heavy Flavour Energy Loss in Small and Large Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present suppression results for high-$p_T$ $D$ and $\pi$ mesons produced in $p / d + A$ and $A+A$ collisions at RHIC and LHC. These results are computed using a convolved elastic and radiative energy loss model, which receives small system size corrections to both the elastic and radiative energy loss. We observe that suppression in small systems is almost entirely due to elastic energy loss; furthermore, we find that our model is acutely sensitive to the transition between hard thermal loop and vacuum propagators in the elastic energy loss. Finally, we consider the central limit theorem approximation, which is commonly used to model the elastic energy loss distribution as Gaussian.</description>

      <title>Microscopic Study of Spin Transfer in Near-Barrier Nuclear Reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In quasi-fission, it is unclear what the interaction between the relative orbital angular momentum and the spin of the fragments is from a microscopic perspective. In macroscopic approaches, it is expected that the large value of the relative orbital angular momentum, of the order of 100~$\hbar$ is transferred through tangential dissipation to the fragments' intrinsic spin by sliding and rolling friction.
  The goal is to investigate the angular momentum transfer from the initial relative orbital angular momentum to the fragments' spin. How is the transferred spin shared between the fragments? What is the time scale associated with the different mechanisms? How does deformation play a role?
  A TDDFT simulation in the TDHF-Skyrme framework is used to describe several reactions at different impact parameters with increasing complexity. A method is proposed to study the evolution of the fragments' total spin as a function of time and angular velocity.
  The increasingly complex reaction allows for careful analysis of all the mechanisms responsible for the transfer of spin. In particular, it is shown that the transfer of nucleons, and neck formation can significantly affect the transfer of spin through tangential friction.
  Several mechanisms are in contradiction with previous macroscopic calculations. In particular, the spin of the fragments does not always increase during the collision which prevents it from being used to estimate the collision time of the reaction.</description>

      <title>Multiparticle azimuthal correlations in isobaric $^{96}$Ru+$^{96}$Ru and $^{96}$Zr+$^{96}$Zr collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} =$ 200 GeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Correlations between event-by-event fluctuations in the amplitudes of flow harmonics offer a novel way to access initial state properties in heavy-ion collisions. We have extensively predicted correlations in different flow harmonics based on multiparticle cumulants in $^{96}$Ru+$^{96}$Ru and $^{96}$Zr+$^{96}$Zr collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} =$ 200 GeV from a multiphase transport model. The state-of-the-art correlated nuclear distributions for the isobars were used to show the difference in nuclear deformations and neutron skin thickness, which have distinct characteristics seen in multiparticle azimuthal correlation. We also found a minimal effect of the shear viscosity effect on these multiparticle azimuthal correlations. Therefore, these studies could also serve as an additional tool for understanding the nature of the initial state fluctuations and nuclear structure, as well as input for possible in-depth dynamical studies for experimental measurement.</description>

      <title>Neutron Tagging Can Greatly Reduce Spallation Backgrounds in Super-Kamiokande</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Super-Kamiokande's spallation backgrounds - the delayed beta decays of nuclides following cosmic-ray muons - are nearly all produced by the small fraction of muons with hadronic showers. We show that these hadronic showers also produce neutrons; their captures can be detected with high efficiency due to the recent addition of dissolved gadolinium to Super-Kamiokande. We show that new cuts based on the neutron tagging of showers could reduce spallation backgrounds by a factor of at least four beyond present cuts. With further work, this could lead to a near-elimination of detector backgrounds above about 6 MeV, which would significantly improve the sensitivity of Super-Kamiokande. These findings heighten the importance of adding gadolinium to Hyper-Kamiokande, which is at a shallower depth. Further, a similar approach could be used in other detectors, for example, the JUNO liquid-scintillator detector, which is also at a shallower depth.</description>

      <title>A new approach to handling factorial moment correlations through principal component analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intermittency analysis of factorial moments is a promising method used for the detection of power-law scaling in high-energy collision data. In particular, it has been employed in the search of fluctuations characteristic of the critical point (CP) of strongly interacting matter. However, intermittency analysis has been hindered by the fact that factorial moments measurements corresponding to different scales are correlated, since the same data are conventionally used to calculate them. This invalidates many assumptions involved in fitting data sets and determining the best fit values of power-law exponents. We present a novel approach to intermittency analysis, employing the well-established statistical and data science tool of Principal Component Analysis (PCA). This technique allows for the proper handling of correlations between scales without the need for subdividing the data sets available.</description>

      <title>Finding Interaction Mechanism between Exotic Molecule and Conventional Hadron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An intriguing and important question arises: how do hadronic molecules interact with conventional hadrons? In this Letter, we propose a novel mechanism to address this issue, focusing on the interactions between hidden-charm molecular pentaquarks ($P_c$) and nucleons ($N$). By applying this mechanism, we derive the corresponding interaction potentials, enabling the prediction of the bound state properties. Our results indicate the possible existence of $P_cN$ bound states--an entirely new form of matter, ripe for exploration in the era of high-precision hadron spectroscopy. Notably, this mechanism extends beyond the $P_cN$ systems and can be applied to any hadronic molecules interacting with conventional hadrons, offering the potential for discovering a variety of novel bound states.</description>

      <title>Finite-Element Simulations of Rotating Neutron Stars with Anisotropic Crusts and Continuous Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: ``Mountains'', or non-axisymmetrical deformations in the elastic crust of rotating neutron stars are efficient radiators of continuous gravitational waves. Recently, small anisotropies were observed in the solid innermost inner core of the Earth. We implement three-dimensional finite-element simulations to study mountains sourced by modest anisotropies in the solid crust of rotating neutron stars. We find that anisotropic mountains may be detectable by current ground-based gravitational-wave detectors and might explain several observed phenomena, confirming the results of a previous work on less realistic neutron star models. In particular, we find that a slightly anisotropic neutron star crust that changes its rotation rate modestly can support an ellipticity of a few $\times$ 10$^{-9}$, which is equivalent to the upper bounds on the ellipticity of some nearby and rapidlly spinning pulsars.</description>

      <title>Effect of isoscalar and isovector scalar fields on baryon semileptonic decays in nuclear matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The precise determination of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix elements is very important, because it could be a clue to new physics beyond Standard Theory. This is particular true of $V_{ud}$, because it is the main contribution to the unitary condition of the CKM matrix elements. The level of accuracy for the test of the unitarity involving the element $V_{ud}$ is now of the order of $10^{-4}$. Because the precise data for $V_{ud}$ is usually extracted from super-allowed nuclear $\beta$ decay, it is quite significant to investigate the breaking of SU(3) flavor symmetry on the weak vector coupling constant in nuclear matter. The purpose of this paper is to investigate how the isoscalar scalar ($\sigma$) and the isovector scalar ($\delta$ or $a_0$) mean-fields affect the weak vector and axial-vector coupling constants for semileptonic baryon (neutron, $\Lambda$ or $\Xi^-$) decay in asymmetric nuclear matter. To do so, we use the quark-meson coupling (QMC) model, where nuclear matter consists of nucleons including quark degrees of freedom bound by the self-consistent exchange of scalar and vector mesons. We pay careful attention to the center of mass correction to the quark currents in matter. We then find that, for neutron $\beta$ decay in asymmetric nuclear matter, the defect of the vector coupling constant due to the $\delta$ field can be of the order of $10^{-4}$ at the nuclear saturation density, which is the same amount as the level of the current uncertainty in the measurements. It is also interesting that, in neutron-rich matter, there exists a certain low density at which isospin symmetry is restored, that is, the $u$-$d$ quark mass difference vanishes. We conclude that the effect of the isoscalar scalar and the isovector scalar fields should be considered in baryon semileptonic decays in nuclei.</description>

      <title>A NICER View of PSR J1231-1411: A Complex Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent constraints on neutron star mass and radius have advanced our understanding of the equation of state of cold dense matter. Some of them have been obtained by modeling the pulses of three millisecond X-ray pulsars observed by the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER). Here, we present a Bayesian parameter inference for a fourth pulsar, PSR J1231-1411, using the same technique with NICER and XMM-Newton data. When applying a broad mass-inclination prior from radio timing measurements and the emission region geometry model that can best explain the data, we find likely-converged results only when using a limited radius prior. If limiting the radius to be consistent with the previous observational constraints and equation of state analyses, we infer the radius to be $12.6 \pm 0.3$ km and the mass to be $1.04_{-0.03}^{+0.05}$ $M_\odot$, each reported as the posterior credible interval bounded by the $16\,\%$ and $84\,\%$ quantiles. If using an uninformative prior but limited between $10$ and $14$ km, we find otherwise similar results, but $R_{\mathrm{eq}} = 13.5_{-0.5}^{+0.3}$ km for the radius. In both cases, we find a non-antipodal hot region geometry where one emitting spot is at the equator or slightly above, surrounded by a large colder region, and where a non-circular hot region lies close to southern rotational pole. If using a wider radius prior, we only find solutions that fit the data significantly worse. We discuss the challenges in finding the better fitting solutions, possibly related to the weak interpulse feature in the pulse profile.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a new long-lived isomer in $^{114}$Rh via Penning-trap mass spectrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on mass measurements of three long-lived states in $^{114}$Rh performed with the JYFLTRAP Penning-trap mass spectrometer: the ground state and two isomers with estimated half-lives of about one second. The used Phase-Imaging Ion-Cyclotron-Resonance technique allowed for the discovery of a so far unknown second long-lived isomer. All three states were produced directly in proton-induced fission on a uranium target, whereas only the isomeric states were populated in the $\beta$ decay of the $^{114}$Ru ground state with spin-parity $0^+$. We propose spin-parity assignments of $(6^-)$ for the ground state, and $(3^+)$ and $(0^-)$ for the isomers. They resolve the puzzle of anomalous fission yields of this isotope despite the existing literature assigning a low angular momentum to the ground state. The experimental evidence is further supported by a detailed analysis based on mean-field calculations with the BSkG3 model. As for many other nuclei in this mass region, considering triaxial shapes is decisive for the interpretation of low-lying states of this nucleus. The discovery of a new isomer in $^{114}$Rh and our theoretical work challenge the currently adopted spin-parity assignments in this and several other odd-odd neutron-rich Rh isotopes.</description>

Abstract: We present phenomenological findings on charm quark transport while including its energy loss in both pre-equilibrium and hydrodynamic stages of the evolution. We employed the MARTINI event generator for the production and evolution of heavy quarks in the relativistic heavy-ion collisions. The sensitivity of the heavy meson nuclear modification factor and flow coefficient to the early stage of heavy-ion collisions and bulk medium evolution is analyzed for Pb+Pb collisions at 5.02 TeV. Our study provides insights into the interaction strength of charm quarks during the early phase and within the quark-gluon plasma.</description>

Abstract: The percolation study offers valuable insights into the characteristics of phase transition, shedding light on the underlying mechanisms that govern the formation of global connectivity within the system. We explore the percolation phase transition in the 3D cubic Ising model by employing two machine learning techniques. Our results demonstrate the capability of machine learning methods in distinguishing different phases during the percolation transition. Through the finite-size scaling analysis on the output of the neural networks, the percolation temperature and a correlation length exponent in the geometrical percolation transition are extracted and compared to those in the thermal magnetization phase transition within the 3D Ising model. These findings provide a valuable way essential for enhancing our understanding of the property of the QCD critical point, which belongs to the same universality class as the 3D Ising model.</description>

      <title>Universal relations for anisotropic interacting quark stars</title>

Abstract: Interacting quark stars, which are entirely composed of interacting quark matter including perturbative QCD corrections and color superconductivity, can meet constraints from various pulsar observations. In realistic scenarios, pressure anisotropies are expected in the star's interior. Recently, the stellar structural properties of anisotropic interacting quark stars have been investigated. In this study, we further explore the universal relations (URs) related to the moment of inertia $I$, tidal deformability $\Lambda$, compactness $C$, and the $f$-mode nonradial pulsation frequency for such stars. Our results reveal that these approximate URs generally hold, being insensitive to both the EOS variations as well as to the presence of anisotropy. In contrast to previous studies on anisotropic neutron stars, we find that more positive anisotropy tends to enhance the $I-\Lambda$ and $I-C$ URs, but weakens the $C-\Lambda$ UR. For all the URs involving $f$-mode frequency, we find that they are enhanced by the inclusion of anisotropy (whether positive or negative). Utilizing these URs and the tidal deformability constraint from the GW170817 event, we put limits on the structural properties of isotropic and anisotropic quark stars, such as the moment of inertia $I_{1.4}$, the canonical radius $R_{1.4}$ and the canonical $f$-mode frequency $f_{f,1.4}$, all of which are very different compared to those of neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Properties of quark stars based on the density-dependent MIT bag model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14775v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we extend the MIT bag model by incorporating the vector interaction among quarks and introducing a density-dependent bag pressure. Then we proceed to investigate the thermodynamic properties of strange quark matter (SQM) and pure up-down quark matter (udQM) in quark stars. The results demonstrate that the vector interaction among quarks and the densitydependent bag pressure have significant impacts on the equation of state for both SQM and udQM. The inclusion of GV , which represents the strength of vector interactions, results in a stiffening of equation of state while maintaining causality. This allows for the description of massive compact stars such as those observed in GW190814 and PSR J0740+6620 as quark stars. Ultimately, we utilize the vMIT bag model to derive a series of mass-radius relations of quark stars (QSs) which is consistent with the astronomical observations from HESS J1731-347, 4U 1702-429, PSR J0740+6620, GW170817 and GW190814.</description>

      <title>Neutron skins: A perspective from dispersive optical models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16097v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An overview is presented of neutron skin predictions obtained using an empirical nonlocal dispersive optical model (DOM). The DOM links both scattering and bound-state experimental data through a subtracted dispersion relation which allows for fully-consistent, data-informed predictions for nuclei where such data exists. Large skins were predicted for both ${}^{48}$Ca ($R^{48}_\textrm{skin}=0.25 \pm 0.023$ fm in 2017) and $^{208}$Pb ($R^{208}_\textrm{skin}=0.25 \pm 0.05$ fm in 2020). While the DOM prediction in $^{208}$Pb is within 1$\sigma$ of the subsequent PREX-2 measurement, the DOM prediction in $^{48}$Ca is over 2$\sigma$ larger than the thin neutron skin resulting from CREX. From the moment it was revealed, the thin skin in ${}^{48}$Ca has puzzled the nuclear-physics community as no adequate theories simultaneously predict both a large skin in ${}^{208}$Pb and a small skin in ${}^{48}$Ca. The DOM is unique in its ability to treat both structure and reaction data on the same footing, providing a unique perspective on this $R_\textrm{skin}$ puzzle. It appears vital that more neutron data be measured in both the scattering and bound-state domain for ${}^{48}$Ca to clarify the situation.</description>

      <title>First complete shell-model description of $^{254}$No: a new paradigm for superheavy nuclear structure studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08210v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we report the latest developments in the beyond mean-field methods applied to the shell-model framework for the description of heavy deformed nuclei. We extend our recent DNO-SM approach within the \textit{Variation-After-Projection} (VAP) scheme, dubbed as DNO-SM(VAP). This approach naturally enables to \textit{a priori} capture correlations more efficiently than the \textit{Projection-After-Variation} (PAV) scheme which is commonly used in current theoretical modelings of nuclei. Using the Kuo-Herling effective interaction, we first examine the extended method by a systematic comparison of the binding energies, the \textit{yrast} spectra and electromagnetic moments of some representative nuclei of masses ranging from $A=251$ to $A=256$. The results show that the VAP scheme variationally provides more bound solutions with respect to the PAV scheme, reflecting the additional correlations that were captured. Both spectra, dipole and spectroscopic quadrupole moments are reproduced favorably. We then focus on the case of $^{254}$No, one of the most studied elements experimentally, which can be considered as the portal to the superheavy region. The calculations show a striking agreement with the complete experimentally known spectroscopy: the \textit{yrast} band, isomers and associated $K$ bands, and the newly observed 0$^+$ and ($K=4$) 4$^+$ states, providing for the first time the complete shell-model description of $^{254}$No. The present successful achievement opens a new way for forthcoming spectroscopic studies of heavy and superheavy nuclei.</description>

      <title>Indication of Sharp and Strong Phase-Transitions from NICER Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01619v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this letter, we present a new, weakly model-dependent, test for ``standard" equations of state (EoS) models that disfavor sharp and strong phase-transitions, by using neutron star mass and radius observations. We show the radii of two neutron stars observed by NICER (PSR J0740+6620 and PSR 0030+0451) are correlated if these two neutron stars are built upon standard EoS models. The radii of neutron stars with different masses are sensitive to the pressures at different densities, and the pressures at different densities are strongly correlated in standard EoS models. We further show that the correlation of the neutron star radii can be significantly weakened, when additional degrees of freedom concerning the first-order phase transitions are added into the EoSs. We propose a new quantity, ${D}_{\mathrm{L}}$, which measures the extent to which the linear correlation of the radii of two neutron stars is weakened. Our method gives a $48\%$ identification probability (with a $5\%$ false alarm rate) of finding beyond standard EoS models in NICER observations. Future observations with higher measurement accuracy can confirm or rule out this identification. Our method is generalizable to any pair of neutron star masses and can be employed with other sets of observations in the future.</description>

      <title>Doubly heavy tetraquark states in a mass splitting model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Treating the $X(4140)$ as a compact $J^{PC}=1^{++}$ $cs\bar{c}\bar{s}$ state and using its mass as a reference scale, we systematically estimate the masses of doubly heavy tetraquark states $QQ\bar{q}\bar{q}$ where $Q=c,b$ and $q=u,d,s$. Their decay properties are studied with a simple rearrangement scheme. Based on our results, the lowest $I(J^P)=0(1^+)$ $bb\bar{n}\bar{n}$ state is a stable tetraquark about 20 MeV below the $\bar{B}^*\bar{B}$ threshold. The mass and width of the low-mass $0(1^+)$ $cc\bar{n}\bar{n}$ ($n=u,d$) tetraquark are compatible with the $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ observed by the LHCb Collaboration. The location of the lowest $0(0^+)$ and $0(1^+)$ $bc\bar{n}\bar{n}$ states are found to be close to the $\bar{B}D$ and $\bar{B}^*D$ thresholds, respectively. We hope that the predicted ratios between partial widths of different channels may be helpful to identify compact tetraquark states from future measurements.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the Variation of Physical Constants, Equivalence Principle Violation, and a Fifth Force from Atomic Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09643v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to derive limits on various forms of ``new physics'' using atomic experimental data. Interactions with dark energy and dark matter fields can lead to space-time variations of fundamental constants, which can be detected through atomic spectroscopy. In this study, we examine the effects of a varying nuclear mass $m_{N}$ and nuclear radius $r_{N}$ on two transition ratios: the comparison of the two-photon transition in atomic hydrogen with the hyperfine transition in $^{133}$Cs based clocks, and the ratio of optical clock frequencies in in Al$^{+}$ and Hg$^{+}$. The sensitivity of these frequency ratios to changes in $m_{N}$ and $r_{N}$ enables us to derive new limits on the variations of the proton mass, quark mass, and the QCD parameter $\theta$. Additionally, we consider the scalar field generated by the Yukawa-type interaction of feebly interacting hypothetical scalar particles with Standard Model particles in the presence of massive bodies such as the Sun and Moon. Using the data from the Al$^{+}$/Hg$^{+}$, Yb$^{+}$/Cs and Yb$^{+}$(E2)/Yb$^{+}$(E3) transition frequency ratios, we place constraints on the interaction of the scalar field with photons, nucleons, and electrons for a range of scalar particle masses. We also investigate limits on the Einstein Equivalence Principle (EEP) violating term ($c_{00}$) in the Standard Model Extension (SME) Lagrangian and the dependence of fundamental constants on gravity.</description>

      <title>Love-C relations for elastic hybrid stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20228v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutron stars (NSs) provide a unique laboratory to study matter under extreme densities. Recent observations from gravitational and electromagnetic waves have enabled constraints on NS properties, such as tidal deformability (related to the tidal Love number) and stellar compactness. Although each of these two NS observables depends strongly on the stellar internal structure, the relation between them (called the Love-C relation) is known to be equation-of-state insensitive. In this study, we investigate the effects of a possible crystalline phase in the core of hybrid stars (HSs) on the mass-radius and Love-C relations, where HSs are a subclass of NS models with a quark matter core and a nuclear matter envelope with a sharp phase transition in between. We find that both the maximum mass and the corresponding radius increase as one increases the stiffness of the quark matter core controlled by the speed of sound, while the density discontinuity at the nuclear-quark matter transition effectively softens the equations of state. Deviations of the Love-C relation for elastic HSs from that of fluid NSs become more pronounced with a larger shear modulus, lower transition pressure, and larger density gap and can be as large as 60%. These findings suggest a potential method for testing the existence of distinct phases within HSs, though deviations are not large enough to be detected with current measurements of the tidal deformability and compactness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00456v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have derived the Wigner equations at global equilibrium with constant vorticity but space-time dependent electromagnetic fields up to second order in semiclassical expansion. We obtain the new second-order contributions to the charge currents and energy-momentum tensor from the varying electromagnetic fields. We also compute the new corrections to the spin polarization pesudo-vector from both contant and varying electromagnetic fields. We also find that the space-time dependent electromagnetic field provides a tighter constraint on the solutions of Wigner functions in global equilibrium compared with constant electromagnetic field.</description>

      <title>Pion Boer-Mulders function using a contact interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11568v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A symmetry preserving treatment of a vector $\otimes$ vector contact interaction (SCI) is used as the basis for calculations of the two pion transverse momentum dependent parton distribution functions (TMDs); namely, that for unpolarised valence degrees-of-freedom and the analogous Boer-Mulders (BM) function. Amongst other things, the analysis enables the following themes to be addressed: the quark current mass dependence of pion TMDs; the impact of the gauge link model on the positivity constraint that bounds the BM function relative to the unpolarised TMD; the equivalence of direct diagrammatic and light-front wave function TMD calculations; and the size of the BM shift. Interpreted astutely, these SCI results enable one to draw insightful pictures of pion TMDs.</description>
