      <title>On the solutions of linear systems over additively idempotent semirings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this article is to solve the system $XA=Y$ where $A=(a_{ij})\in M_{m\times n}(S)$, $Y\in S^{m}$ and $X$ is an unknown vector of size $n$, being $S$ an additively idempotent semiring. If the system has solutions then we completely characterize its maximal one, and in the particular case where $S$ is a generalized tropical semiring a complete characterization of its solutions is provided as well as an explicit bound of the computational cost associated to its computation. Finally, when $S$ is finite, we give a cryptographic application by presenting an attack to the key exchange protocol proposed by Maze, Monico and Rosenthal.</description>

      <title>Patrick Moss 25/10/1947--17/3/2024</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Patrick Moss (1947--2024) had two distinct lives as a mathematician. The first was as a ring theorist in the late 1970s, in which he worked with Ginn and Lenagan as a student. After a long career as an inspirational mathematics teacher, Patrick completed a doctorate under my supervision in 2003. This led to a second mathematical life in arithmetic dynamics almost forty years after his first period of research. This is a short obituary of his remarkable contributions, several of which have stimulated further research.</description>

      <title>Topology and monoid representations II: left regular bands of groups and Hsiao's monoid of ordered $G$-partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to use topological methods to compute $\mathrm{Ext}$ between irreducible representations of von Neumann regular monoids in which Green's $\mathscr L$- and $\mathscr J$-relations coincide (e.g., left regular bands). Our results subsume those of S.~Margolis, F.~Saliola, and B.~Steinberg, \emph{Combinatorial topology and the global dimension of algebras arising in combinatorics}, J. Eur. Math. Soc. (JEMS), \textbf{17}, 3037--3080 (2015).
  Applications include computing $\mathrm{Ext}$ between arbitrary simple modules and computing a quiver presentation for the algebra of Hsiao's monoid of ordered $G$-partitions (connected to the Mantaci-Reutenauer descent algebra for the wreath product $G\wr S_n$). We show that this algebra is Koszul, compute its Koszul dual and compute minimal projective resolutions of all the simple modules using topology. More generally, these results work for CW left regular bands of abelian groups. These results generalize the results of S.~Margolis, F.~V. Saliola, and B.~Steinberg. \emph{Cell complexes, poset topology and the representation theory of algebras arising in algebraic combinatorics and discrete geometry}, Mem. Amer. Math. Soc., \textbf{274}, 1--135, (2021).</description>

      <title>On algebras of Dirichlet series invariant under permutations of coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathscr O_u$ be the algebra of holomorphic functions on ${\bf C}_+:=\{s\in{\bf C}:\text{Re }s&gt;0\}$ that are limits of Dirichlet series $D=\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n n^{-s}$, $s\in \bf{C}_+$, that converge uniformly on proper half-planes of $\bf{C}_+$. We study algebraic-topological properties of subalgebras of $\mathscr O_u$: the Banach algebras $\mathscr W, \mathscr A, \mathscr H^\infty$ and the Frechet algebra $\mathscr O_b$. Here $\mathscr W$ consists of functions in $\mathscr O_u$ of absolutely convergent Dirichlet series on the closure of $\bf{C}_+$, $\mathscr A$ is the uniform closure of $\mathscr W$, $\mathscr H^\infty$ is the algebra of all bounded functions in $\mathscr O_u$, and $\mathscr O_b$ is set of all $f(s)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n n^{-s}$ in $\mathscr O_u$ so that $f_r\in \mathscr H^\infty$, $r\in (0,1)$, where $f_r(s):=\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n r^{\Omega(n)} n^{-s}$ and $\Omega(n)$ is the number of prime factors of $n$. Let $S_\bf{N}$ be the group of permutations of $\bf{N}$. Each $\sigma\in S_\bf{N}$ determines a permutation $\hat\sigma\in S_\bf{N}$ (i.e., such that $\hat\sigma(mn)=\hat\sigma(n)\hat\sigma(m)$ for all $m,n\in \bf{N}$) via the fundamental theorem of arithmetic. For a Dirichlet series $D=\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n n^{-s}$, and $\sigma \in S_\bf{N}$, $S_\sigma(D)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_{\hat{\sigma}^{-1}(n)} n^{-s}$ determines an action of $S_\bf{N}$ on the set of all Dirichlet series. It is shown that each of the algebras above is invariant with respect to this action. Given a subgroup $G$ of $S_\bf{N}$, the set of $G$-invariant subalgebras of these algebras are studied, and their maximal ideal spaces are described, and used to characterise groups of units and of invertible elements having logarithms, find the stable rank, show projective freeness, and describe when the special linear group is generated by elementary matrices, with bounds on the number of factors.</description>

      <title>Loop homology of moment-angle complexes in the flag case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18450v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a general homological approach to presentations of connected graded associative algebras, and apply it to loop homology of moment-angle complexes $Z_K$ that correspond to flag simplicial complexes $K$. For arbitrary coefficient ring, we describe generators of the Pontryagin algebra $H_*(\Omega Z_K)$ and defining relations between them. We prove that such moment-angle complexes are coformal over $\mathbb{Q},$ give a necessary condition for rational formality, and compute their homotopy groups in terms of homotopy groups of spheres.</description>
