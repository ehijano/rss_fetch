      <title>Dynamic Necklace Splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The necklace splitting problem is a classic problem in fair division with many applications, including data-informed fair hash maps. We extend necklace splitting to a dynamic setting, allowing for relocation, insertion, and deletion of beads. We present linear-time, optimal algorithms for the two-color case that support all dynamic updates. For more than two colors, we give linear-time, optimal algorithms for relocation subject to a restriction on the number of agents. Finally, we propose a randomized algorithm for the two-color case that handles all dynamic updates, guarantees approximate fairness with high probability, and runs in polylogarithmic time when the number of agents is small.</description>

      <title>Cooperation in Bilateral Generalized Network Creation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studying the impact of cooperation in strategic settings is one of the cornerstones of algorithmic game theory. Intuitively, allowing more cooperation yields equilibria that are more beneficial for the society of agents. However, for many games it is still an open question how much cooperation is actually needed to ensure socially good equilibria. We contribute to this research endeavor by analyzing the benefits of cooperation in a network formation game that models the creation of communication networks via the interaction of selfish agents. In our game, agents that correspond to nodes of a network can buy incident edges of a given weighted host graph to increase their centrality in the formed network. The cost of an edge is proportional to its length, and both endpoints must agree and pay for an edge to be created. This setting is known for having a high price of anarchy.
  To uncover the impact of cooperation, we investigate the price of anarchy of our network formation game with respect to multiple solution concepts that allow for varying amounts of cooperation. On the negative side, we show that on host graphs with arbitrary edge weights even the strongest form of cooperation cannot improve the price of anarchy. In contrast to this, as our main result, we show that cooperation has a significant positive impact if the given host graph has metric edge weights. For this, we prove asymptotically tight bounds on the price of anarchy via a novel proof technique that might be of independent interest and can be applied in other models with metric weights.</description>

      <title>Capital Games and Growth Equilibria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine formal games that we call "capital games" in which player payoffs are known, but their payoffs are not guaranteed to be von Neumann-Morgenstern utilities. In capital games, the dynamics of player payoffs determine their utility functions. Different players can have different payoff dynamics. We make no assumptions about where these dynamics come from, but implicitly assume that they come from the players' actions and interactions over time. We define an equilibrium concept called "growth equilibrium" and show a correspondence between the growth equilibria of capital games and the Nash equilibria of standard games.</description>

      <title>Statistically Truthful Auctions via Acceptance Rule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12016v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Auctions are key for maximizing sellers' revenue and ensuring truthful bidding among buyers. Recently, an approach known as differentiable economics based on machine learning (ML) has shown promise in learning powerful auction mechanisms for multiple items and participants. However, this approach has no guarantee of strategy-proofness at test time. Strategy-proofness is crucial as it ensures that buyers are incentivized to bid their true valuations, leading to optimal and fair auction outcomes without the risk of manipulation. In this work, we propose a formulation of statistical strategy-proofness for auction mechanisms. Specifically, we offer a method that bounds the regret -- quantifying deviation from truthful bidding -- below a pre-specified level with high probability. Building upon conformal prediction techniques, we develop an auction acceptance rule that leverages regret predictions to guarantee that the data-driven auction mechanism meets the statistical strategy-proofness requirement with high probability. Our method -- Statistically Truthful Auctions via Acceptance Rule (STAR) -- represents a practical middle-ground between two extremes: enforcing truthfulness -- zero-regret -- at the cost of significant revenue loss, and naively using ML to construct auctions with the hope of attaining low regret, with no test-time guarantees.</description>

      <title>An Equilibrium Model for Schedule-Based Transit Networks with Hard Vehicle Capacities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17153v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modelling passenger assignments in public transport networks is a fundamental task for city planners, especially when deliberating network infrastructure decisions. A key aspect of a realistic model is to integrate passengers' selfish routing behaviour under limited vehicle capacities. We formulate a side-constrained user equilibrium model in a schedule-based transit network, where passengers are modelled via a continuum of non-atomic agents that travel from their origin to their destination. An agent's route may comprise several rides along given lines, each using vehicles with hard loading capacities. We give a characterization of (side-constrained) user equilibria via a quasi-variational inequality and prove their existence for fixed departure times by generalizing a well-known result of Bernstein and Smith (Transp. Sci., 1994). We further derive a polynomial time algorithm for single-commodity instances with fixed departure times. For the multi-commodity case with departure time choice, we show that deciding whether an equilibrium exists is NP-hard, and we devise an exponential-time algorithm that computes an equilibrium if it exists, and signals non-existence otherwise. Using our quasi-variational characterization, we formulate a heuristic for computing multi-commodity user equilibria in practice, which is tested on multiple real-world instances. In terms of social cost, the computed user-equilibria are quite efficient compared to a system optimum.</description>

      <title>Balancing Multimodal Training Through Game-Theoretic Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07335v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal learning holds promise for richer information extraction by capturing dependencies across data sources. Yet, current training methods often underperform due to modality competition, a phenomenon where modalities contend for training resources leaving some underoptimized. This raises a pivotal question: how can we address training imbalances, ensure adequate optimization across all modalities, and achieve consistent performance improvements as we transition from unimodal to multimodal data? This paper proposes the Multimodal Competition Regularizer (MCR), inspired by a mutual information (MI) decomposition designed to prevent the adverse effects of competition in multimodal training. Our key contributions are: 1) A game-theoretic framework that adaptively balances modality contributions by encouraging each to maximize its informative role in the final prediction 2) Refining lower and upper bounds for each MI term to enhance the extraction of both task-relevant unique and shared information across modalities. 3) Proposing latent space permutations for conditional MI estimation, significantly improving computational efficiency. MCR outperforms all previously suggested training strategies and simple baseline, clearly demonstrating that training modalities jointly leads to important performance gains on both synthetic and large real-world datasets. We release our code and models at https://github.com/kkontras/MCR.</description>

      <title>Construct to Commitment: The Effect of Narratives on Economic Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21060v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study how government-led narratives through mass media evolve from construct, a mechanism for framing expectations, into commitment, a sustainable pillar for growth. We propose the "Narratives-Construct-Commitment (NCC)" framework outlining the mechanism and institutionalization of narratives, and formalize it as a dynamic Bayesian game. Using the Innovation-Driven Development Strategy (2016) as a case study, we identify the narrative shock from high-frequency financial data and trace its impact using local projection method. By shaping expectations, credible narratives institutionalize investment incentives, channel resources into R&amp;D, and facilitate sustained improvements in total factor productivity (TFP). Our findings strive to provide insights into the New Quality Productive Forces initiative, highlighting the role of narratives in transforming vision into tangible economic growth.</description>
