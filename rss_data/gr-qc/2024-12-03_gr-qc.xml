      <title>Generators of Local Lorentz Transformation in ADM-Vielbein Formalism of Gravitational Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: General relativity contains 16 variables in the framework of ADM-Vielbein formalism which are 6 more than metric formalism. These variables emerge due to additional symmetry of Local Lorentz Transformations. In the framework of the Hamiltonian approach, it is expected to find first class constraints which generate this gauge symmetry. We introduce the complete form of such constraints and show that they exactly obey the algebra of the Lorentz group.</description>

      <title>Spacetime-curvature induced uncertainty principle: linking the large-structure global effects to the local black hole physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper links the advanced formulation of the Generalized Uncertainty Principle, termed the Asymptotic Generalized Extended Uncertainty Principle (AGEUP), to the corpuscular framework to derive the AGEUP-inspired black hole metric. The former incorporates spacetime curvature effects to explore black hole dynamics under quantum gravitational corrections, while the latter is a view that black holes are Bose-Einstein condensates of weakly interacting gravitons. In a particular case, the phenomenological union between the AGEUP with cosmological constant $\Lambda$ to the corpuscular framework enabled a black hole metric that has a scaled mass, which depends on $\Lambda$ and the Planck length $l_{\rm Pl}$. Interesting implications occur, such as the maximum limit for mass $M$ where $\Lambda$ ceases to influence the black hole. Another is the derived value of the modulation factor of the EUP term, $\alpha$, if the large-scale fundamental length is defined solely as the cosmological horizon. Additional analysis were done through the shadow and deflection angle phenomena, deriving constraints on the quantum gravity modulation parameter $\beta$. Constraints from the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) and Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) are discussed as avenues for verifying AGEUP-related deviations in black hole shadow radius and deflection angles, offering potential observational evidence of quantum gravitational effects at astrophysical scales. The findings suggest that AGEUP could be instrumental in providing hints on the quantum gravity nature of black holes, particularly in high-energy astrophysical contexts. By linking local black hole physics with large-scale curvature effects, AGEUP paves the way for further research at the intersection of quantum gravity and cosmology, with implications for observational astrophysics and the fundamental structure of spacetime.</description>

      <title>Methodology for constraining ultralight vector bosons with gravitational wave searches targeting merger remnant black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultralight bosons are a hypothetical class of particles predicted under various extensions of Standard Model physics. As a result of the superradiance mechanism, we expect ultralight bosons, should they exist in certain mass ranges, to form macroscopic clouds around rotating black holes, so that we can probe their existence by looking for the long-transient gravitational wave emission produced by such clouds. In this paper, we propose a statistically robust framework for constraining the existence of ultralight vector bosons in the absence of detecting such a signal from searches targeting merger remnant black holes, effectively marginalizing over the uncertainties present in the properties of the target black holes. We also determine the impact of weak kinetic mixing with the ordinary photon and vector mass generation through a hidden Higgs mechanism on the constraining power of these searches. We find that individual follow-up searches, particularly with the next-generation gravitational wave detectors, can probe regions of parameter space for such models where robust constraints are still lacking.</description>

      <title>The Case For Black Hole Remnants: A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been almost 40 years since the proposal of the idea that Hawking radiation of black holes does not lead to a complete evaporation but rather a "remnant" state. Though traditionally viewed with great criticisms especially from the high energy physics community, in recent years, various approaches have demonstrated that black hole remnants remain a viable possibility. In this review, which is primarily aimed as an introduction to the subject, we will discuss some possible routes to forming remnants and their respective properties and challenges.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Models in Lovelock Gravity: An Overview of Recent Progress</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the current review, we provide a summary of the recent progress made in the cosmological aspect of extra-dimensional Lovelock gravity. Our review covers a wide variety of particular model/matter source combinations: Einstein--Gauss--Bonnet as well as cubic Lovelock gravities with vacuum, cosmological constant, perfect fluid, spatial curvature, and some of their combinations. Our analysis suggests that it is possible to set constraints on the parameters of the above-mentioned models from the simple requirement of the existence of a smooth transition from the initial singularity to a realistic low-energy regime. Initially, anisotropic space naturally evolves into a configuration with two isotropic subspaces, and if one of these subspaces is three-dimensional and is expanding while another is contracting, we call it realistic compactification. Of course, the process is not devoid of obstacles, and in our paper, we review the results of the compactification occurrence investigation for the above-mentioned models. In particular, for vacuum and $\Lambda$-term EGB models, compactification is not suppressed (but is not the only possible outcome either) if the number of extra dimensions is $D \geqslant 2$; for vacuum cubic Lovelock gravities it is always present (however, cubic Lovelock gravity is defined only for $D \geqslant 3$ number of extra dimensions); for the EGB model with perfect fluid it is present for $D=2$ (we have not considered this model in higher dimensions yet), and in the presence of spatial curvature, the realistic stabilization of extra dimensions is always present (however, such a model is well-defined only in $D \geqslant 4$ number of extra dimensions).</description>

      <title>On new regular charged black hole solutions: Limiting Curvature Condition, Quasinormal modes and Shadows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce two new static, spherically symmetric regular black hole solutions that can be obtained from non-linear electrodynamics models. For each solution, we investigate the dynamic stability with respect to arbitrary linear fluctuations of the metric and electromagnetic field, and also examine the energy conditions that those black holes satisfy. Moreover, based on those solutions, we present two additional ones that satisfy the Limiting Curvature Condition. Finally, we make a comparison between the two solutions exploring their null geodesics and circular photon orbits.</description>

      <title>Some remarks on Hayward-AdS black hole surrounded by a fluid of strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain a class of solutions corresponding to a generalization of the Hayward black hole by solving the Einstein equations coupled to a particular nonlinear electromagnetic field. The generalization is realized by considering, additionally, the presence of the cosmological constant and a source corresponding to an anisotropic fluid, namely, a fluid of strings, that surrounds the black hole. We show that the obtained class of solutions preserves or does not the regularity of the original Hayward black hole solution, depending on the values of the parameter $\beta$ which labels the different solutions. We discuss the characteristics of the solutions, from the point of view of the singularities of spacetime, by examining the behavior of the Kretschmann scalar as well as of the geodesics concerning their completeness. We analyze some aspects of thermodynamics, particularizing one of the solutions obtained, namely, for $\beta =-1/2$, in which case the regularity of the Hayward black hole is preserved. Some thermodynamic quantities are obtained and analyzed, for example, pressure, heat capacity, and the critical points, and we show how these quantities change for different values of the parameter $q$ associated with the original Hayward solution, as well as with the parameter $b$ associated with the presence of the fluid of strings. The phase transitions are also analyzed by using the equation of state and the Gibbs free energy.</description>

      <title>Parameter estimation of microlensed gravitational waves with Conditional Variational Autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational lensing of gravitational waves (GWs) provides a unique opportunity to study cosmology and astrophysics at multiple scales. Detecting microlensing signatures, in particular, requires efficient parameter estimation methods due to the high computational cost of traditional Bayesian inference. In this paper we explore the use of deep learning, namely Conditional Variational Autoencoders (CVAE), to estimate parameters of microlensed binary black hole (simulated) waveforms. We find that our CVAE model yields accurate parameter estimation and significant computational savings compared to Bayesian methods such as bilby (up to five orders of magnitude faster inferences). Moreover, the incorporation of CVAE-generated priors in bilby reduces the average runtime of the latter in about 48% with no penalty on its accuracy. Our results suggest that a CVAE model is a promising tool for future low-latency searches of lensed signals. Further applications to actual signals and integration with advanced pipelines could help extend the capabilities of GW observatories in detecting microlensing events.</description>

      <title>Charged black hole solutions in $f(R,T)$ gravity coupled to nonlinear electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate static and spherically symmetric black hole solutions in $f(R,T)$ gravity, where $R$ is the curvature scalar and $T$ is the trace of the energy-momentum tensor, coupled to nonlinear electrodynamics (NLED). To construct our solutions, we adopt a linear functional form, $f(R,T) = R + \beta T$. In the limit $\beta = 0$, the theory reduces to General Relativity (GR), recovering $f(R,T) \approx R$. We propose a power-law Lagrangian of the form $\mathcal{L} = f_0 + F + \alpha F^p$, where $\alpha =f_0= 0$ corresponds to the linear electrodynamics case. Using this setup, we derive the metric functions and determine an effective cosmological constant. Our analysis focuses on specific cases with $p = 2$, $p = 4$, and $p = 6$, where we formulate analytic expressions for the matter fields supporting these solutions in terms of the Lagrangian as a function of $F$. Additionally, we verify the regularity of the solutions and study the structure of the event horizons. Furthermore, we examine a more specific scenario by determining the free forms of the first and second derivatives $\mathcal{L}_F(r)$ and $\mathcal{L}_{FF}(r)$ of the Lagrangean of the nonlinear electromagnetic field. From these relations, we derive the general form of $\mathcal{L}_{\text{NLED}}(r)$ using consistency relations. This Lagrangian exhibits an intrinsic nonlinearity due to the influence of two constants, $\alpha$ and $\beta$. Specifically, $\alpha$ originates from the power-law term in the proposed Lagrangian, while $\beta$ arises from the assumed linear function $f(R,T)$. The interplay of these constants ensures that the nonlinearity of the Lagrangian is governed by both $\alpha$ and $\beta$, rather than $\alpha$ alone.</description>

      <title>Grey-body factors for gravitational and electromagnetic perturbations around Gibbons-Maeda-Garfinkle-Horovits-Strominger black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While grey-body factors for a test scalar field in stringy black holes described by the renowned Gibbons-Maeda-Garfinkle-Horowitz-Strominger (GMGHS) solution have been analyzed in the literature, no such analysis exists for gravitons, likely due to the complexity of the perturbation equations. In this study, we utilize known data on quasinormal modes and the relationship between quasinormal modes and grey-body factors to derive these factors for gravitational and electromagnetic perturbations of the dilaton black hole. Our findings indicate that grey-body factors are significantly suppressed by the dilaton parameter as the black hole's charge approaches its extreme value. The iso-spectrality between axial and polar channels of perturbations is broken in the presence of the dilaton field, which leads to different grey-body factors for different types of perturbations.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Accelerations Characterize the Instability of the Critical Friedmann Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a definitive characterization of the instability of the pressureless ($p=0$) critical ($k=0$) Friedmann spacetime to smooth radial perturbations. We use this to characterize the global accelerations away from $k\leq0$ Friedmann spacetimes induced by the instability in the underdense case. The analysis begins by incorporating the Friedmann spacetimes into a mathematical analysis of smooth spherically symmetric solutions of the Einstein field equations expressed in self-similar coordinates $(t,\xi)$ with $\xi=\frac{r}{t}&lt;1$, conceived to realize the critical Friedmann spacetime as an unstable saddle rest point $SM$. We identify a new maximal asymptotically stable family $\mathcal{F}$ of smooth outwardly expanding solutions which globally characterize the evolution of underdense perturbations. Solutions in $\mathcal{F}$ align with a $k&lt;0$ Friedmann spacetime at early times, generically introduce accelerations away from $k&lt;0$ Friedmann spacetimes at intermediate times and then decay back to the same $k&lt;0$ Friedmann spacetime as $t\to\infty$ uniformly at each fixed radius $r&gt;0$. We propose $\mathcal{F}$ as the maximal asymptotically stable family of solutions into which generic underdense perturbations of the unstable critical Friedmann spacetime will evolve and naturally admit accelerations away from Friedmann spacetimes within the dynamics of solutions of Einstein's original field equations, that is, without recourse to a cosmological constant or dark energy.</description>

      <title>Interacting quark matter and $f(Q)$ gravity: A new paradigm in exploring the properties of quark stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics corrections and the colour superconductivity indicate that strongly interacting matter can manifest unique physical behaviours under extreme conditions. Motivated by this notion, we investigate the interior structure and properties of quark stars composed of interacting quark matter, which provides a comprehensive avenue to explore the strong interaction effects, within the framework of $f(Q)$ gravity. A unified equation of state is formulated to describe various phases of quark matter, including up-down quark matter $(2SC)$, strange quark matter $(2SC+s)$, and the Colour-Flavor Locked $(CFL)$ phase. By employing a systematic reparametrisation and rescaling, the number of degrees of freedom in the equation of state is significantly reduced. Utilising the Buchdahl-I metric ansatz and a linear $f(Q)$ functional form, $f(Q)=\alpha_{0}+\alpha_{1}Q$, we derive the exact solutions of the Einstein field equations in presence of the unified interacting quark matter equation of state. For the $2SC$ phase, we examine the properties of quark stars composed of up-down quark matter. For the $(2SC+s)$and $CFL$ phases, we incorporate the effects of a finite strange quark mass $(m_{s}\neq0)$. The Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations are numerically solved to determine the maximum mass-radius relations for each phase. Our results indicate that the model satisfies key physical criteria, including causality, energy conditions, and stability requirements, ensuring the viability of the configurations. Furthermore, the predicted radii for certain compact star candidates align well with observational data. The study highlights that quark stars composed of interacting quark matter within the $f(Q)$ gravity framework provide a robust and physically consistent stellar model across all considered phases.</description>

      <title>Periodical orbits and waveforms with spontaneous Lorentz symmetry-breaking in Kalb-Ramond gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study time-like geodesics around a spherically symmetric black hole in Kalb-Ramond (KR) gravity, characterized by the parameter $l$, which induces spontaneous Lorentz symmetry breaking. The geodesic equations and effective potential are derived to investigate the influence of $l$. We calculate the marginally bound orbits and innermost stable circular orbits, analyzing the parameter's impact. Periodic orbits are computed numerically and classified within the standard taxonomy, revealing significant effects of $l$ on their momentum and energy. Additionally, we explore an extreme mass ratio inspiral system under the adiabatic approximation to derive gravitational waveforms emitted by an object orbiting a supermassive black hole in KR gravity. These waveforms reflect the distinctive characteristics of periodic orbits and highlight the influence of $l$. With advancements in gravitational wave detection, these results offer insights into black holes influenced by Lorentz symmetry-breaking fields.</description>

Abstract: In the typical data analysis and waveform modelling of the gravitational waves (GWs) signals for binary black holes (BBHs), it's assumed to be isolate sources in the vacuum within the theory of general relativity (GR). However, various kinds of matters may exist around the source or on the path to the detector, and there also exist many different kinds of modified theories of gravity. The effects of these modifications can be characterized within the parameterized post-Einstein (ppE) framework, and the corresponding phase corrections on the waveform at leading post-Newtonian (PN) order are also expressed by the additional parameters for these effects. In this work, we consider the varying-G theory and the dynamical friction of the dark matter spike as an example. Both of these two effects will modify the waveform at -4PN order, if we choose the suitable power law index for the spike. We choose to use a statistic to characterize the dispersion between the posterior of $\dot G$ for different events. For different astronomical models, we find that this statistic can distinguish these two models very effectively. This result indicates that we could use this statistic to distinguish other degenerate effects with the detection of multiple sources.</description>

      <title>Quantum steering for different types of Bell-like states in gravitational background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a relativistic framework, it is generally accepted that quantum steering of maximally entangled states provide greater advantages in practical applications compared to non-maximally entangled states. In this paper, we investigate quantum steering for four different types of Bell-like states of fermionic modes near the event horizon of a Schwarzschild black hole. In some parameter spaces, the peak of steering asymmetry corresponds to a transition from two-way to one-way steerability for Bell-like states under the influence of the Hawking effect. It is intriguing to find that the fermionic steerability of the maximally entangled states experiences sudden death with the Hawking temperature, while the fermionic steerability of the non-maximally entangled states maintains indefinite persistence at infinite Hawking temperature. In contrast to prior research, this finding suggests that quantum steering of non-maximally entangled states is more advantageous than that of maximally entangled states for processing quantum tasks in the gravitational background. This surprising result overturns the traditional idea of ``the advantage of maximally entangled steering in the relativistic framework" and provides a new perspective for understanding the Hawking effect of the black hole.</description>

      <title>Explicit symplectic integrators with adaptive time steps in curved spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, our group developed explicit symplectic methods for curved spacetimes that are not split into several explicitly integrable parts, but are via appropriate time transformations. Such time-transformed explicit symplectic integrators should have employed adaptive time steps in principle, but they are often difficult in practical implementations. In fact, they work well if time transformation functions cause the time-transformed Hamiltonians to have the desired splits and approach 1 or constants for sufficiently large distances. However, they do not satisfy the requirement of step-size selections in this case. Based on the step-size control technique proposed by Preto $\&amp;$ Saha, the nonadaptive time step time-transformed explicit symplectic methods are slightly adjusted as adaptive ones. The adaptive methods have only two additional steps and a negligible increase in computational cost as compared with the nonadaptive ones. Their implementation is simple. Several dynamical simulations of particles and photons near black holes have demonstrated that the adaptive methods typically improve the efficiency of the nonadaptive methods. Because of the desirable property, the new adaptive methods are applied to investigate the chaotic dynamics of particles and photons outside the horizon in a Schwarzschild-Melvin spacetime. The new methods are widely applicable to all curved spacetimes corresponding to Hamiltonians or time-transformed Hamiltonians with the expected splits. Also application to the backwards ray-tracing method for studying the motion of photons and shadows of black holes is possible.</description>

      <title>Adaptive cancellation of mains power interference in continuous gravitational wave searches with a hidden Markov model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous gravitational wave searches with terrestrial, long-baseline interferometers are hampered by long-lived, narrowband features in the power spectral density of the detector noise, known as lines. Candidate GW signals which overlap spectrally with known lines are typically vetoed. Here we demonstrate a line subtraction method based on adaptive noise cancellation, using a recursive least squares algorithm, a common approach in electrical engineering applications such as audio and biomedical signal processing. We validate the line subtraction method by combining it with a hidden Markov model (HMM), a standard continuous wave search tool, to detect an injected continuous wave signal with an unknown and randomly wandering frequency, which overlaps with the mains power line at $60 \, {\rm Hz}$ in the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO). The performance of the line subtraction method is tested on an injected continuous wave signal obscured by (a) synthetic noise data with both Gaussian and non-Gaussian components, and (b) real noise data obtained from the LIGO Livingston detector. In both cases, before applying the line subtraction method the HMM does not detect the injected continuous wave signal. After applying the line subtraction method the mains power line is suppressed by 20--40 dB, and the HMM detects the underlying signal, with a time-averaged root-mean-square error in the frequency estimate of $\sim 0.05 $ Hz. The performance of the line subtraction method with respect to the characteristics of the 60 Hz line and the control parameters of the recursive least squares algorithm is quantified in terms of receiver operating characteristic curves.</description>

      <title>Background-dependent and classical correspondences between $f(Q)$ and $f(T)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $f(Q)$ and $f(T)$ gravity are based on fundamentally different geometric frameworks, yet they exhibit many similar properties. In this article, we identify two types of background-dependent and classical correspondences between these two theories of gravity. The first correspondence is rooted in their equivalence within the background of Minkowski spacetime, while the second is based on the equivalence of their equations of motion. To establish the first correspondence, we develop the tetrad-spin formulation of $f(Q)$ gravity and we derive the corresponding expression for the spin connection. Additionally, we extract the equations of motion of $f(Q)$ gravity within this tetrad-spin framework and we elucidate the relationship through an example in spherical coordinates. For the second correspondence, we derive the general affine connection for the static and spherically symmetric spacetime in $f(Q)$ gravity, and we compare its equations of motion with the ones of $f(T)$ gravity. Amongst others, our results reveal that, within our affine connection branch, $f(T)$ solutions are not simply a subset of $f(Q)$ solutions; rather, they encompass a complex solution beyond $f(Q)$ gravity.</description>

      <title>Minimally Deformed Regular Bardeen Black Hole Solutions in Rastall Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we utilize the minimal geometric deformation technique of gravitational decoupling to extend the regular Bardeen black hole, leading to the derivation of new black hole solutions within the framework of Rastall theory. By decoupling the field equations associated with an extended matter source into two subsystems, we address the first subsystem using the metric components of the regular Bardeen black hole. The second subsystem, incorporating the effects of the additional source, is solved through a constraint imposed by a linear equation of state. By linearly combining the solutions of these subsystems, we obtain two extended models. We then explore the distinct physical properties of these models for specific values of the Rastall and decoupling parameters. Our investigations encompass effective thermodynamic variables such as density and anisotropic pressure, asymptotic flatness, energy conditions, and thermodynamic properties including Hawking temperature, entropy, and specific heat. The results reveal that both models violate asymptotic flatness of the resulting spacetimes. The violation of energy conditions indicate the presence of exotic matter, for both models. Nonetheless, the energy density, radial pressure, as well as the Hawking temperature exhibit acceptable behavior, while the specific heat and Hessian matrix suggest thermodynamic stability.</description>

      <title>Probing Dark Energy Properties in $f Q,C)$ Gravity with FLRW Cosmological Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study delves into the cosmological implications of the $f(Q,C)$ modified gravity framework within the context of the FLRW spacetime which offers a dynamic alternative to the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. Here, we define the transit form of Hubble's parameter to explain several geometrical and physical aspects. The chosen parametric form of the Hubble parameter represents a smooth transition from the decelerating early universe to the accelerating present and late-time evolution. Employing observational datasets such as the Hubble parameter, Type Ia supernovae, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), and Standard Candles (SC), we constrain the model parameters using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. The isotropic pressure, energy density, equation of state parameter, and energy conditions were analyzed to explore the physical viability of the $f(Q,C)$ framework. The results highlight the model's ability to replicate key cosmological behaviors, including the accelerated expansion driven by dark energy.</description>

      <title>Fast and efficient Bayesian method to search for strongly lensed gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A small fraction of the gravitational-wave (GW) signals from binary black holes observable by ground-based detectors will be strongly lensed by intervening objects such as galaxies and clusters. Strong lensing will produce nearly identical copies of the GW signals separated in time. These lensed signals must be identified against a background of unlensed pairs GW events, some of which may appear similar by accident. This is usually done using fast, but approximate methods that, for example, check for the overlap between the posterior distributions of a subset of binary parameters, or using slow, but accurate joint Bayesian parameter estimation. In this work, we present a modified version of the posterior overlap method dubbed "PO2.0" that is mathematically equivalent to joint parameter estimation while still remaining fast. We achieve a significant gain in efficiency by incorporating informative priors about the binary and lensing populations, selection effects, and all the inferred parameters of the binary. For binary black hole signals lensed by galaxies, our improved method can detect 65% lensed events at a pair-wise false alarm probability of $\sim 2\times 10^{-6}$. Consequently, we have a 13% probability of detecting a strongly lensed event above $2.25\sigma$ significance during 18 months of observation by the LIGO-Virgo detectors at their current sensitivity. We also show how we can compute the joint posteriors of the lens and source parameters from a pair of lensed events by reweighting the posteriors of individual events in a computationally inexpensive way.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Torsion-Bar Antenna (TOBA) is a torsion pendulum-based gravitational detector developed to observe gravitational waves in frequencies between 1 mHz and 10 Hz. The low resonant frequency of the torsion pendulum enables observation in this frequency band on the ground. The final target of TOBA is to observe gravitational waves with a 10 m detector and expand the observation band of gravitational waves. In this paper, an overview of TOBA, including the previous prototype experiments and the current ongoing development, is presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present in the form of a catalogue of the cosmological perturbations within the Bahamonde- Dialektopoulos-Levi Said (BDLS) theory, which serves as the teleparallel counterpart of Horndeski gravity. To understand structure formation in cosmological models, it is essential to study both the background and perturbative aspects of their cosmology. While extensive analysis of both Horndeski gravity and its teleparallel analog exists in the literature, a quantitative understanding requires a detailed examination of their cosmological perturbations. We review here all the different gauges for the scalar, vector and tensor perturbations of a cosmological background up to second order and we hope this will help people who work with observations, to incorporate it in existing codes.</description>

      <title>Quantum-reduced loop gravity: New perspectives on the kinematics and dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic approach to the kinematics of quantum-reduced loop gravity, a model originally proposed by Alesci and Cianfrani as an attempt to probe the physical implications of loop quantum gravity. We implement the quantum gauge-fixing procedure underlying quantum-reduced loop gravity by introducing a master constraint operator on the kinematical Hilbert space of loop quantum gravity, representing a set of gauge conditions which classically constrain the densitized triad to be diagonal. The standard Hilbert space of quantum-reduced loop gravity can be recovered as a space of solutions of the master constraint operator, while on the other hand the master constraint approach provides a useful starting point for considering possible generalizations of the standard construction. We also examine the quantum dynamics of states consisting of a single six-valent node in the quantum-reduced framework. We find that the Hamiltonian which governs the dynamics of such states bears a close formal resemblance to the Hamiltonian constraint of Bianchi I models in loop quantum cosmology.</description>

      <title>On the dynamics of single-vertex states in quantum-reduced loop gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we examine a Hamiltonian constraint operator governing the dynamics of simple quantum states, whose graph consists of a single six-valent vertex, in quantum-reduced loop gravity. To this end, we first derive the action of the Hamiltonian constraint on generic basis states in the Hilbert space of quantum-reduced loop gravity. Specializing to the example of the single-vertex states, we find that the Euclidean part of the Hamiltonian bears a close formal similarity to the Hamiltonian constraint of Bianchi I models in loop quantum cosmology. Extending the formal analogy to the Lorentzian part of the Hamiltonian suggests a possible modified definition of the Hamiltonian constraint for loop quantum cosmology, in which the Lorentzian part, corresponding to the scalar curvature of the spatial surfaces, is not assumed to be identically vanishing, and is represented by a non-trivial operator in the quantum theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research paper investigates the impact of non-metricity and matter source on the geometry of charged spheres in the presence of anisotropic matter configuration. We use a specific model of extended symmetric teleparallel theory to minimize the complexity of the field equations. Moreover, the feasible non-singular solutions are used to examine the interior composition of the charged spheres. The Darmois junction conditions are used to determine the unknown constants in the metric coefficients. We explore some significant properties in the interior of compact stars under consideration to check their viable existence in this modified framework. The equilibrium state of the charged spheres is discussed using the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation and stability is analyzed by sound speed and Herrera cracking approach. We find that the charged spheres in this theoretical framework are physically viable and stable.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Tilt and Tensor-to-Scalar Ratio in the Multi-Scalar Field Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present work investigates the possible range of the spectral index $n_s$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ for a sub-class of the generalized multi-scalar field inflation, which includes a linear coupling term between the multi-scalar field potential and the canonical Lagrangian. This coupling influences the slow-roll parameters and also alters our predictions for $n_{s}$ and $r$, which directly depend on those parameters. More precisely, compared to standard multi-field inflation, the values of $n_{s}$ and $r$ decrease to levels consistent with the recent Planck+BICEP/Keck constraint. Interestingly, this validates the chaotic-type potential $V=\sum_{i} \mu_{i} \phi_{i}^{p}$, which were previously ruled out in the light of the current observations.</description>

      <title>Mass inflation and strong cosmic censorship conjecture in covariant quantum gravity black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, a solution to the long-standing issue of general covariance in canonical quantum gravity has been proposed, leading to the proposal of two black hole solutions. From the above, a fundamental question arises: which solution is superior? Note that one of the solutions possesses a Cauchy horizon. Considering this quantum black hole solution with a Cauchy horizon, in the present letter, we explore whether it exhibits properties similar to those of the Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black hole. Given its geometric similarity, by applying the generalized Dray-'t Hooft-Redmond relation, we find evidence of mass inflation and divergence in scalar curvature, indicating that the Cauchy horizon is unstable. While this is consistent with the Strong Cosmic Censorship Conjecture, it suggests that it does not represent a regular black hole. Furthermore, we extend the metric to include a cosmological constant and study the validity of Strong Cosmic Censorship conjecture for the quantum black hole in de Sitter spacetime. The results indicate that the presence of a cosmological constant cannot prevent the violation of the conjecture when the quantum black hole approaches its extreme limit. These reasons suggest that the other black hole solution, which does not have a Cauchy horizon, is more preferable.</description>

      <title>Emission and detection of ultra high frequency gravitational waves from highly eccentric orbits of compact binary systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ultra high frequency emission of gravitational waves by binary systems of black holes has recently been investigated in details in the framework of new experimental ideas around resonant cavities. In this article, we consider the case of elliptic trajectories. At fixed masses and frequency, we conclude that the total amount of energy radiated by the system within the bandwidth of the detector can be significantly higher than for circular orbits. However, due to subtle experimental effects, the signal-to-noise ratio is, overall, a decreasing function of the eccentricity. Limits on the maximum distance at which a merging system of black holes can be detected derived for circular orbits are therefore not improved by considering elliptic trajectories. The article is written as pedagogically as possible so as to be accessible to the non-familiar reader.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Long Wavelength Approximation: Next-generation Gravitational-Wave Detectors and Frequency-dependent Antenna Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The response of a gravitational-wave (GW) interferometer is spatially modulated and is described by two antenna patterns, one for each polarization state of the waves. The antenna patterns are derived from the shape and size of the interferometer, usually under the assumption that the interferometer size is much smaller than the wavelength of the gravitational waves (long wavelength approximation, LWA). This assumption is well justified as long as the frequency of the gravitational waves is well below the free spectral range (FSR) of the Fabry-Perot cavities in the interferometer arms as it happens for current interferometers ($\mathrm{FSR}=37.5$~kHz for the LIGO interferometers and $\mathrm{FSR}=50$~kHz for Virgo and KAGRA). However, the LWA can no longer be taken for granted with third--generation instruments (Einstein Telescope, Cosmic Explorer and LISA) because of their longer arms. This has been known for some time, and previous analyses have mostly been carried out in the frequency domain. In this paper, we explore the behavior of the frequency--dependent antenna patterns in the time domain and in the time--frequency domain, with specific reference to the searches of short GW transients. We analyze the profound changes in the concept of Dominant Polarization Frame, which must be generalized in a nontrivial way, we show that the conventional likelihood-based analysis of coherence in different interferometers can no longer be applied as in current analysis pipelines, and that methods based on the null stream in triangular (60{\deg}) interferometers no longer work. Overall, this paper establishes methods and tools that can be used to overcome these difficulties in the unmodeled analysis of short GW transients.</description>

      <title>Radiating Love: adiabatic tidal fluxes and modes up to next-to-next-to-leading post-Newtonian order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the analytic evaluation of the gravitational energy and of the angular momentum flux with tidal effects for inspiraling compact binaries, at next-to-next-to-leading post-Newtoian (2PN) order, within the effective field theory diagrammatic approach. We first compute the stress-energy tensor for a binary system, that requires the evaluation of two-point Feynman integrals, up to two loops. Then, we extract the multipole moments of the system, which we present for generic orbits in center-of-mass coordinates, and which are needed for the evaluation of the total gravitational energy and the angular momentum flux, for generic orbits. Finally, we provide the expression of gauge invariant quantities such as the fluxes, and the mode amplitudes and phase of the emitted gravitational wave, for circular orbits. Our findings are useful to update earlier theoretical studies as well as related phenomenological analyses, and waveform models</description>

      <title>Does matter Kerr?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Working in momentum space and at linear order in the gravitational coupling, we derive the most general class of energy-momentum tensors associated with a given multipolar structure of the spacetime in arbitrary dimensions, and built out of a mass and an angular momentum, at any order in the spin expansion. In this formalism, we are able to derive directly the full multipolar structure of any solution from the multipole expansion of the energy-momentum tensor, in complete analogy to Newtonian gravity. In particular, we identify the recurrence relations that allow obtaining the multipolar structure of the Kerr and the Myers-Perry black hole solutions, defining source multipoles in a General Relativity context for the first time. For these solutions, we are able to resum the energy-momentum tensor in momentum space at all orders in the angular momentum, and compute its real-space version. In the Kerr case we exactly obtain the matter source found by Israel, namely an equatorial, pressureless thin disk rotating at superluminal speed. For Myers-Perry in five dimensions, the matter distribution is a three-ellipsoid in four spatial dimensions with nontrivial stresses. Remarkably, for any dimensions, the matter configuration is a lower-dimensional distribution which has the same singularity structure as the fully non-linear black-hole solution. Our formalism underscores the advantage of working in momentum space to generate nontrivial matter sources for non-linear spacetimes, and could be used to construct regular non-exotic matter configurations that source spinning black hole solutions or horizonless compact objects with the same multipolar structure as black holes.</description>

      <title>Linear perturbations in Horndeski theories with spatial curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse the implications of the presence of spatial curvature in modified gravity models. As it is well known, the current standard cosmological model, the $\Lambda$CDM, is assumed to be spatially flat based on the results of many experiments. However, this statement does not necessarily hold for a modified gravity (MG) model, and this leads to couplings of the spatial curvature with the parameters of the chosen cosmological model. In this paper, we illustrate the theoretical development of how spatial curvature affects the equations of motion at linear order for scalar and tensor perturbations modes using a model-independent approach based on the formalism of the Effective Field Theory (EFT) of dark energy (DE). The results show that spatial curvature gives rise to a coupling with the scalar field perturbations and the functions parameterizing the model.</description>

      <title>Particle dynamics and the accretion disk around a Self-dual Black Hole immersed in a magnetic field in Loop Quantum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the motion of magnetic dipoles and electrically charged particles in the vicinity of a self-dual black hole in Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) immersed in an external asymptotically uniform magnetic field. We explore the effects of the quantum correction parameter and electromagnetic interactions on the particle geodesics. We derive the field equations and determine the electromagnetic four-vector potential for the case of a self-dual black hole in LQG. We investigate the innermost stable circular orbits (ISCOs) for both magnetic dipoles and electrically charged particles in detail, demonstrating that the quantum correction parameter significantly influences on the ISCO radius, causing it to shrink. Additionally, we show that the ISCO radius of magnetic dipoles is greater than that of electrically charged particles due to the magnetic field interaction. We investigate the ISCO parameters (i.e., $r_{ISCO}$, $l_{ISCO}$, $\mathcal{E}_{ISCO}$, $v_{ISCO}$, and $\Omega_{ISCO}$) for magnetic dipoles and electrically charged particles, providing detailed values. Furthermore, we examine the trajectories of charged particles under various scenarios resulting from the quantum correction parameter $P$. Finally, analyzing the ISCO parameters that define the inner edge of the accretion disk, we explore the accretion disk around a self-dual black hole in LQG. We delve into the electromagnetic radiation flux, temperature, and differential luminosity as radiation properties of the accretion disk in detail. We show that the quantum correction parameter shifts the profile of the electromagnetic flux and accretion disk temperature towards the central object, leading to a slight increase in these quantities.</description>

      <title>Black Hole Orbit Classification: The Synergistic Effects of Cloud Strings, Gauss-Bonnet Terms, and Non-Commutative Parameters in Identifying WGC candidate Models: WGC as WCCC protector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of non-commutative geometry and Gauss-Bonnet corrections in an action and the study of their black hole responses can provide highly intriguing insights. Our primary motivation for this study is to understand the interplay of these two parameters on the geodesics of spacetime, including photon spheres and time-like orbits. In this study, we found that this integration, in its initial form, can limit the value of the Gauss-Bonnet parameter ($\alpha$), creating a critical threshold beyond which changes in the non-commutative parameter ($\Xi$) become ineffective, and the structure can only manifest as a naked singularity. Furthermore, we found that using a more complex model, which includes additional factors such as a cloud of strings and linear charge, as a sample for studying spacetime geodesics, yield different and varied results. In this scenario, negative $\alpha$ values can also play a role, notably preserving the black hole form even with a super-extremal charge ($q &gt; m$). For $\alpha&gt; 0.1$, the black hole mass parameter becomes significantly influential, with a critical mass below which the impact of other parameter changes is nullified. Interestingly, considering a more massive black hole, this high-mass state also maintains its black hole form within the super-extremal charge range. The existence of these two models led us to our main goal. By examining the temperature for these two cases, we find that both situations are suitable for studying the WGC. Finally, based on the behavior of these two models, we will explain how the WGC acts as a logical solution and a protector for the WCCC.</description>

      <title>A robust cosmic standard ruler from the cross-correlations of galaxies and dark sirens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observations of gravitational waves (GWs) from dark sirens allow us to infer their locations and distances. Galaxies, on the other hand, have precise angular positions but no direct measurement of their distances -- only redshifts. The cross-correlation of GWs, which we limit here to binary black hole mergers (BBH), in spherical shells of luminosity distance $D_L$, with galaxies in shells of redshift $z$, leads to a direct measurement of the Hubble diagram $D_L(z)$. Since this standard ruler relies only on the statistical proximity of the dark sirens and galaxies (a general property of large-scale structures), it is essentially model-independent: the correlation is maximal when both redshift and $D_L$ shells coincide. We forecast the constraining power of this technique, which we call {\it{Peak Sirens}}, for run~5~(O5) of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK), as well as for the third-generation experiments Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer. We employ thousands of full-sky light cone simulations with realistic numbers for the tracers, and include masking by the Milky Way, lensing and inhomogeneous GW sky coverage. We find that the method is not expected to suffer from some of the issues present in other dark siren methods, such as biased constraints due to incompleteness of galaxy catalogs or dependence on priors for the merger rates of BBH. We show that with Peak Sirens, given the projected O5 sensitivity, LVK can measure $H_0$ with $7\%$ precision by itself, assuming $\Lambda$CDM, and $4\%$ precision using external datasets to constrain $\Omega_m$. We also show that future third-generation GW detectors can achieve, without external data, sub-percent uncertainties in $H_0$ assuming $\Lambda$CDM, and 3\% in a more flexible $w_0w_a$CDM model. The method also shows remarkable robustness against systematic effects such as the modeling of non-linear structure formation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the linearised dispersion relations of shear waves, heat waves, and sound waves in relativistic ''matter+radiation'' fluids with grey absorption opacities. This is done by solving radiation hydrodynamics perturbatively in the ratio ''radiation stress-energy''/''matter stress-energy''. The resulting expressions $\omega \, {=} \, \omega(k)$ accurately describe the hydrodynamic evolution for any $k\, {\in}\, \mathbb{R}$. General features of the dynamics (e.g., covariant stability, propagation speeds, and damping of discontinuities) are argued directly from the analytic form of these dispersion relations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: X-ray reflection spectroscopy is a powerful tool to study the strong gravity region of black holes. The next generation of astrophysical X-ray missions promises to provide unprecedented high-quality data, which could permit us to get very precise measurements of the properties of the accretion flow and of the spacetime geometry in the strong gravity region around these objects. In this work, we test the accuracy of the relativistic calculations of the reflection model relxill and of its extension to non-Kerr spacetimes relxill_nk in view of the next generation of X-ray missions. We simulate simultaneous observations with Athena/X-IFU and LAD of bright Galactic black holes with a precise and accurate ray-tracing code and we fit the simulated data with the latest versions of relline and relline_nk. While we always recover the correct input parameters, we find residuals in the fits when the emission from the inner part of the accretion disk is higher. Such residuals disappear if we increase the number of interpolation points on the disk in the integral of the transfer function. We also simulate full reflection spectra and find that the emission angle from the accretion disk should be treated properly in this case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct new infinite classes of Euclidean supersymmetric solutions of four dimensional minimal gauged supergravity comprising a $U (1) \times U (1)$-invariant, asymptotically locally hyperbolic, metric on the total space of orbifold line bundles over a spindle (bolt). The conformal boundary is generically a squashed, branched, lens space and the graviphoton gauge field can have either twist or anti-twist through the spindle bolt. Correspondingly, the boundary geometry inherits two types of rigid Killing spinors, that we refer to as twist and anti-twist for the three-dimensional Seifert orbifolds, as well as some specific flat connections for the background gauge field, determined by the data of the spindle bolt. For all our solutions we compute the holographically renormalized on-shell action and compare it to the expression obtained via equivariant localization, uncovering a markedly distinct behaviour in the cases of twist and anti-twist. Our results provide precise predictions for the large $N$ limit of the corresponding localized partition functions of three-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal field theories placed on Seifert orbifolds.</description>

      <title>Dynamical black hole entropy beyond general relativity from the Einstein frame</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently Hollands, Wald and Zhang proposed a new formula for the entropy of a dynamical black hole for an arbitrary theory of gravity obtained from a diffeomorphism covariant Lagrangian via the Noether charge method. We present an alternative, pedagogical derivation of the dynamical black hole entropy for $f(R)$ gravity as well as canonical scalar-tensor theory by means of conformal transformations. First, in general relativity we generalize Visser and Yan's pedagogical proof of the non-stationary physical process first law to black holes that may not be in vacuum, and give a pedagogical derivation of the second-order behavior of the dynamical black hole entropy for vacuum perturbations by considering the second-order variation of the Raychaudhuri equation. Second, we apply the derivation for general relativity to theories in the Einstein frames, and then recast the conclusions in their original frames. We show that the dynamical black hole entropy formulae of these theories satisfy both the non-stationary physical process first law and the non-stationary comparison first law via the Einstein frame. We further study the second-order behavior of the dynamical black hole entropy for vacuum perturbations, and observe that the second law is obeyed at second order in those theories. Using the Einstein frame, we also determine the relationship between the dynamical black hole entropy and the Wald entropy of the generalized apparent horizon in the original frame.</description>

      <title>Wedge Holographic Complexity in Karch-Randall Braneworld</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate holographic complexities in the context of wedge holography, focusing specifically on black string geometry in AdS$_3$. The wedge spacetime is bounded by two end-of-the-world (EOW) branes with intrinsic Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati (DGP) gravity. In line with this codimension-two holography, there are three equivalent perspectives: bulk perspective, brane perspective, and boundary perspective. Using both the ''Complexity=Volume'' (CV) and ''Complexity=Action'' (CA) proposals, we analyze the complexity in wedge black string geometry in the tensionless limit. By treating the branes as rigid, we find the late-time growth rates of CV and CA match exactly across bulk and brane perspectives. These results are consistent with those from JT gravity, with additional contributions from the intrinsic gravity of the branes. For fluctuating branes, we find that the late-time growth rates of CV and CA match between bulk and brane perspectives at the linear order of fluctuation. The CV results exhibit $\frac{\phi_h^2}{\phi_0}$ corrections from fluctuations, consistent with the findings in previous work. Moreover, the CA results reveal an additional constant term in the fluctuating branes case. We provide an interpretation of this in terms of gravitational edge mode effects. The distinct corrections arising from fluctuations in the CA and CV proposals suggest that the CV proposal is more sensitive to geometric details. Furthermore, we discuss these results in relation to Lloyd's bound on complexity, their general time dependence, and the effects of fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Topology of Holographic Thermodynamics within Non-extensive Entropy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we delve into the thermodynamic topology of AdS Reissner-Nordstr$\ddot{o}$m (R-N) black holes by employing nonextensive entropy frameworks, specifically R$\acute{e}$nyi (with nonextensive parameter $\lambda$) and Sharma-Mittal entropy (with nonextensive parameter $\alpha, \beta$). Our investigation spans two frameworks: bulk boundary and restricted phase space (RPS) thermodynamics. In the bulk boundary framework, we face singular zero points revealing topological charges influenced by the free parameter $(\lambda)$ with a positive topological charge $(\omega = +1)$ and the total topological charge $(W = +1)$, indicating the presence of a single stable on-shell black hole. Further analysis shows that when $(\lambda)$ is set to zero, the equations align with the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy structure, demonstrating different behaviors with multiple topological charges $(\omega = +1, -1, +1)$. Notably, increasing the parameter $\alpha$ in Sharma-Mittal entropy results in multiple topological charges $(\omega = +1, -1, +1)$ with the total topological charge $(W = +1)$. Conversely, increasing $(\beta)$ reduces the number of topological charges, maintaining the total topological charge $(W = +1)$. Extending our study to the restricted phase space, we observe consistent topological charges $(\omega = +1)$ across all conditions and parameters. This consistency persists even when reducing to Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, suggesting similar behaviors in both non-extended and Hawking entropy states within RPS.</description>

      <title>Exploring cosmological imprints of phantom crossing with dynamical dark energy in Horndeski gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the current era of precision cosmology, the persistence of cosmological tensions, most notably the Hubble tension and the $S_8$ tension, challenges the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. To reconcile these tensions via late-time modifications to expansion history, various features such as phantom crossing in the dark energy equation of state, a negative energy density at high redshifts, etc., are favoured. However, these scenarios cannot be realized within the framework of GR without introducing ghost or gradient instabilities. In this work, we investigate a dynamical dark energy scenario within the framework of Horndeski gravity, incorporating nonminimal coupling to gravity and self-interactions. We highlight that the model can exhibit novel features like phantom crossing and negative dark energy densities at high redshifts without introducing any instabilities. For this specific Horndeski model, we perform a comprehensive analysis of the background evolution along with the effects on perturbations, examining observables like growth rate, matter and CMB power spectrum. To check the consistency of the model with the observational data, we employ MCMC analysis using BAO/$f\sigma_8$, Supernovae, and CMB data. While the model does not outperform the standard $\Lambda$CDM framework in a combined likelihood analysis, there remains a preference for non-zero values of the model parameters within the data. This suggests that dynamical dark energy scenarios, particularly those with non-minimal couplings, merit further exploration as promising alternatives to GR, offering rich phenomenology that can be tested against a broader range of current and upcoming observational datasets.</description>

Abstract: We analyze solutions of Chamseddine's topological gravity in four space-time dimensions and discover various black hole solutions with(out) torsion as well as those that describe naked singularities. Because all of the solutions belong to the sector with vanishing scalar fields, they share peculiar trait that all conserved charges are vanishing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We focus on three distinct lines of recent developments: edge modes and boundary charges in gravitational physics, relational dynamics in classical and quantum gravity, and quantum reference frames. We argue that these research directions are in fact linked in multiple ways, and can be seen as different aspects of the same research programme. This research programme has two main physical goals and one general conceptual aim. The physical goals are to move beyond the two idealizations/approximations of asymptotic or closed boundary conditions in gravitational physics and of ideal reference frames (coded in coordinate frames or gauge fixings), thus achieving a more realistic modeling of (quantum) gravitational physical phenomena. The conceptual aim is to gain a better understanding of the influence of observers in physics and the ensuing limits of objectivity.</description>

      <title>Estimating the gravitational wave background anisotropy: a Bayesian approach boosted by cross-correlation angular power spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new method designed for Bayesian inference of the angular power spectrum of the Gravitational Wave Background (GWB) anisotropy. This scheme works with time-series data and can optionally incorporate the cross-correlations between the GWB anisotropy and other cosmological tracers, enhancing the significance of Bayesian inference. We employ the realistic LISA response and noise model to demonstrate the validity of this approach. The findings indicate that, without considering any cross-correlations, the 4-year LISA data is insufficient to achieve a significant detection of multipoles. However, if the anisotropies in the GWB are strongly correlated with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), the 4-year data can provide unbiased estimates of the quadrupole moment ($\ell = 2$). This reconstruction process is generic and not restricted to any specific detector, offering a new framework for extracting anisotropies in the GWB data from various current and future gravitational wave observatories.</description>

      <title>Non-Abelian Weyl Symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Abelian gauge symmetry proposed by Hermann Weyl is generalized to its non-Abelian extension. Afterwards the standard model is generalized to incorporate the Abelian and non-Abelian Weyl symmetry. This symmetry extension brings new gauge particles that can be potential candidates for the dark matter. It also naturally introduces a second scalar field into the theory. The breaking of the Weyl symmetry turns this scalar field into a dimensional constant, making the Higgs as the only scalar component in the standard model. In addition to the expected benefits, there are three unexpected bonuses: (1) it brings some new understanding of the parity violation; (2) it provides an answer to the sign problem in the Higgs mechanism; (3) it gives some new perspectives on the nature of the neutrino: non-Abelian Weyl symmetry demands that there \textit{must be} right-handed netrino; furthermore, the smallness of the neutrino mass is protected by the non-Abelian Weyl symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a reply to the Argument from Intimacy on behalf of defenders of emergent spacetime in theories of quantum gravity. We argue that if one accepts that spacetime regions are nowhere in the sense that they are locations but do not have locations, then the Argument from Intimacy can be resolved. We go on to consider a problem with this response, namely that it is unavailable to super-substantivalists. We argue that this is right for identity but not priority super-substantivalists. We then suggest that there is no cost for our solution here, since identity versions of super-substantivalism face severe challenges in the context of spacetime emergence and so should be rejected anyway.</description>

      <title>Lensed fast radio bursts as a probe of time-varying gravitational potential induced by wave dark matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultralight bosonic wave dark matter (DM) is preponderantly contesting the conventional cold DM paradigm in predicting diverse and rich phenomena on small scales. For a DM halo made of ultralight bosons, the wave interference naturally induces slow de Broglie time-scale fluctuations of the gravitational potential. In this paper, we first derive an estimation for the effect of a time-varying gravitational potential on photon propagation. Our numerical simulations suggest that the time-varying potential of a $10^{11}M_{\odot}$ halo composed of $10^{-22}\,\mathrm{eV}$ bosons would stretch or compress a time series signal by a factor of $10^{-10}$. Here, we propose that, due to the precise measurements of their arrival times, lensed repeating fast radio bursts (FRBs) have the potential to effectively validate temporal variations in gravitational potential by monitoring their images over a period of approximately $\mathcal{O}(1)$ years. With rapidly growing FRB observations, this method would serve as a promising method to directly probe the wave nature of galactic DM halos.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The confinement of quarks is analyzed by establishing a correspondence between the effective actions inside a black hole and the QCD action, formulated as a scalar field theory in the Carrollian regime. We first demonstrate that both QCD (in the instanton-dominance limit) and the interior of a black hole can be described at one-loop as the effective action of a soliton in the Carrollian limit. At one-loop, QCD confinement is shown to be entirely analogous to confinement within a black hole, with the event horizon acting as the hadron radius. Higher-order corrections to the effective action do not destabilize the solitons but may produce subtle observable effects, such as deconfinement or a partial resolution to the information loss problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a new proof for the existence of spherically symmetric steady states to the Vlasov-Poisson system, following a strategy that has been used successfully to approximate axially symmetric solutions numerically, both to the Vlasov-Poisson system and to the Einstein-Vlasov system. There are several reasons why a mathematical analysis of this numerical scheme is important. A generalization of the present result to the case of flat axially symmetric solutions would prove that the steady states obtained numerically in \cite{AR3} do exist. Moreover, in the relativistic case the question whether a steady state can be obtained by this scheme seems to be related to its dynamical stability. This motivates the desire for a deeper understanding of this strategy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply an Internal Robustness (iR) analysis to the recently released Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) baryon acoustic oscillations dataset. This approach examines combinations of data subsets through a fully Bayesian model comparison, aiming to identify potential outliers, subsets possibly influenced by systematic errors, or hints of new physics. Using this approach, we identify three data points at $z= 0.295,\,0.51,\,0.71$ as potential outliers. Excluding these points improves the internal robustness of the dataset by minimizing statistical anomalies and enables the recovery of $\Lambda$CDM predictions with a best-fit value of $w_0 = -1.050 \pm 0.128$ and $w_a = 0.208 \pm 0.546$. These results raise the intriguing question of whether the identified outliers signal the presence of systematics or point towards new physics.</description>

In this article we examine the new curvature operator in the setting of quantum-reduced loop gravity. We derive the explicit form of the curvature operator as an operator on the Hilbert space of the quantum-reduced model. As a simple practical example, we study the expectation values of the operator with respect to basis states of the reduced Hilbert space.</description>

Abstract: The Aether Scalar Tensor (AeST) theory is an extension of General Relativity (GR), proposed for addressing galactic and cosmological observations without dark matter. By casting the AeST theory into a $3+1$ form, we determine its full non-perturbative Hamiltonian formulation and analyse the resulting constraints. We find the presence of four first class and four second class constraints and show that the theory has six physical degrees of freedom at the fully nonlinear level. Our results set the basis for determining the propagation of perturbations on general backgrounds and we present the case of small perturbations around Minkowski spacetime as an example stemming from our analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.06232v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Aether Scalar Tensor (AeST) theory is an extension of General Relativity (GR), proposed for addressing galactic and cosmological observations without dark matter.The action for the theory includes a function that can currently only be constrained by phenomenological considerations. In antecedent work, forms of this function were considered that led to an effective fluid contribution to the cosmological evolution equations that approximated that of dust more and more closely at late cosmic times. In this work we consider an alternative set of functions that most closely approximate dust at the earliest cosmic times and where deviations from dust-like behaviour gradually emerge with time. We use the dynamical system formalism to analyze example models from both possible sets of functions, introducing a complete set of dynamical variables describing the spacetime curvature, energy density parameters of different matter components, and AeST scalar field, and obtain the dynamical equations describing cosmological evolution. The cosmological phase space is found to feature invariant submanifolds associated to the absence of the matter components, as well as equilibrium states associated with well-known cosmological behaviors e.g. matter, radiation, and cosmological constant dominated epochs. A full numerical integration of the dynamical system is performed for the models and it is shown that each can closely approximate the $\Lambda \mathrm{CDM}$ model at the level of the cosmic background. Generalizations of the models are considered and it is shown that the new models likely can simultaneously replicate the cosmological successes of cold dark matter whilst satisfying constraints on the theory from the weak-field quasistatic regime.</description>

      <title>Is it possible to separate baryonic from dark matter within the $\Lambda$-CDM formalism?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.10364v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We found general solutions of matter stress-energy (non-)conservation in scalar-tensor FLRW-type cosmological models by extending the logotropic formalism to the case of non-minimal coupling between the scalar field and new dark fluid candidates. The energy conditions expressed by the generating function are introduced. Next, we investigate the possibility of separating baryonic from dark matter and explain their ratio as a chameleon effect in the presence of non-minimal coupling. To answer the question affirmatively we analyze simple extensions of the $\Lambda$-CDM model by adding a non-minimally coupled scalar field in the Einstein frame. Two scenarios involving either a scalaron (quintessence) or a phantom (ghost) are numerically solved and compared. As a result, it is shown that in both cases LCDM model can be reproduced with a high accuracy in the region covered by observations. We have also demonstrated the compatibility of the two models under consideration with available PPN parameters estimations. As expected, in the case of the phantom (ghost) field the Big-Bang scenario is replaced by the (matter) Bounce.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12896v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study supermassive black holes (SMBH), surrounded by a dark matter (DM) spike, that can be found at the centers of Milky Way and $\text{M87}$ galaxies and are accompanied by a specific kind of topological defect. The investigation is developed within the framework of Bumblebee Gravity with a global monopole (BGGM). The dark matter spike is described by a power-law density profile. Our main objective is to assess how the background arising from spontaneous Lorentz symmetry breaking and the presence of a global monopole influence the properties of the Kerr BH within the region affected by the spike. Using a spherically symmetric static BH with BGGM properties as the seed metric, we construct a non-rotating spacetime with a DM spike, resulting in a BGGM-motivated Schwarzschild-like BH by solving the modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations (TOV). Next, we extend this approach to the case of a rotating spacetime resulting in the BGGM-motivated Kerr-like BH (BGMKLBH). This approach allows us to explore the spacetime structure, and the BGMKLBH shadows. Then, using available observational data for the DM spike density and considering the effects of BGGM on $\text{Sgr A}^{*}$ and $\text{M87}^{*}$ SMBHs, we analyse the shapes of their shadows and put constraints on the BGGM parameter. Thus, we infer that the BGMKLBHs could be reliable candidates for the astrophysical BHs.</description>

      <title>Constraining black hole parameters with the precessing jet nozzle of M87*</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17689v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, Cui et al. [Nature \textbf{621}, 711 (2023)] reported that the jet nozzle of M87* exhibits a precession with a period of approximately 11 years. This finding strongly suggests that the supermassive black hole in the core of M87 galaxy is a spinning black hole with a tilted accretion disk. In this paper, our aim is to utilize these observations to preliminarily constrain the parameters of the black hole by using the characteristics of the geodesic motion. Firstly, we investigate the properties of the spherical orbits and the innermost stable spherical orbits with constant radius. The corresponding angular momentum, energy, and Carter constant for both prograde and retrograde orbits are calculated. We find that, compared to equatorial circular orbits, these quantities exhibit significant differences for fixed tilt angles. Moreover, the Carter constant takes positive values for nonvanishing tilt angles. Notably, the presence of misalignment of the orbit angular momentum and black hole spin leads to a precession effect in these spherical orbits. We then make use of these spherical orbits to model the warp radius of the tilted accretion disk, which allows us to determine the corresponding precession period through the motion of massive particles. Further comparing with the observation of M87*, the relationship between the black hole spin and the warp radius is given, through which if one of them is tested, the other one will be effectively determined. Additionally, our study establishes an upper bound on the warp radius of the accretion disk. These findings demonstrate that the precession of the jet nozzle offers a promising approach for testing the physics of strong gravitational regions near a supermassive black holes.</description>

      <title>Sudden cosmological singularities in Aether scalar-tensor theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04091v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we analyze the possibility of sudden cosmological singularities, also known as type-II singularities, in the background of a Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) geometry in an extension of General Relativity (GR) known as Aether scalar-tensor theories (AeST). Similarly to several scalar-tensor theories, we observe that sudden singularities may occur in certain AeST models at the level of the second-order time derivative of the scale factor. These singularities can either be induced by AeST's scalar field itself in the absence of a fluid matter component, or by a divergence of the pressure component of the fluid. In the latter case, one observes that the second-order time derivative of the scalar field $Q$ is also divergent at the instant the sudden singularity happens. We show that the sudden singularities can be prevented by an appropriate choice of the action, for which a divergence in the scalar field compensates the divergence in the pressure component of the matter fluid, thus preserving the regularity of the scale factor and all its time derivatives. For the models featuring a sudden singularity in the second-order time derivative of the scale factor, an analysis of the cosmographic parameters, namely the Hubble and the deceleration parameters, indicates that cosmological models featuring sudden singularities are allowed by the current cosmological measurements. Furthermore, an analysis of the jerk parameter favours cosmological models that attain a sudden singularity at a faster rate, up to a time of at most $t_s\sim 1.2 t_0$, where $t_0$ is the current age of the universe, and with negative values for the cosmological snap parameter.</description>

Abstract: We derive a Weyl invariant equation for Gravity by gauging the global Weyl invariance of vacuum Einstein equations. The equation is linear in the curvature and a natural generalization of Einstein equations to Weyl geometry. The system has 5 physical polarizations, two tensor modes, two vectors modes and one scalar, associated to the cosmological constant. An exact black hole solution is found. We study the dynamics on Friedman backgrounds and the evolution of cosmological perturbations. It is shown that cosmological vector modes do not decay in this model.</description>

      <title>Probing the Solar System for Dark Matter Using the Sagnac Effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04992v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the potential of the Sagnac Effect for detecting dark matter in the Solar System, particularly within the Sun. Originating from the relative delay and interference of light beams traveling in opposite directions on rotating platforms, the effect can account for how varying gravitational conditions affect its manifestation. We analyze the Sagnac time in two static, spherically symmetric spacetimes: Schwarzschild and one incorporating dark matter, in the form of a perfect fluid. Comparing the relative deviations in Sagnac time calculated for these metrics in the reference frame of satellites orbiting our star, which serve as a rotating circular platform and emit laser beams in opposite directions, with the precision of onboard atomic clocks (about $10^{-11}$), allows us to evaluate the potential for detecting dark matter's gravitational influence through this effect.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic quark stars in $f(R,L_m,T)$ gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01970v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of $f(R,L_m,T)$ gravity on the internal structure of compact stars, expecting this theory to manifest prominently in the high-density cores of such stars. In this study, we begin by considering the algebraic function $f(R,L_m,T) = R + \alpha T L_m$, where $\alpha$ represents the matter-geometry coupling constant. We specifically choose the matter Lagrangian density $L_m= -\rho$ to explore compact stars with anisotropic pressure. To this end, we employ the MIT bag model as an equation of state. We then numerically solve the hydrostatic equilibrium equations to obtain mass-radius relations for quark stars, examining static stability criteria, the adiabatic index, and the speed of sound. Finally, we use recent astrophysical data to constrain the coupling parameter $\alpha$, which may lead to either larger or smaller masses for quark stars compared to their counterparts in general relativity.</description>

      <title>New semicoherent targeted search for continuous gravitational waves from pulsars in binary systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03721v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel semicoherent targeted search method for continuous gravitational waves (CWs) emitted by pulsars in binary systems. The method is based on a custom optimization of the coherence time, which is tailored according to the orbital parameters and their uncertainties, as provided by electromagnetic observations. While rotating pulsars are expected to produce quasimonochromatic CWs in their reference frame, their orbital motion introduces additional modulation in the observer's frame, alongside the modulation caused by the Earth's motion. As a result, the received signal is spread across a frequency range, and demodulation techniques must be used to improve sensitivity. However, Doppler corrections can, in some cases, vary significantly within the uncertainties of the orbital parameters, potentially lowering the detection chances of single-template, fully coherent searches. To exploit the constraints derived from electromagnetic observations, we implement a semicoherent search that is more robust than other methods. In this approach, the coherence time is evaluated for each source, taking into account the uncertainties in its orbital parameters. This method was tested and applied to a set of thirteen targets from the ATNF catalog. The search identified one outlier, whose astrophysical origin has been confidently excluded. For the first time to our knowledge, we then set upper limits on the signal strain from these 12 pulsars, with the lowest limit being $h_{UL}\sim9.01\times 10^{-26}$ for PSR~J1326-4728B.</description>

      <title>Classical double copy in the black hole mini-superspace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09374v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a novel formulation of classical double copy in the mini-superspace of static, spherically symmetric black holes where the map between the solutions of general relativity and Maxwell's theory can be realized in Boyer-Lindsquit coordinates. By employing the reduced action principle, we show that the double copy structure can be generalized to Lovelock gravities and quasi-topological gravities. However, the gravitational solutions are mapped to the purely electric solutions of Maxwell's theory with a difference: instead of a direct match between the Kerr-Schild scalar in the gravity side and the scalar potential in the gauge theory side, the scalar potential becomes a polynomial in the Kerr-Schild scalar, giving rise to a generalization of the Kerr-Schild double copy. We calculate the Regge-Teitelboim surface charges and prove that the mass of the black hole solution is identified with the electric charge corresponding to the Coulomb part of the gauge theory solution in the same way it does in the case of general relativity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17941v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this letter, we show that in a particular braneworld scenario with variable brane tension, we obtain matter acting as dark energy while the gravitational constant $G$ promoted to a scalar field on the brane plays the role of matter (both in the sense they have an 'effective' Equation of State equivalent to that of dark energy and matter respectively). This result is interpreted from the Friedmann equation obtained from our model that exactly matches the standard Friedmann equation of General Relativity with a cosmological constant $\Lambda$ in terms of the aforementioned quantities. The universe is assumed to consist of only matter and dark energy in this model which is a good approximation for our universe. We also propose a way to unify early and late-time cosmic acceleration.</description>

      <title>Gravity-induced birefringence in spherically symmetric spacetimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02729v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Geometric optics effectively describes the propagation of electromagnetic waves when the wavelength is much smaller than the characteristic length scale of the medium, making wave phenomena like diffraction negligible. As a result, light propagation in a vacuum is typically modeled by rays that follow null geodesics. However, general relativity predicts that polarization-dependent deviations from these geodesics occur in an inhomogeneous gravitational field. In this article, we evaluate the corrections for the deflection and emission of light by a massive gravitating body. Additionally, we derive the scaling behavior of the physical parameters characterizing the trajectories. The calculations are performed at leading order in frequency. We use these results to assess the significance of the birefringence effect in various astrophysical observations. We find that the effect cannot be measured with current instruments but may be detectable in the near future.</description>

Abstract: In this letter, we study and investigate the effects of the Generalised Uncertainty Principle (GUP) and electric charge on Casimir wormhole geometry in the Curvature-Lagrangian coupled $f(R,L_m)$ gravity. The functional form of the considered model is $f(R,L_m)=\frac{R}{2\kappa}+L_m^{\,\,\alpha}$, corresponding to it the analytic shape function is found. For our analysis, we study the wormhole spacetimes for three particular models for the redshift function. We observe that the null energy condition is violated despite a positive contribution from the electromagnetic energy density. We also note that electric charges, GUP effects, and higher model parameter values increase the throat length. Further, we have studied the deflection of light using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, emphasizing the contribution from GUP by including higher-order terms.</description>

Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) may have formed through the gravitational collapse of cosmological perturbations that were generated and stretched during the inflationary era, later entering the cosmological horizon during the decelerating phase, if their amplitudes were sufficiently large. In this review paper, we will briefly introduce the basic concept of PBHs and review the formation dynamics through this mechanism, the estimation of the initial spins of PBHs and the time evolution of type II fluctuations, with a focus on the radiation-dominated and (early) matter-dominated phases.</description>

      <title>Configurational entropy and stability conditions of fermion and boson stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02803v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a remarkable study by M. Gleiser and N. Jiang [Phys. Rev. D {\bf 92}, 044046, 2015], the authors demonstrated that the stability regions of neutron stars, within the framework of the simple Fermi gas model, and self-gravitating configurations of complex scalar field (boson stars) with various self couplings, obtained through traditional perturbation methods, correlate with critical points of the configurational entropy with an accuracy of a few percent. Recently, P. Koliogiannis \textit{et al.} [Phys. Rev. D {\bf 107}, 044069 2023] found that while the minimization of the configurational entropy generally anticipates qualitatively the stability point for neutron stars and quark stars, this approach lacks universal validity. In this work, we aim to further elucidate this issue by seeking to reconcile these seemingly contradictory findings. Specifically, we calculate the configurational entropy of bosonic and fermionic systems, described by interacting Fermi and boson gases, respectively, that form compact objects stabilized by gravity. We investigate whether the minimization of configurational entropy coincides with the stability point of the corresponding compact objects. Our results indicate a strong correlation between the stability points predicted by configurational entropy and those obtained through traditional methods, with the accuracy of this correlation showing a slight dependence on the interaction strength. Consequently, the stability of compact objects, composed of components obeying Fermi or boson statistics, can alternatively be assessed using the concept of configurational entropy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09333v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this Letter, we investigate the universal classifications of black hole states by considering them as topological defects within the thermodynamic parameter space. Through the asymptotic behaviors of the constructed vector, our results indicate the existence of four distinct topological classifications, denoted as $W^{1-}$, $W^{0+}$, $W^{0-}$, and $W^{1+}$. Within these classifications, the innermost small black hole states are characterized as unstable, stable, unstable, and stable, respectively, while the outermost large ones exhibit an unstable, unstable, stable, and stable behavior. These classifications also display contrasting thermodynamic properties in both low and high Hawking temperature limits. Furthermore, we establish a systematic ordering of the local thermodynamically stable and unstable black hole states as the horizon radius increases for a specific topological classification. These results reveal the universal topological classifications governing black hole thermodynamics, providing valuable insights into the fundamental nature of quantum gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12063v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The perturbations of the hyperbolic motion of a test particle due to the general relativistic gravitoelectromagnetic Schwarzschild and Lense-Thirring components of the gravitational field of a rotating massive body are analytically worked out to the first post-Newtonian level in terms of the osculating Keplerian orbital elements. To the Newtonian order, the impact of the quadrupole mass moment of the source is calculated as well. The resulting analytical expressions are valid for a generic orientation in space of both the orbital plane of the probe and the spin axis of the primary, and for arbitrary values of the eccentricity. They are applied to 'Oumuamua, an interstellar asteroid which recently visited our solar system along an unbound heliocentric orbit, and to the Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous (NEAR) spacecraft during its flyby of the Earth. The calculational approach developed can be straightforwardly extended to any alternative models of gravity as well.</description>

      <title>Existence of Vacuum Wormholes in Einsteinian Cubic Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13996v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wormhole solutions in gravitational theories typically require exotic matter. Here we present a wormhole solution to the field equations of Einsteinian Cubic Gravity -- a phenomenological competitor to general relativity that includes terms cubic in the curvature -- that has no matter, exotic or otherwise. These purely gravitational wormhole geometries are asymptotically AdS but contain a geometric deficit at infinity. The deficit, interpreted as a global monopole, plays an essential role in our construction. We find that our wormhole solution satisfies traversablility criteria. We also find, for different parameters, a range of possible wormhole solutions.</description>

      <title>Linearized gravitational waves in de Sitter space-time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16371v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This is a brief note on a recently flagged issue \cite{CHK} regarding the precise characterization of quadrupolar truncation of the linearized gravitational waves in de Sitter space-time. An apparent inconsistency was noted while transforming the linearized solution truncated to quadrupolar contribution to the Bondi-Sachs form. A consistent truncation was identified as one where the transformation of the truncated solution does not generate logarithmic terms inadmissible in the Bondi-Sachs asymptotic form.
  I point out the role of the gauge conditions and the solution of the homogeneous equation in obviating the apparent inconsistency issue.</description>

      <title>Boundary conformal invariants and the conformal anomaly in five dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.07661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2102.07661v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In odd dimensions the integrated conformal anomaly is entirely due to the boundary terms \cite{Solodukhin:2015eca}. In this paper we present a detailed analysis of the anomaly in five dimensions. We give the complete list of the boundary conformal invariants that exist in five dimensions. Additionally to 8 invariants known before we find a new conformal invariant that contains the derivatives of the extrinsic curvature along the boundary. Then, for a conformal scalar field satisfying either the Dirichlet or the conformal invariant Robin boundary conditions we use the available general results for the heat kernel coefficient $a_5$, compute the conformal anomaly and identify the corresponding values of all boundary conformal charges.</description>

      <title>Quantum stochastic phase-space theorems lead to hidden causal loops in a model for measurement consistent with macroscopic realism, Bell nonlocality and no-signaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.06070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.06070v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we show how quantum measurement and nonlocality can be explained consistently with macroscopic realism and no-signaling. We analyze a measurement of $\hat{x}$ on a system prepared in a superposition of eigenstates, with measurement modeled as amplification, realized by interacting the system with an amplifier. Deriving quantum stochastic path-integral theorems, we prove an equivalence between a phase-space probability distribution $Q(x,p)$ (which uniquely represents the quantum state) and stochastic trajectories for the amplified and attenuated variables, $x$ and $p$, that propagate backwards and forwards in time, respectively. For the superposition, but not the mixture, the backward and forward-propagating trajectories are connected by the initial-time conditional distribution $Q(p|x)$, leading to a causal loop. The joint densities for $x(t)$ and $p(t)$ yield $Q(x,p,t)$, confirming causal consistency. A feature is hidden noise associated with an eigenstate. Unlike the eigenvalue, this noise is not amplified. This motivates an ontological model for measurement, where the amplified amplitude x(t) gives the detected outcome, from which Born's rule follows. For macroscopic superpositions, we demonstrate consistency with macroscopic realism: Further, we evaluate the initial-time distribution $Q_{loop}(x,p)$ for the coupled trajectories conditioned on a given outcome, showing that this cannot correspond to a quantum state. Finally, we analyze Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen and Bell nonlocality. Our conclusion is a model for the collapse of the wave-function and nonlocality, consistent with three weak local realistic premises. We deduce a hybrid causal structure involving causal relations for amplified variables, demonstrating through explicit simulation how microscopic retrocausality can explain measurement and entanglement, without leading to retrocausality at a macroscopic level.</description>

      <title>Quantum conformal symmetries for spacetimes in superposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.00021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.00021v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Without a complete theory of quantum gravity, the question of how quantum fields and quantum particles behave in a superposition of spacetimes seems beyond the reach of theoretical and experimental investigations. Here we use an extension of the quantum reference frame formalism to address this question for the Klein-Gordon field residing on a superposition of conformally equivalent metrics. Based on the group structure of ``quantum conformal transformations'', we construct an explicit quantum operator that can map states describing a quantum field on a superposition of spacetimes to states representing a quantum field with a superposition of masses on a Minkowski background. This constitutes an extended symmetry principle, namely invariance under quantum conformal transformations. The latter allows to build an understanding of superpositions of diffeomorphically non-equivalent spacetimes by relating them to a more intuitive superposition of quantum fields on curved spacetime. Furthermore, it can be used to import the phenomenon of particle production in curved spacetime to its conformally equivalent counterpart, thus revealing new features in modified Minkowski spacetime.</description>

      <title>Microlocal Analysis of Waves Across the Event Horizon of an Extremal Rotating Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03481v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Static black holes contain regions of spacetime which not even light can escape from. In the centre of mass frame, these blocks are separated from each other by event horizons. Unlike pointlike particles, fields can spread and interact non-causally across the horizons. The microlocal theory of this is somewhat incomplete, however. For instance, the theory of real principal type operators does not apply on the horizon. In this article, we address this issue for the extremal rotating black hole. Namely, we show that null covectors on the horizon of the extremal Kerr spacetime form an involutive double characteristic manifold and then extend the construction of parametrix across the event horizon. This provides a mathematical basis for the asymptotic oscillatory solutions in the region. Such approximations are central in quantum mechanics. In contrast to the real principal case, solutions near the horizon admit two channels for propagation of singularities. Indeed, there is additional propagation along the double characteristic variety.</description>

      <title>Differential torsion sensor for direct detection of ultralight vector dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08935v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultralight bosons with masses in the range from $\sim 10^{-22}$ eV/$c^2$ to $\sim 1$ eV/$c^2$, are well-motivated, wave-like dark matter candidates. Particles on the lower-mass end are less explored in experiments due to their vanishingly small mass and weak coupling to the Standard Model. We propose a sensor with dual torsion pendulums for the direct detection of U(1)$_{B\!-\!L}$ gauge boson dark matter, which can achieve an enhanced differential torque sensitivity in a frequency band of $\sim 10^{-2}$-$10$ Hz due to its advantages in common-mode rejection and differential angular sensitivity. We describe the design of the differential torsion sensor and present the estimated sensitivity to an ultralight dark matter field coupled to baryon minus lepton ($B\!-\!L$) number, in a mass range of $\sim 10^{-17}$-$10^{-13}$ eV/$c^2$. Given a setup with meter-scale torsion pendulum beams and kg-scale test masses, the projected constraints on the coupling constant $g_{B\!-\!L}$ can reach $\sim 10^{-27}$ for a boson mass of $\sim 10^{-15}$ eV/$c^2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14422v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we combine and generalize to higher dimensions the approaches to proving the uniqueness of connected (3+1)-dimensional static vacuum asymptotically flat black hole spacetimes by M\"uller zum Hagen--Robinson--Seifert and by Robinson. Applying these techniques, we prove and/or reprove geometric inequalities for connected (n + 1)-dimensional static vacuum asymptotically flat spacetimes with either black hole or equipotential photon surface or specifically photon sphere inner boundary. In particular, assuming a natural upper bound on the total scalar curvature of the boundary, we recover and extend the well-known uniqueness results for such black hole and equipotential photon surface spacetimes. We also relate our results and proofs to existing results, in particular to those by Agostiniani--Mazzieri and by Nozawa--Shiromizu--Izumi--Yamada.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics, magnetic properties, and global $U(1)$ symmetry breaking of the S-type Gubser-Rocha model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00666v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study an explicit formula for the thermodynamic potential of the AdS dyonic black brane solution with an axio-dilaton hair, which was discovered in an extension of the $(3+1)$d Gubser-Rocha model enjoying S-duality. From the thermodynamic potential, we can compute the magnetization and the magnetic susceptibilities of the dyonic solution. The result of the magnetization is negative implying that the system is diamagnetic. Subsequently, we consider a specific neutral limit of the dyonic solution. In this setup, we find that the system exhibits spontaneous breaking of a global $U(1)$ symmetry. The order parameter is given by a complex operator which is dual to the axio-dilaton field in the bulk. Interestingly, the system has a finite Hall conductivity even in the absence of the external magnetic field, and it is related to the phase of the complex operator.</description>

      <title>Detecting the dark sector through scalar-induced gravitational waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04220v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the evolution of cosmological scalar perturbations in the case that the background radiation is weakly coupled to a light scalar field $\phi$. The light scalar $\phi$ is a homogeneous background field with a large initial value. In the radiation-dominated Universe, the coupling term introduces an effective mass to $\phi$ and the background ultra-relativistic particles. The oscillations of $\phi$ result in the periodic change of the equation of state parameter and the sound speed, which provides a novel mechanism to amplify subhorizon scalar perturbations through parametric resonance. The amplification of scalar perturbations leads to a stochastic gravitational-waves background~(SGWB) expected to be observed by multiband gravitational wave observers. The observation of the SGWB helps to determine the initial value of $\phi$ and the coupling strength of the interaction. This mechanism is generally applicable to the interactions that introduce an effective mass, and we take the interaction between $\phi$ and electrons as a concrete example to illustrate the result. We find that under the condition that the coupling coefficient $\lambda=10^{-16}$ and the initial value $\phi_i=10^{18}$ GeV, the resulting SGWB spectrum is expected to be observed by the future observers including LISA, $Taiji$, DECIGO and BBO.</description>

      <title>Exploring Milky Way rotation curves with Gaia DR3: a comparison between $\Lambda$CDM, MOND, and General Relativistic approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12482v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the release of Gaia DR3, we extend the comparison between dynamical models for the Milky Way rotation curve initiated in the previous work. Utilising astrometric and spectro-photometric data for 719143 young disc stars within $|z|&lt;1$ kpc and up to $R \simeq 19$ kpc, we investigate the accuracy of MOND and $\Lambda$CDM frameworks in addition to previously studied models, such as the classical one with a Navarro-Frenk-White dark matter halo and a general relativistic model. We find that all models, including MOND and $\Lambda$CDM, are statistically equivalent in representing the observed rotational velocities. However, $\Lambda$CDM, characterized by an Einasto density profile and cosmological constraints on its parameters, assigns more dark matter than the model featuring a Navarro-Frenk-White profile, with the virial mass estimated at $1.5\text{-}2.5 \times 10^{12} \, {\rm M}_{\odot}$ - a value significantly higher than recent literature estimates. Beyond $10\text{-}15$ kpc, non-Newtonian/non-baryonic contributions to the rotation curve are found to become dominant for all models consistently. Our results suggest the need for further exploration into the role of General Relativity, dark matter, and alternative theories of gravitational dynamics in shaping Milky Way's rotation curve.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16799v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the Chern-Simons-like formulation of exotic general massive gravity models within the framework of third-way to three-dimensional gravity. We classify our construction into two main approaches: one using torsional cosmological Einstein and exotic massive gravity equations, and the other a torsion-free approach. The former approach, while mathematically appealing, precludes the construction of critical exotic models where the central charges vanish. In contrast, the latter approach has a wider parameter space and allows for the construction of critical models. An explicit example of an exotic general model is provided to illustrate both methods. Our methodology represents the first step towards establishing the most general Chern-Simons-like formulation of third-way to three-dimensional gravity, which would enable the study of identifying its bulk/boundary unitary sector.</description>

      <title>Toward a test of Gaussianity of a gravitational wave background</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17987v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The degree of Gaussianity of a field offers insights into its cosmological nature, and its statistical properties serve as indicators of its Gaussianity. In this work, we examine the signatures of Gaussianity in a gravitational wave background (GWB) by analyzing the cumulants of the one- and two-point functions of the relevant observable, using pulsar timing array (PTA) simulations as a proof-of-principle. This appeals to the ongoing debate about the source of the spatially-correlated common-spectrum process observed in PTAs, which is likely associated with a nanohertz stochastic GWB. We investigate the distribution of the sample statistics of the one-point function in the presence of a Gaussian GWB. Our results indicate that, within PTAs, one-point statistics are impractical for constraining the Gaussianity of the nanohertz GWB due to dominant pulsar noises. However, our analysis of two-point statistics shows promise, suggesting that it may be possible to constrain the Gaussianity of the nanohertz GWB using PTA data. We also emphasize that the Gaussian signatures identified in the one- and two-point functions in this work are expected to be applicable to any gravitational wave background.</description>

Abstract: We construct spherically symmetric dyonic black holes in a generalized Maxwell-Friedberg-Lee-Sirlin type model with a complex scalar doublet and a symmetry breaking potential {for the real scalar field}, minimally coupled to Einstein gravity in asymptotically flat space.
  We analyze the properties of the hairy black holes and determine their domain of existence. Our discussion focuses mostly on the case of a long-ranged massless real scalar field.
  Our results indicate that in this case, depending on the coupling constants, the resonant hairy dyonic black holes may bifurcate from Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes at maximal chemical potential, while the limiting solutions at minimal chemical potential may be related to the Penney solution.</description>

      <title>Why do newer degrees of freedom appear in higher-order truncated hydrodynamic theory?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15088v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An exact derivation of relativistic hydrodynamics from an underlying microscopic theory has been shown to be an all-order theory. From the relativistic transport equation of kinetic theory, the full expressions of hydrodynamic viscous fluxes have been derived which turn out to include all orders of out-of-equilibrium derivative corrections. It has been shown, that for maintaining causality, it is imperative that the temporal derivatives must include all orders, which can be resummed in non-local, relaxation operator-like forms and finally `integrated in' introducing newer degrees of freedom. The theory can of course be truncated at any higher spatial orders, but the power over the the infinite temporal sum increases correspondingly such that the causality is respected. As a result, the theory truncated at any higher order of spatial gradient, requires newer degrees of freedom for each increasing order.</description>

      <title>Premerger phenomena in neutron-star binary coalescences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16283v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A variety of high-energy events can take place in the seconds leading up to a binary neutron-star merger. Mechanisms involving tidal resonances, electrodynamic interactions, or shocks in mass-loaded wakes have been proposed as instigators of these precursors. With a view of gravitational-wave and multimessenger astrophysics more broadly, premerger observations and theory are reviewed emphasising how gamma-ray precursors and dynamical tides can constrain the neutron-star equation of state, thermodynamic microphysics, and evolutionary pathways. Connections to post-merger phenomena, notably gamma-ray bursts, are discussed together with how magnetic fields, spin and misalignment, crustal elasticity, and stratification gradients impact observables.</description>

      <title>Linear Perturbations and Stability Analysis in $f(T)$ Braneworld Scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14471v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We conduct a detailed analysis of the full linear perturbations in the braneworld scenario within $f(T)$ gravity. By decomposing the perturbations of the theory into the scalar, transverse vector, antisymmetric pseudotensor, and symmetric transverse-traceless tensor modes, we derive the quadratic action for each mode. The results indicate that there is a total of one scalar, one massless vector, and one tensor propagating degrees of freedom. Consequently, in comparison to general relativity, no additional degrees of freedom appear under the flat braneworld background in the linearized theory. For a thick brane model with $f(T)=T+ \alpha T^2$, we find that it exhibits stability against linear perturbations.</description>

      <title>The Milky Way accretion history compared to cosmological simulations -- from bulge to dwarf galaxy infall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07281v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Galactic halos are known to grow hierarchically, inside out. This implies a correlation between the infall lookback time of satellites and their binding energy. Cosmological simulations predict a linear relation between the infall lookback time and the logarithm of the binding energy, with a small scatter. Gaia measurements of the bulk proper motions of globular clusters and dwarf satellites of the Milky Way are sufficiently accurate to establish the kinetic energies of these systems. Assuming the gravitational potential of the Milky Way, we can deduce the binding energies of the dwarf satellites and those of the galaxies that were previously accreted by the Milky Way. This can be compared to cosmological simulations for the first time. The relation of the infall lookback time versus binding energy we found in a cosmological simulation matches that for the early accretion events when the simulated total Milky Way mass within 21 kpc was rescaled to 2 $10^{11}$ solar masses. This agrees well with previous estimates from globular cluster kinematics and from the rotation curve. However, the vast majority of the dwarf galaxies are clear outliers to this rescaled relation, unless they are very recent infallers. In other words, the very low binding energies of most dwarf galaxies compared to Sgr and previous accreted galaxies suggests that most of them were accreted much later than 8 or even 5 Gyr ago. We also found that the subhalo systems in some cosmological simulations are too dynamically hot when they are compared to identified Milky Way substructures. This leads to an overestimated impact of satellites on the Galaxy rotation curve.</description>

      <title>Pre-Big-Bang Cosmology Cannot Explain NANOGrav 15-year Signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16505v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate whether the Pre-Big Bang (PBB) scenario from string cosmology can explain the stochastic gravitational wave background signal reported in the NANOGrav 15-year dataset. Using Bayesian analysis techniques, we constrain the key parameters of the PBB model by comparing its theoretical predictions with the observed data. Our analysis yields $\beta = -0.12^{+0.06}_{-0.21}$ ($90\%$ credible interval) for the dilaton-dynamics parameter, which lies outside the theoretically allowed range $0 \leq \beta &lt; 3$ with more than $5\sigma$ confidence. Additionally, model comparison strongly favors a simple power-law spectrum over the PBB scenario, with a Bayes factor of approximately $468$. These results demonstrate that the PBB scenario, in its current formulation, cannot adequately explain the NANOGrav observations, highlighting the need for either significant modifications to the model or alternative explanations for the observed signal.</description>

      <title>Krylov Complexity in early universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18405v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Lanczos algorithm offers a method for constructing wave functions for both closed and open systems based on their Hamiltonians. Given that the entire early universe is fundamentally an open system, we apply the Lanczos algorithm to investigate Krylov complexity across different phases of the early universe, including inflation, the radiation-dominated period (RD), and the matter-dominated period (MD). Notably, we find that Krylov complexity differs between the closed and open system approaches. To effectively capture the impact of potentials during the RD and MD phases, we analyze various inflationary potentials, including the Higgs potential, the \(R^2\) inflationary potential, and chaotic inflationary potential, which is taking into account the violations of slow-roll conditions. This analysis is conducted in terms of conformal time through the preheating process. Our numerical results indicate that the evolution of Krylov complexity and Krylov entropy is remarkably similar within distinctive potentials in RD and MD. Additionally, we rigorously construct what is referred to as an open two-mode squeezed state, utilizing the second kind of Meixner polynomials. Based on this construction, we are the first to calculate the evolution equations for \(r_k\) and \(\phi_k\) as they relate to the scale factor. Our findings suggest that dissipative effects lead to a rapid decoherence-like behavior. Moreover, our results indicate that inflation behaves as a strongly dissipative system, while both the radiation-dominated and matter-dominated phases exhibit characteristics of weak dissipation. This research provides new insights into exploring the universe from the perspective of quantum information.</description>
