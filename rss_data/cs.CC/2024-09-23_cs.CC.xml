      <title>NP-Completeness and Physical Zero-Knowledge Proofs for Zeiger</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zeiger is a pencil puzzle consisting of a rectangular grid, with each cell having an arrow pointing in horizontal or vertical direction. Some cells also contain a positive integer. The objective of this puzzle is to fill a positive integer into every unnumbered cell such that the integer in each cell is equal to the number of different integers in all cells along the direction an arrow in that cell points to. In this paper, we prove that deciding solvability of a given Zeiger puzzle is NP-complete via a reduction from the not-all-equal positive 3SAT (NAE3SAT+) problem. We also construct a card-based physical zero-knowledge proof protocol for Zeiger, which enables a prover to physically show a verifier the existence of the puzzle's solution without revealing it.</description>

      <title>Faster Mixing of Higher-Dimensional Random Reversible Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We continue the study of the approximate $k$-wise independence of random reversible circuits as permutations of $\{\pm1\}^n$. Our main result is the first construction of a natural class of random reversible circuits with a sublinear-in-$n$ dependence on depth. Our construction is motivated by considerations in practical cryptography and is somewhat inspired by the design of practical block ciphers, such as DES and AES. Previous constructions of He and O'Donnell [HO24], which were built with gate architectures on one-dimensional lattices, suffered from an inherent linear-in-$n$ dependence on depth. The main novelty of our circuit model is a gate architecture built on higher-dimensional lattices.</description>

      <title>Some Thoughts on Symbolic Transfer Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transfer entropy is used to establish a measure of causal relationships between two variables. Symbolic transfer entropy, as an estimation method for transfer entropy, is widely applied due to its robustness against non-stationarity. This paper investigates the embedding dimension parameter in symbolic transfer entropy and proposes optimization methods for high complexity in extreme cases with complex data. Additionally, it offers some perspectives on estimation methods for transfer entropy.</description>

      <title>Disjoint covering of bipartite graphs with $s$-clubs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a positive integer $s$, an $s$-club in a graph $G$ is a set of vertices inducing a subgraph with diameter at most $s$. As generalizations of cliques, $s$-clubs offer a flexible model for real-world networks. This paper addresses the problems of partitioning and disjoint covering of vertices with $s$-clubs on bipartite graphs. First we prove that for any fixed $s \geq 3$ and fixed $k \geq 3$, determining whether the vertices of $G$ can be partitioned into at most $k$ disjoint $s$-clubs is NP-complete even for bipartite graphs. Additionally, we study the Maximum Disjoint $(t,s)$-Club Covering problem (MAX-DCC($t,s$)), which aims to find a collection of vertex-disjoint $(t,s)$-clubs (i.e. $s$-clubs with at least $t$ vertices) that covers the maximum number of vertices in $G$. We prove that it is NP-hard to achieve an approximation factor of $\frac{95}{94} $ for MAX-DCC($t,3$) for any fixed $t\geq 8$ and for MAX-DCC($t,2$) for any fixed $t\geq 5$ even for bipartite graphs. Previously, results were known only for MAX-DCC($3,2$). Finally, we provide a polynomial-time algorithm for MAX-DCC($2,2$).</description>

      <title>The Complexity of Counting Turns in the Line-Based Dial-a-Ride Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dial-a-Ride problems have been proposed to model the challenge to consolidate passenger transportation requests with a fleet of shared vehicles. The line-based Dial-a-Ride problem (LiDARP) is a variant where the passengers are transported along a fixed sequence of stops, with the option of taking shortcuts. In this paper we consider the LiDARP with the objective function to maximize the number of transported requests. We investigate the complexity of two optimization problems: the LiDARP, and the problem to determine the minimum number of turns needed in an optimal LiDARP solution, called the MinTurn problem. Based on a number of instance parameters and characteristics, we are able to state the boundary between polynomially solvable and NP-hard instances for both problems. Furthermore, we provide parameterized algorithms that are able to solve both the LiDARP and MinTurn problem.</description>

      <title>Classical Simulability of Quantum Circuits with Shallow Magic Depth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum magic is a resource that allows quantum computation to surpass classical simulation. Previous results have linked the amount of quantum magic, characterized by the number of $T$ gates or stabilizer rank, to classical simulability. However, the effect of the distribution of quantum magic on the hardness of simulating a quantum circuit remains open. In this work, we investigate the classical simulability of quantum circuits with alternating Clifford and $T$ layers across three tasks: amplitude estimation, sampling, and evaluating Pauli observables. In the case where all $T$ gates are distributed in a single layer, performing amplitude estimation and sampling to multiplicative error are already classically intractable under reasonable assumptions, but Pauli observables are easy to evaluate. Surprisingly, with the addition of just one $T$ gate layer or merely replacing all $T$ gates with $T^{\frac{1}{2}}$, the Pauli evaluation task reveals a sharp complexity transition from P to GapP-complete. Nevertheless, when the precision requirement is relaxed to 1/poly($n$) additive error, we are able to give a polynomial time classical algorithm to compute amplitudes, Pauli observable, and sampling from $\log(n)$ sized marginal distribution for any magic-depth-one circuit that is decomposable into a product of diagonal gates. Our research provides new techniques to simulate highly magical circuits while shedding light on their complexity and their significant dependence on the magic depth.</description>

      <title>Bisection Width, Discrepancy, and Eigenvalues of Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A celebrated result of Alon from 1993 states that any $d$-regular graph on $n$ vertices (where $d=O(n^{1/9})$) has a bisection with at most $\frac{dn}{2}(\frac{1}{2}-\Omega(\frac{1}{\sqrt{d}}))$ edges, and this is optimal. Recently, this result was greatly extended by R\"aty, Sudakov, and Tomon. We build on the ideas of the latter, and use a semidefinite programming inspired approach to prove the following variant for hypergraphs: every $r$-uniform $d$-regular hypergraph on $n$ vertices (where $d\ll n^{1/2}$) has a bisection of size at most $$\frac{dn}{r}\left(1-\frac{1}{2^{r-1}}-\frac{c}{\sqrt{d}}\right),$$ for some $c=c(r)&gt;0$. This bound is the best possible up to the precise value of $c$. Moreover, a bisection achieving this bound can be found by a polynomial-time randomized algorithm.
  The minimum bisection is closely related to discrepancy. We also prove sharp bounds on the discrepancy and so called positive discrepancy of hypergraphs, extending results of Bollob\'as and Scott. Furthermore, we discuss implications about Alon-Boppana type bounds. We show that if $H$ is an $r$-uniform $d$-regular hypergraph, then certain notions of second largest eigenvalue $\lambda_2$ associated with the adjacency tensor satisfy $\lambda_2\geq \Omega_r(\sqrt{d})$, improving results of Li and Mohar.</description>

      <title>Diversity of Answers to Conjunctive Queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.08848v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Enumeration problems aim at outputting, without repetition, the set of solutions to a given problem instance. However, outputting the entire solution set may be prohibitively expensive if it is too big. In this case, outputting a small, sufficiently diverse subset of the solutions would be preferable. This leads to the Diverse-version of the original enumeration problem, where the goal is to achieve a certain level d of diversity by selecting k solutions. In this paper, we look at the Diverse-version of the query answering problem for Conjunctive Queries and extensions thereof. That is, we study the problem if it is possible to achieve a certain level d of diversity by selecting k answers to the given query and, in the positive case, to actually compute such k answers.</description>

      <title>Quantum Pseudorandom Scramblers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.08941v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum pseudorandom state generators (PRSGs) have stimulated exciting developments in recent years. A PRSG, on a fixed initial (e.g., all-zero) state, produces an output state that is computationally indistinguishable from a Haar random state. However, pseudorandomness of the output state is not guaranteed on other initial states. In fact, known PRSG constructions provably fail on some initial states.
  In this work, we propose and construct quantum Pseudorandom State Scramblers (PRSSs), which can produce a pseudorandom state on an arbitrary initial state. In the information-theoretical setting, we obtain a scrambler which maps an arbitrary initial state to a distribution of quantum states that is close to Haar random in total variation distance. As a result, our scrambler exhibits a dispersing property. Loosely, it can span an $\epsilon$-net of the state space. This significantly strengthens what standard PRSGs can induce, as they may only concentrate on a small region of the state space provided that average output state approximates a Haar random state.
  Our PRSS construction develops a parallel extension of the famous Kac's walk, and we show that it mixes exponentially faster than the standard Kac's walk. This constitutes the core of our proof. We also describe a few applications of PRSSs. While our PRSS construction assumes a post-quantum one-way function, PRSSs are potentially a weaker primitive and can be separated from one-way functions in a relativized world similar to standard PRSGs.</description>

      <title>Chain of Thought Empowers Transformers to Solve Inherently Serial Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12875v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Instructing the model to generate a sequence of intermediate steps, a.k.a., a chain of thought (CoT), is a highly effective method to improve the accuracy of large language models (LLMs) on arithmetics and symbolic reasoning tasks. However, the mechanism behind CoT remains unclear. This work provides a theoretical understanding of the power of CoT for decoder-only transformers through the lens of expressiveness. Conceptually, CoT empowers the model with the ability to perform inherently serial computation, which is otherwise lacking in transformers, especially when depth is low. Given input length $n$, previous works have shown that constant-depth transformers with finite precision $\mathsf{poly}(n)$ embedding size can only solve problems in $\mathsf{TC}^0$ without CoT. We first show an even tighter expressiveness upper bound for constant-depth transformers with constant-bit precision, which can only solve problems in $\mathsf{AC}^0$, a proper subset of $ \mathsf{TC}^0$. However, with $T$ steps of CoT, constant-depth transformers using constant-bit precision and $O(\log n)$ embedding size can solve any problem solvable by boolean circuits of size $T$. Empirically, enabling CoT dramatically improves the accuracy for tasks that are hard for parallel computation, including the composition of permutation groups, iterated squaring, and circuit value problems, especially for low-depth transformers.</description>

      <title>A Wild Sheep Chase Through an Orchard</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10769v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Orchards are a biologically relevant class of phylogenetic networks as they can describe treelike evolutionary histories augmented with horizontal transfer events. Moreover, the class has attractive mathematical characterizations that can be exploited algorithmically. On the other hand, undirected orchard networks have hardly been studied yet. Here, we prove that deciding whether an undirected, binary phylogenetic network is an orchard -- or equivalently, whether it has an orientation that makes it a rooted orchard -- is NP-hard. For this, we introduce a new characterization of undirected orchards which could be useful for proving positive results.</description>
