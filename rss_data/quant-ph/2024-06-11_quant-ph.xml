      <title>Connecting Stabilizer Formalism with Two-Qubit Bloch Spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the application of stabilizer formalism in deriving the two Bloch Sphere representation of pure two-qubit states, including maximally entangled ones. Specifically, we investigate the stabilizer groups of two-qubit stabilizer states and establish a link with both the density matrix and graphical representation of a given stabilizer state. The sum of the stabilizer group's matrices constitutes the state's density matrix. Simultaneously, matrices of a stabilizer group of a given state may be associated with the coordinate axes of the Bloch Spheres representing that state. This analysis reveals a natural link between the density matrix and graphical representations, offering insights into geometry and symmetries of entanglement and two-qubit states in general.</description>

      <title>Robust quantum dots charge autotuning using neural networks uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a machine-learning-based procedure to automate the charge tuning of semiconductor spin qubits with minimal human intervention, addressing one of the significant challenges in scaling up quantum dot technologies. This method exploits artificial neural networks to identify noisy transition lines in stability diagrams, guiding a robust exploration strategy leveraging neural networks' uncertainty estimations. Tested across three distinct offline experimental datasets representing different single quantum dot technologies, the approach achieves over 99% tuning success rate in optimal cases, where more than 10% of the success is directly attributable to uncertainty exploitation. The challenging constraints of small training sets containing high diagram-to-diagram variability allowed us to evaluate the capabilities and limits of the proposed procedure.</description>

      <title>Boosted quantum teleportation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum teleportation has proven to be fundamental for many quantum information and communication processes. The core concept can be exploited in many tasks, from the transmission of quantum states, quantum repeaters, to quantum computing. However, for linear-optical systems, the efficiency of teleportation is directly linked to the success probability of the involved Bell-state measurement. In most implementations, this is realized by linear optics with an intrinsically limited success probability of 50%. Here, we demonstrate quantum teleportation surpassing this limit. We achieve an average fidelity of the teleported states of $0.8677\pm0.0024$, leading to an overall acceptance rate of the teleportation of $69.71\pm0.75\%$. We obtain this boosted success probability by generating ancillary photonic states that are interfered with the Bell states. Thus, our work demonstrates the boosting Bell-state measurements in quantum-technology applications and our scheme could directly be applied to e.g. quantum repeaters.</description>

      <title>Quantum nuclear dynamics on a distributed set of ion-trap quantum computing systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum nuclear dynamics with wavepacket time-evolution is classically intractable and viewed as a promising avenue for quantum information processing. Here, we use an IonQ 11-qubit trapped-ion quantum computer, Harmony, to study the quantum wavepacket dynamics of a shared-proton within a short-strong hydrogen-bonded system. We also provide the first application of distributed quantum computing for chemical dynamics problems, where the distributed set of quantum processes is constructed using a tensor network formalism. For a range of initial states, we experimentally drive the ion-trap system to emulate the quantum nuclear wavepacket as it evolves along the potential surface generated from electronic structure. Following the experimental creation of the nuclear wavepacket, we extract measurement observables such as its time-dependent spatial projection and its characteristic vibrational frequencies to good agreement with classical results. Vibrational eigenenergies obtained from quantum computational are in agreement with those obtained from classical simulations to within a fraction of a kcal/mol, thus suggesting chemical accuracy. Our approach opens a new paradigm for studying the quantum chemical dynamics and vibrational spectra of molecules and also provides the first demonstration for parallel quantum computation on a distributed set of ion-trap quantum computers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate models for open quantum systems -- quantum states that have non-trivial interactions with their environment -- may aid in the advancement of a diverse array of fields, including quantum computation, informatics, and the prediction of static and dynamic molecular properties. In recent years, quantum algorithms have been leveraged for the computation of open quantum systems as the predicted quantum advantage of quantum devices over classical ones may allow previously inaccessible applications. Accomplishing this goal will require input and expertise from different research perspectives, as well as the training of a diverse quantum workforce, making a compilation of current quantum methods for treating open quantum systems both useful and timely. In this Review, we first provide a succinct summary of the fundamental theory of open quantum systems and then delve into a discussion on recent quantum algorithms. We conclude with a discussion of pertinent applications, demonstrating the applicability of this field to realistic chemical, biological, and material systems.</description>

      <title>Entanglement with neutral atoms in the simulation of nonequilibrium dynamics of one-dimensional spin models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement is a key ingredient for quantum information processing with capabilities beyond that of classical computation. We study the generation and role of entanglement in the dynamics of spin-1/2 models, both for the design of quantum gates for general-purpose quantum computation and for quantum simulation of interacting spin models. We introduce the neutral atom M{\o}lmer-S{\o}rensen gate, involving rapid adiabatic Rydberg dressing interleaved in a spin-echo sequence. We show its robustness to quasi-static experimental imperfections and favorable scaling with the time-energy scales of Rydberg-mediated entanglement generation. In quantum simulation, we consider critical behavior in quench dynamics of transverse field Ising models. Using matrix product states to calculate the dynamics, we find that order parameters, critical point, and critical exponents can be estimated using modest bond dimensions. Considering the role of chaos and equilibration in quenches, we find that local observables are well approximated either due to low global entanglement or the proximity of local marginals to the maximally mixed state. These findings highlight the challenge of identifying relevant quantum phenomena that remain inaccessible to classical descriptions. Understanding the regimes where classical descriptions fail but remain accessible to pre-fault tolerant quantum hardware will help inform the design of future quantum information processors</description>

      <title>Residue Number System (RNS) based Distributed Quantum Addition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Arithmetic faces limitations such as noise and resource constraints in the current Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) era quantum computers. We propose using Distributed Quantum Computing (DQC) to overcome these limitations by substituting a higher depth quantum addition circuit with Residue Number System (RNS) based quantum modulo adders. The RNS-based distributed quantum addition circuits possess lower depth and are distributed across multiple quantum computers/jobs, resulting in higher noise resilience. We propose the Quantum Superior Modulo Addition based on RNS Tool (QSMART), which can generate RNS sets of quantum adders based on multiple factors such as depth, range, and efficiency. We also propose a novel design of Quantum Diminished-1 Modulo (2n + 1) Adder (QDMA), which forms a crucial part of RNS-based distributed quantum addition and the QSMART tool. We demonstrate the higher noise resilience of the Residue Number System (RNS) based distributed quantum addition by conducting simulations modeling Quantinuum's H1 ion trap-based quantum computer. Our simulations demonstrate that RNS-based distributed quantum addition has 11.36% to 133.15% higher output probability over 6-bit to 10-bit non-distributed quantum full adders, indicating higher noise fidelity. Furthermore, we present a scalable way of achieving distributed quantum addition higher than limited otherwise by the 20-qubit range of Quantinuum H1.</description>

      <title>Purely Quantum Nonreciprocity by Spatially Separated Transmission Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonreciprocal photon blockade is of particular interest due to its potential applications in chiral quantum technologies and topological photonics. In the regular cases, nonreciprocal transmission (classical nonreciprocity) and nonreciprocal photon blockade (quantum nonreciprocity) often appear simultaneously. Nevertheless, how to achieve purely quantum nonreciprocity (no classical nonreciprocity) remains largely unexplored. Here, we propose a spatially separated transmission scheme, that the photons transport in different directions take different paths, in an optical system consisting of two spinning cavities coupled indirectly by two common drop-filter waveguides. Based on the spatially separated transmission scheme, we demonstrate a purely quantum nonreciprocity (nonreciprocal photon blockade) by considering the Kerr nonlinear interaction in one of the paths. Interestingly, we find that the nonreciprocal photon blockade is enhanced nonreciprocally, i.e., the nonreciprocal photon blockade is enhanced when the photons transport in one direction but suppressed in the reverse direction. We identify that the nonreciprocal enhancement of nonreciprocal photon blockade is induced by the destructive or constructive interference between two paths for two photons passing through the whole system. The spatially separated transmission scheme proposed in the work provides a novel approach to observe purely quantum nonreciprocal effects.</description>

      <title>Generalized symmetry in non-Hermitian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite acute interest in the dynamics of non-Hermitian systems, there is a lack of consensus in the mathematical formulation of non-Hermitian quantum mechanics in the community. Different methodologies are used in the literature to study non-Hermitian dynamics. This ranges from consistent frameworks like biorthogonal quantum mechanics and metric approach characterized by modified inner products, to normalization by time-dependent norms inspired by open quantum systems. In this work, we systematically explore the similarities and differences among these various methods. Utilizing illustrative models with exact solutions, we demonstrate that these methods produce not only quantitatively different results but also distinct physical interpretations. For dissipative systems where non-Hermiticity arises as an approximation, we find that the normalization method in the $\mathcal{PT}$-broken regime closely aligns with the full master equation solutions. In contrast, for quantum systems where non-Hermiticity can be engineered exactly, incorporating metric dynamics is crucial for the probabilistic interpretation of quantum mechanics, necessitating the generalization of unitary symmetry to non-Hermitian systems. This study lays the groundwork for further exploration of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, potentially leveraging generalized symmetries for novel physical phenomena.</description>

      <title>Field-Based Formalism for Calculating Multi-Qubit Exchange Coupling Rates for Transmon Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting qubits are one of the most mature platforms for quantum computing, but significant performance improvements are still needed. To improve the engineering of these systems, 3D full-wave computational electromagnetics analyses are increasingly being used. Unfortunately, existing analysis approaches often rely on full-wave simulations using eigenmode solvers that are typically cumbersome, not robust, and computationally prohibitive if devices with more than a few qubits are to be analyzed. To improve the characterization of superconducting circuits while circumventing these drawbacks, this work begins the development of an alternative framework that we illustrate in the context of evaluating the qubit-qubit exchange coupling rate between transmon qubits. This is a key design parameter that determines the entanglement rate for fast multi-qubit gate performance and also affects decoherence sources like qubit crosstalk. Our modeling framework uses a field-based formalism in the context of macroscopic quantum electrodynamics, which we use to show that the qubit-qubit exchange coupling rate can be related to the electromagnetic dyadic Green's function linking the qubits together. We further show how the quantity involving the dyadic Green's function can be related to the impedance response of the system that can be efficiently computed with classical computational electromagnetics tools. We demonstrate the validity and efficacy of this approach by simulating four practical multi-qubit superconducting circuits and evaluating their qubit-qubit exchange coupling rates. We validate our results against a 3D numerical diagonalization method and against experimental data where available. We also demonstrate the impact of the qubit-qubit exchange coupling rate on qubit crosstalk by simulating a multi-coupler device and identifying operating points where the qubit crosstalk becomes zero.</description>

      <title>A Real-Valued Description of Quantum Mechanics with Schrodinger's 4th-order Matter-Wave Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a variational formulation, we show that Schrodinger's 4th-order, real-valued matter-wave equation which involves the spatial derivatives of the potential V(r), produces the precise eigenvalues of Schrodinger's 2nd-order, complex-valued matter-wave equation together with an equal number of negative, mirror eigenvalues. Accordingly, the paper concludes that there is a real-valued description of non-relativistic quantum mechanics in association with the existence of negative (repelling) energy levels. Schrodinger's classical 2nd-order, complex-valued matter-wave equation which was constructed upon factoring the 4th-order, real-valued differential operator and retaining only one of the two conjugate complex operators is a simpler description of the matter-wave, since it does not involve the derivatives of the potential V(r), at the expense of missing the negative (repelling) energy levels.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Gate Decomposition for High-Level Quantum Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents novel methods for optimizing multi-controlled quantum gates, which naturally arise in high-level quantum programming. Our primary approach involves rewriting $U(2)$ gates as $SU(2)$ gates, utilizing one auxiliary qubit for phase correction. This reduces the number of CNOT gates required to decompose any multi-controlled quantum gate from $O(n^2)$ to at most $32n$. Additionally, we can reduce the number of CNOTs for multi-controlled Pauli gates from $16n$ to $12n$ and propose an optimization to reduce the number of controlled gates in high-level quantum programming. We have implemented these optimizations in the Ket quantum programming platform and demonstrated significant reductions in the number of gates. For instance, for a Grover's algorithm layer with 114 qubits, we achieved a reduction in the number of CNOTs from 101,245 to 2,684. This reduction in the number of gates significantly impacts the execution time of quantum algorithms, thereby enhancing the feasibility of executing them on NISQ computers.</description>

      <title>Efficient Hamiltonian encoding algorithms for extracting quantum control mechanism as interfering pathway amplitudes in the Dyson series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hamiltonian encoding is a methodology for revealing the mechanism behind the dynamics governing controlled quantum systems. In this paper, following Mitra and Rabitz [Phys. Rev. A 67, 033407 (2003)], we define mechanism via pathways of eigenstates that describe the evolution of the system, where each pathway is associated with a complex-valued amplitude corresponding to a term in the Dyson series. The evolution of the system is determined by the constructive and destructive interference of these pathway amplitudes. Pathways with similar attributes can be grouped together into pathway classes. The amplitudes of pathway classes are computed by modulating the Hamiltonian matrix elements and decoding the subsequent evolution of the system rather than by direct computation of the individual terms in the Dyson series. The original implementation of Hamiltonian encoding was computationally intensive and became prohibitively expensive in large quantum systems. This paper presents two new encoding algorithms that calculate the amplitudes of pathway classes by using techniques from graph theory and algebraic topology to exploit patterns in the set of allowed transitions, greatly reducing the number of matrix elements that need to be modulated. These new algorithms provide an exponential decrease in both computation time and memory utilization with respect to the Hilbert space dimension of the system. To demonstrate the use of these techniques, they are applied to two illustrative state-to-state transition problems.</description>

      <title>Optimal control of linear Gaussian quantum systems via quantum learning control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficiently controlling linear Gaussian quantum (LGQ) systems is a significant task in both the study of fundamental quantum theory and the development of modern quantum technology. Here, we propose a general quantum-learning-control method for optimally controlling LGQ systems based on the gradient-descent algorithm. Our approach flexibly designs the loss function for diverse tasks by utilizing first- and second-order moments that completely describe the quantum state of LGQ systems. We demonstrate both deep optomechanical cooling and large optomechanical entanglement using this approach. Our approach enables the fast and deep ground-state cooling of a mechanical resonator within a short time, surpassing the limitations of sideband cooling in the continuous-wave driven strong-coupling regime. Furthermore, optomechanical entanglement could be generated remarkably fast and surpass several times the corresponding steady-state entanglement, even when the thermal phonon occupation reaches one hundred. This work will not only broaden the application of quantum learning control, but also open an avenue for optimal control of LGQ systems.</description>

      <title>Reliable Quantum Memories with Unreliable Components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum memory systems are vital in quantum information processing for dependable storage and retrieval of quantum states. Inspired by classical reliability theories that synthesize reliable computing systems from unreliable components, we formalize the problem of reliable storage of quantum information using noisy components. We introduce the notion of stable quantum memories and define the storage rate as the ratio of the number of logical qubits to the total number of physical qubits, as well as the circuit complexity of the decoder, which includes both quantum gates and measurements. We demonstrate that a strictly positive storage rate can be achieved by constructing a quantum memory system with quantum expander codes. Moreover, by reducing the reliable storage problem to reliable quantum communication, we provide upper bounds on the achievable storage capacity. In the case of physical qubits corrupted by noise satisfying hypercontractivity conditions, we provide a tighter upper bound on storage capacity using an entropy dissipation argument. Furthermore, observing that the time complexity of the decoder scales non-trivially with the number of physical qubits, achieving asymptotic rates may not be possible due to the induced dependence of the noise on the number of physical qubits. In this constrained non-asymptotic setting, we derive upper bounds on storage capacity using finite blocklength communication bounds. Finally, we numerically analyze the gap between upper and lower bounds in both asymptotic and non-asymptotic cases, and provide suggestions to tighten the gap.</description>

Abstract: Decoupling systems into independently evolving components has a long history of simplifying seemingly complex systems. They enable a better understanding of the underlying dynamics and causal structures while providing more efficient means to simulate such processes on a computer. Here we outline a variational decoupling algorithm for decoupling unitary quantum dynamics -- allowing us to decompose a given $n$-qubit unitary gate into multiple independently evolving sub-components. We apply this approach to quantum circuit synthesis - the task of discovering quantum circuit implementations of target unitary dynamics. Our numerical studies illustrate significant benefits, showing that variational decoupling enables us to synthesize general $2$ and $4$-qubit gates to fidelity that conventional variational circuits cannot reach.</description>

      <title>What is my quantum computer good for? Quantum capability learning with physics-aware neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computers have the potential to revolutionize diverse fields, including quantum chemistry, materials science, and machine learning. However, contemporary quantum computers experience errors that often cause quantum programs run on them to fail. Until quantum computers can reliably execute large quantum programs, stakeholders will need fast and reliable methods for assessing a quantum computer's capability-i.e., the programs it can run and how well it can run them. Previously, off-the-shelf neural network architectures have been used to model quantum computers' capabilities, but with limited success, because these networks fail to learn the complex quantum physics that determines real quantum computers' errors. We address this shortcoming with a new quantum-physics-aware neural network architecture for learning capability models. Our architecture combines aspects of graph neural networks with efficient approximations to the physics of errors in quantum programs. This approach achieves up to $\sim50\%$ reductions in mean absolute error on both experimental and simulated data, over state-of-the-art models based on convolutional neural networks.</description>

      <title>Phase-Subtractive Interference and Noise-Resistant Quantum Imaging with Two Undetected Photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a quantum interference phenomenon in which four-photon quantum states generated by two independent sources are used to create a two-photon interference pattern without detecting two of the photons. Contrary to the common perception, the interference pattern can be made fully independent of phases acquired by the photons detected to construct it. However, it still contains information about spatially dependent phases acquired by the two undetected photons. This phenomenon can also be observed with fermionic particles. We show that the phenomenon can be applied to develop an interferometric, quantum phase imaging technique that is immune to uncontrollable phase fluctuations in the interferometer and allows image acquisition without detecting the photons illuminating the object.</description>

      <title>Controlling Unknown Quantum States via Data-Driven State Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate control of quantum states is crucial for quantum computing and other quantum technologies. In the basic scenario, the task is to steer a quantum system towards a target state through a sequence of control operations. Determining the appropriate operations, however, generally requires information about the initial state of the system. When the initial state is not {\em a priori} known, gathering this information is generally challenging for quantum systems of increasing size. To address this problem, we develop a machine-learning algorithm that uses a small amount of measurement data to construct a representation of the system's state. The algorithm compares this data-driven representation with the representation of the target state, and uses reinforcement learning to output the appropriate control operations.We illustrate the effectiveness of the algorithm showing that it achieves accurate control of unknown many-body quantum states and non-Gaussian continuous-variable states using data from a limited set of quantum measurements.</description>

      <title>A modular entanglement-based quantum computer architecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a modular quantum computation architecture based on utilizing multipartite entanglement. Each module consists of a small-scale quantum computer comprising data, memory and interaction qubits. Interaction qubits are used to selectively couple different modules by enhancing interaction strengths via properly adjusting their internal quantum state, where some non-controllable, distance-dependent coupling is used. In this way, different multipartite entangled states with specific entanglement structures shared between modules are generated, and stored in memory qubits. These states are utilized to deterministically perform certain classes of gates or circuits between modules on demand, including parallel controlled-Z gates with arbitrary interaction patterns, multi-qubit gates or whole Clifford circuits, depending on their entanglement structure. The usage of different kinds of multipartite entanglement rather than Bell pairs allows for more efficient and flexible coupling between modules, leading to a scalable quantum computation architecture.</description>

      <title>Information scrambling in quantum-walks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study information scrambling -- a spread of initially localized quantum information into the system's many degree of freedom -- in discrete-time quantum walks. We consider out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOC) and K-complexity as probe of information scrambling. The OTOC for local spin operators in all directions has a light-cone structure which is ``shell-like''. As the wavefront passes, the OTOC approaches to zero in the long-time limit, showing no signature of scrambling. The introduction of spatial or temporal disorder changes the shape of the light-cone akin to localization of wavefuction. We formulate the K-complexity in system with discrete-time evolution, and show that it grows linearly in discrete-time quantum walk. The presence of disorder modifies this growth to sub-linear. Our study present interesting case to explore many-body phenomenon in discrete-time quantum walk using scrambling.</description>

      <title>On the singular position-dependent mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Revisiting the issue associated with Position-Dependent Mass (PDM), we reaffirm that the appropriate framework for addressing a generic PDM is the symmetrization proposed by BenDaniel and Duke. To accomplish this result adopts the effective mass Hamiltonian proposed by von Roos, corrected by a symmetrized kinematic term. After verifying the appropriate ordering to approach the PDM issue, one investigates a crystalline lattice with a defect described by a singular PDM. The singular mass profile proves intriguing as it yields an atom's cluster in the neighborhood of the singularity. Considering that a restoring force acts on the atoms, one notes that the confluent Heun function describes the quantum states. Furthermore, one highlights that when the effective mass distribution tends to a constant profile, we recover a system similar to the harmonic oscillator.</description>

      <title>Reforming Quantum Microgrid Formation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter introduces a novel compact and lossless quantum microgrid formation (qMGF) approach to achieve efficient operational optimization of the power system and improvement of resilience. This is achieved through lossless reformulation to ensure that the results are equivalent to those produced by the classical MGF by exploiting graph-theory-empowered quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) that avoids the need for redundant encoding of continuous variables. Additionally, the qMGF approach utilizes a compact formulation that requires significantly fewer qubits compared to other quantum methods thereby enabling a high-accuracy and low-complexity deployment of qMGF on near-term quantum computers. Case studies on real quantum processing units (QPUs) empirically demonstrated that qMGF can achieve the same high accuracy as classic results with a significantly reduced number of qubits.</description>

      <title>Speedup of high-order unconstrained binary optimization using quantum Z2 lattice gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How to quickly solve the problem of high-order unconstrained binary optimization (HUBO) has attracted much attention, because of its importance and wide-range applications. Here we implement HUBO using a quantum adiabatic algorithm and achieve algorithmic speedup by introducing gauge symmetry into the algorithm. Gauge symmetry enforces the state to be in the instantaneous ground state, further speeding up the computation. Specifically we map the HUBO problem to quantum Z2 lattice gauge theory defined on the dual graph. The gauge operators are found by using the closed-loop-search algorithm, and subsequently the speedup scheme with gauge symmetry for HUBO problem is developed. As an example demonstrated in the classical computers, we present the mathematical formulation of our speedup scheme and propose the so-called gauged local annealing (gLQA) , which is the local quantum annealing (LQA) protected by the gauge symmetry. We then use gLQA to calculate the ground state energy of the Z2 gauge theory. gLQA reduces the computational time by one order of magnitude from that of LQA.</description>

      <title>Quantum Sparse Coding and Decoding Based on Quantum Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sparse coding provides a versatile framework for efficiently capturing and representing crucial data (information) concisely, which plays an essential role in various computer science fields, including data compression, feature extraction, and general signal processing. In this study, we propose a symmetric quantum neural network for realizing sparse coding and decoding algorithms. Our networks consist of multi-layer, two-level unitary transformations that are naturally suited for optical circuits. Each gate is described by two real parameters, corresponding to reflectivity and phase shift. Specifically, the two networks can be efficiently trained together or separately using a quantum natural gradient descent algorithm, either simultaneously or independently. Utilizing the trained model, we achieve sparse coding and decoding of binary and grayscale images in classical problems, as well as that of complex quantum states in quantum problems separately. The results demonstrate an accuracy of 98.77\% for image reconstruction and a fidelity of 97.68\% for quantum state revivification. Our quantum sparse coding and decoding model offers improved generalization and robustness compared to the classical model, laying the groundwork for widespread practical applications in the emerging quantum era.</description>

      <title>Fault-tolerant resource estimation using graph-state compilation on a modular superconducting architecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of fault-tolerant quantum computers (FTQCs) is gaining increased attention within the quantum computing community. Like their digital counterparts, FTQCs, equipped with error correction and large qubit numbers, promise to solve some of humanity's grand challenges. Estimates of the resource requirements for future FTQC systems are essential to making design choices and prioritizing R&amp;D efforts to develop critical technologies. Here, we present a resource estimation framework and software tool that estimates the physical resources required to execute specific quantum algorithms, compiled into their graph-state form, and laid out onto a modular superconducting hardware architecture. This tool can predict the size, power consumption, and execution time of these algorithms at as they approach utility-scale according to explicit assumptions about the system's physical layout, thermal load, and modular connectivity. We use this tool to study the total resources on a proposed modular architecture and the impact of tradeoffs between and inter-module connectivity, latency and resource requirements.</description>

      <title>Long-Range Quantum Tunneling via Matter Wave</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum tunneling refers to a phenomenon that a microscopic object can pass through a potential barrier even it does not have enough energy to overcome the barrier. It has led to many modern applications and nanotechnologies. A general belief is that quantum tunneling, as a manifestation of the wave-particle duality, occurs only when the width of the barrier is comparable to or smaller than the de Broglie's wavelength of the object. Here, via studying the tunneling of an ultracold atom among $N$ far-separated trapping potentials in a state-selective optical lattice, we discover a mechanism to realize a long-range quantum tunneling. It is found that, by the mediation role of the propagating matter wave emitted from the excited-state atom, a coherent tunneling of the tightly confined atom to the remote trapping potentials can occur as long as bound states are present in the energy spectrum of the total system formed by the atom and its matter wave. Breaking through the generally believed distance constraint of quantum tunneling, our result opens another avenue to realize quantum tunneling and gives a guideline to develop tunneling devices.</description>

      <title>Learning effective Hamiltonians for adaptive time-evolution quantum algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital quantum simulation of many-body dynamics relies on Trotterization to decompose the target time evolution into elementary quantum gates operating at a fixed equidistant time discretization. Recent advances have outlined protocols enabling more efficient adaptive Trotter protocols, which have been shown to exhibit a controlled error in the dynamics of local observables and correlation functions. However, it has remained open to which extent the errors on the actual generator of the dynamics, i.e., the target many-body Hamiltonian, remain controlled. Here, we propose to use quantum Hamiltonian learning to numerically obtain the effective Hamiltonian and apply it on the recently introduced ADA-Trotter algorithm as a concrete demonstration. Our key observation is that deviations from the target generator remain bounded on all simulation times. This result suggests that the ADA-Trotter not only generates reliable digital quantum simulation of local dynamics, but also controllably approximates the global quantum state of the target system. Our proposal is sufficiently general and readily applicable to other adaptive time-evolution algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing has made significant progress in recent years, attracting immense interest not only in research laboratories but also in various industries. However, the application of quantum computing to solve real-world problems is still hampered by a number of challenges, including hardware limitations and a relatively under-explored landscape of quantum algorithms, especially when compared to the extensive development of classical computing. The design of quantum circuits, in particular parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs), which contain learnable parameters optimized by classical methods, is a non-trivial and time-consuming task requiring expert knowledge. As a result, research on the automated generation of PQCs, known as quantum architecture search (QAS), has gained considerable interest. QAS focuses on the use of machine learning and optimization-driven techniques to generate PQCs tailored to specific problems and characteristics of quantum hardware. In this paper, we provide an overview of QAS methods by examining relevant research studies in the field. We discuss main challenges in designing and performing an automated search for an optimal PQC, and survey ways to address them to ease future research.</description>

      <title>Remote Implementation of Hidden or Partially Unknown Quantum Operators using Optimal Resources: A Generalized View</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two protocols are proposed for two closely linked but different variants of remote implementation of quantum operators of specific forms. The first protocol is designed for the remote implementation of the single qubit hidden quantum operator, whereas the second one is designed for the remote implementation of the partially unknown single qubit quantum operator. In both cases two-qubit maximally entangled state, which is entangled in the spatial degree of freedom is used. The quantum resources used here are optimal and easy to realize and maintain in comparison to the multi-partite or multi-mode entangled states used in earlier works. The proposed protocols are also generalized to their controlled, bidirectional, cyclic, controlled cyclic, and controlled bidirectional versions and it is shown that either Bell state alone or products of Bell states will be sufficient to perform these tasks with some additional classical communications in the controlled cases only. This is in sharp contrast to the earlier proposals that require large entangled states. In addition, it's noted that remote implementation of hidden or partially unknown operators involving multiple controllers and/or multiple players who jointly apply the desired operator(s) would require quantum channels more complex than the Bell states and their products. Explicit forms of such quantum channels are also provided.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The resource theory with covariant Gibbs-preserving operations, also called enhanced thermal operations, is investigated. We prove that with the help of a correlated catalyst, the state convertibility for any coherent state is fully characterized by the free energy defined with the quantum relative entropy. We can extend this result to general resource theories in the form that imposing the covariant condition to a general resource theory does not change the state convertibility as long as the initial state is coherent and distillable. This means that the additional constraint from the law of energy conservation is irrelevant in the correlated-catalytic framework.</description>

      <title>Quantum enhancements and entropic constraints to Boundary Time Crystals as sensors of AC fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the use of a boundary time crystals (BTCs) as sensors of AC fields. Boundary time crystals are non-equilibrium phases of matter in contact to an environment, for which a macroscopic fraction of the many-body system breaks the time translation symmetry. We find an enhanced sensitivity of the BTC when its spins are resonant with the applied AC field, as quantified by the quantum Fisher information (QFI). The QFI dynamics in this regime is shown to be captured by a relatively simple ansatz consisting of an initial power-law growth and late-time exponential decay. We study the scaling of the ansatz parameters with resources (encoding time and number of spins) and identify a moderate quantum enhancement in the sensor performance through comparison with classical QFI bounds. Investigating the precise source of this performance, we find that despite of its long coherence time and multipartite correlations (advantageous properties for quantum metrology), the entropic cost of the BTC (which grows indefinitely in the thermodynamic limit) hinders an optimal decoding of the AC field information. This result has implications for future candidates of quantum sensors in open system and we hope it will encourage future study into the role of entropy in quantum metrology.</description>

      <title>Applications and resource estimates for open system simulation on a quantum computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study applications of a fully controllable open system quantum simulator. A universal quantum computer can realize such a simulator, and some classical methods can also approximate it. We introduce two concrete computational problems, such that finding their solution would have direct scientific or industrial utility. The scientific utility is exemplified by a computation of nonequilibrium behavior of Ca$_3$Co$_2$O$_6$, which has been studied in the costly MagLab experiments. Specifically, an order of \$2M per material can be saved if an affordable quantum computer simulation is used to screen the materials before sending them to MagLab. For industrial utility, we develop a methodology that allows researchers of various backgrounds to estimate the economic value of an emerging technology consistently. We then apply our approach to the applications of materials with a Metal-Insulator Transition. These materials have not been used commercially yet, but many potential applications, including alternative transistors, neuromorphic computing, and smart windows, amount in total to \$20M for the entire material search performed on a quantum computer. We provide zeroth-order resource estimates for both algorithms on superconducting qubit hardware, finding that simulating long-lifetime nonequilibrium effects presents a new challenge for quantum simulators. Finally, we introduce planted solution problems and their obfuscated versions to test the capabilities of the future quantum device. The intended use of those problems is to match the size of application benchmarks so that solving one guarantees the ability to solve the other.</description>

      <title>Identifying Bottlenecks of NISQ-friendly HHL algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing promises enabling solving large problem instances, e.g. large linear equation systems with HHL algorithm, once the hardware stack matures. For the foreseeable future quantum computing will remain in the so-called NISQ era, in which the algorithms need to account for the flaws of the hardware such as noise. In this work, we perform an empirical study to test scaling properties and directly related noise resilience of the the most resources-intense component of the HHL algorithm, namely QPE and its NISQ-adaptation Iterative QPE. We explore the effectiveness of noise mitigation techniques for these algorithms and investigate whether we can keep the gate number low by enforcing sparsity constraints on the input or using circuit optimization techniques provided by Qiskit package. Our results indicate that currently available noise mitigation techniques, such as Qiskit readout and Mthree readout packages, are insufficient for enabling results recovery even in the small instances tested here. Moreover, our results indicate that the scaling of these algorithms with increase in precision seems to be the most substantial obstacle. These insights allowed us to deduce an approximate bottleneck for algorithms that consider a similar time evolution as QPE. Such observations provide evidence of weaknesses of such algorithms on NISQ devices and help us formulate meaningful future research directions.</description>

      <title>Quantum Geometric Tensor and Critical Metrology in the Anisotropic Dicke Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum phase transition in the anisotropic Dicke model through an examination of the quantum geometric tensor of the ground state. In this analysis, two distinct classical limits exhibit their unique anisotropic characteristics. The classical spin limit demonstrates a preference for the rotating-wave coupling, whereas the classical oscillator limit exhibits symmetry in the coupling strength of the bias. The anisotropic features of the classical spin limit persist at finite scales. Furthermore, we observe that the interplay among the anisotropic ratio, spin length, and frequency ratio can collectively enhance the critical behaviors. This critical enhancement without trade-off between these factors provides a flexible method for quantum precision measurement.</description>

      <title>Building Continuous Quantum-Classical Bayesian Neural Networks for a Classical Clinical Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we are introducing a Quantum-Classical Bayesian Neural Network (QCBNN) that is capable to perform uncertainty-aware classification of classical medical dataset. This model is a symbiosis of a classical Convolutional NN that performs ultra-sound image processing and a quantum circuit that generates its stochastic weights, within a Bayesian learning framework. To test the utility of this idea for the possible future deployment in the medical sector we track multiple behavioral metrics that capture both predictive performance as well as model's uncertainty. It is our ambition to create a hybrid model that is capable to classify samples in a more uncertainty aware fashion, which will advance the trustworthiness of these models and thus bring us step closer to utilizing them in the industry. We test multiple setups for quantum circuit for this task, and our best architectures display bigger uncertainty gap between correctly and incorrectly identified samples than its classical benchmark at an expense of a slight drop in predictive performance. The innovation of this paper is two-fold: (1) combining of different approaches that allow the stochastic weights from the quantum circuit to be continues thus allowing the model to classify application-driven dataset; (2) studying architectural features of quantum circuit that make-or-break these models, which pave the way into further investigation of more informed architectural designs.</description>

      <title>Feasibility of accelerating incompressible computational fluid dynamics simulations with fault-tolerant quantum computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Across industries, traditional design and engineering workflows are being upgraded to simulation-driven processes. Many workflows include computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Simulations of turbulent flow are notorious for high compute costs and reliance on approximate methods that compromise accuracy. Improvements in the speed and accuracy of CFD calculations would potentially reduce design workflow costs by reducing computational costs and eliminating the need for experimental testing. This study explores the feasibility of using fault-tolerant quantum computers to improve the speed and accuracy of CFD simulations in the incompressible or weakly compressible regime. For the example of simulation-driven ship design, we consider simulations for calculating the drag force in steady-state flows, and provide analysis on economic utility and classical hardness. As a waypoint toward assessing the feasibility of our chosen quantum approach, we estimate the quantum resources required for the simpler case of drag force on a sphere. We estimate the product of logical qubits $\times$ $T$ gates to range from $10^{22}$ to $10^{28}$. These high initial estimates suggest that future quantum computers are unlikely to provide utility for incompressible CFD applications unless significant algorithmic advancements or alternative quantum approaches are developed. Encouraged by applications in quantum chemistry that have realized orders-of-magnitude improvements as they matured, we identify the most promising next steps for quantum resource reduction as we work to scale up our estimates from spheres to utility-scale problems with more complex geometry.</description>

      <title>Feasibility of accelerating homogeneous catalyst discovery with fault-tolerant quantum computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The industrial manufacturing of chemicals consumes a significant amount of energy and raw materials. In principle, the development of new catalysts could greatly improve the efficiency of chemical production. However, the discovery of viable catalysts can be exceedingly challenging because it is difficult to know the efficacy of a candidate without experimentally synthesizing and characterizing it. This study explores the feasibility of using fault-tolerant quantum computers to accelerate the discovery of homogeneous catalysts for nitrogen fixation, an industrially important chemical process. It introduces a set of ground-state energy estimation problems representative of calculations needed for the discovery of homogeneous catalysts and analyzes them on three dimensions: economic utility, classical hardness, and quantum resource requirements. For the highest utility problem considered, two steps of a catalytic cycle for the generation of cyanate anion from dinitrogen, the economic utility of running these computations is estimated to be $200,000, and the required runtime for double-factorized phase estimation on a fault-tolerant superconducting device is estimated under conservative assumptions to be 139,000 QPU-hours. The computational cost of an equivalent DMRG calculation is estimated to be about 400,000 CPU-hours. These results suggest that, with continued development, it will be feasible for fault-tolerant quantum computers to accelerate the discovery of homogeneous catalysts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a rigorous proof of the approximate convergence of sliding-window quantum belief-propagation as outlined heuristically in the work of Bilgin and Poulin (Ref. [1]), in the absence of the quantum Markov property. In particular, we confirm the hypothesis outlined in this work that the approximation error of each step in the belief-propagation algorithm decreases exponentially with the sliding-window size, under the assumption that the underlying state on which belief-propagation is being performed possesses a so-called thermal boundedness property: a relaxation of the Markov property required for exact convergence.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Differentiable quantum dynamics require automatic differentiation of a complex-valued initial value problem, which numerically integrates a system of ordinary differential equations from a specified initial condition, as well as the eigendecomposition of a matrix. We explored several automatic differentiation frameworks for these tasks, finding that no framework natively supports our application requirements. We therefore demonstrate a need for broader support of complex-valued, differentiable numerical integration in scientific computing libraries.</description>

      <title>Entanglement and steering in quantum batteries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advantage of quantum batteries is that quantum resources can be used to improve charging efficiency. The quantum resources that are known to be available are: quantum entanglement and quantum coherence. In this paper, we introduce quantum steering as a new quantum resource into batteries for the first time. We analyze the relationship between quantum steering, quantum entanglement, energy storage, and extractable work by considering two models: Field-quantum battery and Cavity-Heisenberg quantum battery. We find that in the steerable range, the quantum steering of different qubits has a maximum or minimum value, which corresponds to the energy storage of the battery, and the extractable work has a maximum value. The occurrence of the minimum value of quantum entanglement is always accompanied by the occurrence of the maximum value of parameters such as energy storage. Ultimately, we analyzed the reasons for these results using the purity of the system. And found a relatively general conclusion: when the purity is at the maximum, important parameters such as the energy storage of the battery are also at the maximum.</description>

      <title>Background resilient quantitative phase microscopy using entangled photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a quantum-based quantitative phase microscopy technique using a phase gradient approach that is inherently background resistant and does not rely on interferometry or scanning. Here, a transparent sample is illuminated by both photons of a position-momentum entangled pair with one photon setup for position measurement in the near-field (NF) of the sample and its partner for momentum measurement in the far-field (FF). By virtue of the spatial correlation property inherent to the entanglement, both the position and momentum information of the photons can thus be obtained simultaneously. The phase profile of the sample is then deduced through a phase gradient measurement obtained by measuring the centroid shift of the photons' in the FF momentum plane for each NF position. We show that the technique, while achieving an imaging resolution of 2.76\,$\mu$m, is phase accurate to at least $\lambda/30$ and phase sensitive to $\lambda/100$ at a wavelength of 810\,nm. In addition, through the temporal correlation between the photon pairs, our technique shows resilience to strong dynamic background lights, which can prove difficult to account for in classical phase imaging techniques. We believe this work marks a significant advancement in the capabilities of quantum phase microscopy and quantum imaging in general, it showcases imaging and phase resolutions approaching those attainable with classical phase microscopes. This advancement brings quantum imaging closer to practical real-world applications, heralding new possibilities in the field.</description>

      <title>Quantum simulation of one-dimensional fermionic systems with Ising Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, analog quantum simulators have reached unprecedented quality, both in qubit numbers and coherence times. Most of these simulators natively implement Ising-type Hamiltonians, which limits the class of models that can be simulated efficiently. We propose a method to overcome this limitation and simulate the time-evolution of a large class of spinless fermionic systems in 1D using simple Ising-type Hamiltonians with local transverse fields. The time complexity of the simulation scales with the square root of the inverse error, and thus favorably compared to the worst-case error of first-order product formulas. Our method is based on domain wall encoding, which is implemented via strong (anti-)ferromagnetic couplings $|J|$. We show that in the limit of strong $|J|$, the domain walls behave like spinless fermions in 1D. The Ising Hamiltonians are one-dimensional chains with nearest-neighbor and, optionally, next-nearest-neighbor interactions. As a proof-of-concept, we perform numerical simulations of various 1D-fermionic systems using domain wall evolution and accurately reproduce the systems' properties, such as topological edge states, Anderson localization, quantum chaotic time evolution and time-reversal symmetry breaking via Floquet-engineering. Our approach makes the simulation of a large class of fermionic many-body systems feasible on analogue quantum hardware that natively implements Ising-type Hamiltonians with transverse fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the increasing development of quantum science and technology, quantum batteries are gradually emerging. But there are still many unsolved problems in the field of quantum batteries. Such as: how to increase the space utilization rate of quantum batteries? How to increase and control the charging power of quantum batteries? And how to have better quantum batterie energy storage without reducing the power of quantum batteries. Therefore, we propose a controllable dual-cavity quantum batterie. It can increase the charging power of the quantum batterie by manipulating the number of atoms without consuming other resources, and can make the power of the quantum batterie effectively adjust between $N^2$ and $N^{2.5}$. And the advantage of regulation to a certain extent is greater than the advantage of the interaction force between atoms.</description>

      <title>Bridging magic and non-Gaussian resources via Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill encoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although the similarity between non-stabilizer states -- also known as magic states -- in discrete-variable systems and non-Gaussian states in continuous-variable systems has widely been recognized, the precise connections between these two notions have still been unclear. We establish a fundamental link between these two quantum resources via the Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) encoding. We show that the negativity of the continuous-variable Wigner function for an encoded GKP state coincides with a magic measure we introduce, which matches the negativity of the discrete Wigner function for odd dimensions. We also provide a continuous-variable representation of the stabilizer R\'enyi entropy -- a recent proposal for a magic measure for multi-qubit states. With this in hand, we give a classical simulation algorithm with runtime scaling with the resource contents, quantified by our magic measures. We also employ our results to prove that implementing a multi-qubit logical non-Clifford operation in the GKP code subspace requires a non-Gaussian operation even at the limit of perfect encoding, despite the fact that the ideal GKP states already come with a large amount of non-Gaussianity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an innovative Parallel Quantum Local Search (PQLS) methodology that leverages the capabilities of small-scale quantum computers to efficiently address complex combinatorial optimization problems. Traditional Quantum Local Search (QLS) methods face limitations due to the sequential nature of solving sub-problems, which arises from dependencies between their solutions. Our approach transcends this constraint by simultaneously executing multiple QLS pathways and aggregating their most effective outcomes at certain intervals to establish a ``generation''. Each subsequent generation commences with the optimal solution from its predecessor, thereby significantly accelerating the convergence towards an optimal solution. Our findings demonstrate the profound impact of parallel quantum computing in enhancing the resolution of Ising problems, which are synonymous with combinatorial optimization challenges.</description>

      <title>Quantum Equilibrium Propagation for efficient training of quantum systems based on Onsager reciprocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The widespread adoption of machine learning and artificial intelligence in all branches of science and technology has created a need for energy-efficient, alternative hardware platforms. While such neuromorphic approaches have been proposed and realised for a wide range of platforms, physically extracting the gradients required for training remains challenging as generic approaches only exist in certain cases. Equilibrium propagation (EP) is such a procedure that has been introduced and applied to classical energy-based models which relax to an equilibrium. Here, we show a direct connection between EP and Onsager reciprocity and exploit this to derive a quantum version of EP. This can be used to optimize loss functions that depend on the expectation values of observables of an arbitrary quantum system. Specifically, we illustrate this new concept with supervised and unsupervised learning examples in which the input or the solvable task is of quantum mechanical nature, e.g., the recognition of quantum many-body ground states, quantum phase exploration, sensing and phase boundary exploration. We propose that in the future quantum EP may be used to solve tasks such as quantum phase discovery with a quantum simulator even for Hamiltonians which are numerically hard to simulate or even partially unknown. Our scheme is relevant for a variety of quantum simulation platforms such as ion chains, superconducting qubit arrays, neutral atom Rydberg tweezer arrays and strongly interacting atoms in optical lattices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A possible route to test whether macroscopic systems can acquire quantum features using superconducting circuits is here presented. It is shown that under general assumptions a classical test current pulse of fixed energy and adjustable length acquires quantum features after interacting with the quantum vacuum of the photon field. Further, it is shown that the mere existence of vacuum fluctuations can lead to the breakdown of energy and momentum conservation, and as the length of the pulse grows with respect to the characteristic size of the quantum system, the test pulse undergoes quantum-to-classical transition. This model differs from previous ones for its simplicity and points towards a new way of creating correlated systems suitable for quantum-based technology.</description>

      <title>Rephasing spectral diffusion in time-bin spin-spin entanglement protocols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating high fidelity spin-spin entanglement is an essential task of quantum repeater networks for the distribution of quantum information across long distances. Solid-state based spin-photon interfaces are promising candidates to realize nodes of a quantum network, but are often limited by spectral diffusion of the optical transition, which results in phase errors on the entangled states. Here, we introduce a method to correct phase errors from quasi-static frequency fluctuations after the entangled state is generated, by shelving the emitters in the excited state to refocus the unknown phase. For quasi-static frequency fluctuations, the fidelity is determined only by the lifetime of the excited state used for shelving, making it particularly suitable for systems with a long-lived shelving state with correlated spectral diffusion. Such a shelving state may be found in Kramers doublet systems such as rare-earth emitters and color centers in Si or SiC interfaced with nanophotonic cavities with a strongly frequency-dependent Purcell enhancement. The protocol can be used to generate high-fidelity entangled spin pairs without reducing the rate of entanglement generation.</description>

      <title>Quantifying fault tolerant simulation of strongly correlated systems using the Fermi-Hubbard model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the physics of strongly correlated materials is one of the grand challenge problems for physics today. A large class of scientifically interesting materials, from high-$T_c$ superconductors to spin liquids, involve medium to strong correlations, and building a holistic understanding of these materials is critical. Doing so is hindered by the competition between the kinetic energy and Coulomb repulsion, which renders both analytic and numerical methods unsatisfactory for describing interacting materials. Fault-tolerant quantum computers have been proposed as a path forward to overcome these difficulties, but this potential capability has not yet been fully assessed. Here, using the multi-orbital Fermi-Hubbard model as a representative model and a source of scalable problem specifications, we estimate the resource costs needed to use fault-tolerant quantum computers for obtaining experimentally relevant quantities such as correlation function estimation. We find that advances in quantum algorithms and hardware will be needed in order to reduce quantum resources and feasibly address utility-scale problem instances.</description>

      <title>Spin-photon entanglement of a single Er$^{3+}$ ion in the telecom band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-distance quantum communication using quantum repeaters is an enabling technology for secure communication, distributed quantum computing and quantum-enhanced sensing and metrology. As a building block of quantum repeaters, spin-photon entanglement has been demonstrated with both atomic and solid-state qubits. However, previously demonstrated qubits with long spin coherence do not directly emit photons into the low-loss telecom band that is needed for long-distance communication. Here, we demonstrate spin-photon entanglement using a single Er$^{3+}$ ion in a solid-state crystal, integrated into a silicon nanophotonic circuit. Direct emission into the telecom band enables an entanglement rate of 1.48 Hz over 15.6 km of optical fiber, with a fidelity of 73(3)$\%$. This opens the door to large-scale quantum networks based on scalable nanophotonic devices and many spectrally multiplexed Er$^{3+}$ ions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using holography, we study the universal scaling laws governing the coarsening dynamics of strongly coupled domain walls. Specifically, we studied the universal dependence of the length of the domain wall interfaces on the quench rate. The relation satisfies the Kibble-Zurek scaling shortly after the critical point. However, as time goes by, the coarsening dynamics suppresses the Kibble-Zurek scaling in favor of a universal dynamical scaling of the characteristic length and the adiabatic growth of the system. Theoretical predictions of the universal scaling laws are consistent with numerical findings in both regimes for both weak and strongly coupled systems.</description>

      <title>The two-spin enigma: from the helium atom to quantum ontology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this article is to provide an informal introduction to quantum physics, like if we were following the path of a police investigation. The scenery involves the demise, or vanishing, of some valuable properties of the two electrons in the helium atom. We will start from experimentally based evidence in order to analyse and tentatively explain physical facts, moving cautiously from a classical to a quantum description. Statements such as 'a quantum superposition is like being in two states at the same time', 'quantum entanglement is like an instantaneous action at a distance', or 'facts are relative', will be prohibited as empty of explanatory content. As a spoiler, and maybe against current common wisdom, but not giving up physical realism, the conclusion of the enquiry will be that classical physics and quantum physics can neither function nor even be conceived one without the other - in line with ideas attributed to e.g. Niels Bohr or Lev Landau.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first single-reference calculations of the atomic axial tensors (AATs) using wave-function-based methods including dynamic electron correlation effects using second-order M{\o}ller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2) and configuration interaction doubles (CID). Our implementation involves computing the overlap of numerical derivatives of the correlated wave functions with respect to both nuclear displacement coordinates and the external magnetic field. Out test set included three small molecules, including the axially chiral hydrogen molecule dimer and (P)-hydrogen peroxide, and the achiral H2O. For our molecular test set, we observed deviations of the AATs for MP2 and CID from that of the Hartree-Fock (HF) method upwards of 49%, varying with the choice of basis set. For (P)-hydrogen peroxide, electron correlation effects on the VCD rotatory strengths and corresponding spectra were particularly significant, with maximum deviations of the rotatory strengths of 62% and 49% for MP2 and CID, respectively, using our largest basis set. The inclusion of dynamic electron correlation to the computation of the AATs can have a significant impact on the resulting rotatory strengths and VCD spectra.</description>

      <title>Probably the simplest and cheapest quantum Monte Carlo method so far for extracting high-precision entanglement entropy and its derivative</title>

Abstract: Measuring entanglement entropy (EE) to probe the intrinsic physics of quantum many-body systems is an important but challenging topic in condensed matter, high energy and computational physics. Designing quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) algorithm to obtain the R\'enyi EE is a promising solution in large-scale many-body systems. However, to gain high-precision EE, the QMC-based algorithm for EE becomes more and more complex at the designing level. The entangled region needs being changed during the QMC simulation, and the detailed balance condition becomes more complicated. Moreover, the intermediately incremental processes introduced cannot be exploited neither. In this paper, we propose a simple QMC scheme able to extract EE and its derivative with high-precision, which requires neither changing replica manifold during the simulation nor adding extra detailed balance conditions. All the values measured in the incremental process are the EE under physical parameters, which greatly improves the efficiency. It opens an access to numerically probe the novel phases and phase transitions by scanning EE in a wide parameter-region in 2D and higher dimensional systems. The method has low-technical barrier and is natural for parallel computing. Our algorithm makes it no longer a dream to calculate a large amount of high-precision EE values without complicated techniques and huge computational cost.</description>

      <title>Highly Versatile FPGA-Implemented Cyber Coherent Ising Machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, quantum Ising machines have drawn a lot of attention, but due to physical implementation constraints, it has been difficult to achieve dense coupling, such as full coupling with sufficient spins to handle practical large-scale applications. Consequently, classically computable equations have been derived from quantum master equations for these quantum Ising machines. Parallel implementations of these algorithms using FPGAs have been used to rapidly find solutions to these problems on a scale that is difficult to achieve in physical systems. We have developed an FPGA implemented cyber coherent Ising machine (cyber CIM) that is much more versatile than previous implementations using FPGAs. Our architecture is versatile since it can be applied to the open-loop CIM, which was proposed when CIM research began, to the closed-loop CIM, which has been used recently, as well as to Jacobi successive over-relaxation method. By modifying the sequence control code for the calculation control module, other algorithms such as Simulated Bifurcation (SB) can also be implemented. Earlier research on large-scale FPGA implementations of SB and CIM used binary or ternary discrete values for connections, whereas the cyber CIM used FP32 values. Also, the cyber CIM utilized Zeeman terms that were represented as FP32, which were not present in other large-scale FPGA systems. Our implementation with continuous interaction realizes N=4096 on a single FPGA, comparable to the single-FPGA implementation of SB with binary interactions, with N=4096. The cyber CIM enables applications such as CDMA multi-user detector and L0 compressed sensing which were not possible with earlier FPGA systems, while enabling superior calculation speeds, more than ten times faster than a GPU implementation. The calculation speed can be further improved by increasing parallelism, such as through clustering.</description>

Abstract: We provide an alternative characterization of two-dimensional locality (necessary e.g. to define the Hall conductivity of a Fermi projection) using the spectral projections of the Laughlin flux operator. Using this abstract characterization, we define generalizations of this locality, which we term quasi-2D. We go on to calculate the path-connected components of spaces of unitaries or orthogonal projections which are quasi-2D-local and find a starkly different behavior compared with the actual 2D column of the Kitaev table, exhibiting e.g., in the unitary chiral case, infinitely many $\mathbb{Z}$-valued indices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To simulate thermalizing systems at long times, the most straightforward approach is to calculate the thermal properties at the corresponding energy. In a quantum many-body system of size $N$, for local observables and many initial states, this approach has an error of $O(1/N)$, which is reminiscent of the finite-size error of the equivalence of ensembles. In this paper, we propose a simple and efficient numerical method so that the simulation error is of higher order in $1/N$. This finite-size error scaling is proved by assuming the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis.</description>

Abstract: One of the most impressive applications of a quantum annealer was optimizing a group of Volkswagen to reduce traffic congestion using a D-Wave system. A simple formulation of a quadratic term was proposed to reduce traffic congestion. This quadratic term was useful for determining the shortest routes among several candidates. The original formulation produced decreases in the total lengths of car tours and traffic congestion. In this study, we reformulated the cost function with the sole focus on reducing traffic congestion. We then found a unique cost function for expressing the quadratic function with a dead zone and an inequality constraint.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We argue that the dynamics of particle imbalance in quadratic fermionic models is, for the majority of initial many-body product states in site occupation basis, virtually indistinguishable from the dynamics of survival probabilities of single-particle states. We then generalize our statement to a similar relationship between the non-equal time and space density correlation functions in many-body states and the transition probabilities of single-particle states at nonzero distances. Finally, we study the equal time connected density-density correlation functions in many-body states, which exhibit certain qualitative analogies with the survival and transition probabilities of single-particle states. Our results are numerically tested for two paradigmatic models of single-particle localization: the 3D Anderson model and the 1D Aubry-Andr\'e model. This work gives affirmative answer to the question whether it is possible to measure features of the single-particle survival and transition probabilities by the dynamics of observables in many-body states.</description>

      <title>Janus graphene nanoribbons with a single ferromagnetic zigzag edge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological design of pi-electrons in zigzag-edged graphene nanoribbons (ZGNRs) leads to a wealth of magnetic quantum phenomena and exotic quantum phases. Symmetric ZGNRs typically exhibit antiferromagnetically coupled spin-ordered edge states. Eliminating cross-edge magnetic coupling in ZGNRs not only enables the realization of a new class of ferromagnetic quantum spin chains, enabling the exploration of quantum spin physics and entanglement of multiple qubits in the 1D limit, but also establishes a long-sought carbon-based ferromagnetic transport channel, pivotal for ultimate scaling of GNR-based quantum electronics. However, designing such GNRs entails overcoming daunting challenges, including simultaneous breaking of structural and spin symmetries, and designing elegant precursors for asymmetric fabrication of reactive zigzag edges. Here, we report a general approach for designing and fabricating such ferromagnetic GNRs in the form of Janus GNRs with two distinct edge configurations. Guided by Lieb's theorem and topological classification theory, we devised two JGNRs by asymmetrically introduced a topological defect array of benzene motifs to one zigzag edge, while keeping the opposing zigzag edge unchanged. This breaks structural symmetry and creates a sublattice imbalance within each unit cell, initiating a spin symmetry breaking. Three Z-shape precursors are designed to fabricate one parent ZGNR and two JGNRs with an optimal lattice spacing of the defect array for a complete quench of the magnetic edge states at the defective edge. Characterization via scanning probe microscopy/spectroscopy and first-principles density functional theory confirms the successful fabrication of Janus GNRs with ferromagnetic ground state delocalised along the pristine zigzag edge.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parton fragmentation functions (FFs) are indispensable for understanding processes of hadron production ubiquitously existing in high-energy collisions, but their first principle determination has never been realized due to the insurmountable difficulties in encoding their operator definition using traditional lattice methodology. We propose a framework that makes a first step for evaluating FFs utilizing quantum computing methodology. The key element is to construct a semi-inclusive hadron operator for filtering out hadrons of desired types in a collection of particles encoded in the quantum state. We illustrate the framework by elaborating on the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model with numeral simulations. Remarkably, We show that the semi-inclusive hadron operator can be constructed efficiently with a variational quantum algorithm. Moreover, we develop error mitigation techniques tailed for accurately calculating the FFs in the presence of quantum noises. Our work opens a new avenue for investigating QCD hadronization on near-term quantum computers.</description>

      <title>A Variational Approach to Learning Photonic Unitary Operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Structured light, light tailored in its internal degrees of freedom, has become topical in numerous quantum and classical information processing protocols. In this work, we harness the high dimensional nature of structured light modulated in the transverse spatial degree of freedom to realise an adaptable scheme for learning unitary operations. Our approach borrows from concepts in variational quantum computing, where a search or optimisation problem is mapped onto the task of finding a minimum ground state energy for a given energy/goal function. We achieve this by a pseudo-random walk procedure over the parameter space of the unitary operation, implemented with optical matrix-vector multiplication enacted on arrays of Gaussian modes by exploiting the partial Fourier transforming capabilities of a cylindrical lens in the transverse degree of freedom for the measurement. We outline the concept theoretically, and experimentally demonstrate that we are able to learn optical unitary matrices for dimensions d = 2, 4, 8 and 16 with average fidelities of &gt;90%. Our work advances high dimensional information processing and can be adapted to both process and quantum state tomography of unknown states and channels.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the time evolution of a state of a relativistic quantum field theory restricted to a spatial subregion $\Omega$. More precisely, we use the Feynman-Vernon influence functional formalism to describe the dynamics of the field theory in the interior of $\Omega$ arising after integrating out the degrees of freedom in the exterior. We show how the influence of the environment gets encoded in a boundary term. Furthermore, we derive a stochastic equation of motion for the field expectation value in the interior. We find that the boundary conditions obtained in this way are energy non-conserving and non-local in space and time. Our results find applications in understanding the emergence of local thermalization in relativistic quantum field theories and the relationship between quantum field theory and relativistic fluid dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: At asymptotically late times ultrametricity can emerge from the persistent slow aging dynamics of the glass phase. We show that this suffices to recover the breaking of replica symmetry in mean-field spin glasses from the late time limit of the time evolution using the Keldysh path integral. This provides an alternative approach to replica symmetry breaking by connecting it rigorously to the dynamic formulation. Stationary spin glasses are thereby understood to spontaneously break thermal symmetry, or the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger relation of a state in global thermal equilibrium. We demonstrate our general statements for the spherical quantum $p$-spin model and the quantum Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model in the presence of transverse and longitudinal fields. In doing so, we also derive their dynamical Ginzburg-Landau effective Keldysh actions starting from microscopic quantum models.</description>

      <title>Electronic Wigner-Molecule Polymeric Chains in Elongated Silicon Quantum Dots and Finite-Length Quantum Wires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spectral properties of electrons confined in a wire-like quasi-one-dimensional (1D) elongated quantum dot (EQD) coupler between silicon qubits, are investigated with a newly developed valley-augmented unrestricted Hartree-Fock (va-UHF) method, generalized to include the valley degree of freedom treated as an isospin, allowing calculations for a large number of electrons. The lower energy symmetry-broken solutions of the self-consistent generalized Pople-Nesbet equations exhibit, for a confinement that has been modeled after an experimentally fabricated one in silicon, formation of Wigner-molecular polymeric (longitudinal) chains, initiating through charge accumulation at the edges of the finite-length quasi-1D wire. An increasing number of parallel zig-zag chains form as the number of electrons loaded into the confinement is increased, with the formation of newly added chains determined by the strength of the transverse harmonic confinement. The broken-symmetry va-UHF solutions, subsequently augmented by the quantum-mechanically required parity-restoration, go beyond the va-UHF single-determinant solution, predicting formation of entangled Wigner-molecular chains whose charge distributions obliterate the zig-zag organization of the broken-symmetry solutions. The symmetry-restored va-UHF methodology enables systematic investigations of multi-electron complex nano-scale confined structures that could be targeted for future imaging microscopy experiments in silicon and other materials (e.g., 1D domain walls in TMD materials), and quantum information utilization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presented the first thorough exploration of the attacks on the interface between gate-level and pulse-level quantum circuits and pulse-level quantum circuits themselves. Typically, quantum circuits and programs that execute on quantum computers, are defined using gate-level primitives. However, to improve the expressivity of quantum circuits and to allow better optimization, pulse-level circuits are now often used. The attacks presented in this work leverage the inconsistency between the gate-level description of the custom gate, and the actual, low-level pulse implementation of this gate. By manipulating the custom gate specification, this work proposes numerous attacks: qubit plunder, qubit block, qubit reorder, timing mismatch, frequency mismatch, phase mismatch, and waveform mismatch. This work demonstrates these attacks on the real quantum computer and simulator, and shows that most current software development kits are vulnerable to these new types of attacks. In the end, this work proposes a defense framework. The exploration of security and privacy issues of the rising pulse-level quantum circuits provides insight into the future development of secure quantum software development kits and quantum computer systems.</description>

      <title>Steady-state dynamics and non-local correlations in thermoelectric Cooper pair splitters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent experiments on Cooper pair splitters using superconductor-quantum dot hybrids have embarked on creating entanglement in the solid-state, by engineering the sub-gap processes in the superconducting region. Using the thermoelectric Cooper pair splitter setup [Nat. Comm., 12, 21, (2021)] as a prototype, we develop a detailed analysis of the observed transport signal to bring out vital insights into the regimes of operation and establish the non-local nature of the correlations arising from the crossed Andreev processes. As a striking consequence, contact induced level broadening of the quantum dot's discrete energy spectrum and its hybridization with the superconducting segment, results in a parity reversal of the thermoelectric current along with shifted resonances of the crossed Andreev processes. We conclusively establish the presence of non-local correlations by making a clear nexus with quantum discord. Our detailed analysis thereby provides insights into the gate voltage control of the entanglement generation in superconducting-hybrid Cooper pair splitters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06063v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computational fluid dynamics (QCFD) offers a promising alternative to classical computational fluid dynamics (CFD) by leveraging quantum algorithms for higher efficiency. This paper introduces a comprehensive QCFD method implemented on a superconducting quantum computer, demonstrating successful simulations of steady Poiseuille flow and unsteady acoustic wave propagation. The Poiseuille flow simulation achieved a relative error of less than $0.2\%$, and the unsteady acoustic wave simulation solved a 5043-dimension matrix, marking the largest fluid simulation on a quantum computer to date. Our approach bridges quantum and classical computing, adapting to quantum hardware constraints and offering scalable solutions for large-scale CFD problems, which paves the way for practical applications of near-term quantum computers in computational science.</description>

      <title>Surface criticality in the mixed-field Ising model with sign-inverted next-nearest-neighbor interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rydberg atoms in an optical tweezer array have been used as a quantum simulator of the spin-$1/2$ antiferromagnetic Ising model with longitudinal and transverse fields. We suggest how to implement the next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) interaction whose sign is opposite to that of the nearest neighbor one in the Rydberg atom systems. We show that this can be achieved by weakly coupling one Rydberg state with another Rydberg state. We further study the surface criticality associated with the first-order quantum phase transition between the antiferromagnetic and paramagnetic phases, which emerges due to the sign-inverted NNN interaction. From the microscopic model, we derive a Ginzburg-Landau (GL) equation, which describes static and dynamic properties of the antiferromagnetic order parameter near the transition. Using both analytical GL theory and numerical method based on a mean-field theory, we calculate the order parameter in the proximity of a boundary of the system in order to show that the healing length of the order parameter logarithmically diverges, signaling the surface criticality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The thermodynamics and the entanglement properties of two-dimensional conformal field theories ($2$d CFTs) on curved backgrounds are studied. By means of conformal mapping we study the equivalent system on flat space governed by the deformed Hamiltonian, which is a spatial integral of the Hamiltonian density modulated by an enveloping function. Focusing on holographic CFTs, we observe Hawking-Page like phase transition for the thermal and the entanglement entropy as we vary the background metric. We also compute the mutual information to study the information theoretic correlation between parts of the curved spacetime. The gravity dual of 2d CFTs on curved background is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Bayesian Optimization of Variational Quantum Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel and powerful method to harness Bayesian optimization for Variational Quantum Eigensolvers (VQEs) -- a hybrid quantum-classical protocol used to approximate the ground state of a quantum Hamiltonian. Specifically, we derive a VQE-kernel which incorporates important prior information about quantum circuits: the kernel feature map of the VQE-kernel exactly matches the known functional form of the VQE's objective function and thereby significantly reduces the posterior uncertainty. Moreover, we propose a novel acquisition function for Bayesian optimization called Expected Maximum Improvement over Confident Regions (EMICoRe) which can actively exploit the inductive bias of the VQE-kernel by treating regions with low predictive uncertainty as indirectly ``observed''. As a result, observations at as few as three points in the search domain are sufficient to determine the complete objective function along an entire one-dimensional subspace of the optimization landscape. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that our approach improves over state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

Abstract: We focus on quantum systems represented by a Hilbert space $L^2(A)$, where $A$ is a locally compact Abelian group that contains a compact open subgroup. We examine two interconnected issues related to Weyl-Heisenberg operators. First, we provide a complete and elegant solution to the problem of describing the stabilizer states in terms of their wave functions, an issue that arises in quantum information theory. Subsequently, we demonstrate that the stabilizer states are precisely the minimizers of the Wehrl entropy functional, thereby resolving the analog of the Wehrl conjecture for any such group. Additionally, we construct a moduli space for the set of stabilizer states, that is, a parameterization of this set, that endows it with a natural algebraic structure, and we derive a formula for the number of stabilizer states when $A$ is finite. Notably, these results are novel even for finite Abelian groups.</description>

Abstract: We describe a method to estimate R\'enyi entanglement entropy of a spin system, which is based on the replica trick and generative neural networks with explicit probability estimation. It can be extended to any spin system or lattice field theory. We demonstrate our method on a one-dimensional quantum Ising spin chain. As the generative model, we use a hierarchy of autoregressive networks, allowing us to simulate up to 32 spins. We calculate the second R\'enyi entropy and its derivative and cross-check our results with the numerical evaluation of entropy and results available in the literature.</description>

Abstract: Time crystalline structures can be created in periodically driven systems. They are temporal lattices which can reveal different condensed matter behaviours ranging from Anderson localization in time to temporal analogues of many-body localization or topological insulators. However, the potential practical applications of time crystalline structures have yet to be explored. Here, we pave the way for time-tronics where temporal lattices are like printed circuit boards for realization of a broad range of quantum devices. The elements of these devices can correspond to structures of dimensions higher than three and can be arbitrarily connected and reconfigured at any moment. Moreover, our approach allows for the construction of a quantum computer, enabling quantum gate operations for all possible pairs of qubits. Our findings indicate that the limitations faced in building devices using conventional spatial crystals can be overcome by adopting crystalline structures in time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent case-by-case studies revealed that the dispersion of low energy excitations in gapless frustration-free Hamiltonians is often quadratic or softer. In this work, we argue that this is actually a general property of such systems. By combining a previous study by Bravyi and Gosset and the min-max principle, we prove this hypothesis for models with local Hilbert spaces of dimension two that contains only nearest-neighbor interactions on cubic lattice. This may be understood as a no-go theorem realizing gapless phases with linearly dispersive excitations in frustration-free Hamiltonians. We also provide examples of frustration-free Hamiltonians in which the plane-wave state of a single spin flip does not constitute low energy excitations.</description>

Abstract: The dynamic critical exponent $z$ characterizes the finite-size gap in gapless quantum many-body systems. We establish a rigorous lower bound $z \geq 2$ for frustration-free Hamiltonians on any lattice in any spatial dimension, given that their ground state exhibits a power-law decaying correlation function. This bound applies to representative classes of frustration-free Hamiltonians, including Rokhsar-Kivelson Hamiltonians, which are in one-to-one correspondence to Markov chains with locality, as well as parent Hamiltonians of critical projected entangled pair states with either a unique ground state or topologically degenerate ground states, and Hamiltonians with a plane-wave ground state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strong charge-photon coupling allows the coherent coupling of a charge qubit, realized by a single charge carrier (either an electron or a hole) in a double quantum dot, to photons of a microwave resonator. Here, we theoretically demonstrate that, in the dispersive regime, the photons can mediate both an $i$SWAP gate as well as a $\sqrt{i\mathrm{SWAP}}$ gate between two distant charge qubits. We provide a thorough discussion of the impact of the dominant noise sources, resonator damping and charge qubit dephasing on the average gate fidelity. Assuming a state-of-the art resonator decay rate and charge qubit dephasing rate, the predicted average gate fidelities are below 90%. However, an increase of the charge qubit dephasing rate by one order of magnitude is conjectured to result in gate fidelities surpassing 95%.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2011.06475v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose new quantum algorithms for estimating spectral sums of positive semi-definite (PSD) matrices. The spectral sum of an PSD matrix $A$, for a function $f$, is defined as $ \text{Tr}[f(A)] = \sum_j f(\lambda_j)$, where $\lambda_j$ are the eigenvalues of $A$. Typical examples of spectral sums are the von Neumann entropy, the trace of $A^{-1}$, the log-determinant, and the Schatten $p$-norm, where the latter does not require the matrix to be PSD. The current best classical randomized algorithms estimating these quantities have a runtime that is at least linearly in the number of nonzero entries of the matrix and quadratic in the estimation error. Assuming access to a block-encoding of a matrix, our algorithms are sub-linear in the matrix size, and depend at most quadratically on other parameters, like the condition number and the approximation error, and thus can compete with most of the randomized and distributed classical algorithms proposed in the literature, and polynomially improve the runtime of other quantum algorithms proposed for the same problems. We show how the algorithms and techniques used in this work can be applied to three problems in spectral graph theory: approximating the number of triangles, the effective resistance, and the number of spanning trees within a graph.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2112.00872v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Perelomov coherent states for equally spaced, infinite homogeneous waveguide arrays with Euclidean E(2) symmetry are defined, and a new resolution of the identity is obtained. The key point to construct this novel resolution of the identity is the fact that coherent states satisfy the Helmholtz equation (in coherent states labels), and thus every coherent state belongs to a one-parameter family uniquely determined by the Cauchy initial data of the coherent state in a one-dimensional Cauchy set. For this reason we call \textit{Cauchy coherent} states to these initial data. The novel, non-local resolution of the identity in terms of Cauchy coherent states is provided using frame theory. It is also shown that Perelomov coherent states for the Eucliean E(2) group have a simple and natural physical realization in these waveguide arrays.</description>

Abstract: We generalize the concept of folding from surface codes to CSS codes by considering certain dualities within them. In particular, this gives a general method to implement logical operations in suitable LDPC quantum codes using transversal gates and qubit permutations only.
  To demonstrate our approach, we specifically consider a [[30, 8, 3]] hyperbolic quantum code called Bring's code. Further, we show that by restricting the logical subspace of Bring's code to four qubits, we can obtain the full Clifford group on that subspace.</description>

      <title>On Locality of Quantum Information in the Heisenberg Picture for Arbitrary States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.02695v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The locality issue of quantum mechanics is a key issue to a proper understanding of quantum physics and beyond. What has been commonly emphasized as quantum nonlocality has received an inspiring examination through the notion of Heisenberg picture of quantum information. Deutsch and Hayden established a local description of quantum information in a setting of quantum information flow in a system of qubits. With the introduction of a slightly modified version of what we call the Deutsch-Hayden matrix values of observables, together with our recently introduced parallel notion of the noncommutative values from a more fundamental perspective, we clarify all the locality issues based on such values as quantum information carried by local observables in any given arbitrary state of a generic composite system. Quantum information as the {\em `quantum' values} of observables gives a transparent conceptual picture of all the. Spatial locality for a projective measurement is also discussed. The pressing question is if and how such information for an entangled system can be retrieved through local processes which can only be addressed with new experimental thinking.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic Shadow Spectroscopy</title>

Abstract: We present shadow spectroscopy as a simulator-agnostic quantum algorithm for estimating energy gaps using very few circuit repetitions (shots) and no extra resources (ancilla qubits) beyond performing time evolution and measurements. The approach builds on the fundamental feature that every observable property of a quantum system must evolve according to the same harmonic components: we can reveal them by post-processing classical shadows of time-evolved quantum states to extract a large number of time-periodic signals $N_o\propto 10^8$, whose frequencies correspond to Hamiltonian energy differences with Heisenberg-limited precision. We provide strong analytical guarantees that (a) quantum resources scale as $O(\log N_o)$, while the classical computational complexity is linear $O(N_o)$, (b) the signal-to-noise ratio increases with the number of processed signals as $\propto \sqrt{N_o}$, and (c) spectral peak positions are immune to reasonable levels of noise. We demonstrate our approach on model spin systems and the excited state conical intersection of molecular CH$_2$ and verify that our method is indeed intuitively easy to use in practice, robust against gate noise, amiable to a new type of algorithmic-error mitigation technique, and uses orders of magnitude fewer number of shots than typical near-term quantum algorithms -- as low as 10 shots per timestep is sufficient. Finally, we measured a high-quality, experimental shadow spectrum of a spin chain on readily-available IBM quantum computers, achieving the same precision as in noise-free simulations without using any advanced error mitigation, and verified scalability in tensor-network simulations of up to 100-qubit systems.</description>

      <title>Approximate Quantum Compiling for Quantum Simulation: A Tensor Network based approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.08609v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce AQCtensor, a novel algorithm to produce short-depth quantum circuits from Matrix Product States (MPS). Our approach is specifically tailored to the preparation of quantum states generated from the time evolution of quantum many-body Hamiltonians. This tailored approach has two clear advantages over previous algorithms that were designed to map a generic MPS to a quantum circuit. First, we optimize all parameters of a parametric circuit at once using Approximate Quantum Compiling (AQC) - this is to be contrasted with other approaches based on locally optimizing a subset of circuit parameters and "sweeping" across the system. We introduce an optimization scheme to avoid the so-called ``orthogonality catastrophe" - i.e. the fact that the fidelity of two arbitrary quantum states decays exponentially with the number of qubits - that would otherwise render a global optimization of the circuit impractical. Second, the depth of our parametric circuit is constant in the number of qubits for a fixed simulation time and fixed error tolerance. This is to be contrasted with the linear circuit Ansatz used in generic algorithms whose depth scales linearly in the number of qubits. For simulation problems on 100 qubits, we show that AQCtensor thus achieves at least an order of magnitude reduction in the depth of the resulting optimized circuit, as compared with the best generic MPS to quantum circuit algorithms. We demonstrate our approach on simulation problems on Heisenberg-like Hamiltonians on up to 100 qubits and find optimized quantum circuits that have significantly reduced depth as compared to standard Trotterized circuits.</description>

Abstract: Reversible circuits have been studied extensively and intensively, and have plenty of applications in various areas, such as digital signal processing, cryptography, and especially quantum computing. In 2003, the lower bound $\Omega(2^n n/\log n)$ for the synthesis of $n$-wire reversible circuits was proved. Whether this lower bound has a matching upper bound was listed as one of the future challenging open problems in the survey (M. Saeedi and I. L Markov, ACM Computing Surveys, 45(2):1-34, 2013). In this paper we propose an algorithm to implement an arbitrary $n$-wire reversible circuit with no more than $O(2^n n/\log n)$ elementary gates, and thus close the open problem.</description>

      <title>Guidable Local Hamiltonian Problems with Implications to Heuristic Ans\"atze State Preparation and the Quantum PCP Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.11578v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study 'Merlinized' versions of the recently defined Guided Local Hamiltonian problem, which we call 'Guidable Local Hamiltonian' problems. Unlike their guided counterparts, these problems do not have a guiding state provided as a part of the input, but merely come with the promise that one exists. We consider in particular two classes of guiding states: those that can be prepared efficiently by a quantum circuit; and those belonging to a class of quantum states we call classically evaluatable, for which it is possible to efficiently compute expectation values of local observables classically. We show that guidable local Hamiltonian problems for both classes of guiding states are $\mathsf{QCMA}$-complete in the inverse-polynomial precision setting, but lie within $\mathsf{NP}$ (or $\mathsf{NqP}$) in the constant precision regime when the guiding state is classically evaluatable.
  Our completeness results show that, from a complexity-theoretic perspective, classical Ans\"atze selected by classical heuristics are just as powerful as quantum Ans\"atze prepared by quantum heuristics, as long as one has access to quantum phase estimation. In relation to the quantum PCP conjecture, we (i) define a complexity class capturing quantum-classical probabilistically checkable proof systems and show that it is contained in $\mathsf{BQP}^{\mathsf{NP}[1]}$ for constant proof queries; (ii) give a no-go result on 'dequantizing' the known quantum reduction which maps a $\mathsf{QPCP}$-verification circuit to a local Hamiltonian with constant promise gap; (iii) give several no-go results for the existence of quantum gap amplification procedures that preserve certain ground state properties; and (iv) propose two conjectures that can be viewed as stronger versions of the NLTS theorem. Finally, we show that many of our results can be directly modified to obtain similar results for the class $\mathsf{MA}$.</description>

      <title>Ising Meson Spectroscopy on a Noisy Digital Quantum Simulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.03311v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum simulation has the potential to be an indispensable technique for the investigation of non-perturbative phenomena in strongly-interacting quantum field theories (QFTs). In the modern quantum era, with Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum~(NISQ) simulators widely available and larger-scale quantum machines on the horizon, it is natural to ask: what non-perturbative QFT problems can be solved with the existing quantum hardware? We show that existing noisy quantum machines can be used to analyze the energy spectrum of a large family of strongly-interacting 1+1D QFTs. The latter exhibit a wide-range of non-perturbative effects like `quark confinement' and `false vacuum decay' which are typically associated with higher-dimensional QFTs of elementary particles. We perform quench experiments on IBM's ibmq_mumbai quantum simulator to compute the energy spectrum of 1+1D quantum Ising model with a longitudinal field. The latter model is particularly interesting due to the formation of mesonic bound states arising from a confining potential for the Ising domain-walls, reminiscent of t'Hooft's model of two-dimensional quantum chromodynamics. Our results demonstrate that digital quantum simulation in the NISQ era has the potential to be a viable alternative to numerical techniques such as density matrix renormalization group or the truncated conformal space methods for analyzing QFTs.</description>

      <title>Fermionic anyons: entanglement and quantum computation from a resource-theoretic perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.00795v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computational models can be approached via the lens of resources needed to perform computational tasks, where a computational advantage is achieved by consuming specific forms of quantum resources, or, conversely, resource-free computations are classically simulable. Can we similarly identify quantum computational resources in the setting of more general quasi-particle statistics? In this work, we develop a framework to characterize the separability of a specific type of one-dimensional quasiparticle known as a fermionic anyon. As we evince, the usual notion of partial trace fails in this scenario, so we build the notion of separability through a fractional Jordan-Wigner transformation, leading to an entanglement description of fermionic-anyon states. We apply this notion of fermionic-anyon separability, and the unitary operations that preserve it, mapping it to the free resources of matchgate circuits. We also identify how entanglement between two qubits encoded in a dual-rail manner, as standard for matchgate circuits, corresponds to the notion of entanglement between fermionic anyons.</description>

Abstract: We discuss dense coding with $n$ copies of a specific preshared state between the sender and the receiver when the encoding operation is limited to the application of group representation. Typically, to act on multiple local copies of these preshared states, the receiver needs quantum memory, because in general the multiple copies will be generated sequentially. Depending on available encoding unitary operations, we investigate what preshared state offers an advantage of using quantum memory on the receiver's side.</description>

Abstract: The past decade has witnessed significant advancements in quantum hardware, encompassing improvements in speed, qubit quantity, and quantum volume-a metric defining the maximum size of a quantum circuit effectively implementable on near-term quantum devices. This progress has led to a surge in Quantum Machine Learning (QML) applications on real hardware, aiming to achieve quantum advantage over classical approaches. This survey focuses on selected supervised and unsupervised learning applications executed on quantum hardware, specifically tailored for real-world scenarios. The exploration includes a thorough analysis of current QML implementation limitations on quantum hardware, covering techniques like encoding, ansatz structure, error mitigation, and gradient methods to address these challenges. Furthermore, the survey evaluates the performance of QML implementations in comparison to classical counterparts. In conclusion, we discuss existing bottlenecks related to applying QML on real quantum devices and propose potential solutions to overcome these challenges in the future.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.01885v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a quantum system driven out of equilibrium via a small Hamiltonian perturbation. Building on the paradigmatic framework of linear response theory (LRT), we derive an expression for the full generating function of the dissipated work. Remarkably, we find that all information about the distribution can be encoded in a single quantity, the standard relaxation function in LRT, thus opening up new ways to use phenomenological models to study non-equilibrium fluctuations in complex quantum systems. Our results establish a number of refined quantum thermodynamic constraints on the work statistics that apply to regimes of perturbative but arbitrarily fast protocols, and do not rely on assumptions such as slow driving or weak coupling. Finally, our approach uncovers a distinctly quantum signature in the work statistics that originates from underlying zero-point energy fluctuations. This causes an increased dispersion of the probability distribution at short driving times, a feature that can be probed in efforts to witness non-classical effects in quantum thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Effective-medium approach to the resonance distribution of wave scattering in a random point field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.00542v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a previous paper [Phys. Rev. A 105, 042205 (2022)], the distribution of resonance poles in the complex plane of the wavenumber $k$ associated to the multiple scattering of a quantum particle in a random point field was numerically discovered. This distribution presented two distinctive structures: a set of peaks at small $k$ when the wavelength is larger than the interscatterer distance, and a band almost parallel to the real axis at larger $k$. In this paper, a theoretical study based on wave transport theory is proposed to explain the origin of these structures and to predict their distribution in the complex $k$ plane. First, it is shown that the peaks at small $k$ can be understood using the effective wave equation for the average wavefunction over the disorder. Then, that the band at large $k$ can be described by the Bethe-Salpeter equation for the square modulus of the wavefunction. This study is supported by careful comparisons with numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Efficient Large-Scale Many-Body Quantum Dynamics via Local-Information Time Evolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06036v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: During time evolution of many-body systems entanglement grows rapidly, limiting exact simulations to small-scale systems or small timescales. Quantum information tends however to flow towards larger scales without returning to local scales, such that its detailed large-scale structure does not directly affect local observables. This allows for the removal of large-scale quantum information in a way that preserves all local observables and gives access to large-scale and large-time quantum dynamics. To this end, we use the recently introduced information lattice to organize quantum information into different scales, allowing us to define local information and information currents which we employ to systematically discard long-range quantum correlations in a controlled way. Our approach relies on decomposing the system into subsystems up to a maximum scale and time evolving the subsystem density matrices by solving the subsystem von Neumann equations in parallel. Importantly, the information flow needs to be preserved during the discarding of large-scale information. To achieve this without the need to make assumptions about the microscopic details of the information current, we introduce a second scale at which information is discarded while using the state at the maximum scale to accurately obtain the information flow. The resulting algorithm, which we call local information time evolution (LITE), is highly versatile and suitable for investigating many-body quantum dynamics in both closed and open quantum systems with diverse hydrodynamic behaviors. We present results for energy transport in the mixed-field Ising model and magnetization transport in an open XX spin chain where we accurately determine the diffusion coefficients. The information lattice framework employed here promises to offer insightful results about the spatial and temporal behavior of entanglement in many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Heralded Optical Entanglement Generation via the Graph Picture of Linear Quantum Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.10291v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-destructive heralded entanglement with photons is a valuable resource for quantum information processing. However, they generally entail ancillary particles and modes that amplify the circuit intricacy. To address this challenge, a recent work (npj Quantum Information (accepted), arXiv:2211.04042) introduced a graph approach for creating multipartite entanglements with boson subtractions. Nonetheless, it remains an essential intermediate step toward practical heralded schemes: the proposition of heralded subtraction operators in bosonic linear quantum networks. This research establishes comprehensive translation rules from subtraction operators to linear optical operators, which provides a seamless path to design heralded schemes with single photons. Our method begets enhanced or previously unreported schemes for the $N$-partite GHZ state with $2N$ photons, $N$-partite W state with $2N+1$ photons and superposition of $N=3$ GHZ and W states with 9 photons. Our streamlined approach can straightforwardly design heralded schemes for multipartite entangled states by assembling the operators according to the guidence of sculpting bigraphs, hence significantly simplifies the quantum circuit design process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12762v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum decision theory is introduced here, and a new basis for this theory is proposed. It is first based upon the author's general arguments for the Hilbert space formalism in quantum theory, and next on arguments for the Born rule, which is the basis for calculating quantum probabilities. A basic notion behind the quantum theory foundation is that of theoretical variables, that are divided into accessible and inaccessible ones. This is here specialized to decision variables. It is assumed that each accessible variable can be seen as a function of a specific inaccessible variable. Another assumption is that there exist two maximal accessible decision processes in the given situation. Two basic assumptions behind the Born rule are 1) the likelihood principle, 2) the actor in question has motivations that can be modeled by a hypothetical perfectly rational higher being. The theory is illustrated by a medical example. Finally, a broad discussion of decision processes is given.</description>

      <title>Low-depth Clifford circuits approximately solve MaxCut</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15022v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a quantum-inspired approximation algorithm for MaxCut based on low-depth Clifford circuits. We start by showing that the solution unitaries found by the adaptive quantum approximation optimization algorithm (ADAPT-QAOA) for the MaxCut problem on weighted fully connected graphs are (almost) Clifford circuits. Motivated by this observation, we devise an approximation algorithm for MaxCut, \emph{ADAPT-Clifford}, that searches through the Clifford manifold by combining a minimal set of generating elements of the Clifford group. Our algorithm finds an approximate solution of MaxCut on an $N$-vertex graph by building a depth $O(N)$ Clifford circuit. The algorithm has runtime complexity $O(N^2)$ and $O(N^3)$ for sparse and dense graphs, respectively, and space complexity $O(N^2)$, with improved solution quality achieved at the expense of more demanding runtimes. We implement ADAPT-Clifford and characterize its performance on graphs with positive and signed weights. The case of signed weights is illustrated with the paradigmatic Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model, for which our algorithm finds solutions with ground-state mean energy density corresponding to $\sim94\%$ of the Parisi value in the thermodynamic limit. The case of positive weights is investigated by comparing the cut found by ADAPT-Clifford with the cut found with the Goemans-Williamson (GW) algorithm. For both sparse and dense instances we provide copious evidence that, up to hundreds of nodes, ADAPT-Clifford finds cuts of lower energy than GW.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.00174v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the two-qubit asymmetric quantum Rabi model (AQRM) and find its dark-state solution. Such solutions have at most one photon and constant eigenenergy in the whole coupling regime, causing level crossings in the spectrum, although there is no explicit conserved quantity except energy. We find an operator in the eigenenergy basis to label all the degeneracies with its eigenvalues, and compare it with the well-known hidden symmetry which exists when bias parameter $\epsilon$ is a multiple of half of the resonator frequency $\omega$. Extended to the multimode case, we find symmetries related with conserved bosonic number operators, which also cause level crossings. This provides a perspective for symmetry studies on generalized Rabi models.</description>

Abstract: Quantum error correction is crucial for scalable quantum information processing applications. Traditional discrete-variable quantum codes that use multiple two-level systems to encode logical information can be hardware-intensive. An alternative approach is provided by bosonic codes, which use the infinite-dimensional Hilbert space of harmonic oscillators to encode quantum information. Two promising features of bosonic codes are that syndrome measurements are natively analog and that they can be concatenated with discrete-variable codes. In this work, we propose novel decoding methods that explicitly exploit the analog syndrome information obtained from the bosonic qubit readout in a concatenated architecture. Our methods are versatile and can be generally applied to any bosonic code concatenated with a quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) code. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of quasi-single-shot protocols as a novel approach that significantly reduces the number of repeated syndrome measurements required when decoding under phenomenological noise. To realize the protocol, we present a first implementation of time-domain decoding with the overlapping window method for general QLDPC codes, and a novel analog single-shot decoding method. Our results lay the foundation for general decoding algorithms using analog information and demonstrate promising results in the direction of fault-tolerant quantum computation with concatenated bosonic-QLDPC codes.</description>

Abstract: A quantum-limited amplifier enables the amplification of weak signals while introducing minimal noise dictated by the principles of quantum mechanics. These amplifiers serve a broad spectrum of applications in quantum computing, including fast and accurate readout of superconducting qubits and spins, as well as various uses in quantum sensing and metrology. Parametric amplification, primarily developed using Josephson junctions, has evolved into the leading technology for highly effective microwave measurements within quantum circuits. Despite their significant contributions, these amplifiers face fundamental limitations, such as their inability to handle high powers, sensitivity to parasitic magnetic fields, and particularly their limitation to operate only at millikelvin temperatures. To tackle these challenges, here we experimentally develop a novel quantum-limited amplifier based on superconducting kinetic inductance and present an extensive theoretical model to describe this nonlinear coupled-mode system. Our device surpasses the conventional constraints associated with Josephson junction amplifiers by operating at much higher temperatures up to 4.5 K. With two distinct spectral modes and tunability through bias current, this amplifier can operate selectively in both single and double-mode amplification regimes near the quantum noise limit. Utilizing a nonlinear thin film exhibiting kinetic inductance, our device attains gain exceeding 50 dB in a single-mode and 32 dB in a double-mode configuration while adding 0.35 input-referred quanta of noise. Importantly, this amplifier eliminates the need for Josephson junctions, resulting in significantly higher power handling capabilities than Josephson-based amplifiers. It also demonstrates resilience in the presence of magnetic fields, offers a straightforward design, and enhances reliability.</description>

      <title>Resource-efficient shadow tomography using equatorial stabilizer measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14622v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a resource-efficient shadow-tomography scheme using equatorial-stabilizer measurements generated from subsets of Clifford unitaries. For $n$-qubit systems, equatorial-stabilizer-based shadow-tomography schemes can estimate $M$ observables (up to an additive error $\varepsilon$) using $\mathcal{O}(\log(M),\mathrm{poly}(n),1/\varepsilon^2)$ sampling copies for a large class of observables, including those with traceless parts possessing polynomially-bounded Frobenius norms. For arbitrary quantum-state observables, sampling complexity becomes $n$-independent. Our scheme only requires an $n$-depth controlled-$Z$ (CZ) circuit [$\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ CZ gates] and Pauli measurements per sampling copy, exhibiting a smaller maximal gate count relative to previously-known randomized-Clifford-based proposals. Implementation-wise, the maximal circuit depth is reduced to $\frac{n}{2}+\mathcal{O}(\log(n))$ with controlled-NOT (CNOT) gates. Alternatively, our scheme is realizable with $2n$-depth circuits comprising $O(n^2)$ nearest-neighboring CNOT gates, with possible further gate-count improvements. We numerically confirm our theoretically-derived shadow-tomographic sampling complexities with random pure states and multiqubit graph states. Finally, we demonstrate that equatorial-stabilizer-based shadow tomography is more noise-tolerant than randomized-Clifford-based schemes in terms of average gate fidelity and fidelity estimation for Greenberger--Horne--Zeilinger (GHZ) state and W state.</description>

Abstract: All quantum random number generators based on measuring value indefinite observables are at least three-dimensional because the Kochen-Specker Theorem and the Located Kochen-Specker Theorem are false in dimension two. In this article, we construct quantum random number generators based on measuring a three-dimensional value indefinite observable that generates binary quantum random outputs with the same randomness qualities as the ternary ones: the outputs are maximally unpredictable.</description>

      <title>Strategies for simulating time evolution of Hamiltonian lattice field theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11637v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simulating the time evolution of quantum field theories given some Hamiltonian $H$ requires developing algorithms for implementing the unitary operator e^{-iHt}. A variety of techniques exist that accomplish this task, with the most common technique used so far being Trotterization, which is a special case of the application of a product formula. However, other techniques exist that promise better asymptotic scaling in certain parameters of the theory being simulated, the most efficient of which are based on the concept of block encoding.
  In this work we study the performance of such algorithms in simulating lattice field theories. We derive and compare the asymptotic gate complexities of several commonly used simulation techniques in application to Hamiltonian Lattice Field Theories. Using the scalar \phi^4 theory as a test, we also perform numerical studies and compare the gate costs required by Product Formulas and Signal Processing based techniques to simulate time evolution. For the latter, we use the the Linear Combination of Unitaries construction augmented with the Quantum Fourier Transform circuit to switch between the field and momentum eigenbases, which leads to immediate order-of-magnitude improvement in the cost of preparing the block encoding.
  The paper also includes a pedagogical review of utilized techniques, in particular Product Formulas, LCU, Qubitization, QSP, as well as a technique we call HHKL based on its inventors' names.</description>

      <title>The entanglement membrane in exactly solvable lattice models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12509v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entanglement membrane theory is an effective coarse-grained description of entanglement dynamics and operator growth in chaotic quantum many-body systems. The fundamental quantity characterizing the membrane is the entanglement line tension. However, determining the entanglement line tension for microscopic models is in general exponentially difficult. We compute the entanglement line tension in a recently introduced class of exactly solvable yet chaotic unitary circuits, so-called generalized dual-unitary circuits, obtaining a non-trivial form that gives rise to a hierarchy of velocity scales with $v_E&lt;v_B$. For the lowest level of the hierarchy, $\bar{\mathcal{L}}_{2}$ circuits, the entanglement line tension can be computed entirely, while for the higher levels the solvability is reduced to certain regions in spacetime. This partial solvability enables us to place bounds on the entanglement velocity. We find that $\bar{\mathcal{L}}_{2}$ circuits saturate certain bounds on entanglement growth that are also saturated in holographic models. Furthermore, we relate the entanglement line tension to temporal entanglement and correlation functions. We also develop new methods of constructing generalized dual-unitary gates, including constructions based on complex Hadamard matrices that exhibit additional solvability properties and constructions that display behavior unique to local dimension greater than or equal to three. Our results shed light on entanglement membrane theory in microscopic Floquet lattice models and enable us to perform non-trivial checks on the validity of its predictions by comparison to exact and numerical calculations. Moreover, they demonstrate that generalized dual-unitary circuits display a more generic form of information dynamics than dual-unitary circuits.</description>

Abstract: The concept of information scrambling elucidates the dispersion of local information in quantum many-body systems, offering insights into various physical phenomena such as wormhole teleportation. This phenomenon has spurred extensive theoretical and experimental investigations. Among these, the size-winding mechanism emerges as a valuable diagnostic tool for optimizing signal detection. In this work, we establish a computational framework for determining the winding size distribution in large-$N$ quantum systems with all-to-all interactions, utilizing the scramblon effective theory. We obtain the winding size distribution for the large-$q$ SYK model across the entire time domain. Notably, we unveil that the manifestation of size winding results from a universal phase factor in the scramblon propagator, highlighting the significance of the Lyapunov exponent. These findings contribute to a sharp and precise connection between operator dynamics and the phenomenon of wormhole teleportation.</description>

      <title>A Strategy for Preparing Quantum Squeezed States Using Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16320v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a scheme leveraging reinforcement learning to engineer control fields for generating non-classical states. It is exemplified by the application to prepare spin-squeezed states for an open collective spin model where a linear control field is designed to govern the dynamics. The reinforcement learning agent determines the temporal sequence of control pulses, commencing from a coherent spin state in an environment characterized by dissipation and dephasing. Compared to the constant control scenario, this approach provides various control sequences maintaining collective spin squeezing and entanglement. It is observed that denser application of the control pulses enhances the performance of the outcomes. However, there is a minor enhancement in the performance by adding control actions. The proposed strategy demonstrates increased effectiveness for larger systems. Thermal excitations of the reservoir are detrimental to the control outcomes. Feasible experiments are suggested to implement this control proposal based on the comparison with the others. The extensions to continuous control problems and another quantum system are discussed. The replaceability of the reinforcement learning module is also emphasized. This research paves the way for its application in manipulating other quantum systems.</description>

Abstract: We study the impact of saturable nonlinearity on the presence and location of exceptional points in a non-Hermitian dimer system. The inclusion of the saturable nonlinearity leads to the emergence of multiple eigenvalues, exceeding the typical two found in the linear counterpart. To identify the exceptional points, we calculate the nonlinear eigenvalues both from a polynomial equation for the defined population imbalance and through a fully numerical method. Our results reveal that exceptional points can be precisely located by adjusting the non-equal saturable nonlinearities in the detuning space.</description>

Abstract: The rapid advancement of quantum computing has increasingly highlighted its potential in the realm of machine learning, particularly in the context of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Quantum machine learning (QML) leverages the unique capabilities of quantum computing to offer novel perspectives and methodologies for complex data processing and pattern recognition challenges. This paper introduces a novel Quantum Mixed-State Attention Network (QMSAN), which integrates the principles of quantum computing with classical machine learning algorithms, especially self-attention networks, to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness in handling NLP tasks. QMSAN model employs a quantum attention mechanism based on mixed states, enabling efficient direct estimation of similarity between queries and keys within the quantum domain, leading to more effective attention weight acquisition. Additionally, we propose an innovative quantum positional encoding scheme, implemented through fixed quantum gates within the quantum circuit, to enhance the model's accuracy. Experimental validation on various datasets demonstrates that QMSAN model outperforms existing quantum and classical models in text classification, achieving significant performance improvements. QMSAN model not only significantly reduces the number of parameters but also exceeds classical self-attention networks in performance, showcasing its strong capability in data representation and information extraction. Furthermore, our study investigates the model's robustness in different quantum noise environments, showing that QMSAN possesses commendable robustness to low noise.</description>

Abstract: Generic low-dimensional Hamiltonian systems feature a structured, mixed classical phase-space. The traditional Percival classification of quantum spectra into regular states supported by quasi-integrable regions and irregular states supported by quasi-chaotic regions turns out to be insufficient to capture the richness of the Hilbert space. Berry's conjecture and the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis are not applicable and quantum effects such as tunneling, scarring, and localization, do not obey the standard paradigms. We demonstrate these statements for a prototype Bose-Hubbard model. We highlight the hybridization of chaotic and regular regions from opposing perspectives of ergodicity and localization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06923v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply the Nakajima-Zwanzig approach to open quantum systems to study steady-state transport across generic multi-level junctions coupled to bosonic or fermionic reservoirs. The method allows for a unified diagrammatic formulation in Liouville space, with diagrams being classified according to an expansion in the coupling strength between the reservoirs and the junction. Analytical, approximate expressions are provided up to fourth order for the steady-state boson transport that generalize to multi-level systems the known results for the low-temperature thermal conductance in the spin-boson model. The formalism is applied to the problem of heat transport in a qubit-resonator junction modeled by the quantum Rabi model. Nontrivial transport features emerge as a result of the interplay between the qubit-oscillator detuning and coupling strength. For quasi-degenerate spectra, nonvanishing steady-state coherences cause a suppression of the thermal conductance.</description>

Abstract: A general theory based upon 6 postulates is introduced. The basical notions are theoretical variables that are associated with an observer or with a group of communicating observers. These variables may be accessible or inaccessible. From these postulates, the ordinary formalism of quantum theory are derived. The mathematical derivations are not given in this article, but I refer to the recent articles [9, 10]. Three possible applications of the general theory can be given; 1) The variables may decision variables connected to the decisions of a person or of a group of persons. 2) The variables may be statistical parameters or future data, But most importantly here: 3) The variables are physical variables in some context. This last application gives a completely new foundation of quantum mechanics, a foundation which in my opinion is much more easy to understand than the ordinary formalism.The other applications seem also to give interesting consequences of the approach. Socalled paradoxes like that of Schr\"odinger's cat can be clarified under the theory. Explanations of the outcomes of David Bohm's version of the EPR experiment and of the Bell experiment are provided. Finally, references to links towards relativity theory and to quantum field theory are given.</description>

Abstract: Entanglement is the most striking but also most weird property in quantum mechanics, even though it has been confirmed by many experiments over decades through the criterion of violating Bell's inequality. However, a fundamental questions arisen from EPR paradox is still not fully understood, that is, why and how entanglement emerges in quantum realm but not in classical world. In this paper, we investigate the quantum dynamics of two photonic modes (or any two bosonic modes) coupled to each other through a beam splitting. Such a coupling fails to produce two-mode entanglement. We also start with an initially separable pure state for the two modes, namely, there are no entanglement and statistic probability feature to begin with. By solving the quantum equation of motion exactly without relying on the probabilistic interpretation, we find that when the initial wave function of one mode is different from a wave packet obeying the minimum Heisenberg uncertainty (which corresponds to a well-defined classically particle), the causality in the time-evolution of each mode is internally broken. It also leads to the emergence of quantum entanglement between the two modes. The lack of causality is the nature of statistics. The Bell's theorem only rules out the existence of local hidden variables in the probabilistic interpretation of quantum mechanics. It is the breaking of internal causality in the dynamical evolution of subsystems that induces the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics, even though the dynamical evolution of the whole system completely obey the deterministic Schr\"{o}dinger equation. This conclusion is valid for all quantum systems. It provides a fundamental origin of the probabilistic feature within the deterministic framework of quantum mechanics.</description>

Abstract: The study of entanglement in gauge theories is expected to provide insights into many fundamental phenomena, including confinement. However, calculations of quantities related to entanglement in gauge theories are limited by ambiguities that stem from the non-factorizability of the Hilbert space. In this work we study lattice gauge theories that admit a dual description in terms of spin models, for which the replica trick and R\'enyi entropies are well defined. In the first part of this work, we explicitly perform the duality transformation in a replica geometry, deriving the structure of a replica space for a gauge theory. Then, in the second part, we calculate, by means of Monte Carlo simulations, the entropic c-function of the $\Z_2$ gauge theory in three spacetime dimensions, exploiting its dual description in terms of the three-dimensional Ising model.</description>

Abstract: Quantum computing has made tremendous improvements in both software and hardware that have sparked interest in academia and industry to realize quantum computing applications. To this end, several steps are necessary: The underlying problem must be encoded in a quantum circuit, a suitable device must be selected to execute it, and it must be compiled accordingly. This compilation step has a significant influence on the quality of the resulting solution. However, current state-of-the-art compilation tools treat the quantum circuit as a sequence of instructions without considering the actual application it realizes -- wasting a yet untapped potential to increase the solution quality. In this work, a different approach is explored that explicitly incorporates the application considered and aims to optimize its solution quality during compilation. Initial results show the benefits of this approach: For an industry-inspired application of a quantum generative model, the proposed approach outperformed Qiskit's most-optimized compilation scheme and led to better solution quality. Therefore, this work presents a first step towards application-aware compilation.</description>

      <title>Schwinger-Keldysh nonequilibrium quantum field theory of open quantum systems beyond the Markovian regime: Application to the spin-boson model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00765v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a Schwinger-Keldysh field theory (SKFT) for open quantum systems interacting with a dissipative environment and apply it to the spin-boson model as an archetypical example where the environment is composed of a bosonic bath. Prior SKFT developments of this type have been confined to the Markovian regime, as an alternative to a conventional description by the Lindblad quantum master equation (QME) which is a time-local matrix differential equation. Here we combine SKFT with a two-particle irreducible (2PI) action that resums a class of Feynman diagrams to infinite order. We obtain the time-evolution of the spin density matrix in the form of a system of integro-differential equations applicable to both Markovian and non-Markovian regimes. The latter regime--where taking into account memory effects becomes essential--poses a challenge for standard methods when trying to incorporate arbitrary properties of the system, bath, and length of time evolution. The SKFT+2PI-computed time evolution of the spin expectation values in the Markovian regime reproduces the solution of the Lindblad QME, as long as the system-bath coupling in the latter is adjusted by increasing it. In the non-Markovian regime, SKFT+2PI yields a nonperturbative solution that mimics results from both hierarchical equations of motion and tensor networks methods that we employ as benchmarks. Our SKFT+2PI approach can also access challenging cases, such as zero-temperature and sub-Ohmic bath, as well as arbitrary long evolution times. Taking into account favorable numerical cost of solving the integro-differential equations with increasing number of spins, time steps or dimensionality the SKFT+2PI approach offers a promising route for simulation of driven-dissipative systems in quantum computing or quantum magnonics and spintronics in the presence of a variety of (single or multiple) dissipative environments.</description>

      <title>On solving Schroedinger's equation with classical action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06328v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the Schroedinger equation of quantum physics can be solved using the classical Hamilton-Jacobi action dynamics, extending a key result of Feynman applicable only to quadratic Lagrangians. This is made possible by two developments. The first is incorporating geometric constraints directly in the classical least action problem, in effect replacing in part the probabilistic setting by the non-uniqueness of solutions of the constrained problem. For instance, in the double slit experiment or for a particle in a box, spatial inequality constraints create Dirac constraint forces, which lead to multiple path solutions. The second development is a spatial rescaling of clocks, specifically designed to achieve a general equivalence between Schroedinger and Hamilton-Jacobi representations. These developments leave the results of associated Feynman path integrals unchanged, but the computation can be greatly simplified as only classical action is used and time-slicing is avoided altogether. They also suggest a smooth transition between physics across scales.</description>

      <title>Capacities of a two-parameter family of noisy Werner-Holevo channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11216v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In $d=2j+1$ dimensions, the Landau-Streater quantum channel is defined on the basis of spin $j$ representation of the $su(2)$ algebra. Only for $j=1$, this channel is equivalent to the Werner-Holevo channel and enjoys covariance properties with respect to the group $SU(3)$. We extend this class of channels to higher dimensions in a way which is based on the Lie algebra $so(d)$ and $su(d)$. As a result it retains its equivalence to the Werner-Holevo channel in arbitrary dimensions. The resulting channel is covariant with respect to the unitary group $SU(d)$. We then modify this channel in a way which can act as a noisy channel on qudits. The resulting modified channel now interpolates between the identity channel and the Werner-Holevo channel and its covariance is reduced to the subgroup of orthogonal matrices $SO(d)$. We then investigate some of the propeties of the resulting two-parameter family of channels, including their spectrum, their regions of lack of indivisibility, their Holevo quantity, entanglement-assisted capacity and the closed form of their complement channel and a possible lower bound for their quantum capacity.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Train: Rethinking Hybrid Quantum-Classical Machine Learning in the Model Compression Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11304v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduces the Quantum-Train(QT) framework, a novel approach that integrates quantum computing with classical machine learning algorithms to address significant challenges in data encoding, model compression, and inference hardware requirements. Even with a slight decrease in accuracy, QT achieves remarkable results by employing a quantum neural network alongside a classical mapping model, which significantly reduces the parameter count from $M$ to $O(\text{polylog} (M))$ during training. Our experiments demonstrate QT's effectiveness in classification tasks, offering insights into its potential to revolutionize machine learning by leveraging quantum computational advantages. This approach not only improves model efficiency but also reduces generalization errors, showcasing QT's potential across various machine learning applications.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Entropy of Free Fermions with a Random Matrix as a One-Body Hamiltonian</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11342v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a quantum system of large size $N$ and its subsystem of size $L$ assuming that $N$ is much larger than $L$, which can also be sufficiently large, i.e., $1 \ll L \lesssim N $. A widely accepted mathematical version of this heuristic inequality is the asymptotic regime of successive limits: first the macroscopic limit $N \to \infty$, then an asymptotic analysis of the entanglement entropy as $L \to \infty$. In this paper, we consider another version of the above heuristic inequality: the regime of asymptotically proportional $L$ and $N$, i.e., the simultaneous limits $L \to \infty,\; N \to \infty, L/N \to \lambda &gt;0$. Specifically, we consider the system of free fermions which is in its ground state and such that its one-body Hamiltonian is a large random matrix, that is often used to model the long-range hopping. By using random matrix theory, we show that in this case, the entanglement entropy obeys the volume law known for systems with short-ranged hopping but described either by a mixed state or a pure strongly excited state of the Hamiltonian. We also give a streamlined proof of Page's formula for the entanglement entropy of the black hole radiation for a wide class of typical ground states, thereby proving the universality of the formula.</description>

      <title>Quantumness and Randomness of Quantum Random Number Generators via Photon Statistics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14085v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Several quantum random number generator (QRNG) models have been proposed to produce random numbers, which, due to the quantum theory, are more secure than their classical counterparts. Many QRNG devices are commercially available as off-the-shelf black-box devices. Computationally, it is not possible to distinguish between a PRNG and a QRNG just by observing their outputs. The common practice for testing quantumness is a direct comparison between the mean and the variance of the experimental photon count. However, statistically, this is not a feasible solution either, because of finite sample size. A QRNG that uses single photons as the quantum source produces true quantum random numbers. Since single photons follow sub-Poissonian statistics, by determining the underlying distribution one can conclude whether a QRNG is truly quantum or not. In this work, we point out the limitations of existing methods of such a decision-making processes, and propose a more efficient two-fold statistical method, which can ensure whether an optical source is quantum or not up to a desired confidence level. Also, QRNGs can not produce true random numbers without deterministic classical post-processing. In this work, we also show that the two models of QRNGs, one producing random numbers from exponential distribution and the other from uniform distribution, become essentially similar under device noise. Detector outputs of both the above models can be tested to quantify the randomness coming from the quantum source of a QRNG, which in turn, dictates how much post-processing is required to produce good random numbers retaining quantumness. In this context, we also derive a relation when the underlying sampling distributions of the QRNGs will be $\epsilon$-random. Depending on this relation, a suitable post-processing algorithm can be chosen.</description>

      <title>Wigner's Theorem for stabilizer states and quantum designs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17565v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe the symmetry group of the stabilizer polytope for any number $n$ of systems and any prime local dimension $d$. In the qubit case, the symmetry group coincides with the linear and anti-linear Clifford operations. In the case of qudits, the structure is somewhat richer: for $n=1$, it is a wreath product of permutations of bases and permutations of the elements within each basis. For $n&gt;1$, the symmetries are given by affine symplectic similitudes. These are the affine maps that preserve the symplectic form of the underlying discrete phase space up to a non-zero multiplier. We phrase these results with respect to a number of a priori different notions of "symmetry'', including Kadison symmetries (bijections that are compatible with convex combinations), Wigner symmetries (bijections that preserve inner products), and symmetries realized by an action on Hilbert space. Going beyond stabilizer states, we extend an observation of Heinrich and Gross (Ref. [25]) and show that the symmetries of fairly general sets of Hermitian operators are constrained by certain moments. In particular: the symmetries of a set that behaves like a 3-design preserve Jordan products and are therefore realized by conjugation with unitaries or anti-unitaries. (The structure constants of the Jordan algebra are encoded in an order-three tensor, which we connect to the third moments of a design). This generalizes Kadison's formulation of the classic Wigner Theorem on quantum mechanical symmetries.</description>

      <title>General Framework for Quantifying Dissipation Pathways in Open Quantum Systems. I. Theoretical Formulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00266v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a general and practical theoretical framework to investigate how energy is dissipated in open quantum system dynamics. This is done by quantifying the contributions of individual bath components to the overall dissipation of the system. The framework is based on the Nakajima-Zwanzig projection operator technique which allows us to express the rate of energy dissipation into a specific bath degree of freedom by using traces of operator products. The approach captures system-bath interactions to all orders, but is based on second-order perturbation theory on the off-diagonal subsystem's couplings and a Markovian description of the bath. The usefulness of our theory is demonstrated by applying it to various models of open quantum systems involving harmonic oscillator or spin baths, and connecting the outcomes to existing results such as our previously reported formula derived for locally coupled harmonic bath [J. Chem. Phys. 154, 084109 (2021)]. We also prove that the dissipation calculated by our theory rigorously satisfies thermodynamic principles such as energy conservation and detailed balance. Overall, the strategy can be used to develop the theory and simulation of dissipation pathways to interpret and engineer the dynamics of open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>General Framework for Quantifying Dissipation Pathways in Open Quantum Systems. II. Numerical Validation and the Role of Non-Markovianity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00267v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the previous paper [C. W. Kim and I. Franco, J. Chem. Phys. 160, 214111 (2024)], we developed a theory called MQME-D, which allows us to decompose the overall energy dissipation process in open quantum system dynamics into contributions by individual components of the bath when the subsystem dynamics is governed by a Markovian quantum master equation (MQME). Here, we contrast the predictions of MQME-D against the numerically exact results obtained by combining hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) with a recently reported protocol for monitoring the statistics of the bath. Overall, MQME-D accurately captures the contributions of specific bath components to the overall dissipation while greatly reducing the computational cost as compared to exact computations using HEOM. The computations show that MQME-D exhibits errors originating from its inherent Markov approximation. We demonstrate that its accuracy can be significantly increased by incorporating non-Markovianity by exploiting time scale separations (TSS) in different components of the bath. Our work demonstrates that MQME-D combined with TSS can be reliably used to understanding how energy is dissipated in realistic open quantum system dynamics.</description>

      <title>The computational power of random quantum circuits in arbitrary geometries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02501v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Empirical evidence for a gap between the computational powers of classical and quantum computers has been provided by experiments that sample the output distributions of two-dimensional quantum circuits. Many attempts to close this gap have utilized classical simulations based on tensor network techniques, and their limitations shed light on the improvements to quantum hardware required to frustrate classical simulability. In particular, quantum computers having in excess of $\sim 50$ qubits are primarily vulnerable to classical simulation due to restrictions on their gate fidelity and their connectivity, the latter determining how many gates are required (and therefore how much infidelity is suffered) in generating highly-entangled states. Here, we describe recent hardware upgrades to Quantinuum's H2 quantum computer enabling it to operate on up to $56$ qubits with arbitrary connectivity and $99.843(5)\%$ two-qubit gate fidelity. Utilizing the flexible connectivity of H2, we present data from random circuit sampling in highly connected geometries, doing so at unprecedented fidelities and a scale that appears to be beyond the capabilities of state-of-the-art classical algorithms. The considerable difficulty of classically simulating H2 is likely limited only by qubit number, demonstrating the promise and scalability of the QCCD architecture as continued progress is made towards building larger machines.</description>

Abstract: Quantum speed limits are the boundaries that define how quickly one quantum state can transform into another. Instead of focusing on the transformation between pairs of states, we provide bounds on the speed limit of quantum evolution by unitary operators in arbitrary dimensions. These do not depend on the initial and final state but depend only on the trace of the unitary operator that is to be implemented and the gross characteristics (average and variance) of the energy spectrum of the Hamiltonian which generates this unitary evolution. The bounds that we find can be thought of as the generalization of the Mandelstam-Tamm (TM) and the Margolus-Levitin (ML) bound for state transformations to implementations of unitary operators. We will discuss the application of these bounds in several classes of transformations that are of interest in quantum information processing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04217v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With a variety of realisations, optomechanics utilizes its light matter interaction to test fundamental physics. By coupling the phonons of a mechanical resonator to the photons in a high quality cavity, control of increasingly macroscopic objects has become feasible. In such systems, state manipulation of the mechanical mode is achieved by driving the cavity. To be able to achieve high drive powers the system is typically designed such that it remains in a linear response regime when driven. A nonlinear response and especially bistability in a driven cavity is often considered detrimentally to cooling and state preparation in optomechanical systems and is avoided in experiments. Here we show, that with an intrinsic nonlinear cavity backaction cooling of a mechanical resonator is feasible operating deeply within the nonlinear regime of the cavity. With our theory taking the nonlinearity into account, precise predictions on backaction cooling can be achieved even with a cavity beyond the bifurcation point, where the cavity photon number spectrum starts to deviate from a typical Lorentzian shape.</description>

Abstract: A key challenge in quantum computing is speeding up measurement and initialization. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a dispersive measurement method for superconducting qubits that simultaneously measures the qubit and returns the readout resonator to its initial state. The approach is based on universal analytical pulses and requires knowledge of the qubit and resonator parameters, but needs no direct optimization of the pulse shape, even when accounting for the nonlinearity of the system. Moreover, the method generalizes to measuring an arbitrary number of modes and states. For the qubit readout, we can drive the resonator to $\sim 10^2$ photons and back to $\sim 10^{-3}$ photons in less than $3 \kappa^{-1}$, while still achieving a $T_1$-limited assignment error below 1\%. We also present universal pulse shapes and experimental results for qutrit readout.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2107.06067v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The square root of Not is a logical operator of importance in quantum computing theory and of interest as a mathematical object in its own right. In physics, it is a square complex matrix of dimension 2. In the present work it is a complex square matrix of arbitrary dimension. The introduction of linear algebra into logical theory has been enhanced in recent decades by the researches in the field of neural networks and quantum computing. Here we will make a brief description of the representation of logical operations through matrices and we show how general expressions for the two square roots of the Not operator are obtained. Then, we explore two topics. First, we study an extension to a non-quantum domain of a short form of Deutsch's algorithm. Then, we assume that a root of Not is a matrix extension of the imaginary unit i, and under this idea we obtain fully matrix versions for the Euler expansions and for the representations of circular functions by complex exponentials.</description>

      <title>Long-range entanglement from measuring symmetry-protected topological phases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2112.01519v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A fundamental distinction between many-body quantum states are those with short- and long-range entanglement (SRE and LRE). The latter cannot be created by finite-depth circuits, underscoring the nonlocal nature of Schr\"odinger cat states, topological order, and quantum criticality. Remarkably, examples are known where LRE is obtained by performing single-site measurements on SRE, such as the toric code from measuring a sublattice of a 2D cluster state. However, a systematic understanding of when and how measurements of SRE give rise to LRE is still lacking. Here, we establish that LRE appears upon performing measurements on symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases -- of which the cluster state is one example. For instance, we show how to implement the Kramers-Wannier transformation by adding a cluster SPT to an input state followed by measurement. This transformation naturally relates states with SRE and LRE. An application is the realization of double-semion order when the input state is the $\mathbb Z_2$ Levin-Gu SPT. Similarly, the addition of fermionic SPTs and measurement leads to an implementation of the Jordan-Wigner transformation of a general state. More generally, we argue that a large class of SPT phases protected by $G \times H$ symmetry gives rise to anomalous LRE upon measuring $G$-charges, and we prove that this persists for generic points in the SPT phase under certain conditions. Our work introduces a new practical tool for using SPT phases as resources for creating LRE, and uncovers the classification result that all states related by sequentially gauging Abelian groups or by Jordan-Wigner transformation are in the same equivalence class, once we augment finite-depth circuits with single-site measurements. In particular, any topological or fracton order with a solvable finite gauge group can be obtained from a product state in this way.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.04276v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work presents a computational analysis of a superconducting transmon qubit design, in which the superconductor-insulator-superconductor (SIS) Josephson junction is replaced by a co-planar, superconductor-constriction-superconductor (ScS) nanobridge junction. Within the scope of Ginzburg-Landau theory, we find that the nanobridge ScS transmon has an improved charge dispersion compared to the SIS transmon, with a tradeoff of smaller anharmonicity. These calculations provide a framework for estimating the superconductor material properties and junction dimensions compatible with gigahertz frequency ScS transmon operation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.14986v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the present paper, Kato's distributional inequality with magnetic field is generalized to vector-valued functions and operator-valued vector potentials. This result is then used in non-relativistic quantum electrodynamics (QED) to show that eigenstates of the Pauli-Fierz Hamiltonian satisfy a subsolution estimate, and hence that any $L^2$-exponential bound in terms of a Lipschitz function implies the corresponding pointwise exponential bound. Similar pointwise bounds are also established for the one-particle density of states that are not eigenstates.</description>

Abstract: Linear algebraic primitives are at the core of many modern algorithms in engineering, science, and machine learning. Hence, accelerating these primitives with novel computing hardware would have tremendous economic impact. Quantum computing has been proposed for this purpose, although the resource requirements are far beyond current technological capabilities, so this approach remains long-term in timescale. Here we consider an alternative physics-based computing paradigm based on classical thermodynamics, to provide a near-term approach to accelerating linear algebra.
  At first sight, thermodynamics and linear algebra seem to be unrelated fields. In this work, we connect solving linear algebra problems to sampling from the thermodynamic equilibrium distribution of a system of coupled harmonic oscillators. We present simple thermodynamic algorithms for (1) solving linear systems of equations, (2) computing matrix inverses, (3) computing matrix determinants, and (4) solving Lyapunov equations. Under reasonable assumptions, we rigorously establish asymptotic speedups for our algorithms, relative to digital methods, that scale linearly in matrix dimension. Our algorithms exploit thermodynamic principles like ergodicity, entropy, and equilibration, highlighting the deep connection between these two seemingly distinct fields, and opening up algebraic applications for thermodynamic computing hardware.</description>

      <title>Relevant long-range interaction of the entanglement Hamiltonian emerges from a short-range gapped system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16089v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Beyond the Li-Haldane-Poilblanc conjecture, we find the entanglement Hamiltonian (EH) is actually not closely similar to the original Hamiltonian on the virtual edge. Unexpectedly, the EH has some relevant long-range interacting terms which hugely affect the physics. Without loss of generality, we study a spin-1/2 Heisenberg bilayer to obtain the entanglement information between the two layers through our newly developed quantum Monte Carlo scheme, which can simulate large-scale EH. Although the entanglement spectrum carrying the Goldstone mode seems like a Heisenberg model on a single layer, which is consistent with Li-Haldane-Poilblanc conjecture, we demonstrate that there actually exists a finite-temperature phase transition of the EH. The results violate the Mermin-Wagner theorem, which means there should be relevant long-range terms in the EH. It reveals that the Li-Haldane-Poilblanc conjecture ignores necessary corrections for the EH which may lead totally different physics.</description>

      <title>Unveiling UV/IR Mixing via Symmetry Defects: A View from Topological Entanglement Entropy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.09425v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Some topological lattice models in two spatial dimensions exhibit intricate lattice size dependence in their ground state degeneracy (GSD). This and other features such as the position-dependent anyonic excitations are manifestations of UV/IR mixing. In the first part of the paper we exactly calculate the topological entanglement entropy (TEE) of one such model, the rank-2 toric code, after identifying the minimum entropy states for a non-contractible boundary around the torus. The resulting TEE, as with the GSD, shows intricate dependence on the lattice size. In the latter part of the paper we focus on the fact that the rank-2 toric code is an example of a translation symmetry-enriched topological phase, and show that viewing distinct lattice size as a consequence of different translation symmetry defects can explain both our TEE results and the GSD of the rank-2 toric code. Our work establishes the translation symmetry defect framework as a robust description of the UV/IR mixing in topological lattice models.</description>

Abstract: This essay offers a meta-level analysis in the sociology and history of physics in the context of the so-called "Arrow of Time Problem" or "Two Times Problem," which asserts that the empirically observed directionality of time is in conflict with physical theory. I argue that there is actually no necessary conflict between physics and the arrow of time, and that the observed directionality of time is perfectly consistent with physics unconstrained by certain optional metaphysical, epistemological and methodological beliefs and practices characterizing the conventional or Received View.</description>

      <title>Absence of a dissipative quantum phase transition in Josephson junctions: Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14754v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the resistively shunted Josephson junction (RSJ), using the stochastic Liouville equation method in imaginary time - an exact scheme based on the Feynman-Vernon influence functional. The formulation we use makes it clear that Schmid's superconducting - insulating quantum phase transition long believed to occur in the RSJ is forbidden already at the qualitative level. This confirms theoretically a similar conclusion based on experimental observations drawn in 2020 by Murani et al. For all parameters investigated, we find that shunting a junction makes it more superconducting. We reveal that the UV cutoff of the resistor plays an unforeseen key role in these systems, and show that the erroneous prediction of an insulating state resulted from ill-assuming it would not.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05163v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Photonics offers unique capabilities for quantum information processing (QIP) such as room-temperature operation, the scalability of nanophotonics, and access to ultrabroad bandwidths and consequently ultrafast operation. Ultrashort-pulse sources of quantum states in nanophotonics are an important building block for achieving scalable ultrafast QIP, however, their demonstrations so far have been sparse. Here, we demonstrate a femtosecond biphoton source in dispersion-engineered periodically poled lithium niobate nanophotonics. We measure 17 THz of bandwidth for the source centered at 2.09 \textmu m, corresponding to a few optical cycles, with a brightness of 8.8 GHz/mW. Our results open new paths towards realization of ultrafast nanophotonic QIP.</description>

      <title>Quantum robustness of the toric code in a parallel field on the honeycomb and triangular lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15389v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum robustness of the topological order in the toric code on the honeycomb lattice in the presence of a uniform parallel field. For a field in $z$-direction, the low-energy physics is in the flux-free sector and can be mapped to the transverse-field Ising model on the honeycomb lattice. One finds a second-order quantum phase transition in the 3D Ising$^\star$ universality class for both signs of the field. The same is true for a postive field in $x$-direction where an analogue mapping in the charge-free sector yields a ferromagnetic transverse-field Ising model on the triangular lattice and the phase transition is still 3D Ising$^\star$. In contrast, for negative $x$-field, the charge-free sector is mapped to the highly frustrated antiferromagnetic transverse-field Ising model on the triangular lattice which is known to host a quantum phase transition in the 3D XY$^\star$ universality class. Further, the charge-free sector does not always contain the low-energy physics for negative $x$-fields and a first-order phase transition to the polarized phase in the charge-full sector takes place at larger negative field values. We quantify the location of this transition by comparing quantum Monte Carlo simulations and high-field series expansions. The full extension of the topological phase in the presence of $x$- and $z$-fields is determined by perturbative linked-cluster expansions using a full graph decomposition. Extrapolating the high-order series of the charge and the flux gap allows to estimate critical exponents of the gap closing. This analysis indicates that the topological order breaks down by critical lines of 3D Ising$^\star$ and 3D XY$^\star$ type with interesting potential multi-critical crossing points. All findings for the toric code on the honeycomb lattice can be transferred exactly to the toric code on the triangular lattice.</description>

      <title>Anisotropy-Induced Spin Parity Effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.19311v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spin parity effects refer to those special situations where a dichotomy in the physical behavior of a system arises, solely depending on whether the relevant spin quantum number is integral or half-odd integral. As is the case with the Haldane conjecture in antiferromagnetic spin chains, their pursuit often derives deep insights and invokes new developments in quantum condensed matter physics. Here we put forth a simple and general scheme for generating such effects in any spatial dimension through the use of anisotropic interactions, and a setup within reasonable reach of state-of-the-art cold-atom implementations. We demonstrate its utility through a detailed analysis of the magnetization behavior of a specific one-dimensional spin chain model -- an anisotropic antiferromagnet in a transverse magnetic field, unraveling along the way the quantum origin of finite-size effects observed in the magnetization curve that had previously been noted but not clearly understood.</description>

      <title>Dual Symmetry Classification of Non-Hermitian Systems and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Point-Gap Topology of a Non-Unitary Quantum Walk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04147v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems exhibit richer topological properties compared to their Hermitian counterparts. It is well known that non-Hermitian systems have been classified based on either the symmetry relations for non-Hermitian Hamiltonians or the symmetry relations for non-unitary time-evolution operators in the context of Floquet topological phases. In this work, we propose that non-Hermitian systems can always be classified in two ways; a non-Hermitian system can be classified using the symmetry relations for non-Hermitian Hamiltonians or time-evolution operator regardless of the Floquet topological phases or not. We refer to this as dual symmetry classification. To demonstrate this, we successfully introduce a new non-unitary quantum walk that exhibits point gaps with a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ point-gap topological phase applying the dual symmetry classification and treating the time-evolution operator of this quantum walk as the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10018v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For quantum many-body systems in one dimension, computational complexity theory reveals that the evaluation of ground-state energy remains elusive on quantum computers, contrasting the existence of a classical algorithm for temperatures higher than the inverse logarithm of the system size. This highlights a qualitative difference between low- and high-temperature states in terms of computational complexity. Here, we describe finite-temperature states using the matrix product state formalism. Within the framework of random samplings, we derive an analytical formula for the required number of samples, which provides both quantitative and qualitative measures of computational complexity. At high and low temperatures, its scaling behavior with system size is linear and quadratic, respectively, demonstrating a distinct crossover between these numerically difficult regimes of quantitative difference.</description>

      <title>New method for the solution of the two-body Dirac equation for the positronium bound states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00444v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new theoretical method is developed to solve the two-body bound-state Dirac equation for positronium. Only Coulomb potential was included in the Dirac Hamiltonian. It is shown that the two-body Dirac Hamiltonian can be written in the Hermitian matrix form of the 4$\times$4 size and diagonalized in the momentum-state representation. Numerical results for the energy spectrum of the para- and ortho-positronium ground states performed within the variational method using the harmonic oscillator basis functions are in good agreement with a high-precision finite-element method of T.C. Scott et al. After the Fourier transformation into the coordinate-state representation the bound state wave functions of the para-Ps and ortho-Ps do not contain any singularity at the origin in contrast to the method mentioned above. The weights of the large-small and small-large components of the ground state wave functions are estimated to be of order 10$^{-6}$, while the weight of the small-small component is of order 10$^{-12}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07056v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum dynamics of the isotropic Universe in the presence of a free massless scalar field, playing the role of a physical clock. The Hilbert space is constructed via a direct analogy between the Wheeler-DeWitt equation in the minisuperspace and a relativistic scalar one in physical space. In particular, we show how the introduction of a "turning point" in the Universe evolution allows to overcome an intrinsic ambiguity in representing the expanding and collapsing Universe. In this way, the positive and negative frequencies are simply identified with time reversed states. The main subject of the present analysis is the construction of a horizon operator, whose quantum behavior is investigated when Polymer Quantum Mechanics is implemented to describe the asymptotic evolution near the initial singularity. The reason of this choice is motivated by the intrinsic spreading of localized wavepackets when the polymer dispersion relation governs the quantum dynamics. The evidence that the mean value of the quantum horizon operator follows its semiclassical behavior (corrected for polymerization) is a clear indication that a concept of causality can be restored also in the quantum cosmological picture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14237v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we construct CFT states dual to local excitations in the three-dimensional de Sitter space (dS), called the bulk local states. We find that the conjugation operation in dS$_3/$CFT$_2$ is notably different from that in AdS$_3/$CFT$_2$. This requires us to combine two bulk local states constructed out of different primary states in a CPT-invariant way. This analysis explains why Green's functions in the dS Euclidean vacuum cannot simply be obtained from the Wick rotation of those in AdS. We also argue that this characteristic feature explains the emergence of time coordinate from the dual Euclidean CFT. We show that the information metric for the quantum estimation of bulk coordinate values replicates the de Sitter space metric.</description>

Abstract: Effective Lagrangian of itinerant electron system of finite density at finite magnetic field is found to include Chern-Simons term of electromagnetic potentials of lower scale dimension than those studied before. This term has an origin in many-body wave function and unique topological property that is independent of a spin degree of freedom. The coupling strength is proportional to $\frac{\rho}{eB}$, which is singular at $B=0$ for a constant charge density. The effective Lagrangian at a finite $B$ represents physical effects at $ B \neq 0$ properly. A universal shift of the magnetic field known as Slater-Pauling curve is derived from the effective Lagrangian.</description>
