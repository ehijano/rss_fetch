      <title>Does the Fundamental Metallicity Relation Evolve with Redshift? II: The Evolution in Normalisation of the Mass-Metallicity Relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The metal content of galaxies is a direct probe of the baryon cycle. A hallmark example is the relationship between a galaxy's stellar mass, star formation rate (SFR), and gas-phase metallicity: the Fundamental Metallicity Relation (FMR). While low-redshift ($z\lesssim4$) observational studies suggest that the FMR is redshift-invariant, recent JWST data indicate deviations from this model. In this study, we utilize the FMR to predict the evolution of the normalisation of the mass-metallicity relation (MZR) using the cosmological simulations Illustris, IllustrisTNG, EAGLE, and SIMBA. Our findings demonstrate that a $z = 0$ calibrated FMR struggles to predict the evolution in the MZR of each simulation. To quantify the divergence of the predictions, we introduce the concepts of a ''static'' FMR, where the role of the SFR in setting the normalization of the MZR does not change with redshift, and a ''dynamic'' FMR, where the role of SFR evolves over time. We find static FMRs in Illustris and SIMBA and dynamic FMRs in IllustrisTNG and EAGLE. We suggest that the differences between these models likely points to the subtle differences in the implementation of the baryon cycle. Moreover, we echo recent JWST results at $z &gt; 4$ by finding significant offsets from the FMR in IllustrisTNG and EAGLE, suggesting that the observed FMR may be dynamic as well. Overall, our findings imply that the current FMR framework neglects important variations in the baryon cycle through cosmic time.</description>

      <title>Linking high-z and low-z: Are We Observing the Progenitors of the Milky Way with JWST?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent JWST observation of the Firefly Sparkle at $z=8.3$ offers a unique opportunity to link the high- and the low-$z$ Universe. Indeed, the claim of it being a Milky Way (MW) type of assembly at the cosmic dawn opens the possibility of interpreting the observation with locally calibrated galaxy-formation models. Here, we use the MW-evolution model NEFERTITI to perform forward modeling of our Galaxy's progenitors at high-$z$. We build a set of mock spectra for the MW building blocks to make predictions for JWST and to interpret the Firefly Sparkle observation. First, we find that the most massive MW progenitor becomes detectable in a deep survey like JADES from $z\approx 8.2$, meaning that we could have already observed MW-analogs that still need interpretation. Second, we provide predictions for the number of detectable MW progenitors in lensed surveys like CANUCS, and interpret the Firefly Sparkle as a group of MW building blocks. Both the number of detections and the observed NIRCam photometry are consistent with our predictions. By identifying the MW progenitors whose mock photometry best fits the data, we find bursty and extended star-formation histories, lasting $&gt; 150-300$~Myr, and estimate their properties: $M_h \approx 10^{8-9} \, M_{\odot}$, $ M_\star \approx 10^{6.2-7.5}\, M_{\odot}$, $ SFR \approx 0.04-0.20 \, M_{\odot} yr^{-1}$ and $ Z_{gas} \approx 0.04 - 0.24 \, Z_{\odot}$. Uncovering the properties of MW-analogs at cosmic dawn by combining JWST observations and locally-constrained models, will allow us to understand our Galaxy's formation, linking the high- and low-$z$ perspectives.</description>

      <title>The ALMA-ALPAKA survey II. Evolution of turbulence in galaxy disks across cosmic time: difference between cold and warm gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gas in the interstellar medium (ISM) of galaxies is supersonically turbulent. Measurements of turbulence typically rely on cold gas emission lines for low-z galaxies and warm ionized gas observations for z&gt;0 galaxies. Studies of warm gas kinematics at z&gt;0 conclude that the turbulence strongly evolves as a function of redshift, due to the increasing impact of gas accretion and mergers in the early Universe. However, recent findings suggest potential biases in turbulence measurements derived from ionized gas at high-z, impacting our understanding of turbulence origin, ISM physics and disk formation. We investigate the evolution of turbulence using velocity dispersion ($\sigma$) measurements from cold gas tracers (i.e., CO, [CI], [CII]) derived from a sample of 57 galaxy disks spanning the redshift range z=0-5. This sample consists of main-sequence and starburst galaxies with stellar masses $\gtrsim 10^{10} M_{\odot}$. The comparison with current H$\alpha$ kinematic observations and existing models demonstrates that the velocity dispersion inferred from cold gas tracers differ by a factor of $\approx 3$ from those obtained using emission lines tracing warm gas. We show that stellar feedback is the main driver of turbulence measured from cold gas tracers. This is fundamentally different from the conclusions of studies based on warm gas, which had to consider additional turbulence drivers to explain the high values of $\sigma$. We present a model predicting the redshift evolution of turbulence in galaxy disks, attributing the increase of $\sigma$ with redshift to the higher energy injected by supernovae due to the elevated star-formation rate in high-z galaxies. This supernova-driven model suggests that turbulence is lower in galaxies with lower stellar mass compared to those with higher stellar mass. Additionally, it forecasts the evolution of $\sigma$ in Milky-Way like progenitors.</description>

      <title>Connecting the radio AGN life cycle to feedback: Ionised gas is more disturbed in young radio AGN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the host galaxies of radio AGN, kinematically disturbed gas due to jet-driven feedback is a widely observed phenomenon. Simulations predict that the impact of jets on the surrounding gas changes as they grow. Useful insights into this phenomenon can be obtained by characterising radio AGN into different evolutionary stages and studying their impact on gas kinematics. We present a systematic study of the [OIII] gas kinematics for a sample of 5720 radio AGN up to $z\sim0.8$ with a large 1.4 GHz luminosity range of $\approx10^{22.5}-10^{28}$W/Hz, and 1693 [OIII] detections. Taking advantage of the wide frequency coverage of LOFAR and VLA surveys from $144-3000$MHz, we determine the radio spectral shapes, using them to characterise sources into different stages of the radio AGN life cycle. We determine the [OIII] kinematics from SDSS spectra and link it to the life cycle. Our main conclusion is that the [OIII] gas is $\sim$3 times more likely to be disturbed in the peaked spectrum (PS) sources (that represent a young phase of activity) than non-peaked spectrum (NPS) sources (that represent more evolved sources) at $z&lt;0.4$. This changes to a factor of $\sim$2 at $z&gt;0.4$. This shows that on average, the strong impact of jets is limited to the initial stages of the radio AGN life cycle. At later stages, the impact on gas is more gentle. We also determine the dependence of this trend on 1.4GHz and [OIII] luminosities and find that the difference between the two groups increases with 1.4GHz luminosity. Young radio AGN with $L_\mathrm{1.4GHz}&gt;10^{25}$W/Hz have the most extreme impact on [OIII]. Using a stacking analysis, we are further able to trace the changing impact on [OIII] in the high-frequency peaked spectrum (i.e. youngest), low-frequency peaked spectrum ("less young"), and non-peaked spectrum (evolved) radio AGN.</description>

      <title>Intertwined Formation of $\rm{H_2}$, Dust, and Stars in Cosmological Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: Molecular hydrogen ($\rm{H_2}$) is crucial in galaxy formation and evolution, serving as the main fuel for star formation (SF). In metal-enriched environments, $\rm{H_2}$ primarily forms on interstellar dust grain surfaces. However, due to the complexities of modelling this process, SF in cosmological simulations often relies on empirical or theoretical frameworks validated only in the Local Universe to estimate the abundance of $\rm{H_2}$.
  Aims: This study aims to model the connection between star, dust, and $\rm{H_2}$ formation processes in cosmological simulations.
  Methods: We include $\rm{H_2}$ formation on dust grain surfaces and account for molecule destruction and radiation shielding into the SF and feedback model MUPPI.
  Results: The model reproduces key properties of observed galaxies for stellar, dust, and $\rm{H_2}$ components. The cosmic density of $\rm{H_2}$ ($\rho_{\rm{H2}}$) peaks around $z=1.5$, then decreases by half towards $z=0$, showing milder evolution than observed. The $\rm{H_2}$ mass function since $z=2$ also shows gentler evolution. Our model successfully recovers the integrated molecular Kennicutt-Schmidt (mKS) law between surface star formation rate ($\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$) and surface $\rm{H_2}$ density ($\Sigma_{\rm H2}$) at $z=0$, already evident at $z=2$ with a higher normalization. We find hints of a broken power law with a steeper slope at higher $\Sigma_{\rm H2}$, aligning with some observational findings. Additionally, the $\rm{H_2}$-to-dust mass ratio in galaxies shows a decreasing trend with gas metallicity and stellar mass. The $\rm{H_2}$-to-dust mass fraction for the global galaxy population is higher at higher redshifts. The analysis of the atomic-to-molecular transition on a particle-by-particle basis suggests that gas metallicity cannot reliably substitute the dust-to-gas ratio in models simulating dust-promoted $\rm{H_2}$.</description>

      <title>New Synoptic Observations of the Cosmic Optical Background with New Horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtained New Horizons LORRI images to measure the cosmic optical background (COB) intensity integrated over $0.4\lesssim\lambda\lesssim0.9{~\rm\mu m}.$ The survey comprises 16 high Galactic-latitude fields selected to minimize scattered diffuse Galactic light (DGL) from the Milky Way galaxy, as well as scattered light from bright stars. This work supersedes an earlier analysis based on observations of one of the present fields. Isolating the COB contribution to the raw total sky levels measured in the fields requires subtracting the remaining scattered light from bright stars and galaxies, intensity from faint stars within the fields fainter than the photometric detection-limit, and the DGL foreground. DGL is estimated from Planck HFI $350 {~\rm\mu m}$ and $550 {~\rm\mu m}$ intensities, using a new self-calibrated indicator based on the 16 fields augmented with eight additional DGL calibration fields obtained as part of the survey. The survey yields a highly significant detection ($6.8\sigma$) of the COB at ${\rm 11.16\pm 1.65~(1.47~sys,~0.75~ran) ~nW ~m^{-2} ~sr^{-1}}$ at the LORRI pivot wavelength of 0.608 $\mu$m. The estimated integrated intensity from background galaxies, ${\rm 8.17\pm 1.18 ~nW ~m^{-2} ~sr^{-1}},$ can account for the great majority of this signal. The rest of the COB signal, ${\rm 2.99\pm2.03~ (1.75~sys,~1.03~ran) ~nW ~m^{-2} ~sr^{-1}},$ is formally classified as anomalous intensity but is not significantly different from zero. The simplest interpretation is that the COB is completely due to galaxies.</description>

      <title>Probing populations of dark stellar remnants in the globular clusters 47 Tuc and Terzan 5 using pulsar timing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new method to combine multimass equilibrium dynamical models and pulsar timing data to constrain the mass distribution and remnant populations of Milky Way globular clusters (GCs). We first apply this method to 47 Tuc, a cluster for which there exists an abundance of stellar kinematic data and which is also host to a large population of millisecond pulsars. We demonstrate that the pulsar timing data allow us to place strong constraints on the overall mass distribution and remnant populations even without fitting on stellar kinematics. Our models favor a small population of stellar-mass BHs in this cluster (with a total mass of $412^{+77}_{-146} \mathrm{M_\odot}$), arguing against the need for a large ($ &gt; 2000 \ \mathrm{M_\odot}$) central intermediate-mass black hole. We then apply the method to Terzan 5, a heavily obscured bulge cluster which hosts the largest population of millisecond pulsars of any Milky Way GC and for which the collection of conventional stellar kinematic data is very limited. We improve existing constraints on the mass distribution and structural parameters of this cluster and place stringent constraints on its black hole content, finding an upper limit on the mass in BHs of $\sim 4500 \ \mathrm{M_\odot}$. This method allows us to probe the central dynamics of GCs even in the absence of stellar kinematic data and can be easily applied to other GCs with pulsar timing data, for which datasets will continue to grow with the next generation of radio telescopes.</description>

      <title>DESI Early Data Release Milky Way Survey Value-Added Catalogue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the stellar value-added catalogue based on the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Early Data Release. The catalogue contains radial velocity and stellar parameter measurements for $\simeq$ 400,000 unique stars observed during commissioning and survey validation by DESI. These observations were made under conditions similar to the Milky Way Survey (MWS) currently carried out by DESI but also include multiple specially targeted fields, such as those containing well-studied dwarf galaxies and stellar streams. The majority of observed stars have $16&lt;r&lt;20$ with a median signal-to-noise ratio in the spectra of $\sim$ 20. In the paper, we describe the structure of the catalogue, give an overview of different target classes observed, as well as provide recipes for selecting clean stellar samples. We validate the catalogue using external high-resolution measurements and show that radial velocities, surface gravities, and iron abundances determined by DESI are accurate to 1 km/s, $0.3$ dex and $\sim$ 0.15 dex respectively. We also demonstrate possible uses of the catalogue for chemo-dynamical studies of the Milky Way stellar halo and Draco dwarf spheroidal. The value-added catalogue described in this paper is the very first DESI MWS catalogue. The next DESI data release, expected in less than a year, will add the data from the first year of DESI survey operations and will contain approximately 4 million stars, along with significant processing improvements.</description>

      <title>Reconciling M/L Ratios Across Cosmic Time: a Concordance IMF for Massive Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stellar initial mass function (IMF) is thought to be bottom-heavy in the cores of the most massive galaxies, with an excess of low mass stars compared to the Milky Way. However, studies of the kinematics of quiescent galaxies at 2&lt;z&lt;5 find M/L ratios that are better explained with lighter IMFs. Light IMFs have also been proposed for the unexpected populations of luminous galaxies that JWST has uncovered at z&gt;7, to reduce tensions with galaxy formation models. Here we explore IMFs that are simultaneously bottom-heavy, with a steep slope at low stellar masses, and top-heavy, with a shallow slope at high masses. We derive a form of the IMF for massive galaxies that is consistent with measurements in the local universe and yet produces relatively low M/L ratios at high redshift. This `concordance' IMF has slopes $\gamma_1=2.40\pm0.09$, $\gamma_2=2.00\pm0.14$, and $\gamma_3=1.85\pm0.11$ in the regimes 0.1-0.5 Msun, 0.5-1 Msun, and &gt;1 Msun respectively. The IMF parameter $\alpha$, the mass excess compared to a Milky Way IMF, ranges from $\log(\alpha)\approx+0.3$ for present-day galaxies to $\log(\alpha)\approx-0.1$ for their star forming progenitors. The concordance IMF applies only to the central regions of the most massive galaxies, with velocity dispersions ~300 km/s, and their progenitors. However, it can be generalized using a previously-measured relation between $\alpha$ and $\sigma$. We arrive at the following modification to the Kroupa (2001) IMF for galaxies with $\sigma\gtrsim 160$ km/s: $\gamma_1\approx1.3+4.3\log\sigma_{160}$; $\gamma_2\approx2.3-1.2\log\sigma_{160}$; and $\gamma_3\approx2.3-1.7\log\sigma_{160}$, with $\sigma_{160}=\sigma/160$ km/s. If galaxies grow primarily inside-out, so that velocity dispersions are relatively stable, these relations should also hold at high redshift.</description>

      <title>A massive, neutral gas reservoir permeating a galaxy proto-cluster after the reionization era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy clusters are the most massive, gravitationally-bound structures in the Universe, emerging through hierarchical structure formation of large-scale dark matter and baryon overdensities. Early galaxy ``proto-clusters'' are believed to be important physical drivers of the overall cosmic star-formation rate density and serve as ``hotspots'' for the reionization of the intergalactic medium. Our understanding of the formation of these structures at the earliest cosmic epochs is, however, limited to sparse observations of their galaxy members, or based on phenomenological models and cosmological simulations. Here we report the detection of a massive neutral, atomic hydrogen (HI) gas reservoir permeating a galaxy proto-cluster at redshift $z=5.4$, observed one billion years after the Big Bang. The presence of this cold gas is revealed by strong damped Lyman-$\alpha$ absorption features observed in several background galaxy spectra taken with JWST/NIRSpec in close on-sky projection. While overall the sightlines probe a large range in HI column densities, $N_{\rm HI} = 10^{21.7}-10^{23.5}$ cm$^{-2}$, they are similar across nearby sightlines, demonstrating that they probe the same dense, neutral gas. This observation of a massive, large-scale overdensity of cold neutral gas challenges current large-scale cosmological simulations and has strong implications for the reionization topology of the Universe.</description>

      <title>GD-1 Stellar Stream and Cocoon in the DESI Early Data Release</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present ~ 126 new spectroscopically identified members of the GD-1 tidal stream obtained with the 5000-fiber Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). We confirm the existence of a ``cocoon'' which is broad (FWHM~2.932deg~460pc) and kinematically hot (velocity dispersion, sigma~5-8km/s) component that surrounds a narrower (FWHM~0.353deg~55pc) and colder (sigma~ 2.2-2.6km/s) thin stream component (based on a median per star velocity precision of 2.7km/s). The cocoon extends over at least a ~ 20deg segment of the stream observed by DESI. The thin and cocoon components have similar mean values of [Fe/H]: -2.54+/- 0.04dex and -2.45+/-0.06dex suggestive of a common origin. The data are consistent with the following scenarios for the origin of the cocoon. The progenitor of the GD-1 stream was an accreted globular cluster (GC) and: (a) the cocoon was produced by pre-accretion tidal stripping of the GC while it was still inside its parent dwarf galaxy; (b) the cocoon is debris from the parent dwarf galaxy; (c) an initially thin GC tidal stream was heated by impacts from dark subhalos in the Milky Way; (d) an initially thin GC stream was heated by a massive Sagittarius dwarf galaxy; or a combination of some these. In the first two cases the velocity dispersion and mean metallicity are consistent with the parent dwarf galaxy having a halo mass of ~0^9\msun. Future DESI spectroscopy and detailed modeling may enable us to distinguish between these possible origins.</description>

      <title>Comment on 'a slightly oblate dark matter halo revealed by a retrograde precessing Galactic disk warp' by Huang et al</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Huang et al. (2024) measured the derivative of the phase $\phi_{\mathrm{w}}$ of the Galactic warp traced by classical Cepheids with respect to their age $\tau$ and interpreted it as the warp precession rate $\omega\equiv\mathrm{d}\phi_{\mathrm{w}}/\mathrm{d}t=-\mathrm{d}\phi_{\mathrm{w}}/\mathrm{d}\tau$. This interpretation is unfounded: young stars follow trajectories close to those of their parental gas and trace the instantaneous gas warp, not its shape at their time of birth: $\phi_{\mathrm{w}}$ should hardly depend on Cepheid age. We show that the measured $\mathrm{d}\phi_{\mathrm{w}}/\mathrm{d}\tau&gt;0$ is consistent with an omitted-variable bias from neglecting the natural twist $\mathrm{d}\phi_{\mathrm{w}}/\mathrm{d}R$ of the warp and the $R$-$\tau$ correlation for Cepheids (originating from the Galactic metallicity gradient and the Cepheid metallicity-age correlation).</description>

      <title>The Most Sensitive Radio Recombination Line Measurements Ever Made of the Galactic Warm Ionized Medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffuse ionized gas pervades the disk of the Milky Way. We detect extremely faint emission from this Galactic Warm Ionized Medium (WIM) using the Green Bank Telescope to make radio recombination line (RRL) observations toward two Milky Way sight lines: G20, $(\ell,{\it b}) = (20^\circ, 0^\circ)$, and G45, $(\ell,{\it b}) = (45^\circ, 0^\circ)$. We stack 18 consecutive Hn$\alpha$ transitions between 4.3-7.1 GHz to derive ${\rm \langle Hn\alpha \rangle}$ spectra that are sensitive to RRL emission from plasmas with emission measures EM &gt;10 ${\rm \,cm^{-6}\,pc}$. Each sight line has two Gaussian shaped spectral components with emission measures that range between $\sim$100 and $\sim$300 ${\rm \,cm^{-6}\,pc}$. Because there is no detectable RRL emission at negative LSR velocities the emitting plasma must be located interior to the Solar orbit. The G20 and G45 emission measures imply RMS densities of 0.15 and 0.18$\,{\rm cm^{-3}}$, respectively, if these sight lines are filled with homogeneous plasma. The observed ${\rm \langle Hn\beta \rangle}$/${\rm \langle Hn\alpha\rangle}$ line ratios are consistent with LTE excitation for the strongest components. The high velocity component of G20 has a narrow line width, 13.5 km s$^{-1}$, that sets an upper limit of &lt;4,000 K for the plasma electron temperature. This is inconsistent with the ansatz of a canonically pervasive, low density, $\sim$ 10,000 K WIM plasma.</description>

      <title>One Small Step for $Roman$; One Giant Leap for Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $Roman$ microlensing program can detect and fully characterize black holes (BHs) that are in orbit with about 30 million solar-type and evolved stars with periods up to the mission lifetime $P&lt;T=5$ yr, and semi-major axes $a&gt;0.2$au, i.e., $P&gt; 10$ d $(M/M_\odot)^{-1/2}$, where $M$ is the BH mass. For BH companions of about 150 million later (fainter) main-sequence stars, the threshold of detection is $a&gt;0.2$ au $\times 10^{(H_{\rm Vega}-18.5)/5}$. The present $Roman$ scheduling creates a "blind spot" near periods of $P=3.5$ yr due to a 2.3-year gap in the data. It also compromises the characterization of BHs in eccentric orbits with periods $P&gt;3$ yr and peribothra within a year of the mission midpoint. I show that one can greatly ameliorate these issues by making a small adjustment to the $Roman$ observing schedule. The present schedule aims to optimize proper-motion measurements, but the adjustment proposed here would degrade these by only 4%-9%. For many cases of $P&gt;90$ d BHs, there will be discrete and/or continuous degeneracies. For G-dwarf and evolved sources, it will be straightforward to resolve these by radial-velocity (RV) follow-up observations, but such observations will be more taxing for fainter sources. Many BH-binaries in orbits of 5 yr $&lt;P&lt;10$ yr will be reliably identified as such from the $Roman$ data, but will lack precise orbits. Nevertheless, the full orbital solutions can be recovered by combining $Roman$ astrometry with RV followup observations. BH binaries with periods 10 yr $&lt;P&lt;$ 95 yr $(M/10 M_\odot)^{1/4}$ can be detected from their astrometric acceleration, but massive multi-fiber RV monitoring would be needed to distinguish them from the astrophysical background due to stellar binaries.</description>

      <title>Multi-Object Spectroscopy of Galaxy Clusters at $z \sim 0.95$ in Ultra Deep Survey Field with Different Star-formation Properties and Large-scale Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While galaxy clusters are dominated by quiescent galaxies at local, they show a wide range in quiescent galaxy fraction (QF) at higher redshifts. Here, we present the discovery of two galaxy clusters at $z \sim 0.95$ with contrasting QFs despite having similar masses (log ($M_{200}/M_{\odot}$)$ \sim 14$) and spectra and redshifts of 29 galaxies in these clusters and 76 galaxies in the surrounding area. The clusters are found in the Ultra Deep Survey (UDS) field and confirmed through multi-object spectroscopic (MOS) observation using the Inamori Magellan Areal Camera and Spectrograph (IMACS) on the Magellan telescope. The two clusters exhibit QFs of $0.094^{+0.11}_{-0.032}$ and $0.38^{+0.14}_{-0.11}$, respectively. Analysis of large-scale structures (LSSs) surrounding these clusters finds that properties of these clusters are consistent with the anti-correlation trend between the QF and the extent of surrounding LSS, found in Lee et al. (2019), which can be interpreted as a result from the replenishment of young, star-forming galaxies keeps the QF low when galaxy clusters are accompanied by rich surrounding environments.</description>

      <title>Comparison of Models for the Warm-Hot Circumgalactic Medium around Milky Way-like Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A systematic comparison of the models of the circumgalactic medium (CGM) and their observables is crucial to understanding the predictive power of the models and constraining physical processes that affect the thermodynamics of CGM. This paper compares four analytic CGM models: precipitation, isentropic, cooling flow, and baryon pasting models for the hot, volume-filling CGM phase, all assuming hydrostatic or quasi-hydrostatic equilibrium. We show that for fiducial parameters of the CGM of a Milky-Way (MW) like galaxy ($\rm M_{vir} \sim 10^{12}~M_{\odot}$ at $z\sim 0$), the thermodynamic profiles -- entropy, density, temperature, and pressure -- show most significant differences between different models at small ($r\lesssim 30$ kpc) and large scales ($r\gtrsim 100$ kpc) while converging at intermediate scales. The slope of the entropy profile, which is one of the most important differentiators between models, is $\approx 0.8$ for the precipitation and cooling flow models, while it is $\approx0.6$ and 0 for the baryon pasting and isentropic models, respectively. We make predictions for various observational quantities for an MW mass halo for the different models, including the projected Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) effect, soft X-ray emission (0.5--2 keV), dispersion measure, and column densities of oxygen ions (OVI, OVII, and OVIII) observable in absorption.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ice mantles play a crucial role in shaping the astrochemical inventory of molecules during star and planet formation. Small-scale molecular processes have a profound impact on large-scale astronomical evolution. The areas of solid-state laboratory astrophysics and computational chemistry study these processes. We review the laboratory effort on ice spectroscopy; methodological advances and challenges; and laboratory and computational studies of ice physics and ice chemistry. The latter we put in context with the ice evolution from clouds to disks. Three takeaway messages from this review are
  - Laboratory and computational studies allow interpretation of astronomical ice spectra in terms of identification, ice morphology and, local environmental conditions as well as the formation of the involved chemical compounds.
  - A detailed understanding of the underlying processes is needed to build reliable astrochemical models to make predictions on the abundances in space.
  - The relative importance of the different ice processes studied in the laboratory and computationally changes along the process of star and planet formation.</description>

      <title>Spectro-polarimetric view of the gamma-ray emitting NLS1 1H0323+342</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gamma-ray emitting narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies are a unique class of objects that launch powerful jets from relatively lower-mass black hole systems compared to the Blazars. However, the black hole masses estimated from the total flux spectrum suffer from the projection effect, making the mass measurement highly uncertain. The polarized spectrum provides a unique view of the central engine through scattered light. We performed spectro-polarimetric observations of the gamma-ray emitting narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy 1H0323+342 using \textit{SPOL/MMT}. The degree of polarization and polarization angle are 0.122 $\pm$ 0.040\% and 142 $\pm$ 9 degrees, while the H$\alpha$ line is polarized at 0.265 $\pm$ 0.280\%. We decomposed the total flux spectrum and estimated broad H$\alpha$ FWHM of 1015 \kms^{-1}. The polarized flux spectrum shows a broadening similar to the total flux spectrum, with a broadening ratio of 1.22. The Monte Carlo radiative transfer code `STOKES' applied to the data provides the best fit for a small viewing angle of 9-24 degrees and a small optical depth ratio between the polar and the equatorial scatters. A thick BLR with significant scale height can explain a similar broadening of the polarized spectrum compared to the total flux spectrum with a small viewing angle.</description>

      <title>Molecular Formation in Low-Metallicity Hot Cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The chemical complexity in low-metallicity hot cores has been confirmed by observations. We investigate the effect of varying physical parameters, such as temperature, density and the cosmic ray ionisation rate (CRIR), on the molecular abundance evolution in low-metallicity hot cores using the UMIST gas phase chemical model. CRIR had the strongest effect on molecular abundance. The resultant molecular abundances were divided into three categories with different trends in time evolution. We compared our results with the observations of hot cores in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Our model fits best with the observations at a time of around $10^5$ years after the evaporation of ice and at the CRIR of $1.36 \times 10^{-16}$ s$^{-1}$. The resultant abundances of the oxygen-bearing complex organic molecules (COMs), such as CH$_3$OH, HCOOCH$_3$ and CH$_3$OCH$_3$, do not fit with observations in the same physical condition and may be located in a different physical environment. Our results suggest that investigating the CRIR value is crucial to predict the molecular evolution in LMC hot cores.</description>

      <title>Digging into the Interior of Hot Cores with ALMA (DIHCA). IV. Fragmentation in High-mass Star-Forming Clumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fragmentation contributes to the formation and evolution of stars. Observationally, high-mass stars are known to form multiple-star systems, preferentially in cluster environments. Theoretically, Jeans instability has been suggested to determine characteristic fragmentation scales, and thermal or turbulent motion in the parental gas clump mainly contributes to the instability. To search for such a characteristic fragmentation scale, we have analyzed ALMA 1.33 mm continuum observations toward 30 high-mass star-forming clumps taken by the Digging into the Interior of Hot Cores with ALMA (DIHCA) survey. We have identified 573 cores using the dendrogram algorithm and measured the separation of cores by using the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) technique. The core separation corrected by projection effects has a distribution peaked around 5800 au. In order to remove biases produced by different distances and sensitivities, we further smooth the images to a common physical scale and perform completeness tests. Our careful analysis finds a characteristic fragmentation scale of $\sim$7000 au, comparable to the thermal Jeans length of the clumps. We conclude that thermal Jeans fragmentation plays a dominant role in determining the clump fragmentation in high-mass star-forming regions, without the need of invoking turbulent Jeans fragmentation.</description>

      <title>Bow-shock structure of Sgr B molecular-cloud complex in the Galactic Centre inferred from 3D CO-line kinematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) bubble structure of the Sgr-B molecular-cloud complex is derived by a kinematical analysis of CO-line archival cube data of the Galactic Centre (GC) observed with the Nobeyama 45-m telescope. The line-of-sight depth is estimated by applying the face-on transformation method of radial velocity to the projected distance on the Galactic plane considering the Galactic rotation of the central molecular zone (CMZ). The 3D complex exhibits a conical-horn structure with the Sgr-B2 cloud located in the farthest end on the line of sight at radial velocity $v_{\rm lsr} \sim 70$ km s$^{-1}$, and the entire complex composes a lopsided bubble opening toward the Sun at $v_{\rm lsr}\sim 50$ to 30 km s$^{-1}$. The line-of-sight extent of the complex is $\sim 100$ pc according to the large velocity extent for several tens of km s$^{-1}$ from Sgr B2 to the outskirts. The entire complex exhibits a flattened conical bubble with full sizes $\sim 40 {\rm pc} \times 20 {\rm pc} \times 100 {\rm pc}$ in the $l$, $b$ and line-of-sight directions, respectively. Based on the 3D analysis, we propose a formation scenario of the giant molecular bubble structure due to a galactic bow shock, and suggest that the star formation in Sgr B2 was enhanced by dual-side compression of the B2 cloud by the Galactic shock wave from up-stream and expanding HII region from the down-stream side of the GC Arm I in Galactic rotation.</description>

      <title>Pathways to Interstellar Amides via Carbamoyl (NH2CO) Isomers by Radical-Neutral Reactions on Ice Grain Mantles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Explaining the formation pathways of amides on ice-grain mantels is crucial to understanding the prebiotic chemistry in an interstellar medium. In this computational study, we explore different radical-neutral formation pathways for some of the observed amides (formamide, acetamide, urea, and N-methylformamide) via intermediate carbamoyl (NH2CO) radical precursors and their isomers. We assess the relative energy of four NH2CO isomers in the gas phase and evaluate their binding energy on small water clusters to discern the affinity that the isomers present to an ice model. We consider three possible reaction pathways for the formation of the carbamoyl radicals, namely, the OH + HCN, CN + H2O, and NH2 + CO reaction channels. We computed the binding energy distribution for the HCN and CH3CN precursors on an ice model consisting of a set of clusters of 22 water molecules each to serve as a starting point for the reactivity study on the ice surface. The computations revealed that the lowest barrier to the formation of an NH2CO isomer corresponds to the NH2 + CO reaction (12.6 kJ/mol). The OH + HCN reaction pathway results in the exothermic formation of the N-radical form of carbamoyl HN(C=O)H with a reaction barrier of 26.7 kJ/mol. We found that the CN + H2O reaction displays a high energy barrier of 70.6 kJ/mol. Finally, we also probed the direct formation of the acetamide radical precursor via the OH + CH3CN reaction and found that the most probable outcome on interstellar ices is the H-abstraction reaction to yield CH2CN and H2O. Based on these results, we believe that including alternative reaction pathways, leading to the formation of amides via the N-radical form of carbamoyl, would provide an improvement in the prediction of the amide abundances in astrochemical models, especially regarding the chemistry of star-forming regions.</description>

      <title>Once a Triple, Not Always a Triple: The Evolution of Hierarchical Triples that Yield Merged Inner Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: More than half of all main-sequence (MS) stars have one or more companions, and many of those with initial masses &lt;8 M$_\odot$ are born in hierarchical triples. These systems feature two stars in a close orbit (the inner binary) while a tertiary star orbits them on a wider orbit (the outer binary). In hierarchical triples, three-body dynamics combined with stellar evolution drives interactions and, in many cases, merges the inner binary entirely to create a renovated `Post-Merger Binary' (PMB). By leveraging dynamical simulations and tracking binary interactions, we explore the outcomes of merged triples and investigate whether PMBs preserve signatures of their three-body history. Our findings indicate that in 26-54% of wide double WD binaries (s&gt;100 au), the more massive white dwarf (WD) is a merger product, implying that these DWD binaries were previously triples. Overall, we estimate that $44\pm14\%$ of observed wide DWDs originated in triple star systems and thereby have rich dynamical histories. Additionally, our results suggest that the separations of inner and outer binaries are uncorrelated at birth, providing insights into stellar formation processes. We also examine MS+MS and MS+Red Giant mergers manifesting as Blue Straggler stars (BSSs). These PMBs have orbital configurations and ages similar to most observed BSS binaries. While the triple+merger formation channel can explain the observed chemical abundances, moderate eccentricities, and companion masses in BSS binaries, it likely only accounts for $\sim$20-25% of BSSs. Meanwhile, we predict that the majority of observed single BSSs formed as collisions in triples and harbor long-period (&gt;10 yr) companions. Furthermore, both BSS binaries and DWDs exhibit signatures of WD birth kicks.</description>

      <title>Indirect Searches for Ultraheavy Dark Matter in the Time Domain</title>

Abstract: Dark matter may exist today in the form of ultraheavy composite bound states. Collisions between such dark matter states can release intense bursts of radiation that includes gamma-rays among the final products. Thus, indirect-detection signals of dark matter may include unconventional gamma-ray bursts. Such bursts may have been missed not necessarily because of their low arriving gamma-ray fluxes, but rather their briefness and rareness. We point out that intense bursts whose non-detection thus far are due to the latter can be detected in the near future with existing and planned facilities. In particular, we propose that, with slight experimental adjustments and suitable data analyses, imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs) and Pulsed All-sky Near-infrared and Optical Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence (PANOSETI) are promising tools for detecting such rare, brief, but intense bursts. We also show that if we assume these bursts originate from collisions of dark matter states, IACTs and PANOSETI can probe a large dark matter parameter space beyond existing limits. Additionally, we present a concrete model of dark matter that produces bursts potentially detectable in these instruments.</description>

      <title>SHARP -- A near-IR multi-mode spectrograph conceived for MORFEO@ELT</title>

Abstract: The Extremely Large Telescopes (ELTs), thanks to their large apertures and cutting-edge Multi-Conjugate Adaptive Optics (MCAO) systems, promise to deliver sharper and deeper data even than the JWST. SHARP is a concept study for a near-IR (0.95-2.45 $\mu$m) spectrograph conceived to fully exploit the collecting area and the angular resolution of the upcoming generation of ELTs. In particular, SHARP is designed for the 2nd port of MORFEO@ELT. Composed of a Multi-Object Spectrograph, NEXUS, and a multi-Integral Field Unit, VESPER, MORFEO-SHARP will deliver high angular ($\sim$30 mas) and spectral (R$\simeq$300, 2000, 6000, 17000) resolution, outperforming NIRSpec@JWST (100 mas). SHARP will enable studies of the nearby Universe and the early Universe in unprecedented detail. NEXUS is fed by a configurable slit system deploying up to 30 slits with $\sim$2.4 arcsec length and adjustable width, over a field of about 1.2"$\times$1.2" (35 mas/pix). Each slit is fed by an inversion prism able to rotate by an arbitrary angle the field that can be seen by the slit. VESPER is composed of 12 probes of 1.7"$\times$1.5" each (spaxel 31 mas) probing a field 24"$\times$70". SHARP is conceived to exploit the ELTs apertures reaching the faintest flux and the sharpest angular resolution by joining the sensitivity of NEXUS and the high spatial sampling of VESPER to MORFEO capabilities. This article provides an overview of the scientific design drivers, their solutions, and the resulting optical design of the instrument achieving the required optical performance.</description>

      <title>ALMA high-resolution observations unveil planet formation shaping molecular emission in the PDS 70 disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With two directly detected protoplanets, the PDS 70 system is a unique source in which to study the complex interplay between forming planets and their natal environment. The large dust cavity carved by the two giant planets can affect the disk chemistry, and therefore the molecular emission morphology. On the other hand, chemical properties of the gas component of the disk are expected to leave an imprint on the planetary atmospheres. In this work, we reconstruct the emission morphology of a rich inventory of molecular tracers in the PDS 70 disk, and we look for possible chemical signatures of the two actively accreting protoplanets, PDS b and c. We leverage Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) band 6 high-angular-resolution and deep-sensitivity line emission observations, together with image and $uv$-plane techniques, to boost the detection of faint lines. We robustly detect ring-shaped emission from $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, C$^{18}$O, H$^{13}$CN, HC$^{15}$N, DCN, H$_2$CO, CS, C$_2$H, and H$^{13}$CO$^{+}$ lines in unprecedented detail. Most of the molecular tracers show a peak of the emission inside the millimeter dust peak. We interpret this as the direct impact of the effective irradiation of the cavity wall, as a result of the planet formation process. Moreover, we have found evidence of an O-poor gas reservoir in the outer disk, which is supported by the observations of bright C-rich molecules, the non-detection of SO, and a lower limit on the $\mathrm{CS/SO}$ ratio of $\sim1$. Eventually, we provide the first detection of the c-C$_3$H$_2$ transitions at 218.73 GHz, and the marginal detection of an azimuthal asymmetry in the higher-energy H$_2$CO (3$_{2,1}$-2$_{2,0}$) line, which could be due to accretion heating near PDS 70b.</description>

      <title>MUSE spectroscopy of the high abundance discrepancy planetary nebula NGC 6153</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: (Abridged) The Abundance Discrepancy problem in planetary nebulae (PNe) has long puzzled astronomers. NGC6153, with its high Abundance Discrepancy Factor (ADF~10), provides an opportunity to understand the chemical structure and ionisation processes by constructing detailed emission line maps and examining variations in electron temperature and density. We used the MUSE spectrograph to acquire IFU data covering the wavelength range 4600-9300 \AA\ with a spatial sampling of 0.2 arcsec and spectral resolutions ranging from R = 1600-3500. We created emission line maps for 60 lines and two continuum regions. We developed a tailored methodology for the analysis of the data, including correction for recombination contributions to auroral lines and the contributions of different plasma phases. Our analysis confirmed the presence of a low-temperature plasma component in NGC6153. We find that electron temperatures derived from recombination line/continuum diagnostics are significantly lower than those derived from collisionally excited lines diagnostics. Ionic chemical abundance maps were constructed, considering the weight of the cold plasma phase in the HI emission. Adopting this approach, we found ionic abundances that could be up to 0.2 dex lower for those derived from CELs and up to 1.1 dex higher for those derived from RLs than in the case of an homogeneous HI emission. The Abundance Contrast Factor (ACF) between both plasma components was defined, with values, on average, 0.9 dex higher than the ADF. Different methods for calculating ionisation correction factors (ICFs) yielded consistent results. Our findings emphasize that accurate chemical abundance determinations in high-ADF PNe must account for multiple plasma phases.</description>

Abstract: 1I/`Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov are the first macroscopic interstellar objects to be detected in the solar system. Their discovery has triggered a tsunami of scientific interest regarding the physical properties, dynamics and origin of the so-called interstellar interloper population. While it is clear that a deep understanding of these issues cannot be reached from a sample of just two bodies, the emergence of this new field of astronomical study is particularly fascinating, with ramifications from planetary science to galactic dynamics.</description>

      <title>The Anomalous Acceleration of PSR J2043+1711: Long-Period Orbital Companion or Stellar Flyby?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on the rate of change of its orbital period, PSR J2043+1711 has a substantial peculiar acceleration of 3.5 $\pm$ 0.8 mm/s/yr, which deviates from the acceleration predicted by equilibrium Milky Way models at a $4\sigma$ level. The magnitude of the peculiar acceleration is too large to be explained by disequilibrium effects of the Milky Way interacting with orbiting dwarf galaxies ($\sim$1 mm/s/yr), and too small to be caused by period variations due to the pulsar being a redback. We identify and examine two plausible causes for the anomalous acceleration: a stellar flyby, and a long-period orbital companion. We identify a main-sequence star in \textit{Gaia} DR3 and Pan-STARRS DR2 with the correct mass, distance, and on-sky position to potentially explain the observed peculiar acceleration. However, the star and the pulsar system have substantially different proper motions, indicating that they are not gravitationally bound. However, it is possible that this is an unrelated star that just happens to be located near J2043+1711 along our line of sight (chance probability of 1.6\%). Therefore, we also constrain possible orbital parameters for a circumbinary companion in a hierarchical triple system with J2043+1711; the changes in the spindown rate of the pulsar are consistent with an outer object that has an orbital period of 80 kyr, a companion mass of 0.3 $M_\odot$ (indicative of a white dwarf or low-mass star), and a semi-major axis of 2000 AU. Continued timing and/or future faint optical observations of J2043+1711 may eventually allow us to differentiate between these scenarios.</description>

      <title>Finding planets via gravitational microlensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since the first microlensing planet discovery in 2003, more than 200 planets have been detected with gravitational microlensing, in addition to several free-floating planet and black hole candidates. In this chapter the microlensing theory is presented by introducing the numerical methods used to solve binary and triple lens problems and how these lead to the characterisation of the planetary systems. Then the microlensing planetary detection efficiency is discussed, with an emphasis on cold planets beyond the snow line. Furthermore, it will be explained how the planetary characterisation can be facilitated when the microlensing light curves exhibit distortions due to second order effects such as parallax, planetary orbital motion, and extended source. These second order effects can be turned to our advantage, and become useful to ultimately better characterise the planetary systems, but they can also introduce degeneracies in the light curve models. It will be explained how the use of modern observational and computational techniques enables microlensers to solve these degeneracies and estimate the planetary system parameters with very high accuracy. Then a review of the main discoveries to date will be presented while exploring the recent statistical results from high-cadence ground-based surveys and space-based observations, especially on the planet mass function. Finally, future prospects are discussed, with the expected advances from dedicated space missions, extending the planet sensitivity range down to Mars mass.</description>

      <title>Grids of stellar models with rotation VIII: Models from 1.7 to 500 $M_\odot$ at metallicity $Z = 10^{-5}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Grids of stellar evolution models with rotation using the Geneva stellar evolution code (Genec) have been published for a wide range of metallicities. We introduce the last remaining grid of Genec models, with a metallicity of $Z=10^{-5}$. We study the impact of this extremely metal-poor initial composition on various aspects of stellar evolution, and compare it to the results from previous grids at other metallicities. We provide electronic tables that can be used to interpolate between stellar evolution tracks and for population synthesis. Using the same physics as in the previous papers of this series, we computed a grid of stellar evolution models with Genec spanning masses between 1.7 and 500 $M_\odot$, with and without rotation, at a metallicity of $Z=10^{-5}$. Due to the extremely low metallicity of the models, mass-loss processes are negligible for all except the most massive stars. For most properties (such as evolutionary tracks in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, lifetimes, and final fates), the present models fit neatly between those previously computed at surrounding metallicities. However, specific to this metallicity is the very large production of primary nitrogen in moderately rotating stars, which is linked to the interplay between the hydrogen- and helium-burning regions. The stars in the present grid are interesting candidates as sources of nitrogen-enrichment in the early Universe. Indeed, they may have formed very early on from material previously enriched by the massive short-lived Population III stars, and as such constitute a very important piece in the puzzle that is the history of the Universe.</description>

      <title>Investigating the interplay between AGN coronal properties and hard X-ray variability with NuSTAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active galactic nuclei (AGN) are extremely variable in the X-ray band down to very short time scales. However, the driver of the X-ray variability is still poorly understood. Previous results suggest that the hot corona, which is responsible for the primary Comptonized emission observed in AGN, should have an important role in driving the X-ray variability. In this work, we investigate the connection between the X-ray amplitude variability and the coronal physical parameters, namely the temperature ($kT$) and optical depth ($\tau$). We present the spectral and timing analysis of 46 NuSTAR observations corresponding to a sample of 20 AGN. For each source we derive the coronal temperature and optical depth through X-ray spectroscopy, and we compute the normalized excess variance for different energy bands at a time scale of $10$ ks. We find a strong inverse correlation between $kT$ and $\tau$, with correlation coefficient $r&lt;-0.9$ and negligible null probability. No clear dependence between the temperature and physical properties such as the black hole mass and the Eddington ratio is found. We also find that the observed X-ray variability does not correlate with either the coronal temperature or optical depth under the thermal equilibrium assumption, while it is anti-correlated with the black hole mass. These results can be interpreted in a scenario where one possibility is that the observed X-ray variability could be mainly driven by variations in coronal physical properties on a time scale of less than $10$ ks, whereas we assume thermal equilibrium at such time scales in this paper, given the capability of the currently available hard X-ray telescopes. However, it is also possible that the X-ray variability is mostly driven by the absolute size of the corona, which depends on the supermassive black hole mass, rather than by its physical properties.</description>

      <title>Empirical mass-loss rates and clumping properties of O-type stars in the LMC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We constrain wind parameters of a sample of 18 O-type stars in the LMC, through analysis with stellar atmosphere and wind models including the effects of optically thick clumping. This allows us to determine the most accurate spectroscopic mass-loss and wind structure properties of massive stars at sub-solar metallicity to date and gain insight into the impact of metallicity on massive stellar winds. Combining high signal to noise (S/N) ratio spectroscopy in the UV and optical gives us access to diagnostics of multiple different physical processes in the stellar wind. We produce synthetic spectra using the stellar atmosphere modelling code FASTWIND, and reproduce the observed spectra using a genetic algorithm based fitting technique. We empirically constrain 15 physical parameters associated with the stellar and wind properties, including temperature, surface gravity, surface abundances, rotation, macroturbulence and wind parameters. We find, on average, mass-loss rates a factor of 4-5 lower than those predicted by Vink et al. 2001, in good agreement with predictions from Bjorklund et al. 2021, and the best agreement with those from Krticka et al. 2018. In the 'weak-wind' regime we find mass-loss rates orders of magnitude below any theoretical predictions. We find a positive correlation of clumping factors (fcl) with effective temperature with an average fcl = 14 +- 8 for the full sample. Above 38 kK an average 46 +- 24% of the wind velocity span is covered by clumps and the interclump density is 10-30% of the mean wind. Below an effective temperature of roughly 38 kK there must be additional light leakage for supergiants. For dwarf stars at low temperatures there is a statistical preference for very low clump velocity spans, however it is unclear if this can be physically motivated as there are no clearly observable wind signatures in UV diagnostics.</description>

      <title>Transferring spectroscopic stellar labels to 217 million Gaia DR3 XP stars with SHBoost</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the feasibility of using machine-learning regression as a method of extracting basic stellar parameters and line-of-sight extinctions, given spectro-photometric data. To this end, we build a stable gradient-boosted random-forest regressor (xgboost), trained on spectroscopic data, capable of producing output parameters with reliable uncertainties from Gaia DR3 data (most notably the low-resolution XP spectra) without ground-based spectroscopic observations. Using Shapley additive explanations, we are able to interpret how the predictions for each star are influenced by each data feature. For the training and testing of the network, we use high-quality parameters obtained from the StarHorse code for a sample of around eight million stars observed by major spectroscopic surveys (APOGEE, GALAH, LAMOST, RAVE, SEGUE, and GES), complemented by curated samples of hot stars, very metal-poor stars, white dwarfs, and hot sub-dwarfs. The training data cover the whole sky, all Galactic components, and almost the full magnitude range of the Gaia DR3 XP sample of more than 217 million objects that also have parallaxes. We achieve median uncertainties (at $G\approx16$) of 0.20 mag in V-band extinction, 0.01 dex in logarithmic effective temperature, 0.20 dex in surface gravity, 0.18 dex in metallicity, and $12\%$ in mass (over the full Gaia DR3 XP sample, with considerable variations in precision as a function of magnitude and stellar type). We succeed in predicting competitive results based on Gaia DR3 XP spectra compared to classical isochrone fitting methods we employed in earlier work, especially for the parameters $A_V$, $T_{\rm eff}$, and metallicity. Finally, we showcase some applications of this new catalogue (e.g. extinction maps, metallicity trends in the Milky Way, extended maps of young massive stars, metal-poor stars, and metal-rich stars).

Abstract: The first stars formed over five orders of magnitude in mass by accretion in primordial dark matter halos. We study the evolution of massive, very massive and supermassive primordial (Pop III) stars over nine orders of magnitude in accretion rate. We use the stellar evolution code GENEC to evolve accreting Pop III stars from 10$^{-6}$ - 10$^3$ M$_\odot$/yr and study how these rates determine final masses. The stars are evolved until either the end of central Si burning or until they encounter the general relativistic instability (GRI). We also examine how metallicity affects the evolution of the stars. At rates below $2.5 x 10^{-5}$ M$_\odot$/yr the final mass of the star falls below that required for pair-instability supernovae. The minimum rate required to produce black holes with masses above 250 M$_\odot$ is $5 x 10^{-5}$ M$_\odot$/yr, well within the range of infall rates found in numerical simulations of halos that cool via H$_2$, $10^{-3}$ M$_\odot$/yr. At rates of $5 x 10^{-5}$ M$_\odot$/yr to $4 x 10^{-2}$ \Ms\ yr$^{-1}$, like those expected for halos cooling by both H$_2$ and Ly-alpha, the star collapses after Si burning. At higher accretion rates the GRI triggers the collapse of the star during central H burning. Stars that grow at above these rates are cool red hypergiants with effective temperatures $log(T_{\text{eff}}) = 3.8$ and luminosities that can reach 10$^{10.5}$ L$_\odot$. At accretion rates of 100 - 1000 M$_\odot$/yr the gas encounters the general relativistic instability prior to the onset of central hydrogen burning and collapses to a black hole with a mass of 10$^6$ M$_\odot$ without ever having become a star. We reveal for the first time the critical transition rate in accretion above which catastrophic baryon collapse, like that which can occur during galaxy collisions in the high-redshift Universe, produces supermassive black holes via dark collapse.</description>

      <title>Ba Enrichment in Gaia MS+WD Binaries: Tracing $s$-Process Element Production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A large population of intermediate-separation binaries, consisting of a main-sequence (MS) star and a white dwarf (WD), has recently emerged from Gaia's third data release (DR3), posing challenges to current models of binary evolution. Here we examine the $s$-process element abundances in these systems using data from GALAH DR3. Following refined sample analysis with parameter estimates based on GALAH spectra, we find a distinct locus where enhanced $s$-process elements depend on both the WD mass and metallicity, consistent with loci identified in previous asymptotic giant branch (AGB) nucleosynthesis studies with higher $s$-process yields. Notably, these enhanced abundances show no correlation with the systems' orbital parameters, supporting a history of accretion in intermediate-separation MS+WD systems. Consequently, our results form a direct observational evidence of a connection between AGB masses and $s$-process yields. We conclude by showing that the GALAH DR3 survey includes numerous Ba dwarf stars, within and beyond the mass range covered in our current sample, which can further elucidate $s$-process element distributions in MS+WD binaries.</description>

      <title>General Relativistic effects and the NIR variability of Sgr A* II: A systematic approach to temporal asymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A systematic study, based on the third-moment structure function, of Sgr A*'s variability finds an exponential rise time $\tau_{1,\rm{obs}}=14.8^{+0.4}_{-1.5}~\mathrm{minutes}$ and decay time $\tau_{2,\rm{obs}}=13.1^{+1.3}_{-1.4}~\mathrm{minutes}$. This symmetry of the flux-density variability is consistent with earlier work, and we interpret it as caused by the dominance of Doppler boosting, as opposed to gravitational lensing, in Sgr~A*'s light curve. A relativistic, semi-physical model of Sgr~A* confirms an inclination angle $i&lt;45$ degrees. The model also shows that the emission of the intrinsic radiative process can have some asymmetry even though the observed emission does not. The third-moment structure function, which is a measure of the skewness of the light-curve increments, may be a useful summary statistic in other contexts of astronomy because it senses only temporal asymmetry, i.e., it averages to zero for any temporally symmetric signal.</description>

Abstract: We study the black hole mass $-$ host galaxy stellar mass relation, $M_{\rm{BH}}-M_{\ast}$, of a sample of $z&lt;4$ optically-variable AGNs in the COSMOS field. The parent sample of 491 COSMOS AGNs were identified by optical variability from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP) program. Using publicly-available catalogs and spectra, we consolidate their spectroscopic redshifts and estimate virial black hole masses using broad line widths and luminosities. We show that variability searches with deep, high precision photometry like the HSC-SSP can identity AGNs in low mass galaxies up to $z\sim1$. However, their black holes are more massive given their host galaxy stellar masses than predicted by the local relation for active galaxies. We report that $z\sim 0.5-4$ variability-selected AGNs are meanwhile more consistent with the $M_{\rm{BH}}-M_{\ast}$ relation for local inactive early-type galaxies. This result is consistent with most previous studies of the $M_{\rm{BH}}-M_{\ast}$ relation at similar redshifts and indicates that AGNs selected from variability are not intrinsically different from the broad-line Type 1 AGN population at similar luminosities. Our results demonstrate the need for robust black hole and stellar mass estimates for intermediate-mass black hole candidates in low-mass galaxies at similar redshifts. Assuming that these results do not reflect a selection bias, they appear to be consistent with self-regulated feedback models wherein the central black hole and stars in galaxies grow in tandem.</description>

      <title>The baryon cycle in modern cosmological hydrodynamical simulations</title>

Abstract: In recent years, cosmological hydrodynamical simulations have proven their utility as key interpretative tools in the study of galaxy formation and evolution. In this work, we present a like-for-like comparison between the baryon cycle in three publicly available, leading cosmological simulation suites: EAGLE, IllustrisTNG, and SIMBA. While these simulations broadly agree in terms of their predictions for the stellar mass content and star formation rates of galaxies at $z\approx0$, they achieve this result for markedly different reasons. In EAGLE and SIMBA, we demonstrate that at low halo masses ($M_{\rm 200c}\lesssim 10^{11.5}\, M_{\odot}$), stellar feedback (SF)-driven outflows can reach far beyond the scale of the halo, extending up to $2-3\times R_{\rm 200c}$. In contrast, in TNG, SF-driven outflows, while stronger at the scale of the ISM, recycle within the CGM (within $R_{\rm 200c}$). We find that AGN-driven outflows in SIMBA are notably potent, reaching several times $R_{\rm 200c}$ even at halo masses up to $M_{\rm 200c}\approx10^{13.5}\, M_{\odot}$. In both TNG and EAGLE, AGN feedback can eject gas beyond $R_{\rm 200c}$ at this mass scale, but seldom beyond $2-3\times R_{\rm 200c}$. We find that the scale of feedback-driven outflows can be directly linked with the prevention of cosmological inflow, as well as the total baryon fraction of haloes within $R_{\rm 200c}$. This work lays the foundation to develop targeted observational tests that can discriminate between feedback scenarios, and inform sub-grid feedback models in the next generation of simulations.</description>

      <title>The Pristine survey XXIV: The Galactic underdogs -- Dynamic tales of a Milky Way metal-poor population</title>

Abstract: Through the chemodynamical characterisation of metal-poor stars, one can efficiently probe the early history of the Milky Way. We aim at decontaminating a sample of $\sim$ 3M giant stars with Gaia DR3 XP-based \textit{Pristine-Gaia} metallicities, to investigate a subset of very metal-poor stars ([Fe/H] &lt; -1.7) with disc-like orbits. We construct a statistically robust sample of $\sim$ 36 000 very metal-poor giants, using APOGEE and LAMOST to estimate and remove contamination from high $V_\phi$ stars. We investigate the spatial and kinematic properties of the decontaminated sample, using $V_\phi$ and the action space, both powerful to disentangle stellar populations. As in previous works, we find a pronounced asymmetry in $L_z$ and $V_\phi$ in favour of prograde stars. This excess is mostly made of prograde-planar stars (10% of the very metal-poor population), and contains stars with $V_\phi$ &gt; 180 km s$^{-1}$ and $Z_{\text{max}}$ &lt; 1.5 kpc, down to [Fe/H] = -2.9 at a 2$\sigma$ confidence level. While the overall orbital distributions of our sample match that of a halo, the highly prograde and planar subset (2% of the very metal-poor population) also bears characteristics classically associated with a thick disc, i.e., a spatial distribution compatible with a short-scaled thick disc, and a thick disc-like $Z_{\text{max}}$ - $R_{\text{max}}$ distribution. Additionally, assuming a stationary or prograde halo with $\overline{V_\phi}$ $\sim$ 30-40 km.s$^{-1}$ is not sufficient to suppress the kinematic signature of the highly prograde and planar subset. These results rule out any link with a thin disc, and instead, support a contribution from a \textit{metal-weak thick disc}.</description>

      <title>Faraday tomography of LoTSS-DR2 data: III. Revealing the Local Bubble and the complex of local interstellar clouds in the high-latitude inner Galaxy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14679v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we present a new mosaic created with the second release of LOFAR Two-Metre Sky Survey data (LoTSS-DR2), which probes polarised synchrotron emission in the high-latitude inner Galaxy. Our objective is to characterise the observed emission through multi-tracer analysis to better understand the volume and the structures that may be observed with LOFAR. Furthermore, we exploit Faraday depth as a unique tool to probe the diffuse magnetised structure in the local ISM. We produced a mosaic Faraday cube of LoTSS-DR2 data by applying a rotation measure synthesis algorithm. From the cube, we constructed Faraday moment maps to characterise the nature of spectra. Additionally, we quantified the linear depolarisation canals using the Rolling Hough transform and used them to search for alignment with other data sets. Utilising LoTSS-DR2 observations alongside complementary data sets including Planck polarisation data, HI emission maps, and starlight polarisation measurements, we estimated the distance to the Faraday structures. The Faraday cube reveals an ordered structure across two-thirds of the observed area, whose orientation aligns well with that of both the HI filaments and the magnetic field. We estimate the minimum distance to the Faraday structures to be between 40 and 80 pc, which puts them in the vicinity of the Local Bubble wall. The emission is organised in a large gradient in Faraday depth whose origin we associate with the curved wall of the Local Bubble. Comparing our data with a model of the Local Bubble wall, we conclude that we might be probing a contribution of the medium inside the Local Bubble cavity as well, corresponding to the complex of local interstellar clouds. Moreover, we propose a toy model incorporating an ionised front of finite thickness into the Local Bubble wall, as a curved, cold neutral shell alone is insufficient to produce the observed gradient.</description>

      <title>J0011+3217: A peculiar radio galaxy with a one-sided secondary lobe and misaligned giant primary lobes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14889v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: From the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey second data release (LoTSS DR2) at 144 MHz, we identified a peculiar radio galaxy, J0011+3217. It has a large, one-sided diffuse secondary wing that stretches up to 0.85 Mpc (roughly 85\% of the size of the primary lobe). The linear size of the primary lobe of the galaxy is 0.99 Mpc. This peculiar source is a giant radio galaxy with a misaligned primary lobe. There is an optical galaxy 16 kpc (7 arcsec) from the host active galactic nucleus of J0011+3217. J0011+3217 has a radio luminosity of $1.65\times 10^{26}$ W Hz$^{-1}$ at 144 MHz with a spectral index of $-0.80$ between 144 and 607 MHz. J0011+3217 is located 1.2 Mpc from the centre of the Abell 7 cluster. The Abell 7 cluster has a redshift of 0.104 and a mass ($M_{500}$) of 3.71 $\times 10^{14}$ M$_\odot$. The cluster is associated with strong X-ray emission. We studied the X-ray emission around the cluster and from the region surrounding J0011+3217 using an XMM-Newton image of J0011+3217, and we analysed the velocity structure and spatial distribution of galaxies in the cluster, showing that J0011+3217 inhabits an offset group of galaxies that are moving with respect to Abell 7. The off-axis distortion, or bending, of the primary lobe of J0011+3217 in the outer edges has a strong effect on the relative motion of the surrounding medium; this in turn causes the bending of the jets in the opposite direction of the cluster (like wide-angle tailed sources). We suggest that the morphology of J0011+3217 is influenced by ram pressure created by the Abell 7 cluster, highlighting the complex interactions between the source and the surrounding cluster environment.</description>

      <title>Compact Binary Formation in Open Star Clusters III: Probability of Binary Black Holes Hidden Inside of Gaia Black Holes</title>

Abstract: Gaia mission and its follow-up observations have discovered binaries containing single BHs and visible stars without mass transfer, so-called Gaia BHs. One important question is if Gaia BHs have binary BHs (BBHs), hereafter Gaia BBHs, instead of single BHs. We have investigated how efficiently Gaia BBHs are formed in open star clusters, one of the promising formation sites of Gaia BHs, by means of gravitational $N$-body simulations. Limiting Gaia BHs' periods to $10^2$-$10^4$ days, we have found that there are no Gaia BBHs in the solar-metallicity environments, while the formation efficiency of Gaia BBHs is not small ($\sim 10^{-6} M_\odot^{-1}$ or $\sim 10$ % of Gaia BHs) in subsolar-metallicity environments. However, the probability of Gaia BBHs hidden in Gaia BHs is only $\sim 1$ %. This is because most of the BBHs merge within $1$ Gyr through gravitational wave radiation. Note that the ages of discovered Gaia BHs are more than $1$ Gyr. If we extend Gaia BHs' periods to $10^4$-$10^5$ days, the probability becomes higher to $\sim 10$ %. In this case, a large fraction of BBHs can have enough wide orbits not to merge within the Hubble time. The probability would not be high for Gaia BHs already discovered and to be discovered in the near future. Nevertheless, we have shown the BH/BBH mass, visible star mass, and eccentricity distributions of Gaia BHs and Gaia BBHs, which will be helpful for follow-up observations to discover Gaia BBHs. A Gaia BH would be more likely to be a Gaia BBH if it has younger age, longer period, lower-mass companion, more circular orbit, lower metallicity, and more massive BH. Our results have implied that Gaia BH3 is unlikely to be a Gaia BBH.</description>

      <title>Accurate Measurement of the Lensing Magnification by BOSS CMASS Galaxies and Its Implications for Cosmology and Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16484v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnification serves as an independent and complementary gravitational lensing measurement to shear. We develop a novel method to achieve an accurate and robust magnification measurement around BOSS CMASS galaxies across physical scales of $0.016h^{-1}{\rm Mpc} &lt; r_{\rm p} &lt; 10h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$. We first measure the excess total flux density $\delta M$ of the source galaxies in deep DECaLS photometric catalog that are lensed by CMASS galaxies. We convert $\delta M$ to magnification $\mu$ by establishing the $\delta \mu-\delta M$ relation using a deeper photometric sample. By comparing magnification measurements in three optical bands ($grz$), we constrain the dust attenuation curve and its radial distribution, discovering a steep attenuation curve in the circumgalactic medium of CMASS galaxies. We further compare dust-corrected magnification measurements to model predictions from high-resolution dark matter-only (DMO) simulations in WMAP and Planck cosmologies, as well as the hydrodynamic simulation \texttt{TNG300-1}, using precise galaxy-halo connections from the Photometric objects Around Cosmic webs method and the accurate ray-tracing algorithm \texttt{P3MLens}. For $r_{\rm p} &gt; 70h^{-1}$ kpc, our magnification measurements are in good agreement with both WMAP and Planck cosmologies. However, at $r_{\rm p} &lt; 70h^{-1}$ kpc, we observe an excess magnification signal, which is higher than the DMO model in Planck cosmology at $2.8\sigma$ and would be exacerbated if significant baryon feedback is included. Implications of the potential small scale discrepancy for the nature of dark matter and for the processes governing galaxy formation are discussed.</description>
