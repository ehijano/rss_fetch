      <title>Factors and moderators of ageism: An analysis using data from 55 countries in the World Values Survey Wave 6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Today, as the aging of the world accelerates, it is an urgent task to clarify factors that prevent ageism. In this study, using hierarchical multiple regression analysis of data from 40,869 people from 55 countries collected in the World Values Survey Wave 6, we showed that after controlling for demographic factors, stereotypes, a hungry spirit, and male chauvinism are related to ageism, and that altruism, trust within and outside the family, and trust in competition moderate the relationship between the independent and dependent variables. Furthermore, data from Japan, which has the highest aging rate and aging speed in the world, showed that these moderation relationships are moderated.</description>

      <title>From Policy to Practice: The Cost of Europe's Green Hydrogen Ambitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The European Commission's new definition of green hydrogen provides clear guidelines and legal certainty for producers and consumers. However, the strict criteria for electrolysis production, requiring additionality, temporal correlation, and geographical correlation, could increase hydrogen costs, affecting its competitiveness as an energy carrier. This study examines the impact of these European regulations using a stochastic capacity expansion model for the European energy market up to 2048. We analyze how these requirements influence costs and investment decisions. Our results show that green hydrogen production requirements will raise system costs by 82 Euro billion from 2024 to 2048, driven mainly by a rapid transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy. The additionality requirement, which mandates the use of new renewable energy installations for electrolysis, emerges as the most expensive to comply with but also the most effective in accelerating the transition to renewable power, particularly before 2030.</description>

      <title>The green hydrogen ambition and implementation gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Green hydrogen is critical for decarbonising hard-to-electrify sectors, but faces high costs and investment risks. Here we define and quantify the green hydrogen ambition and implementation gap, showing that meeting hydrogen expectations will remain challenging despite surging announcements of projects and subsidies. Tracking 137 projects over three years, we identify a wide 2022 implementation gap with only 2% of global capacity announcements finished on schedule. In contrast, the 2030 ambition gap towards 1.5{\deg}C scenarios is gradually closing as the announced project pipeline has nearly tripled to 441 GW within three years. However, we estimate that, without carbon pricing, realising all these projects would require global subsidies of \$1.6 trillion (\$1.2 - 2.6 trillion range), far exceeding announced subsidies. Given past and future implementation gaps, policymakers must prepare for prolonged green hydrogen scarcity. Policy support needs to secure hydrogen investments, but should focus on applications where hydrogen is indispensable.</description>

      <title>Will Southeast Asia be the next global manufacturing hub? A multiway cointegration, causality, and dynamic connectedness analyses on factors influencing offshore decisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has compelled multinational corporations to diversify their global supply chain risk and to relocate their factories to Southeast Asian countries beyond China. Such recent phenomena provide a good opportunity to understand the factors that influenced offshore decisions in the last two decades. We propose a new conceptual framework based on econometric approaches to examine the relationships between these factors. Firstly, the Vector Auto Regression (VAR) for multi-way cointegration analysis by a Johansen test as well as the embedding Granger causality analysis to examine offshore decisions--innovation, technology readiness, infrastructure, foreign direct investment (FDI), and intermediate imports. Secondly, a Quantile Vector Autoregressive (QVAR) model is used to assess the dynamic connectedness among Southeast Asian countries based on the offshore factors. This study explores a system-wide experiment to evaluate the spillover effects of offshore decisions. It reports a comprehensive analysis using time-series data collected from the World Bank. The results of the cointegration, causality, and dynamic connectedness analyses show that a subset of Southeast Asian countries have spillover effects on each other. These countries present a multi-way cointegration and dynamic connectedness relationship. The study contributes to policymaking by providing a data-driven innovative approach through a new conceptual framework.</description>

      <title>Can Digital Aid Deliver During Humanitarian Crises?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13432v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Can digital payments systems help reduce extreme hunger? Humanitarian needs are at their highest since 1945, aid budgets are falling behind, and hunger is concentrating in fragile states where repression and aid diversion present major obstacles. In such contexts, partnering with governments is often neither feasible nor desirable, making private digital platforms a potentially useful means of delivering assistance. We experimentally evaluated digital payments to extremely poor, female-headed households in Afghanistan, as part of a partnership between community, nonprofit, and private organizations. The payments led to substantial improvements in food security and mental well-being. Despite beneficiaries' limited tech literacy, 99.75\% used the payments, and stringent checks revealed no evidence of diversion. Before seeing our results, policymakers and experts are uncertain and skeptical about digital aid, consistent with the lack of prior evidence on digital payments for humanitarian response. Delivery costs are under 7 cents per dollar, which is 10 cents per dollar less than the World Food Programme's global figure for cash-based transfers. These savings can help reduce hunger without additional resources, demonstrating how hybrid partnerships utilizing digital platform technologies can help address grand challenges in difficult contexts.</description>

      <title>On Labs and Fabs: Mapping How Alliances, Acquisitions, and Antitrust are Shaping the Frontier AI Industry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01722v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As frontier AI models advance, policy proposals for safe AI development are gaining increasing attention from researchers and policymakers. This paper explores the current integration in the AI supply chain, focusing on vertical relationships and strategic partnerships among AI labs, cloud providers, chip manufacturers, and lithography companies. It aims to lay the groundwork for a deeper understanding of the implications of various governance interventions, including antitrust measures. The study has two main contributions. First, it profiles 25 leading companies in the AI supply chain, analyzing 300 relationships and noting 80 significant mergers and acquisitions along with 40 antitrust cases. Second, we discuss potential market definitions and the integration drivers based on the observed trends. The analysis reveals predominant horizontal integration through natural growth rather than acquisitions and notable trends of backward vertical integration in the semiconductor supply chain. Strategic partnerships are also significant downstream, especially between AI companies and cloud providers, with large tech companies often pursuing conglomerate integration by acquiring specialized AI startups or forming alliances with frontier AI labs. To further understand the strategic partnerships in the industry, we provide three brief case studies featuring companies like OpenAI and Nvidia. We conclude by posing open research questions on market dynamics and possible governance interventions, such as licensing and safety audits.</description>

      <title>Social Environment Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14090v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) holds promise as a technology that can be used to improve government and economic policy-making. This paper proposes a new research agenda towards this end by introducing Social Environment Design, a general framework for the use of AI for automated policy-making that connects with the Reinforcement Learning, EconCS, and Computational Social Choice communities. The framework seeks to capture general economic environments, includes voting on policy objectives, and gives a direction for the systematic analysis of government and economic policy through AI simulation. We highlight key open problems for future research in AI-based policy-making. By solving these challenges, we hope to achieve various social welfare objectives, thereby promoting more ethical and responsible decision making.</description>
