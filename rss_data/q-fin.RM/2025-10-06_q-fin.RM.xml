      <title>Downside Risk-Aware Equilibria for Strategic Decision-Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Game theory has traditionally had a relatively limited view of risk based on how a player's expected reward is impacted by the uncertainty of the actions of other players. Recently, a new game-theoretic approach provides a more holistic view of risk also considering the reward-variance. However, these variance-based approaches measure variance of the reward on both the upside and downside. In many domains, such as finance, downside risk only is of key importance, as this represents the potential losses associated with a decision. In contrast, large upside "risk" (e.g. profits) are not an issue. To address this restrictive view of risk, we propose a novel solution concept, downside risk aware equilibria (DRAE) based on lower partial moments. DRAE restricts downside risk, while placing no restrictions on upside risk, and additionally, models higher-order risk preferences. We demonstrate the applicability of DRAE on several games, successfully finding equilibria which balance downside risk with expected reward, and prove the existence and optimality of this equilibria.</description>

      <title>DeFi Liquidation Risk Modeling Using Geometric Brownian Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08100v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an analytical method to compute the collateral liquidation probability in decentralized finance (DeFi) stablecoin single-collateral lending. Our approach models the collateral exchange rate as a zero-drift geometric Brownian motion, and derives the probability of it crossing the liquidation threshold. Unlike most existing methods that rely on computationally intensive simulations such as Monte Carlo, our formula provides a lightweight, exact solution. This advancement offers a more efficient alternative for risk assessment in DeFi platforms.</description>
