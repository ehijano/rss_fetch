      <title>Functional Brain Network Identification in Opioid Use Disorder Using Machine Learning Analysis of Resting-State fMRI BOLD Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the neurobiology of opioid use disorder (OUD) using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) may help inform treatment strategies to improve patient outcomes. Recent literature suggests temporal characteristics of rs-fMRI blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signals may offer complementary information to functional connectivity analysis. However, existing studies of OUD analyze BOLD signals using measures computed across all time points. This study, for the first time in the literature, employs data-driven machine learning (ML) modeling of rs-fMRI BOLD features representing multiple time points to identify region(s) of interest that differentiate OUD subjects from healthy controls (HC). Following the triple network model, we obtain rs-fMRI BOLD features from the default mode network (DMN), salience network (SN), and executive control network (ECN) for 31 OUD and 45 HC subjects. Then, we use the Boruta ML algorithm to identify statistically significant BOLD features that differentiate OUD from HC, identifying the DMN as the most salient functional network for OUD. Furthermore, we conduct brain activity mapping, showing heightened neural activity within the DMN for OUD. We perform 5-fold cross-validation classification (OUD vs. HC) experiments to study the discriminative power of functional network features with and without fusing demographic features. The DMN shows the most discriminative power, achieving mean AUC and F1 scores of 80.91% and 73.97%, respectively, when fusing BOLD and demographic features. Follow-up Boruta analysis using BOLD features extracted from the medial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, and left and right temporoparietal junctions reveals significant features for all four functional hubs within the DMN.</description>

      <title>How high dimensional neural dynamics are confined in phase space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High dimensional dynamics play a vital role in brain function, ecological systems, and neuro-inspired machine learning. Where and how these dynamics are confined in the phase space remains challenging to solve. Here, we provide an analytic argument that the confinement region is an M-shape when the neural dynamics show a diversity, with two sharp boundaries and a flat low-density region in between. Despite increasing synaptic strengths in a neural circuit, the shape remains qualitatively the same, while the left boundary is continuously pushed away. However, in deep chaotic regions, an arch-shaped confinement gradually emerges. Our theory is supported by numerical simulations on finite-sized networks. This analytic theory opens up a geometric route towards addressing fundamental questions about high dimensional non-equilibrium dynamics.</description>

      <title>Brain-like Functional Organization within Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The human brain has long inspired the pursuit of artificial intelligence (AI). Recently, neuroimaging studies provide compelling evidence of alignment between the computational representation of artificial neural networks (ANNs) and the neural responses of the human brain to stimuli, suggesting that ANNs may employ brain-like information processing strategies. While such alignment has been observed across sensory modalities--visual, auditory, and linguistic--much of the focus has been on the behaviors of artificial neurons (ANs) at the population level, leaving the functional organization of individual ANs that facilitates such brain-like processes largely unexplored. In this study, we bridge this gap by directly coupling sub-groups of artificial neurons with functional brain networks (FBNs), the foundational organizational structure of the human brain. Specifically, we extract representative patterns from temporal responses of ANs in large language models (LLMs), and use them as fixed regressors to construct voxel-wise encoding models to predict brain activity recorded by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). This framework links the AN sub-groups to FBNs, enabling the delineation of brain-like functional organization within LLMs. Our findings reveal that LLMs (BERT and Llama 1-3) exhibit brain-like functional architecture, with sub-groups of artificial neurons mirroring the organizational patterns of well-established FBNs. Notably, the brain-like functional organization of LLMs evolves with the increased sophistication and capability, achieving an improved balance between the diversity of computational behaviors and the consistency of functional specializations. This research represents the first exploration of brain-like functional organization within LLMs, offering novel insights to inform the development of artificial general intelligence (AGI) with human brain principles.</description>

      <title>Kuramoto Oscillators With Asymmetric Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a system of coupled oscillators of the Sakaguchi-Kuramoto type with interactions including a phase delay. We consider the case of a coupling matrix such that oscillators with large natural frequencies drive all slower ones but not the reverse. This scheme is inspired by Hebbian learning in neuroscience. We propose a simple model which is partly solvable analytically and shows many unusual features. For example, for the case of phase delay $\pi/2$ (a symmetric phase response curve) with symmetric coupling there is no synchronous behavior. But in the asymmetric coupling case, there are phase-locked states, i.e., states where many oscillators have the same frequency, but with substantial phase differences.</description>

      <title>A prescriptive theory for brain-like inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) is a widely used objective for training deep generative models, such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). In the neuroscience literature, an identical objective is known as the variational free energy, hinting at a potential unified framework for brain function and machine learning. Despite its utility in interpreting generative models, including diffusion models, ELBO maximization is often seen as too broad to offer prescriptive guidance for specific architectures in neuroscience or machine learning. In this work, we show that maximizing ELBO under Poisson assumptions for general sequence data leads to a spiking neural network that performs Bayesian posterior inference through its membrane potential dynamics. The resulting model, the iterative Poisson VAE (iP-VAE), has a closer connection to biological neurons than previous brain-inspired predictive coding models based on Gaussian assumptions. Compared to amortized and iterative VAEs, iP-VAElearns sparser representations and exhibits superior generalization to out-of-distribution samples. These findings suggest that optimizing ELBO, combined with Poisson assumptions, provides a solid foundation for developing prescriptive theories in NeuroAI.</description>

      <title>Evolving choice hysteresis in reinforcement learning: comparing the adaptive value of positivity bias and gradual perseveration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The tendency of repeating past choices more often than expected from the history of outcomes has been repeatedly empirically observed in reinforcement learning experiments. It can be explained by at least two computational processes: asymmetric update and (gradual) choice perseveration. A recent meta-analysis showed that both mechanisms are detectable in human reinforcement learning. However, while their descriptive value seems to be well established, they have not been compared regarding their possible adaptive value. In this study, we address this gap by simulating reinforcement learning agents in a variety of environments with a new variant of an evolutionary algorithm. Our results show that positivity bias (in the form of asymmetric update) is evolutionary stable in many situations, while the emergence of gradual perseveration is less systematic and robust. Overall, our results illustrate that biases can be adaptive and selected by evolution, in an environment-specific manner.</description>

      <title>Human-like Episodic Memory for Infinite Context LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09450v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities, but still struggle with processing extensive contexts, limiting their ability to maintain coherence and accuracy over long sequences. In contrast, the human brain excels at organising and retrieving episodic experiences across vast temporal scales, spanning a lifetime. In this work, we introduce EM-LLM, a novel approach that integrates key aspects of human episodic memory and event cognition into LLMs with no fine-tuning, enabling them to handle practically infinite context lengths while maintaining computational efficiency. EM-LLM organises sequences of tokens into coherent episodic events using a combination of Bayesian surprise and graph-theoretic boundary refinement in an online fashion. When needed, these events are retrieved through a two-stage memory process, combining similarity-based and temporally contiguous retrieval for efficient and human-like access to relevant information. Experiments on the LongBench and InfiniteBench benchmarks demonstrate EM-LLM's superior performance, consistently outperforming the state-of-the-art retrieval model InfLLM across various baseline LLMs. In addition, EM-LLM outperforms its popular counterpart, RAG, in a wide range of tasks, while requiring similar resources. Notably, EM-LLM's performance even surpasses full-context models in most tasks, while successfully performing retrieval across 10 million tokens - a scale computationally infeasible for such models. Finally, our analysis reveals strong correlations between EM-LLM's event segmentation and human-perceived events, suggesting a bridge between this artificial system and its biological counterpart, thereby offering a novel computational framework for exploring human memory mechanisms.</description>
