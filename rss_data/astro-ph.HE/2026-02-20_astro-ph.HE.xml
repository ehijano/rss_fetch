      <title>A positive period derivative in the quasi-periodic eruptions of ZTF19acnskyy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the first direct measurement of the period derivative in a quasi-periodic eruption (QPE), finding a smoothly increasing period with $\dot{P}\approx (1.7\pm 0.02)\times10^{-2}$ d d$^{-1}$ in the source ZTF19acnskyy/"Ansky". Most models for QPEs invoke repeated interactions of a stellar-mass orbiting companion around the supermassive black hole (SMBH) in an extreme mass-ratio inspiral (EMRI). In these scenarios, a positive $\dot{P}$ is surprising, but not impossible to produce. We explore several possible explanations for the observed $\dot{P}$, including stable mass-transfer driven by impulsive mass loss events in an EMRI, velocity kicks at pericenter due to tidal interactions with the SMBH, apparent period changes due either to general relativistic precession effects in an EMRI or light travel-time delays in a hierarchical SMBH binary, and mass-transfer variations in a thermal/viscous disk instability model. We find that none of the considered models provides a complete explanation for the data, motivating further work on physical explanations for positive period derivatives in QPEs.</description>

      <title>Investigating IceCube Neutrino Alerts with the HAWC $\gamma$-Ray Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutrino emission from astrophysical sources has long been considered a signature of cosmic-ray acceleration. The IceCube neutrino observatory has observed a diffuse flux of TeV-PeV neutrinos, but very few confirmed sources have emerged. With the recent publication of IceCube Event Catalog (IceCat-1), IceCube has released a list of the most promising astrophysical neutrino events since May 2011. Using the archival data from the High Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) $\gamma$-ray observatory, we perform a coincidence search for gamma rays and neutrinos using a Bayesian Block algorithm with the public IceCube alerts from IceCat-1, along with additional alerts issued later. In this work, we consider 368 alerts, up to July 8, 2025, that are within HAWC's field of view. We observe approximately a 5\% coincident detection rate, which is consistent with expectations from background. Two of these detections contain the Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) Markarian 421 and Markarian 501. We discuss the likelihood that the neutrino/$\gamma$-ray coincidences are false positives and a brief overview of the results.</description>

      <title>X-ray Spectral-Timing Properties of Tidal Disruption Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform the first systematic study of the minute-to-hours-timescale stochastic variability observed in the X-ray luminosity of tidal disruption events (TDEs) using XMM-Newton data and Fourier analysis methods. We measure the spectral properties, power spectral densities (PSDs), fractional variability amplitudes, and energy dependence of the variability for 18 TDEs spanning 54 observations, of which 27 occur in thermal disk-dominated states and 27 show a nonthermal hard X-ray corona. Compared to pure thermal sources, we find TDEs with coronae are more X-ray variable and show steeper PSDs indicating longer correlation timescales. This state-transition behavior is qualitatively similar to X-ray binaries, which show higher fractional variability in the hard state than in the soft state. However, newborn TDE coronae show systematically flatter PSDs and softer energy spectra than their long-lived AGN counterparts. We also show that the variability amplitude of thermal TDEs increases with photon energy, consistent with variations sourced by local temperature fluctuations and exponentially enhanced in the Wien tail. Our work demonstrates that combining spectral and timing properties of X-ray TDEs can probe the microphysics of newly formed accretion flows around supermassive black holes, and that the coronae formed in TDEs fundamentally differ from those in AGN.</description>

      <title>Theory of striped dynamic spectra of the Crab pulsar high-frequency interpulse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A theory of the spectral "zebra" pattern of the Crab pulsar's high-frequency interpulse (HFIP) radio emission is developed. The observed emission bands are interference maxima caused by multiple ray propagation through the pulsar magnetosphere. The high-contrast interference pattern is the combined effect of gravitational lensing and plasma de-lensing of light rays. The model enables space-resolved tomography of the pulsar magnetosphere, yielding a radial plasma density profile of $n_{e}\propto r^{-3}$, which agrees with theoretical insights. We predict the zebra pattern trend to change at a higher frequency when the ray separation becomes smaller than the pulsar size. This frequency is predicted to be in the range between 42 GHz and 650 GHz, which is within the reach of existing facilities like ALMA and SMA. These observations hold significant importance and would contribute to our understanding of the magnetosphere. Furthermore, they offer the potential to investigate gravity in the strong field regime near the star's surface.</description>

      <title>Illuminating the Mass Gap Through Deep Optical Constraint on a Neutron Star Merger Candidate S250206dm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gravitational wave (GW) event S250206dm, as the first well-localized neutron star merger candidate potentially located in the mass gap, presented a unique opportunity to probe the electromagnetic signatures from such a system. Here we report a deep, multiband search with the new 2.5-meter Wide Field Survey Telescope (WFST), covering about 64% of the localization region up to a 5-sigma limiting magnitude of 23 mag. In total, 12 potential candidates have been identified while none of them are likely related to S250206dm. This non-detection provides the most stringent constraint to date on any associated kilonova. Crucially, an AT 2017gfo-like event at 269 Mpc can be excluded by WFST observations alone. Based on ejecta mass limits, a neutron star-black hole with a large mass ratio (Q &gt;= 3.2) is disfavored. This optical-derived constraint on the mass ratio reaches, for the first time, a precision comparable to that inferred from the GW signal. This work presents the best observation of this type of events until now, and demonstrates the power of rapid, deep follow-up observations to constrain the properties of compact binary progenitors, offering key insights into the constituents of the mass gap.</description>

      <title>WFST Supernovae in the First Year: I. Statistical Study of 16 Early-phase Type Ia Supernovae from the Pilot Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we present 16 early-phase type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) discovered during the pilot survey of the 2.5-meter Wide Field Survey Telescope (WFST-PS) from March 4 to July 10, 2024, including three SNe Ia with early-excess emission features (EExSNe Ia). The discovery magnitude of the 16 WFST-PS early-phase SNe is at least 3 mag fainter than their peak brightness. A large scatter of color indices is found in approximately the first 10 days of supernova explosions, indicating diverse photometric behaviors in the early phase. Three EExSNe Ia show relatively brighter peak luminosities and longer rise time compared to those of non-EExSNe Ia. The results indicate that current theoretical models require further refinement to fully capture the early photometric evolution of SNe Ia. Based on the initial high-cadence ugr-band data from the WFST-PS survey, we emphasize that early near-ultraviolet (NUV) observations are indispensable for placing tight constraints on the explosion mechanisms and progenitor systems of SNe Ia.</description>

      <title>WFST Supernovae in the First Year: II. SN 2024aedt: Systematical Study of a Transitional Type Ia Supernova</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present comprehensive photometric and spectroscopic observations of a transitional type Ia SN 2024aedt, discovered by the 2.5-meter Wide Field Survey Telescope (WFST) within one day of the explosion. Its light curve is characterized by a peak absolute magnitude of $M_B = -18.49 \pm 0.03$ mag and a decline rate of $\Delta m_{15}(B) = 1.53 \pm 0.36$ mag, placing the object on the $\Delta m_{15}(B)$--$M_B$ diagram in the transition region between normal and subluminous SNe Ia. Furthermore, the early-color evolution and host galaxy environment of SN 2024aedt underscore its transitional nature, sharing properties with both normal and 91bg-like SNe Ia. Light-curve modeling with MOSFiT yields a synthesized $^{56}\mathrm{Ni}$ mass of $0.414 \pm 0.042\,M_{\odot}$ and a total ejecta mass of $0.548 \pm 0.108\,M_{\odot}$. A comparison with theoretical models suggests that the evolutionary trend can be broadly explained by both delayed-detonation (DDT) and double-detonation (DDet) scenarios while possible early-excess emissions predicted by DDet cannot be identified given the limited detections soon after the SN explosion. Although the overall spectral evolution of SN 2024aedt is similar to that of other transitional SNe Ia, the spectroscopic comparison reveals diversity in the early-phase blue-end features, which becomes more homogeneous at later phases. The result indicates the importance of early-time observations in understanding the origin of SN Ia diversity.</description>

      <title>WFST Supernovae in the First Year: III. Systematical Study of the Photometric Behavior of Early-phase Core-collapse Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the multiband photometric properties of seven supernovae (SNe) showing double-peaked light-curve evolution and prominent shock-cooling emission, observed by the Wide Field Survey Telescope (WFST) during its first year of operation. By jointly employing an analytic early shock-cooling model and the Arnett radioactive-diffusion model, we fit the bolometric light curves and infer ejecta masses in the range $1.1$-$2.6 M_\odot$, consistent with a transitional population between ultra-stripped supernovae (USSNe) and normal stripped-envelope supernovae (SESNe). The envelope masses are estimated to be $M_{\rm env}=0.1$-$0.4 M_\odot$, while the progenitors are constrained to be yellow or blue supergiants (YSGs/BSGs) with radii of $R=120$-$300 R_\odot$. Using empirical relations, we estimate progenitor luminosities of $L=10^{4.6}$-$10^{4.9} L_\odot$, corresponding to zero-age main-sequence (ZAMS) masses of $8$-$20 M_\odot$. Theoretical models suggest that such progenitors are more naturally produced through binary evolution channels, as single-star evolutionary pathways are unable to yield ejecta masses this low.</description>

      <title>Modeling of Relativistic Plasmas with a Conservative Discontinuous Galerkin Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new method for solving the relativistic Vlasov--Maxwell system of equations, applicable to a wide range of extreme high-energy-density astrophysical and laboratory environments. The method directly discretizes the kinetic equation on a high-dimensional phase-space grid using a discontinuous Galerkin finite element approach, yielding a high-order, conservative numerical scheme that is free from the Poisson noise inherent to traditional Monte-Carlo methods. A novel and flexible velocity-space mapping technique enables the efficient treatment of the wide range of energy scales characteristic of relativistic plasmas, including QED pair-production discharges, instabilities in strongly magnetized plasmas surrounding neutron stars, and relativistic magnetic reconnection. Our noise-free approach is capable of providing unique insight into plasma dynamics, enabling detailed analysis of electromagnetic emission and fine-scale phase-space structure.</description>

      <title>The spectral state transition of Mkn 590, a potential link between AGNs and X-ray binaries?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Seyfert galaxy Markarian 590 offers a rare glimpse into the dynamic life cycle of black hole accretion, captured across multiple wavelengths from the years 1975 to 2025. Using the decade-long multi-band observations from the Swift observatory, we capture a clear spectral state transition analogous to those seen in X-ray binaries but seldom observed in a single AGN. We track a complete AGN state transition in real time, as the source evolves from a faint, hard X-ray state to a bright, UV- and soft X-ray dominated phase. The X-ray loudness parameter $\alpha_{ox}$ follows a pronounced 'V'-shaped dependence on Eddington ratio $\lambda_{Edd}$, with a break at $\lambda_{Edd}$ = 0.021 +/- 0.008, coinciding with thresholds identified in population studies of changing-look quasars and X-ray binaries. Across this transition, Mkn 590 evolves through distinct accretion regimes in the Hardness Intensity Diagrams (HID): faint, flaring, transitional, and bright, on a timescale of $\sim$10 years, which is well below classical viscous timescales for a geometrically thin disk but in agreement with the propagation of thermal wavefronts in the inner disk. When placed on the Fundamental Plane of black hole activity, the source broadly follows the expected radio/X-ray mass scaling, though with a 70% flatter slope, pointing towards a persistent coronal-jet coupling even in radiatively efficient states. Together, our results establish Mkn 590 as a rare, time-resolved case of AGN state transitions and offer compelling evidence for scale-invariant accretion physics across the black hole mass spectrum.</description>

Abstract: Neutron stars provide a unique environment to probe the properties of dense nuclear matter. In this work, we present a comparative study between two approaches to modeling the neutron star structure: a Chiral Effective Field Theory based approach and the MUSES Calculation Engine framework, which uses three different approaches for the three density regions.

      <title>Fast pre-merger detection of massive black-hole binaries in LISA based on time-frequency excess power</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna is expected to observe gravitational waves from massive black hole binaries across cosmic time. Many are anticipated to be detectable hours to weeks before coalescence. We present a fast algorithm for the pre-merger detection and preliminary characterization of such binaries. The method performs a search for excess power with a chirping time-frequency morphology in short-time Fourier transform spectrograms. By tiling the time-frequency plane with slices defined by the quadrupole frequency evolution, we define a signal significance relative to a fitted background distribution of instrumental noise and Galactic foreground. Individual search triggers are followed by a coherence tracker, which groups over time triggers consistent with the same physical signal . Doing so, our analysis provides progressively refined estimates of the chirp mass and coalescence time. We validate our algorithm on the Sangria LISA Data Challenge dataset, successfully detecting all 15 injected MBHBs: 14 of them hours-to-weeks before merger, while one is only detected after the binary coalescence. The algorithm yields chirp mass relative errors below $3\%$ for high-SNR sources and coalescence time uncertainties of up to a few hours. With a computational cost of less than a second to process a 10-day data segment on single core, our approach is suitable for generating real-time alerts, trigger protected observational periods, and provide informative priors for Bayesian parameter estimation.</description>

      <title>Analytical Estimates of Gravitational Wave Background Anisotropies from Shot Noise and Large-Scale Structure in Pulsar Timing Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An important next step for pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) is to measure anisotropies in the gravitational wave background (GWB) at $\sim$ nano-Hz frequencies. We calculate the expected GWB anisotropies using empirically calibrated models for the merger rates of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs). The anisotropies reflect both shot-noise in the discrete SMBHB populations while also tracing, in part, the large-scale structure (LSS) of the universe. The shot-noise term is sensitive to the high-mass end of the merging SMBH mass function, depends somewhat on the low-redshift tail of the merger distribution, and is a strong function of observing frequency. The precise frequency dependence provides a test of SMBHB residence times. In our models, the mean shot-noise anisotropy typically lies close to or above the broad frequency-band NANOGrav upper limits. Consequently, near-future PTA data, and potentially re-analyses of existing measurements using frequency-dependent shot-noise anisotropy templates, should be capable of detecting this signal or placing meaningful constraints on SMBHB merger models. A full interpretation, however, will require modeling the probability distribution of shot-noise amplitudes rather than relying solely on ensemble-averaged predictions. The LSS-induced anisotropies are at least two to three orders of magnitude smaller. Although the LSS contribution contains valuable information regarding the redshift distribution and clustering bias of the merging SMBHBs, detecting this component will be challenging.</description>

      <title>Extreme-mass ratio inspirals in Schwarzschild - de Sitter spacetime I: Weak-field orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The inspiral of a compact object into a black hole is a key source of low-frequency gravitational waves for future space-based detectors like LISA. While models of this process have advanced, they typically focus on asymptotically flat spacetimes. In this paper, we explore how the absence of asymptotic flatness affects the slow, adiabatic orbital evolution due to radiation reaction. This lack of asymptotic flatness can arise from external environments or an expanding universe. Using the Schwarzschild-de Sitter (SdS) spacetime, where the deviation from flatness is governed by the cosmological constant, we study bound orbits characterized by their semi-latus rectum $p$ and eccentricity $e$. We calculate how the cosmological constant shifts the separatrix between bound and plunging orbits and alters the relationship between the binary's binding energy, angular momentum, and orbital parameters. Assuming the orbital timescale is much shorter than the inspiral timescale, we apply a modified quadrupole formula to examine the impact of a small positive cosmological constant on the orbital evolution in the weak-field limit. We find that the cosmological constant accelerates the decrease in eccentricity, reducing inspiral plunge times, which could influence event rate estimates for space-based detectors.</description>

      <title>A Kinetic Route to Helicity-Constrained Decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Through 2D3V PIC simulations of freely decaying sub-ion turbulence, intermittent localized regions with $\mathbf{E} \cdot \mathbf{B} \neq 0$ are found to be statistically associated with reductions in the magnitude of magnetic helicity while evolving in the early electron-scale interaction phase. Motivated by this behavior, we propose a source-compensated, history-dependent helicity density that satisfies an exact local balance identity by construction, enabling Saffman-type two-point correlation integrals which, under standard flux-decorrelation assumptions, can exhibit intermediate-scale plateaus that are roughly time-independent. In our simulations we demonstrate such plateaus to remain approximately invariant even as the usual Saffman helicity integral plateau value $I_H$ evolves during the early kinetic stage. Under approximate single-scale self-similarity, the plateau behavior of the magnetic integral is consistent with the 2D decay constraint $BL \sim \text{const}$. For initially net-helical configurations, we observe rapid development of mixed-signed magnetic helicity patches and a decrease of the global fractional helicity, such that the decay over the kinetic interval is again most consistent with the cancellation-dominated scaling constraint.</description>

      <title>Late-blooming magnetars: awakening as long period transients after a dormant cooling epoch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05373v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Long-period transients are an elusive class of compact objects uncovered by radio surveys. While magnetars are a leading candidate for those sources that appear isolated, several observational properties challenge the established evolutionary framework: (i) low quiescent X-ray luminosities, (ii) $\sim$hour-long rotational periods, and (iii) highly-variable radio flux. It is shown via magnetothermal modelling that, if electric currents thread the fluid core at the time of crust freezing, the neutron star remains multiband silent for an initial period of approximately 0.1 Myr while cooling passively. Once the crust becomes cold enough, the Hall effect begins to dominate the magnetic evolution, triggering crustal failures that inject magnetospheric twist that initiates radio pulsing while depleting rotational kinetic energy from an already-slow star. Depending on where electric currents circulate, such 'late-blooming' magnetars manifesting as long-period transients may thus form a distinct branch from soft gamma repeaters and anomalous X-ray pulsars.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05737v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We search for Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) by re-analyzing the spectral lag data for GRB 190114C from Fermi-GBM using frequentist analysis, where we deal with the astrophysical nuisance parameters using profile likelihood. For this use case, we find a global minima for the $\chi^2$ as a function of energy scale of LIV ($E_{QG}$), well below the Planck scale. The best-fit $1\sigma$ central intervals for $E_{QG}$ are given by $2.81^{+0.50}_{-0.37}\times 10^{14}$ GeV and $9.85^{+0.84}_{-0.60}\times 10^{5}$ GeV for linear and quadratic LIV, respectively, and agree with the Bayesian estimates obtained so far in a previous work. Therefore, the results from the frequentist analysis of GRB 190114C agree with Bayesian analysis.</description>

      <title>Particle injection in three-dimensional relativistic magnetic reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14886v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Relativistic magnetic reconnection has been proposed as an important nonthermal particle acceleration (NTPA) mechanism that generates power-law spectra and high-energy emissions. Power-law particle spectra are in general characterized by three parameters: the power-law index, the high-energy cutoff, and the low-energy cutoff (i.e., the injection energy). Particle injection into the nonthermal power law, despite also being a critical step in the NTPA chain, has received considerably less attention than the subsequent acceleration to high energies. Open questions on particle injection that are important for both physical understanding and astronomical observations include how the upstream magnetization~$\sigma$ influences the injection energy and the contributions of the known injection mechanisms (i.e., direct acceleration by the reconnection electric field, Fermi kicks, and pickup acceleration) to the injected particle population. Using fully kinetic particle-in-cell simulations, we uncover these relationships by systematically measuring the injection energy and calculating the contributions of each acceleration mechanism to the total injected particle population. We also present a theoretical model to explain these results. Additionally, we compare two- and three-dimensional simulations to assess the impact of the flux-rope kink and drift-kink instability on particle injection. We conclude with comparisons with previous work and outlook for future work.</description>

      <title>Ultra-long Gamma-ray Bursts from Micro-Tidal Disruption Events: The Case of GRB 250702B</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22779v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultra-long gamma-ray bursts (ULGRBs), a rare class of high-energy transients with durations $&gt;10^3$s, remain poorly understood. GRB 250702B is notable for its multi-hour prompt emission, an X-ray pre-peak emission starting $\sim$1 day earlier, off-nuclear host position, and hard, rapidly variable gamma-rays. This combination is difficult to explain with standard ULGRB progenitors such as blue-supergiant collapsars, magnetar engines, or white-dwarf tidal disruptions by intermediate-mass black holes. We interpret the event as a micro-tidal disruption event ($\mu$TDE), where a stellar-mass black hole or neutron star partially or fully disrupts a main-sequence star. Three $\mu$TDE pathways can reproduce the observed pre-peak emission to main flare delay: (i) a dynamical (partial/repeating) disruption, in which a grazing passage yields a faint precursor and the core returns after $\sim$day for a deeper encounter; (ii) a natal-kick disruption, where the delay reflects the ballistic motion of a newborn compact object relative to its companion, leading to full disruption; and (iii) a hybrid natal-kick + partial case, in which the kick seeds the close encounter but the first passage is only partial, with the core returning on the day-scale period. Cross-section scalings imply comparable rates for partial and full outcomes in both dynamical and natal-kick scenarios. The highly variable, hard $\gamma$-ray emission supports association with a stellar-mass compact object. Fallback and viscous accretion naturally explain the ultra-long duration, energetics, and ks-scale X-ray variability. We outline observational discriminants between the three channels and argue that $\mu$TDEs offer a compelling framework for ULGRBs such as GRB 250702B.</description>

      <title>Quarkyonic Neutron Stars as Candidates for the GW230529 Mass-Gap Object</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14266v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine whether quarkyonic equations of state (EOS) can account for compact objects in the $2.5$-$4.5\,M_\odot$ mass range reported for the GW230529 gravitational-wave event. The pressure-energy density and mass-radius (M-R) relations obtained from quarkyonic EOS models indicate a significant stiffening at high densities, allowing stable configurations beyond $2.5\,M_\odot$. The predicted M-R sequences extend into the GW230529 mass window while maintaining radii in the range of $\approx 13$-$15$~km, suggesting that quarkyonic stars can naturally populate the so-called compact object mass gap. These results imply that the heavier component of GW230529 could plausibly be a massive quarkyonic neutron star rather than a low-mass black hole.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07649v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a unified charge-dependent solar modulation model by solving the three-dimensional Parker transport equation, incorporating a realistic wavy heliospheric current sheet to treat drift effects self-consistently. Using a local interstellar spectrum from GALPROP constrained by Voyager data, we fit the model to time-resolved proton and antiproton fluxes measured by the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer - 02 (AMS-02) during the solar-quiet period (May 2011 to June 2022). To enable rapid parameter scans, we employ neural-network-based surrogate models to compute propagation and modulation matrices efficiently. The results demonstrate that the model simultaneously describes the observed proton and antiproton fluxes with physically reasonable parameters, providing a unified account of charge-dependent modulation.</description>

      <title>GOTO identification and broadband modelling of the counterpart to the SVOM GRB 250818B</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.16559v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rapid localisation and follow-up of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) increasingly rely on low-latency triggers from new missions coupled to wide-field robotic optical facilities. We present the discovery and multi-wavelength follow-up of GRB 250818B, detected by the Space Variable Objects Monitor (SVOM) and localised optically by the Gravitational-wave Optical Transient Observer (GOTO). We compile and homogenise X-ray, optical/NIR, and radio data to build broadband light curves and spectral energy distributions. The afterglow is unusually luminous for a nominal short GRB, lying on the bright end of the short-GRB population in X-rays and optical and among the most luminous high-redshift short-GRB afterglows in the radio. MeerKAT detects the source at 3.1 GHz, while ALMA provides deep higher-frequency limits. Keck/LRIS spectroscopy shows continuum and metal absorption (Fe II, Mg II, Mg I), giving $z=1.216$. Synchrotron forward-shock modelling favours a constant-density medium and strongly prefers refreshed (energy-injection) emission, well described by a two-component jet with $E_{K,iso} \sim 4\times10^{52}$ erg, $n_0 \sim 3.6$ cm$^{-3}$, $\theta_j \simeq 0.10$ rad ($\sim 5.7$ deg), and $p \simeq 1.64$. The host association is ambiguous: the nearest LS DR10 galaxy candidate ($r_{AB} \sim 24.7$) is offset by $\sim 4$ arcsec ($\sim 34$ kpc) with chance-alignment probability $P_{cc} \sim 0.2$, and current imaging does not exclude a fainter, near-coincident host. SED fitting of the candidate host suggests a low-mass galaxy. GRB 250818B highlights the power of rapid wide-field counterpart identification in the SVOM era, while host-association uncertainty can still limit offset-based interpretation.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Star Properties with NJL and MFTQCD Model: A Bayesian Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15337v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The composition of the core of neutron stars (NS) is still under debate. One possibility is that because of the high densities reached in their cores, matter could be deconfined into quark matter. We investigate the existence of hybrid stars, using microscopic models to describe different phases of matter. Within the adopted microscopic models we calculate properties of NS and properties of matter. We want to probe the pQCD calculations influence and analyze properties that identify a transition to deconfined matter. Bayesian approach is applied to generate 8 sets of equations of state (EOS). A Maxwell construction is adopted to describe the deconfinement transition. For the hadron phase, we consider a stiff and a soft EOS obtained from the Relativistic Mean Field model with nonlinear meson terms. For the quark phase, we use 2 different models: the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model with multiquark interactions and the Mean Field Theory of QCD, a model similar to the vector MIT bag model. Bayesian inference was applied to determine the model parameters that satisfy the X-ray observations from NICER and have phase transition at densities between 0.15 - 0.40 fm$^{-3}$. We also applied restrictions from the pQCD calculations to half of the sets. Hybrid stars are compatible with current observational data. The pQCD restrictions reduce the value of the $M_{max}$. However, even applying this restriction, the models were able to reach values of $2.1 - 2.3 M_\odot$. The conformal limit was still not attained at the center of the most massive stars. The vector interactions are essential to describe hybrid stars with a mass above $2 M_\odot$. The multiquark interactions introduced may affect the limits of some quantities considered as indicators of the presence of a deconfined phase. It is possible to find a set of EOS, that predict that inside NS the renormalized matter trace anomaly is always positive.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04491v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present GollumFit, a framework designed for performing binned-likelihood analyses on neutrino telescope data. GollumFit incorporates model parameters common to any neutrino telescope and also model parameters specific to the IceCube Neutrino Observatory. We provide a high-level overview of its key features and how the code is organized. We then discuss the performance of the fitting in a typical analysis scenario, highlighting the ability to fit over tens of nuisance parameters. We present some examples showing how to use the package for likelihood minimization tasks. This framework uniquely incorporates the particular model parameters necessary for neutrino telescopes, and solves an associated likelihood problem in a time-efficient manner.</description>

Abstract: The Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog (GWTC) is a collection of candidate gravitational-wave transient signals identified and characterized by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration. Producing the contents of the GWTC from detector data requires complex analysis methods. These comprise techniques to model the signal; identify the transients in the data; evaluate the quality of the data and mitigate possible instrumental issues; infer the parameters of each transient; compare the data with the waveform models for compact binary coalescences; and handle the large amount of results associated with all these different analyses. In this paper, we describe the methods employed to produce the catalog's fourth release, GWTC-4.0, focusing on the analysis of the first part of the fourth observing run of Advanced LIGO, Advanced Virgo and KAGRA.</description>

      <title>Self-regularized entropy: What does black hole entropy predict for tests of Kerr no-hair theorem?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20421v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the canonical (brick-wall) entropy of Hawking radiation in a in a quantum black hole model whose strong-field exterior is modeled phenomenologically, to first order in a small quadrupole parameter, by the static q-metric, which is an exact vacuum solution of the Einstein equations. WKB counting of trapped near-horizon cavity modes shows that, within the perturbative small-deformation regime studied here, a modest quadrupolar deformation self-regularizes the ultraviolet divergence: the entropy becomes finite without an ad hoc cutoff. Adopting the Hawking temperature and the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of a Schwarzschild black hole of the same mass as external thermodynamic inputs, matching this canonical entropy to that benchmark yields an entropy-motivated deformation scale which, when interpreted phenomenologically in a stationary extension, corresponds to percent-to-tens-of-percent violations of the Kerr multipole relations, and provides concrete observational targets for the Next Generation Event Horizon Telescope (ngEHT), the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), and planned third-generation (3G) ground-based gravitational wave observatories.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian Inference of Hybrid Stars with Large Quark Cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02653v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutron stars (NSs) are interesting objects capable of reaching densities unattainable on Earth. The properties of matter under these conditions remain a mystery. Exotic matter, including quark matter, may be present in the NS core. In this work, we explore the possible compositions of NS cores, in particular, the possible existence of large quark cores. We use the Relativistic Mean Field (RMF) model with nonlinear terms for the hadron phase and the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model and Mean Field Theory of Quantum Chromodynamics (MFTQCD) for the quark phase. Through Bayesian inference, we obtain different sets of equations: four sets with hybrid equations and one set with only the hadron phase. We impose constraints regarding the properties of nuclear matter, X-ray observational data from NICER, gravitational wave data from the binary neutron star merger GW170817, perturbative QCD (pQCD) calculations, and causality. The MFTQCD allows for a phase transition to quark matter at low densities, just above saturation density, while for the NJL sets, the phase transition occurs above twice the saturation density. As a result, the MFTQCD model predicts the presence of quark matter in the inner core of 1.4 M$_\odot$ NSs, while NJL models suggest a low probability of quark matter in the interior of a 1.4 M$_\odot$ NS. Both models predict the existence of quark matter in 2 M$_\odot$ NSs. The slope of the mass-radius curve has been shown to carry information about the presence of quark matter. In particular, a positive slope at 1.8 M$_\odot$ indicates the presence of non-nucleonic matter. A hybrid star with a stiff quark equation of state could explain a larger radius in more massive stars, such as two solar mass stars, compared to canonical NSs.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic flows in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm{NN}}} = 2.4\,\text{GeV}$ with a Skyrme pseudopotential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20387v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Within the framework of the lattice Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck transport model, we present a systematic study of proton anisotropic flow observables measured by the HADES collaboration, by utilizing the recently developed density-, momentum- and isospin-dependent N$5$LO Skyrme pseudopotential. In particular, we investigate the impacts of the momentum dependence of nucleon mean-field potentials, the stiffness of symmetric nuclear matter (SNM) EOS, the high-density behaviors of the symmetry energy and the in-medium modification of nucleon-nucleon elastic cross sections on proton $v_{1}$, $v_{2}$, $v_{3}$, and $v_{4}$ in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm{NN}}} = 2.4\,\text{GeV}$. Our results show that the proton anisotropic flows are strongly sensitive to the momentum dependence of nucleon mean-field potential as well as the incompressibility coefficient $K_0$ of SNM. In addition, the transverse momentum dependence of the proton $v_2$ exhibits a modest sensitivity to the higher-order skewness coefficient $J_0$ and kurtosis coefficient $I_0$ of SNM as well as the momentum dependence of the symmetry potential, while the transverse momentum dependence of the proton $v_1$ is shown to modestly depend on the in-medium modification of nucleon-nucleon elastic cross sections. Moreover, the high-density symmetry energy seems to have limited effects on the proton anisotropic flows. These findings highlight the necessity of considering the momentum dependence of nucleon mean-field potentials including the symmetry potential, the higher-order characteristic parameters of SNM EOS beyond $K_0$, and the in-medium modification of nucleon-nucleon elastic cross sections, in future Bayesian transport model analyses on proton anisotropic flows in heavy-ion collisions at HADES energies, thereby to extract information on nuclear matter EOS as well as the associated underlying nuclear effective interactions.</description>

      <title>Nucleon Short-Range Correlations and High-Momentum Dynamics: Implications on the Equation of State of Dense Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04206v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nucleon short-range correlations (SRCs) and their high-momentum tails (HMTs) encode key short-range dynamics in nuclei and dense matter. This review provides a concise overview of SRC features relevant to the Equation of State (EOS) of isospin-asymmetric nuclear matter. We summarize empirical and theoretical properties of the single-nucleon momentum distribution $n(k)$, emphasizing the role of the neutron--proton tensor force, the dominance of correlated np pairs, and the enhancement of minority-species HMTs. Links to nucleon effective E-masses, quasi-deuteron components, and orbital entanglement are briefly noted. We examine how SRC-induced HMTs modify kinetic and potential contributions to the EOS in both non-relativistic and relativistic frameworks, including the softening of the kinetic symmetry energy and departures from the isospin parabolic approximation of asymmetric nuclear EOS. Sensitivity to high-momentum components and generalizations to arbitrary dimensions are also highlighted. Implications for heavy-ion reactions are summarized, including effects on particle yields, collective flows, deeply sub-threshold particle production and hard photon emission, driven by modified initial nucleon momentum distributions and abundant high relative-momentum np pairs during the reaction. Finally, we outline SRC-HMT consequences for neutron-star matter, covering proton fractions, tidal deformabilities, $Z$-factors, cooling, and the core--crust transition, as well as possible connections to dark-matter interactions in dense environments.</description>

      <title>A compact object with a K type star companion in the solar neighborhood: a wide post common envelope binary with a white dwarf candidate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15619v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Post-common envelope binaries (PCEBs) consisting of a white dwarf (WD) plus a main-sequence (MS) star can constrain current prescriptions of common envelope evolution (CEE) and calibrate theoretical models of binary formation and evolution. Most PCEBs studied to date have typical orbital periods of hours to a few days and can be well explained by assuming inefficient CEE to expel the envelope. However, there are currently several systems with relatively wide orbital periods ($&gt;$18 days). To explain these wide PCEBs, additional sources of energy have been suggested to be taken into account. Here, we present the discovery and observational characterization of a compact object ($M\,\geq\,0.58\,\rm M_{\odot}$) with a K-type star companion in the solar neighborhood ($d\sim 112$ pc) and an orbital period of $P_{\rm orb}\sim 14$ days. The compact object binary is likely to be a system consisting of a WD and a barium dwarf, making it the shortest-period barium star binary candidate. Such a system with an orbital period within the gap between tight and wide binaries provides a test of whether additional energy sources are required to explain its formation. Using binary evolution models, we investigate the evolutionary history of this wide PCEB system and find that the observed properties of this source can be explained without invoking any extra energy source.</description>
