      <title>GeoPl@ntNet: A Platform for Exploring Essential Biodiversity Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper describes GeoPl@ntNet, an interactive web application designed to make Essential Biodiversity Variables accessible and understandable to everyone through dynamic maps and fact sheets. Its core purpose is to allow users to explore high-resolution AI-generated maps of species distributions, habitat types, and biodiversity indicators across Europe. These maps, developed through a cascading pipeline involving convolutional neural networks and large language models, provide an intuitive yet information-rich interface to better understand biodiversity, with resolutions as precise as 50x50 meters. The website also enables exploration of specific regions, allowing users to select areas of interest on the map (e.g., urban green spaces, protected areas, or riverbanks) to view local species and their coverage. Additionally, GeoPl@ntNet generates comprehensive reports for selected regions, including insights into the number of protected species, invasive species, and endemic species.</description>

      <title>XAI-Driven Deep Learning for Protein Sequence Functional Group Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proteins perform essential biological functions, and accurate classification of their sequences is critical for understanding structure-function relationships, enzyme mechanisms, and molecular interactions. This study presents a deep learning-based framework for functional group classification of protein sequences derived from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). Four architectures were implemented: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM), CNN-BiLSTM hybrid, and CNN with Attention. Each model was trained using k-mer integer encoding to capture both local and long-range dependencies. Among these, the CNN achieved the highest validation accuracy of 91.8%, demonstrating the effectiveness of localized motif detection. Explainable AI techniques, including Grad-CAM and Integrated Gradients, were applied to interpret model predictions and identify biologically meaningful sequence motifs. The discovered motifs, enriched in histidine, aspartate, glutamate, and lysine, represent amino acid residues commonly found in catalytic and metal-binding regions of transferase enzymes. These findings highlight that deep learning models can uncover functionally relevant biochemical signatures, bridging the gap between predictive accuracy and biological interpretability in protein sequence analysis.</description>

      <title>MAT-MPNN: A Mobility-Aware Transformer-MPNN Model for Dynamic Spatiotemporal Prediction of HIV Diagnoses in California, Florida, and New England</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) has posed a major global health challenge for decades, and forecasting HIV diagnoses continues to be a critical area of research. However, capturing the complex spatial and temporal dependencies of HIV transmission remains challenging. Conventional Message Passing Neural Network (MPNN) models rely on a fixed binary adjacency matrix that only encodes geographic adjacency, which is unable to represent interactions between non-contiguous counties. Our study proposes a deep learning architecture Mobility-Aware Transformer-Message Passing Neural Network (MAT-MPNN) framework to predict county-level HIV diagnosis rates across California, Florida, and the New England region. The model combines temporal features extracted by a Transformer encoder with spatial relationships captured through a Mobility Graph Generator (MGG). The MGG improves conventional adjacency matrices by combining geographic and demographic information. Compared with the best-performing hybrid baseline, the Transformer MPNN model, MAT-MPNN reduced the Mean Squared Prediction Error (MSPE) by 27.9% in Florida, 39.1% in California, and 12.5% in New England, and improved the Predictive Model Choice Criterion (PMCC) by 7.7%, 3.5%, and 3.9%, respectively. MAT-MPNN also achieved better results than the Spatially Varying Auto-Regressive (SVAR) model in Florida and New England, with comparable performance in California. These results demonstrate that applying mobility-aware dynamic spatial structures substantially enhances predictive accuracy and calibration in spatiotemporal epidemiological prediction.</description>

      <title>Symbiotic causal network of seagrass-bacteria-alga-diatom interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Seagrass meadows contribute to the conservation of marine ecosystems, reduction in global warming impacts and pathogen controls. However, the decline in seagrass habitats due to environmental loads has become an urgent global issue. One way to address this issue is to better understand healthy seagrass habitats. Here, we estimate the structural characteristics of symbiotic and metabolic systems in sediments from eight coastal regions of Japan, with each region containing both seagrass-covered areas and adjacent unvegetated areas. Notably, seagrasses commonly maintain a balanced symbiotic relationship characterized by a positive association with cable bacteria (Desulfobulbaceae), nitrogen-cycling bacteria (Hyphomonadaceae), and coral alga (Corallinophycidae) and a negative association with diatoms (Diatomea). Furthermore, seagrass growth conditions influence metabolic pathways by activating nitrogen-related metabolism while attenuating methanogenesis. Our findings highlight the crucial roles of marine plants and their symbiotic systems in ensuring environmental conservation within the context of blue carbon storage across environmental gradients.</description>

      <title>Automated glenoid bone loss measurement and segmentation in CT scans for pre-operative planning in shoulder instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reliable measurement of glenoid bone loss is essential for operative planning in shoulder instability, but current manual and semi-automated methods are time-consuming and often subject to interreader variability. We developed and validated a fully automated deep learning pipeline for measuring glenoid bone loss on three-dimensional computed tomography (CT) scans using a linear-based, en-face view, best-circle method. Shoulder CT images of 91 patients (average age, 40 years; range, 14-89 years; 65 men) were retrospectively collected along with manual labels including glenoid segmentation, landmarks, and bone loss measurements. The multi-stage algorithm has three main stages: (1) segmentation, where we developed a U-Net to automatically segment the glenoid and humerus; (2) anatomical landmark detection, where a second network predicts glenoid rim points; and (3) geometric fitting, where we applied principal component analysis (PCA), projection, and circle fitting to compute the percentage of bone loss. The automated measurements showed strong agreement with consensus readings and exceeded surgeon-to-surgeon consistency (intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) 0.84 vs 0.78), including in low- and high-bone-loss subgroups (ICC 0.71 vs 0.63 and 0.83 vs 0.21, respectively; P &lt; 0.001). For classifying patients into low, medium, and high bone-loss categories, the pipeline achieved a recall of 0.714 for low and 0.857 for high severity, with no low cases misclassified as high or vice versa. These results suggest that our method is a time-efficient and clinically reliable tool for preoperative planning in shoulder instability and for screening patients with substantial glenoid bone loss.

      <title>Integral Bayesian symbolic regression for optimal discovery of governing equations from scarce and noisy data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how systems evolve over time often requires discovering the differential equations that govern their behavior. Automatically learning these equations from experimental data is challenging when the data are noisy or limited, and existing approaches struggle, in particular, with the estimation of unobserved derivatives. Here, we introduce an integral Bayesian symbolic regression method that learns governing equations directly from raw time-series data, without requiring manual assumptions or error-prone derivative estimation. By sampling the space of symbolic differential equations and evaluating them via numerical integration, our method robustly identifies governing equations even from noisy or scarce data. We show that this approach accurately recovers ground-truth models in synthetic benchmarks, and that it makes quasi-optimal predictions of system dynamics for all noise regimes. Applying this method to bacterial growth experiments across multiple species and substrates, we discover novel growth equations that outperform classical models in accurately capturing all phases of microbial proliferation, including lag, exponential, and saturation. Unlike standard approaches, our method reveals subtle shifts in growth dynamics, such as double ramp-ups or non-canonical transitions, offering a deeper, data-driven understanding of microbial physiology.</description>

      <title>Apo2Mol: 3D Molecule Generation via Dynamic Pocket-Aware Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep generative models are rapidly advancing structure-based drug design, offering substantial promise for generating small molecule ligands that bind to specific protein targets. However, most current approaches assume a rigid protein binding pocket, neglecting the intrinsic flexibility of proteins and the conformational rearrangements induced by ligand binding, limiting their applicability in practical drug discovery. Here, we propose Apo2Mol, a diffusion-based generative framework for 3D molecule design that explicitly accounts for conformational flexibility in protein binding pockets. To support this, we curate a dataset of over 24,000 experimentally resolved apo-holo structure pairs from the Protein Data Bank, enabling the characterization of protein structure changes associated with ligand binding. Apo2Mol employs a full-atom hierarchical graph-based diffusion model that simultaneously generates 3D ligand molecules and their corresponding holo pocket conformations from input apo states. Empirical studies demonstrate that Apo2Mol can achieve state-of-the-art performance in generating high-affinity ligands and accurately capture realistic protein pocket conformational changes.</description>

      <title>Benchmark on Drug Target Interaction Modeling from a Drug Structure Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04055v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The prediction modeling of drug-target interactions is crucial to drug discovery and design, which has seen rapid advancements owing to deep learning technologies. Recently developed methods, such as those based on graph neural networks (GNNs) and Transformers, demonstrate exceptional performance across various datasets by effectively extracting structural information. However, the benchmarking of these novel methods often varies significantly in terms of hyperparameter settings and datasets, which limits algorithmic progress. In view of these, we conducted a comprehensive survey and benchmark for drug-target interaction modeling from a structural perspective via integrating tens of explicit (i.e., GNN-based) and implicit (i.e., Transformer-based) structure learning algorithms. We conducted a macroscopical comparison between these two classes of encoding strategies as well as the different featurization techniques that inform molecules' chemical and physical properties. We then carry out the microscopical comparison between all the integrated models across the six datasets via comprehensively benchmarking their effectiveness and efficiency. To ensure fairness, we investigate model performance under individually optimized configuration. Remarkably, the summarized insights from the benchmark studies lead to the design of model combos. We demonstrate that our combos can achieve new state-of-the-art performance on various datasets associated with cost-effective memory and computation.</description>
