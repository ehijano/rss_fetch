      <title>On Bose-Einstein condensates in disordered media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the quantum dynamics of interacting bosons in the mean-field regime when they are subjected to a disordered potential, which is either random or quasi-periodic. Starting from a spatially localized Bose-Einstein condensate, we prove that fluctuations around the condensate propagate with a small velocity due to the disorder. This provides an example of a disordered many-body system with provably slow transport behavior in any spatial dimension. The main technical novelty is an interaction picture analysis relative to the Anderson-localized one-body dynamics.</description>

      <title>Group-Theoretic Structure Governing Identifiability in Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In physical systems possessing symmetry, reconstructing the underlying causal structure from observational data constitutes an inverse problem of fundamental importance. In this work, we formulate the inverse problem of causal inference within the framework of group-representation theory, clarifying the structure of the representation spaces to which the {\it causality} and estimation maps belong. This formulation leads to both theoretical and practical limits of reconstructability (identifiability). We show that the local velocity-gradient tensor, regarded as a {\it causal factor}, can be reconstructed from the orientational motion of suspended particles. In this setting, the estimation map must act as a group homomorphism between the observation and causal spaces, and the reconstructable subspace is constrained by the decomposition structure of the SO(3) representation. Based on this principle, we construct an SO(3)-equivariant neural network (implemented with the e3nn framework) and verify that the identifiability determined by the group-representation structure is reproduced in the actual learning process. These results demonstrate a fundamental principle that the group-representation structure determines the reconstructability (identifiability limit) in inverse problems of causal inference.</description>

      <title>Acoustic pulse propagation in a non-ideal shallow-water model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study develops a theoretical framework for modeling acoustic pulse propagation in a non-ideal shallow-water waveguide. We derive an {\epsilon}-pseudodifferential operator ({\epsilon}-PDO) formulation from the general three-dimensional wave equation, that accounts for vertical stratification, bottom interaction, and slow horizontal inhomogeneity. Using the operator separation of variables method and the WKB-ansatz, we obtain single-mode equations describing the evolution of amplitude and phase along rays. The approach incorporates non-self-adjoint operators to model energy leakage through the bottom and introduces a Hamiltonian formalism for eikonal and transport equations, enabling the computation of amplitude, time, and phase fronts. Analytical and numerical examples are provided for different boundary conditions, including Neumann (ideal), self-adjoint, and partially reflecting interfaces. The results extend previous semiclassical and ray-based theories of wave propagation by including dissipative effects and improving the physical realism of shallow-water acoustic modeling.</description>

      <title>A $k$-contact Geometrical Approach to Pseudo-Gauge Transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a starting point to the geometric description for the pseudo-gauge ambiguity in relativistic hydrodynamics, showing that it corresponds to the freedom to redefine the thermodynamic equilibrium state of the system. To do this, we develop for the first time a description of a relativistic hydrodynamic-like theory using $k$-contact geometry. In this approach, thermodynamic laws are encoded in a $k$-contact form, thermodynamical states are described via $k$-contact Legendrian submanifolds, and conservation laws emerge as a consequence of Hamilton-de Donder-Weyl (HdDW) equations. The inherent non-uniqueness of these solutions is identified as the source of the pseudo-gauge freedom. We explicitly demonstrate how this redefinition of equilibrium works in a model of a Bjorken-like expansion, where a pseudo-gauge transformation is shown to leave the physical dissipation invariant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A superintegrable generalization of the classical and quantum Zernike systems is reviewed. The corresponding Hamiltonians are endowed with higher-order integrals and can be interpreted as higher-order superintegrable perturbations of the 2D spherical (Higgs), hyperbolic, and Euclidean harmonic oscillators. As a new result, the complete polynomial Higgs-type symmetry algebra of the generalized classical system is presented. For the generalized quantum system, the symmetry algebra and the spectra are provided for a representative case.</description>

      <title>Microlocal analysis of the non-relativistic limit of the Klein--Gordon equation: Asymptotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is the less technical half of a two-part work in which we introduce a robust microlocal framework for analyzing the non-relativistic limit of relativistic wave equations with time-dependent coefficients, focusing on the Klein--Gordon equation. Two asymptotic regimes in phase space are relevant to the non-relativistic limit: one corresponding to what physicists call ``natural'' units, in which the PDE is approximable by the free Klein--Gordon equation, and a low-frequency regime in which the equation is approximable by the usual Schr\"odinger equation. As shown in the companion paper, combining the analyses in the two regimes gives global estimates which are uniform as the speed of light goes to infinity. In this paper, we derive asymptotics from those estimates. Our framework differs from those in previous works in that ours is based on spacetime phase-space analysis.</description>

      <title>Ginzburg-Landau minimizers with high topological degrees in an annulus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent experiments on fermionic rings, we study the asymptotic behaviour of minimizers of the Ginzburg-Landau (GL) energy in an annulus with a Dirichlet data which depends on the GL parameter on the outer boundary. We show that there is a critical degree of order $|\ln \varepsilon|$ under which the ground state displays a giant vortex and above which minimizers exhibit a combination of a giant vortex and vortices which tend to the outer boundary as the GL parameter tends to zero. Our analysis relies on the construction of suitable upper and lower bounds, on the extension to a slightly bigger annulus and on the minimization of the mean-field energy appearing in the lower bound. In order to be able to derive the minimum of this energy we use the symmetry of the domain and criticality with respect to inner variations.</description>

      <title>Topological subregions in Chern Simons theory and topological string theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The standard, gapped entanglement boundary condition in Chern Simons theory breaks the topological invariance of the theory by introducing a complex structure on the entangling surface. This produces an infinite dimensional subregion Hilbert space, a non-trivial modular Hamiltonion, and a UV-divergent entanglement entropy that is a universal feature of local quantum field theories. In this work, we appeal to the combinatorial quantization of Chern Simons theory to define a purely topological notion of a subregion. The subregion operator algebras are spaces of functions on a quantum group. We develop a diagrammatic calculus for the associated $q$-deformed entanglement entropy, which arise from the entanglement of anyonic edge modes. The $q$-deformation regulates the divergences of the QFT, producing a finite entanglement entropy associated to a $q$-tracial state. We explain how these ideas provide an operator algebraic framework for the entanglement entropy computations in topological string theory \cite{Donnelly:2020teo,Jiang:2020cqo, wongtopstring}, where a large- $N$ limit of the $q$-deformed subregion algebra plays a key role in the stringy description of spacetime.</description>

      <title>Boundedness for the wave equation on $C^1$ stationary axisymmetric perturbations of Kerr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On the full range of sub-extremal Kerr exterior spacetimes we give a new proof of energy boundedness for high-frequency projections of solutions to the wave equation onto trapped frequencies. A key feature of the new estimate is that it circumvents the use of an integrated local energy decay (ILED) statement. As an illustration of the robustness of the estimate, we use it to establish energy boundedness for solutions to the wave equation on stationary and axisymmetric metrics which are merely $C^1$ close to a sub-extremal Kerr spacetime. We show explicitly that such perturbed metrics may possess stably trapped null geodesics, and thus one does not expect ILED statements to hold.</description>

      <title>Infrared Universality: The $r^{-3}$ Spectral Threshold for Coupled Gravitational and Electromagnetic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We identify the $r^{-3}$ curvature-decay rate as a universal geometric threshold separating compact from non-compact perturbations of Laplace-type operators on asymptotically flat manifolds. For the coupled Einstein--Maxwell system, we prove that the linearized operator $\mathcal{L}$ is essentially self-adjoint and that curvature and field strengths decaying faster than $r^{-3}$ act as relatively compact perturbations, while decay exactly at $r^{-3}$ places $0\in\sigma_{\mathrm{ess}}(\mathcal{L})$ through delocalized zero modes. This threshold mechanism unifies the infrared behavior of spin-1, spin-2, and mixed spin-$(1\oplus2)$ fields, linking the onset of spectral delocalization with the appearance of gravitational and electromagnetic memory. Finite-difference simulations corroborate the analytic scaling and reproduce the characteristic quadrupolar and dipolar sky maps predicted for the coupled memory fields. These results demonstrate that curvature decay at $r^{-3}$ constitutes a fundamental geometric boundary underlying infrared universality in gauge and gravitational theories, providing a spectral counterpart to the asymptotic-symmetry and soft-theorem formulations of memory.</description>

      <title>Kinetic Theory and the Mechanics of Isothermal Gas Spheres: Derivation of the Classical Emden--Chandrasekhar Equation via the Vlasov--Poisson Formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a derivation of the mechanics of isothermal gas spheres directly from the Vlasov--Poisson equation. By extremising the Boltzmann entropy, we obtain the Maxwell--Boltzmann distribution for a self-gravitating isothermal Newtonian gas, which is a stationary solution of the Vlasov--Poisson system. From this distribution, the corresponding Poisson--Boltzmann equation for the gravitational potential is deduced. The second variation of entropy reproduces the classical Antonov instability criterion: the critical energy is $E_c \simeq -0.335\,\frac{G M^2}{R}$, below which no local entropy maximum exists and the configuration becomes unstable (the so-called "gravothermal catastrophe"). In this work, we assume $E&gt;E_c$, so all equilibria lie on the stable branch, and the Antonov instability does not affect the analysis. Specializing to spherical symmetry, we recover the classical equation for the isothermal gas sphere, as originally studied by Chandrasekhar, which has applications to the formation of red giant stars. We also derive the fundamental equation of hydrostatic equilibrium, the energy integral and the virial theorem directly from the stationary Vlasov--Poisson solution, demonstrating also that an isothermal gas exhibits negative specific heat. Furthermore, we show that an isothermal gas sphere of strictly constant density is an impossibility. This exposition emphasizes some of the deep connections and self-consistency between kinetic theory, statistical mechanics, and stellar structure, while highlighting some formal aspects of classical astrophysical models.</description>

      <title>Complex Eigenvalues in a pseudo-Hermitian \b{eta}-Laguerre ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian PT-symmetric models have been extensively studied in recent years. Following the seminal work that reduced classical random matrix ensembles to a tridiagonal form, several efforts have aimed to generalize this framework to non-Hermitian extensions of the so-called \b{eta}-ensembles. In particular, while the transition of eigenvalues from the real axis to the complex plane has been well characterized for the \b{eta}-Hermite ensemble under symmetry breaking, the behavior of the \b{eta}-Laguerre ensemble in a similar non-Hermitian setting remains
  less understood. In this work, we investigate an ensemble of unstable matrices isospectral to the \b{eta}-Laguerre ensemble. Introducing a small non-Hermitian perturbation breaks the symmetry and drives the eigenvalues into the complex plane. We derive analytical expressions for the loci of complex-conjugate eigenvalue pairs, which organize into a balloon-like structure in the complex plane, followed by a discrete finite line of real eigenvalues. The asymptotic behavior of these eigenvalues is analyzed in the large matrix-size limit, and our theoretical predictions are supported by numerical simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This thesis is devoted to the study of physical systems embedded within the field of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics. Specifically, the state of the systems of interest constitutes a stochastic process that can be externally driven by a set of controllable parameters. On the one hand, for systems in contact with a thermal bath, we have studied the emergence of strong memory effects and glassy behaviour upon varying the bath temperature, and how these are related to the existence of non-equilibrium attractors governing the dynamics. On the other hand, for overdamped harmonic systems, we have studied the problem of minimising the connection time between arbitrary stationary (either equilibrium or non-equilibrium) states, by suitably varying either the bath temperature or the stiffnesses of the potential.</description>

      <title>On the Limitations of a Generalized Vaidya Metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that there can not be a smooth matching of the Generalized Vaidya metric with an exterior Schwarzschild/Vaidya patch across a finite boundary hypersurface unless the mass function is a function of the null coordinate alone. By explicitly deriving the extrinsic curvature components, we show that for $\partial m / \partial r \neq 0$ one has a discontinuity in the curvature and induces a surface stress-energy tensor, corresponding to a thin shell of matter. This discontinuity also appears in the geometric invariant $\mathcal{K} = K_{ab}K^{ab}$ and in the Kodama current, indicating a mismatch in quasi-local energy flux across the boundary. The analysis of timelike geodesics leads to the same condition, reinforcing that the generalized Vaidya geometry with $\partial m / \partial r \neq 0$ cannot represent a consistent stellar interior bounded by a regular surface. We therefore note that the generalized Vaidya spacetime should be interpreted as an unbounded geometry with intrinsic heat flux rather than a viable bounded source.</description>

Abstract: This letter introduces the novel concept of Painlev\'e solitons -- waves arising from the interaction between Painlev\'e waves and solitons in integrable systems. Painlev\'e solitons may also be viewed as solitons propagating against a Painlev\'e wave background, in analogy with the established notion of elliptic solitons, which refer to solitons on an elliptic wave background. By employing a novel symmetry decomposition method aided by nonlocal residual symmetries, we explicitly construct (extended) Painlev\'e II solitons for the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation and (extended) Painlev\'e IV solitons for the Boussinesq equation.</description>

      <title>Evidence for spontaneous breaking of a continuous symmetry at a non-conformal quantum critical point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present evidence for the spontaneous breaking of a continuous symmetry in a nearest-neighbour interacting spin-1 chain tuned to a quantum critical point at $T=0$ between two XY quasi-long-range order phases differing by the spontaneous breaking of a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry. Despite the one-dimensional nature of the system, which typically prevents such a continuous symmetry breaking due to the Hohenberg-Mermin-Wagner theorem, the presence of a Berry phase term in the quantum model allows us to observe, using matrix product state methods, a finite perpendicular magnetization. Moreover, the quasi-long-range decay of the correlation function becomes truly long-range order, and the dynamical structure factor displays a characteristic Bragg peak together with sharp gapless modes. Our results imply the quantum phase transition has an anomalous dimension of $\eta \simeq 1$ together with the dynamical critical exponent $z\simeq 3/2$, known from the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class in one dimension. We perform a perturbative renormalization group calculation about the upper critical dimension $d_c=2$ that we could close at second loop order. We find an interacting fixed point with critical exponents distinct from the Ising ones. Together, our findings suggest the nature of the fixed point to be non-perturbative. We propose a field-theory that we believe to improve the quantitative results.</description>

      <title>Moderate-to-large deviation asymptotics for real eigenvalues of the elliptic Ginibre matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the statistics of the number of real eigenvalues in the elliptic deformation of the real Ginibre ensemble. As the matrix dimension grows, the law of large numbers and the central limit theorem for the number of real eigenvalues are well understood, but the probabilities of rare events remain largely unexplored. Large deviation type results have been obtained only in extreme cases, when either a vanishingly small proportion of eigenvalues are real or almost all eigenvalues are real. Here, in both the strong and weak asymmetry regimes, we derive the probabilities of rare events in the moderate-to-large deviation regime, thereby providing a natural connection between the previously known regime of Gaussian fluctuations and the large deviation regime. Our results are new even for the classical real Ginibre ensemble.</description>

      <title>Finite-time trajectorial estimates for inhomogeneous random walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider integer-valued random walks with independent but not identically distributed increments, and extend to this context several classical estimates, including a local limit theorem, precise small-ball estimates (both conditional on the final point and unconditional), and bounds on the probability that the random walk trajectory remains positive up to a given time (again, both conditional on the final point and unconditional). Two key features of this work are that the bounds are non-asymptotic, holding true for finite time horizons, and, crucially, that the latter hold uniformly over an entire class of admissible increment sequences. This provides a robust framework for applications. These results are, in particular, tailored for the analysis of processes derived through a time-dependent tilting of the increments of a time-homogeneous random walk.</description>

      <title>Random Walk conditioned to stay above a non-flat floor: curvature effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $h:[0,1]\to\mathbb{R}$ be $C^2$ and such that $\sup_{[0,1]} h''&lt;0$. For a (large) positive integer $n$, set $h_n(k) = n h(k/n)$ for any $k\in\{0,\dots,n\}$. We consider a random walk $(S_k)_{k\geq 0}$ with i.i.d.\ centred increments having some finite exponential moments. We are interested in the event $\{S\geq h_n\} = \{S_k\geq h_n(k)\;\forall k\in\{0,\dots,n\}\}$. It is well known that $P(S\geq h_n \,|\, S_0=0,\, S_n=\lceil h_n(n) \rceil) = e^{n\int_0^1 I(h'(s)) \,ds + o(n)}$, where $I$ is the Legendre-Fenchel transform of the log-moment generating function associated to the increments. We first prove that the leading correction is of order $e^{-\Theta(n^{1/3})}$. We then turn our attention to the conditional random walk measure $P^h_n = P(\cdot \,|\, S\geq h_n, S_0=0, S_n=\lceil h_n(n) \rceil)$. We prove that the one-point tails are of the form $\mathbb{P}_n^h (S_k \geq h_n(k) + t n^{1/3} ) = e^{-\Theta(t^{3/2})}$ for all $t&lt;n^\beta$ for any $\beta\in (0,1/6)$. Moreover, we prove that, for any $r\geq 1$, $E_n^h((S_k-h_n(k))^r) = \Theta(n^{r/3})$ and $\mathrm{Var}_{P_n^h}(S_k) = \Theta(n^{2/3})$, for all $k$ far enough from $0$ and $n$. In addition, we show that $\mathrm{Cov}_{P_n^h}(S_k,S_\ell) \leq e^{-O(|\ell-k|/n^{2/3})}$ for all $k,\ell$ not too close to $0$ and $n$.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Dirac equations on noncompact quantum graphs with potentials: Multiplicity and Concentration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the existence and multiplicity of solutions to the following class of nonlinear Dirac equations (NLDE) on noncompact quantum graphs:
  \[
  -i\,\varepsilon c\,\sigma_1\,\partial_x u + m c^2 \sigma_3 u + V(x)\,u = f(|u|)\,u, \quad x\in \mathcal{G}, \tag{P}
  \]
  where \(V:\mathcal{G}\to\mathbb{R}\) and \(f:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}\) are continuous, \(\varepsilon&gt;0\) is a semiclassical parameter, \(m&gt;0\) denotes the mass, and \(c&gt;0\) the speed of light. Here \(\sigma_1,\sigma_3\) are Pauli matrices, and \(\mathcal{G}\) is a noncompact quantum graph. We prove that when \(\varepsilon\) is sufficiently small, the number of solutions to \((P)\) is at least the number of global minima of \(V\).
  Moreover, these solutions exhibit semiclassical concentration: as \(\varepsilon\to0\), their concentration points approach the set of global minima of \(V\).</description>

      <title>$q$-Fock Space of $q$-Analytic Functions and its realization in $L^{2}(\mathbb{C}; e^{-z\bar z} \,\mathrm{d}x\,\mathrm{d}y)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a $q$-deformation of the Fock space of holomorphic functions on $\mathbb{C}$, based on a geometric definition of $q$-analyticity. This definition is inspired by a standard construction in complex differential geometry. Within this framework, we define $q$-analytic monomials $z_q^n$ and construct the associated $q$-Fock space as a Hilbert space with orthonormal basis $\{z_q^n/\sqrt{[n]_q!]}\}_{n\ge 0}$. The reproducing kernel of this space is computed explicitly, and $q$-position and $q$-momentum operators are introduced, satisfying $q$-deformed commutation relations. We show that the $q$-monomials $z_q^n$ can be expanded in terms of complex Hermite polynomials, thereby providing a realization of the $q$-Fock space as a subspace of $L^2(\mathbb{C}; e^{-|z|^2}\,\mathrm{d}x\,\mathrm{d}y)$. Finally, we define a $q$-Bargmann transform that maps suitable $q$-Hermite functions into our $q$-Fock space and acts as a unitary isomorphism. Our construction offers a geometric and analytic approach to $q$-function theory, complementing recent operator-theoretic models.</description>

Abstract: In these notes, we describe an interesting connection between unitary representations of Lie groups and nets of local algebras, as they appear in Algebraic Quantum Field Theory (AQFT). It is based on first translating the axioms for nets of operator algebras parameterized by regions in a space-time manifold into those for nets of real subspaces, and then study this structure from a perspective based on geometry and representation theory of Lie groups.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal polynomials for the singularly perturbed Laguerre weight, Hankel determinants and asymptotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on the work of Chen and Its [{\em J. Approx. Theory} {\bf 162} ({2010}) {270--297}], we further study orthogonal polynomials with respect to the singularly perturbed Laguerre weight $w(x;t,\alpha) = {x^\alpha}{\mathrm e^{- x-\frac{t}{x}}}, \; x\in\mathbb{R}^{+},\;\alpha &gt; -1,\; t\geq 0$. By using the ladder operators and associated compatibility conditions for orthogonal polynomials with general Laguerre-type weights, we derive the second-order differential equation satisfied by the orthogonal polynomials, a system of difference equations and a system of differential-difference equations for the recurrence coefficients. We also investigate the properties of the zeros of the orthogonal polynomials. Using Dyson's Coulomb fluid approach together with the discrete system, we obtain the large $n$ asymptotic expansions of the recurrence coefficients, the sub-leading coefficient of the monic orthogonal polynomials, the Hankel determinant and the normalized constant for fixed $t&gt;0$. It is found that all the asymptotic expansions are singular at $t=0$. We also study the long-time ($t\rightarrow\infty$) asymptotics of these quantities explicitly for fixed $n\in\mathbb{N}$ from the Toda-type system.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we present several aspects of the interplay between classical and quantum theories. After reviewing the equivalence between positivity and complete positivity in the commutative setting, we introduce and analyze intermediate notions that interpolate between these two properties for linear maps on the space of operators on a Hilbert space, highlighting their natural connections to quantum dynamics and entanglement theory. Finally, we discuss possible constructions that allow one to derive quantum states and evolutions from classical counterparts, and vice versa.</description>

      <title>Structure of Vidinli Algebras: Simple Nonassociative Jordan-Lie Algebras with Azumaya Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Vidinli algebra, originally defined in three dimensions, is extended to arbitrary odd dimensions via symplectic forms. Particular attention is given to the five- and seven-dimensional cases. The symmetric and antisymmetric parts of the multiplication yield a Jordan algebra and a Heisenberg Lie algebra, respectively. A categorical construction, called the degenerate pushout, is introduced to assemble higher-dimensional algebras from lower-dimensional components, even in the presence of degeneracies such as zero divisors. This method applies not only to Vidinli algebras but also recovers classical structures including spin factor Jordan algebras and Heisenberg Lie algebras. The Vidinli family admits three independent characterizations; geometric, categorical, and analytic, demonstrating how global non-associ\-ative structure can arise from local constraints. Together with their variants, the Vidinli algebras form a structured and tractable class within the otherwise wild category of non-associative algebras.</description>

Abstract: We prove that an apparent horizon can form as a result of Einsteinian evolution in pure vacuum spacetime starting from regular initial data free of apparent horizons due to pure boundary effects. We adapt a Cauchy-double-null framework and use the boundary generalized mean curvature condition for the existence of an interior apparent horizon imposed by the author S-T Yau in \cite{yau}. In particular, we prove that the condition of \cite{yau} can be met dynamically starting from a configuration that does not verify the same through a focusing mechanism. This is the first part of a two-part sequence, and in the sequel, we will focus on explicitly constructing the Cauchy data.</description>

Abstract: The paper contains an analysis of the conditions for the existence of elastic versus non-elastic wave superpositions governed by the Euler system in (1+1)-dimensions. A review of recently obtained results is presented including the introduction of the notion of quasi-rectifiability of vector fields and its application to both elastic and non-elastic wave superpositions. It is shown that the smallest real Lie algebra containing vector fields associated with the waves admitted by the Euler system is isomorphic to an infinite-dimensional Lie algebra which is the semi-direct sum of an Abelian ideal and the three-dimensional real Lie algebra K+ or K-. The maximal module corresponding to the Euler system can be transformed by an angle preserving transformation to a real algebra isomorphic to the Lie algebras K+, K-. The algebras K+ and K- are quasirectifiable and describe the behavior of wave superpositions. Based on these facts, we are able to find a parametrization of the region of non-elastic wave superpositions which allows for the construction of the reduced form of the Euler system.</description>

Abstract: We show that the Zassenhaus decomposition for the exponential of the sum of two non-commuting operators, simplifies drastically when these operators satisfy a simple condition, called the no-mixed adjoint property. An important application to a Unitary Coupled Cluster method for strongly correlated electron systems is presented. This ansatz requires no Trotterization and is exact on a quantum computer with a finite number of Givens gate equals to the number of free parameters. The formulas obtained in this work also shed light on why and when optimization after Trotterization gives exact solutions in disentangled forms of unitary coupled cluster.</description>

      <title>Coherent distributions for the rigid rotator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.04832</link>
      <description>arXiv:1504.04832v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coherent solutions of the classical Liouville equation for the rigid rotator are presented as positive phase-space distributions associated with the Lagrangian submanifolds of Hamilton-Jacobi theory. These solutions become Wigner-type quasiprobability distributions by a formal discretization of the left-invariant vector fields from their Fourier transform in angular momentum. The results are consistent with the usual quantization of the anisotropic rotator, but the expected value of the Hamiltonian contains a finite "zero point" energy term. It is shown that during the time when a quasiprobability distribution evolves according to the Liouville equation, the related quantum wave function should satisfy the time-dependent Schroedinger equation.</description>

      <title>Optimal Fermionic Joint Measurements for Estimating Non-Commuting Majorana Observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19349v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An important class of fermionic observables, relevant in tasks such as fermionic partial tomography and estimating energy levels of chemical Hamiltonians, are the binary measurements obtained from the product of anti-commuting Majorana operators. In this work, we investigate efficient estimation strategies of these observables based on a joint measurement which, after classical post-processing, yields all sufficiently unsharp (noisy) Majorana observables of even-degree. By exploiting the symmetry properties of the Majorana observables, as described by the braid group, we show that the incompatibility robustness, i.e., the minimal classical noise necessary for joint measurability, relates to the spectral properties of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model. In particular, we show that for an $n$ mode fermionic system, the incompatibility robustness of all degree-$2k$ Majorana observables satisfies $\Theta(n^{-k/2})$ for $k\leq 5$. Furthermore, we present a joint measurement scheme achieving the asymptotically optimal noise, implemented by a small number of fermionic Gaussian unitaries and sampling from the set of all Majorana monomials. Our joint measurement, which can be performed via a randomization over projective measurements, provides rigorous performance guarantees for estimating fermionic observables comparable with fermionic classical shadows.</description>

      <title>The variational principle for a marked Gibbs point process with infinite-range multibody interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17170v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the Gibbs variational principle for the Asakura--Oosawa model in which particles of random size obey a hardcore constraint of non-overlap and are additionally subject to a temperature-dependent area interaction. The particle size is unbounded, leading to infinite-range interactions, and the potential cannot be written as a $k$-body interaction for fixed $k$. As a byproduct, we also prove the existence of infinite-volume Gibbs point processes satisfying the DLR equations. The essential control over the influence of boundary conditions can be established using the geometry of the model and the hard-core constraint.</description>

      <title>Quantum physics informed neural networks for multi-variable partial differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12244v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum Physics-Informed Neural Networks (QPINNs) integrate quantum computing and machine learning to impose physical biases on the output of a quantum neural network, aiming to either solve or discover differential equations. The approach has recently been implemented on both the gate model and continuous variable quantum computing architecture, where it has been demonstrated capable of solving ordinary differential equations. Here, we aim to extend the method to effectively address a wider range of equations, such as the Poisson equation and the heat equation. To achieve this goal, we introduce an architecture specifically designed to compute second-order (and higher-order) derivatives without relying on nested automatic differentiation methods. This approach mitigates the unwanted side effects associated with nested gradients in simulations, paving the way for more efficient and accurate implementations. By leveraging such an approach, the quantum circuit addresses partial differential equations, a challenge not yet tackled using this approach on continuous-variable quantum computers. As a proof-of-concept, we solve a one-dimensional instance of the heat equation, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling PDEs, both in an ideal and a noisy regime. We report our experiment on a photonic hardware to address a realistic noise scenario for our simulations. Such a framework paves the way for further developments in continuous-variable quantum computing and underscores its potential contributions to advancing quantum machine learning.</description>

      <title>Repeated quantum backflow and overflow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13184v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum backflow is a surprising phenomenon in which a quantum particle, moving in one dimension and with a state of rightwards momentum, can exhibit a net probability transfer to the left-hand half-line over a finite time interval. We generalise the setting of quantum backflow to allow for $M$ disjoint time intervals, considering the sum of probability differences for each interval. In classical statistical particle mechanics, the total backflow lies in the interval $[-1,0]$ for all $M$, indicating rightwards probability transfer. By contrast, we show that, in quantum mechanics, the maximum $M$-fold backflow is positive and unbounded from above as $M$ increases, demonstrating that there are states that exhibit repeated periods of backflow.
  Moreover, for $M\ge 2$, we discover a new phenomenon; namely, that there are states whose total backflow is below $-1$, giving a probability transfer to the right-hand half-line beyond that possible in classical statistical particle mechanics. We call this effect "quantum overflow". The maximum extent of the backflow and overflow effects is described by a hierarchy of backflow and overflow functions and constants, where the $M$'th backflow (overflow) constant is the supremum (infimum) of the $M$'th backflow (overflow) function. The $M=1$ backflow constant was first identified by Bracken and Melloy.
  Our results are obtained by formulating the $M$-fold backflow problem in terms of the spectra of suitable bounded operators. Using this formulation, we also study limiting cases of the backflow and overflow functions, including cases in which two disjoint intervals merge. Our analytical results are supported by detailed numerical investigations. Among other things, by applying numerical acceleration methods, we obtain a new estimate of the Bracken-Melloy constant of $0.0384506$ which is slightly lower than the previously accepted value of $0.038452$.</description>

      <title>Control-affine Schr\"odinger Bridge and Generalized Bohm Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08511v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The control-affine Schr\"odinger bridge concerns with a stochastic optimal control problem. Its solution is a controlled evolution of joint state probability density subject to a control-affine It\^o diffusion with a given deadline connecting a given pair of initial and terminal densities. In this work, we recast the necessary conditions of optimality for the control-affine Schr\"odinger bridge problem as a two point boundary value problem for a quantum mechanical Schr\"odinger PDE with complex potential. This complex-valued potential is a generalization of the real-valued Bohm potential in quantum mechanics. Our derived potential is akin to the optical potential in nuclear physics where the real part of the potential encodes elastic scattering (transmission of wave function), and the imaginary part encodes inelastic scattering (absorption of wave function). The key takeaway is that the process noise that drives the evolution of probability densities induces an absorbing medium in the evolution of wave function. These results make new connections between control theory and non-equilibrium statistical mechanics through the lens of quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Stability of multi-solitons for $1$d Supercritical NLS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03637v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider the one-dimensional $L^2$ supercritical nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation \begin{equation} i\partial_{t}\psi+\partial^{2}_{x}\psi+\vert \psi\vert^{2k}\psi=0 \text{, $k&gt;2$}. \end{equation} It is well known that solitary waves for this equation are unstable. In the pioneering work of Krieger and Schlag \cite{KriegerSchlag}, the asymptotic stability of a solitary wave was established on a codimension-one center-stable manifold. In the present paper, using linear estimates developed for one-dimensional matrix charge transfer models in our previous work, \cite{dispanalysis1}, we prove asymptotic stability of multi-solitons on a finite-codimension manifold for $k&gt;\frac{11}{4}.$</description>

      <title>Limiting distribution of the chemical distance in high dimensional critical percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06236v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We identify the asymptotic distribution of the chemical distance in high-dimensional critical Bernoulli percolation. Namely, we show that the distance between the origin and a distant vertex conditioned to lie in the cluster of the origin converges in distribution when rescaled by a multiple the square of the Euclidean distance. The limiting distribution has an explicit density and coincides with the distribution of the time for a Brownian motion in $\mathbb{R}^d$ conditioned to hit a given unit vector to reach its target. Our result follows from a general moment computation for quantities that have an additive structure across the pivotal edges on a long-range connection in percolation. In addition to the number of pivotal edges in a long connection, this also includes the effective resistance. The existence of the incipient infinite cluster limit, in a form recently established, plays a key role in the derivation of our results.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Sum Rule from Higher-Form Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17317v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove an entanglement sum rule for $(d-1)$-dimensional quantum lattice models with finite abelian higher-form symmetries, obtained by minimally coupling a sector on $p$-simplices carrying a $p$-form $G$ symmetry to a sector on $(p+1)$-simplices carrying the dual $(d-p-2)$-form $\widehat G$ symmetry (with $\widehat G$ being the Pontryagin dual of $G$). The coupling is introduced by conjugation with a symmetry-preserving operator $\mathcal{U}$ that dresses symmetry-invariant operators with appropriate Wilson operators. Our main result concerns symmetric eigenstates of the coupled model that arise by acting with $\mathcal{U}$ on direct-product symmetric eigenstates of the decoupled model: provided a topological criterion formulated via the Mayer--Vietoris sequence holds for the chosen bipartition, $\mathcal{U}$ factorizes across the cut when acting on the symmetric state, and the entanglement entropy equals the sum of the entropies of the two sectors. This framework explains and generalizes known examples in fermion-$\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory, identifies when topology obstructs the sum rule, and provides a procedure to construct new examples by gauging higher-form symmetries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19902v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that every fusion category containing a non-invertible, self-dual object $a$ gives rise to an integrable anyonic chain whose Hamiltonian density satisfies the Temperley-Lieb algebra. This spin chain arises by considering the projection onto the identity channel in the fusion process $a\otimes a$. We relate these models to Pasquier's construction of ADE lattice models. We then exploit the underlying Temperley-Lieb structure to discuss the spectrum of these models and argue that these models are gapped when the quantum dimension of $a$ is greater than 2. We show that for fusion categories where the dimension is close to 2, such as the Fib$\times$Fib and Haagerup fusion categories, the finite size effects are large and they can obscure the numerical analysis of the gap.</description>

      <title>Initial-State Typicality in Quantum Relaxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01709v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Relaxation in open quantum systems is fundamental to quantum science and technologies. Yet, the influence of the initial state on relaxation remains a central, largely unanswered question. Here, by systematically characterizing the relaxation behavior of generic initial states, we uncover a typicality phenomenon in high-dimensional open quantum systems: relaxation becomes nearly initial-state-independent as system size increases under verifiable conditions. Crucially, we prove this typicality for thermalization processes above a size-independent temperature. Our findings extend the typicality to open quantum dynamics, in turn identifying a class of systems where two widely used quantities -- the Liouvillian gap and the maximal relaxation time -- merit re-examination. We formalize this with two new concepts: the 'typical strong Mpemba effect' and the 'typical relaxation time'. Beyond these conceptual advances, our results provide practical implications: a scalable route to accelerating relaxation and a typical mixing-time benchmark that complements conventional worst-case metrics for quantum simulations and state preparation.</description>
