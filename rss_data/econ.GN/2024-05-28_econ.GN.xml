      <title>Prediction of healthcare costs on consumer direct health plan in the Brazilian context</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rise in healthcare costs has led to the adoption of cost-sharing devices in health plans. This article explores this discussion by simulating Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) to cover medical and hospital expenses, supported by catastrophic insurance. Simulating 10 million lives, we evaluate the utilization of catastrophic insurance and the balances of HSAs at the end of working life. To estimate annual expenditures, a Markov Chains approach - distinct from the usual ones - was used based on recent past expenditures, age range, and gender. The results suggest that HSAs do not create inequalities, offering a viable method to sustain private healthcare financing for the elderly.</description>

      <title>Multimarket Contact, Merger, and Airline Collusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This thesis investigates the dynamics of multimarket contact and airline mergers on collusive pricing of airlines. In align with Bernheim and Whinston (1990) and Athey et.al.(2004), it detects collusive pricing via pairwise price difference and price rigidity. The piece of work extends previous work by incorporating additional controls such as distinction between non-stop and stopover itineraries and detailed market concentration measures. The findings confirm a significant relationship between multimarket contact and reduced price differences, indicating collusive equilibria facilitated by frequent interactions across markets. Moreover, the results highlight that airlines exhibit more collusive behavior when pricing non-stop flights, and are more likely to attain tacit collusion when they approaches duopoly in a particular market. The study also explores the effects of airline mergers on collusion, employing an event study methodology with a difference-in-difference (DID) design. It finds no direct evidence that mergers lead to increased collusion among unmerged carriers. However, it reveals that during and after the merger process, carrier pairs between merged and unmerged carriers are more likely to collude compared to pairs of unmerged carriers.</description>

      <title>The Mariana Environmental Disaster and its Labor Market Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines the labor market impacts of the 2015 Mariana Dam disaster in Brazil. It contrasts two theoretical models: an urban spatial equilibrium model and a factor of production model, with diverging perspectives on environmental influences on labor outcomes. Utilizing rich national administrative and spatial data, the study reveals that the unusual environmental alteration, with minimal human capital loss, primarily affected outcomes via the factor of production channel. Nevertheless, spatial equilibrium dynamics are discernible within certain market segments. This research contributes to the growing literature on environmental changes and its economic consequences.</description>

      <title>Product Design Using Generative Adversarial Network: Incorporating Consumer Preference and External Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of Generative AI enables large-scale automation of product design. However, this automated process usually does not incorporate consumer preference information from a company's internal dataset. Meanwhile, external sources such as social media and user-generated content (UGC) websites often contain rich product design and consumer preference information, but such information is not utilized by companies in design generation. We propose a semi-supervised deep generative framework that integrates consumer preferences and external data into product design, allowing companies to generate consumer-preferred designs in a cost-effective and scalable way. We train a predictor model to learn consumer preferences and use predicted popularity levels as additional input labels to guide the training of a Continuous Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CcGAN). The CcGAN can be instructed to generate new designs of a certain popularity level, enabling companies to efficiently create consumer-preferred designs and save resources by avoiding developing and testing unpopular designs. The framework also incorporates existing product designs and consumer preference information from external sources, which is particularly helpful for small or start-up companies who have limited internal data and face the "cold-start" problem. We apply the proposed framework to a real business setting by helping a large self-aided photography chain in China design new photo templates. We show that our proposed model performs well in generating appealing template designs for the company.</description>

      <title>Effect of Interest Payments on External Debt on Economic Growth in Kenya</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Kenya, interest payments on external debt have been increasing from 2010 to 2015, while GDP growth experienced a slight decline over the same period. Policymakers are concerned that the rapid increase in external debt in developing countries such as Kenya has the potential to erode the country's sovereign rating, particularly if it is not supported by proportionate growth in the size of the economy. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of interest payments on external debt on economic growth in Kenya. The study utilized secondary data for 25 years, from 1991 to 2015, for GDP growth and interest payments on external debt. The results from the analysis of variance statistics indicate that the model was statistically significant. This implies that interest payments on external debt are good predictors of GDP growth. Regression coefficient results show that GDP growth and the logarithm of interest payments on external debt are negatively and significantly related. The study recommends that future government plans should ensure that external borrowings are taken at rates not higher than the interest rate payments.</description>

      <title>Efficient mid-term forecasting of hourly electricity load using generalized additive models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate mid-term (weeks to one year) hourly electricity load forecasts are essential for strategic decision-making in power plant operation, ensuring supply security and grid stability, and energy trading. While numerous models effectively predict short-term (hours to a few days) hourly load, mid-term forecasting solutions remain scarce. In mid-term load forecasting, besides daily, weekly, and annual seasonal and autoregressive effects, capturing weather and holiday effects, as well as socio-economic non-stationarities in the data, poses significant modeling challenges. To address these challenges, we propose a novel forecasting method using Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) built from interpretable P-splines and enhanced with autoregressive post-processing. This model uses smoothed temperatures, Error-Trend-Seasonal (ETS) modeled non-stationary states, a nuanced representation of holiday effects with weekday variations, and seasonal information as input. The proposed model is evaluated on load data from 24 European countries. This analysis demonstrates that the model not only has significantly enhanced forecasting accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods but also offers valuable insights into the influence of individual components on predicted load, given its full interpretability. Achieving performance akin to day-ahead TSO forecasts in fast computation times of a few seconds for several years of hourly data underscores the model's potential for practical application in the power system industry.</description>

      <title>Promotion through Connections: Favors or Information?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.07723</link>
      <description>arXiv:1708.07723v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Connections appear to be helpful in many contexts, such as obtaining a job, a promotion, a grant, a loan, or publishing a paper. This may be due either to favoritism or to information conveyed by connections. Attempts at identifying both effects have relied on measures of true quality, generally built from data collected long after promotion. Building on earlier work on discrimination, we propose a new method to identify favors and information from data collected at the time of promotion. Under weak assumptions, we show that promotion decisions for connected candidates look more random to the econometrician due to the information channel. We derive new identification results and estimate the strength of the two effects. We adapt the control function approach to address the issue of the selection into connections. Applying our methodology to academic promotions in Spain and Italy, as well as political advancements in China, we find evidence that connections may both convey information and attract favors.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Granular Models of Firm Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15226v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit granular models that represent the size of a firm as the sum of the sizes of multiple constituents or sub-units. Originally developed to address the unexpectedly slow reduction in volatility as firm size increases, these models also explain the shape of the distribution of firm growth rates.
  We introduce new theoretical insights regarding the relationship between firm size and growth rate statistics within this framework, directly linking the growth statistics of a firm to how diversified it is. The non-intuitive nature of our results arises from the fat-tailed distributions of the size and the number of sub-units, which suggest the categorization of firms into three distinct diversification types: well-diversified firms with sizes evenly distributed across many sub-units, firms with many sub-units but concentrated size in just a few, and poorly diversified firms consisting of only a small number of sub-units.
  Inspired by our theoretical findings, we identify new empirical patterns in firm growth. Our findings show that growth volatility, when adjusted by average size-conditioned volatility, has a size-independent distribution, but with a tail that is much too thin to be in agreement with the predictions of granular models. Furthermore, the predicted Gaussian distribution of growth rates, even when rescaled for firm-specific volatility, remains fat-tailed across all sizes. Such discrepancies not only challenge the granularity hypothesis but also underscore the need for deeper exploration into the mechanisms driving firm growth.</description>

      <title>Decoding Social Sentiment in DAO: A Comparative Analysis of Blockchain Governance Communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14676v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Blockchain technology is leading a revolutionary transformation across diverse industries, with effective governance being critical for the success and sustainability of blockchain projects. Community forums, pivotal in engaging decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), significantly impact blockchain governance decisions. Concurrently, Natural Language Processing (NLP), particularly sentiment analysis, provides powerful insights from textual data. While prior research has explored the potential of NLP tools in social media sentiment analysis, there is a gap in understanding the sentiment landscape of blockchain governance communities. The evolving discourse and sentiment dynamics on the forums of top DAOs remain largely unknown. This paper delves deep into the evolving discourse and sentiment dynamics on the public forums of leading DeFi projects: Aave, Uniswap, Curve DAO, Yearn.finance, Merit Circle, and Balancer, focusing primarily on discussions related to governance issues. Our study shows that participants in decentralized communities generally express positive sentiments during Discord discussions. Furthermore, there is a potential interaction between discussion intensity and sentiment dynamics; higher discussion volume may contribute to a more stable sentiment from code analysis. The insights gained from this study are valuable for decision-makers in blockchain governance, underscoring the pivotal role of sentiment analysis in interpreting community emotions and its evolving impact on the landscape of blockchain governance. This research significantly contributes to the interdisciplinary exploration of the intersection of blockchain and society, specifically emphasizing the decentralized blockchain governance ecosystem. We provide our data and code for replicability as open access on GitHub.</description>
