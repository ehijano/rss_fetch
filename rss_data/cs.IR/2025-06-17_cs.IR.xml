      <title>Algorithms for estimating linear function in data mining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main goal of this topic is to showcase several studied algorithms for estimating the linear utility function to predict the users preferences. For example, if a user comes to buy a car that has several attributes including speed, color, age, etc in a linear function, the algorithms that we present in this paper help with estimating this linear function to filter out a small subset that would be of best interest to the user among a million tuples in a very large database. In addition, the estimating linear function could also be applicable in getting to know what the data can do or predicting the future based on the data that is used in data science, which is demonstrated by the GNN, PLOD algorithms. In the ever-evolving field of data science, deriving valuable insights from large datasets is critical for informed decision-making, particularly in predictive applications. Data analysts often identify high-quality datasets without missing values, duplicates, or inconsistencies before merging diverse attributes for analysis. Taking housing price prediction as a case study, various attributes must be considered, including location factors (proximity to urban centers, crime rates), property features (size, style, modernity), and regional policies (tax implications). Experts in the field typically rank these attributes to establish a predictive utility function, which machine learning models use to forecast outcomes like housing prices. Several data discovery algorithms, including those that address the challenges of predefined utility functions and human input for attribute ranking, which often result in a time-consuming iterative process, that the work of cannot overcome.</description>

      <title>T$^2$-RAGBench: Text-and-Table Benchmark for Evaluating Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While most financial documents contain a combination of textual and tabular information, robust Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are essential for effectively accessing and reasoning over such content to perform complex numerical tasks. This paper introduces T$^2$-RAGBench, a benchmark comprising 32,908 question-context-answer triples, designed to evaluate RAG methods on real-world financial data. Unlike typical QA datasets that operate under Oracle-context settings, where the relevant context is explicitly provided, T$^2$-RAGBench challenges models to first retrieve the correct context before conducting numerical reasoning. Existing QA datasets involving text and tables typically contain context-dependent questions, which may yield multiple correct answers depending on the provided context. To address this, we transform these datasets into a context-independent format, enabling reliable RAG evaluation. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of popular RAG methods. Our analysis identifies Hybrid BM25, a technique that combines dense and sparse vectors, as the most effective approach for text-and-table data. However, results demonstrate that T$^2$-RAGBench remains challenging even for SOTA LLMs and RAG methods. Further ablation studies examine the impact of embedding models and corpus size on retrieval performance. T$^2$-RAGBench provides a realistic and rigorous benchmark for existing RAG methods on text-and-table data. Code and dataset are available online.</description>

      <title>WebTrust: An AI-Driven Data Scoring System for Reliable Information Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As access to information becomes more open and widespread, people are increasingly using AI tools for assistance. However, many of these tools struggle to estimate the trustworthiness of the information. Although today's search engines include AI features, they often fail to offer clear indicators of data reliability. To address this gap, we introduce WebTrust, a system designed to simplify the process of finding and judging credible information online. Built on a fine-tuned version of IBM's Granite-1B model and trained on a custom dataset, WebTrust works by assigning a reliability score (from 0.1 to 1) to each statement it processes. In addition, it offers a clear justification for why a piece of information received that score. Evaluated using prompt engineering, WebTrust consistently achieves superior performance compared to other small-scale LLMs and rule-based approaches, outperforming them across all experiments on MAE, RMSE, and R2. User testing showed that when reliability scores are displayed alongside search results, people feel more confident and satisfied with the information they find. With its accuracy, transparency, and ease of use, WebTrust offers a practical solution to help combat misinformation and make trustworthy information more accessible to everyone.</description>

      <title>T-TExTS (Teaching Text Expansion for Teacher Scaffolding): Enhancing Text Selection in High School Literature through Knowledge Graph-Based Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The implementation of transformational pedagogy in secondary education classrooms requires a broad multiliteracy approach. Due to limited planning time and resources, high school English Literature teachers often struggle to curate diverse, thematically aligned literature text sets. This study addresses the critical need for a tool that provides scaffolds for novice educators in selecting literature texts that are diverse -- in terms of genre, theme, subtheme, and author -- yet similar in context and pedagogical merits. We have developed a recommendation system, Teaching Text Expansion for Teacher Scaffolding (T-TExTS), that suggests high school English Literature books based on pedagogical merits, genre, and thematic relevance using a knowledge graph. We constructed a domain-specific ontology using the KNowledge Acquisition and Representation Methodology (KNARM), transformed into a knowledge graph, which was then embedded using DeepWalk, biased random walk, and a hybrid of both approaches. The system was evaluated using link prediction and recommendation performance metrics, including Area Under the Curve (AUC), Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), Hits@K, and normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (nDCG). DeepWalk outperformed in most ranking metrics, with the highest AUC (0.9431), whereas the hybrid model offered balanced performance. These findings demonstrate the importance of semantic, ontology-driven approaches in recommendation systems and suggest that T-TExTS can significantly ease the burden of English Literature text selection for high school educators, promoting more informed and inclusive curricular decisions.

      <title>A Gradient Meta-Learning Joint Optimization for Beamforming and Antenna Position in Pinching-Antenna Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a novel optimization design for multi-waveguide pinching-antenna systems, aiming to maximize the weighted sum rate (WSR) by jointly optimizing beamforming coefficients and antenna position. To handle the formulated non-convex problem, a gradient-based meta-learning joint optimization (GML-JO) algorithm is proposed. Specifically, the original problem is initially decomposed into two sub-problems of beamforming optimization and antenna position optimization through equivalent substitution. Then, the convex approximation methods are used to deal with the nonconvex constraints of sub-problems, and two sub-neural networks are constructed to calculate the sub-problems separately. Different from alternating optimization (AO), where two sub-problems are solved alternately and the solutions are influenced by the initial values, two sub-neural networks of proposed GML-JO with fixed channel coefficients are considered as local sub-tasks and the computation results are used to calculate the loss function of joint optimization. Finally, the parameters of sub-networks are updated using the average loss function over different sub-tasks and the solution that is robust to the initial value is obtained. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed GML-JO algorithm achieves 5.6 bits/s/Hz WSR within 100 iterations, yielding a 32.7\% performance enhancement over conventional AO with substantially reduced computational complexity. Moreover, the proposed GML-JO algorithm is robust to different choices of initialization and yields better performance compared with the existing optimization methods.</description>

      <title>INTERPOS: Interaction Rhythm Guided Positional Morphing for Mobile App Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mobile app market has expanded exponentially, offering millions of apps with diverse functionalities, yet research in mobile app recommendation remains limited. Traditional sequential recommender systems utilize the order of items in users' historical interactions to predict the next item for the users. Position embeddings, well-established in transformer-based architectures for natural language processing tasks, effectively distinguish token positions in sequences. In sequential recommendation systems, position embeddings can capture the order of items in a user's historical interaction sequence. Nevertheless, this ordering does not consider the time elapsed between two interactions of the same user (e.g., 1 day, 1 week, 1 month), referred to as "user rhythm". In mobile app recommendation datasets, the time between consecutive user interactions is notably longer compared to other domains like movies, posing significant challenges for sequential recommender systems. To address this phenomenon in the mobile app domain, we introduce INTERPOS, an Interaction Rhythm Guided Positional Morphing strategy for autoregressive mobile app recommender systems. INTERPOS incorporates rhythm-guided position embeddings, providing a more comprehensive representation that considers both the sequential order of interactions and the temporal gaps between them. This approach enables a deep understanding of users' rhythms at a fine-grained level, capturing the intricacies of their interaction patterns over time. We propose three strategies to incorporate the morphed positional embeddings in two transformer-based sequential recommendation system architectures. Our extensive evaluations show that INTERPOS outperforms state-of-the-art models using 7 mobile app recommendation datasets on NDCG@K and HIT@K metrics. The source code of INTERPOS is available at https://github.com/dlgrad/INTERPOS.</description>

      <title>Device-Cloud Collaborative Correction for On-Device Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid development of recommendation models and device computing power, device-based recommendation has become an important research area due to its better real-time performance and privacy protection. Previously, Transformer-based sequential recommendation models have been widely applied in this field because they outperform Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)-based recommendation models in terms of performance. However, as the length of interaction sequences increases, Transformer-based models introduce significantly more space and computational overhead compared to RNN-based models, posing challenges for device-based recommendation. To balance real-time performance and high performance on devices, we propose Device-Cloud \underline{Co}llaborative \underline{Corr}ection Framework for On-Device \underline{Rec}ommendation (CoCorrRec). CoCorrRec uses a self-correction network (SCN) to correct parameters with extremely low time cost. By updating model parameters during testing based on the input token, it achieves performance comparable to current optimal but more complex Transformer-based models. Furthermore, to prevent SCN from overfitting, we design a global correction network (GCN) that processes hidden states uploaded from devices and provides a global correction solution. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets show that CoCorrRec outperforms existing Transformer-based and RNN-based device recommendation models in terms of performance, with fewer parameters and lower FLOPs, thereby achieving a balance between real-time performance and high efficiency.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Group-wise Ranking Framework for Recommendation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In modern recommender systems, CTR/CVR models are increasingly trained with ranking objectives to improve item ranking quality. While this shift aligns training more closely with serving goals, most existing methods rely on in-batch negative sampling, which predominantly surfaces easy negatives. This limits the model's ability to capture fine-grained user preferences and weakens overall ranking performance. To address this, we propose a Hierarchical Group-wise Ranking Framework with two key components. First, we apply residual vector quantization to user embeddings to generate hierarchical user codes that partition users into hierarchical, trie-structured clusters. Second, we apply listwise ranking losses to user-item pairs at each level of the hierarchy, where shallow levels group loosely similar users and deeper levels group highly similar users, reinforcing learning-to-rank signals through progressively harder negatives. Since users with similar preferences and content exposure tend to yield more informative negatives, applying ranking losses within these hierarchical user groups serves as an effective approximation of hard negative mining. Our approach improves ranking performance without requiring complex real-time context collection or retrieval infrastructure. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently enhances both model calibration and ranking accuracy, offering a scalable and practical solution for industrial recommender systems.</description>

      <title>Identifying and Investigating Global News Coverage of Critical Events Such as Disasters and Terrorist Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Comparative studies of news coverage are challenging to conduct because methods to identify news articles about the same event in different languages require expertise that is difficult to scale. We introduce an AI-powered method for identifying news articles based on an event FINGERPRINT, which is a minimal set of metadata required to identify critical events. Our event coverage identification method, FINGERPRINT TO ARTICLE MATCHING FOR EVENTS (FAME), efficiently identifies news articles about critical world events, specifically terrorist attacks and several types of natural disasters. FAME does not require training data and is able to automatically and efficiently identify news articles that discuss an event given its fingerprint: time, location, and class (such as storm or flood). The method achieves state-of-the-art performance and scales to massive databases of tens of millions of news articles and hundreds of events happening globally. We use FAME to identify 27,441 articles that cover 470 natural disaster and terrorist attack events that happened in 2020. To this end, we use a massive database of news articles in three languages from MediaCloud, and three widely used, expert-curated databases of critical events: EM-DAT, USGS, and GTD. Our case study reveals patterns consistent with prior literature: coverage of disasters and terrorist attacks correlates to death counts, to the GDP of a country where the event occurs, and to trade volume between the reporting country and the country where the event occurred. We share our NLP annotations and cross-country media attention data to support the efforts of researchers and media monitoring organizations.</description>

      <title>SPOT: Bridging Natural Language and Geospatial Search for Investigative Journalists</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: OpenStreetMap (OSM) is a vital resource for investigative journalists doing geolocation verification. However, existing tools to query OSM data such as Overpass Turbo require familiarity with complex query languages, creating barriers for non-technical users. We present SPOT, an open source natural language interface that makes OSM's rich, tag-based geographic data more accessible through intuitive scene descriptions. SPOT interprets user inputs as structured representations of geospatial object configurations using fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs), with results being displayed in an interactive map interface. While more general geospatial search tasks are conceivable, SPOT is specifically designed for use in investigative journalism, addressing real-world challenges such as hallucinations in model output, inconsistencies in OSM tagging, and the noisy nature of user input. It combines a novel synthetic data pipeline with a semantic bundling system to enable robust, accurate query generation. To our knowledge, SPOT is the first system to achieve reliable natural language access to OSM data at this level of accuracy. By lowering the technical barrier to geolocation verification, SPOT contributes a practical tool to the broader efforts to support fact-checking and combat disinformation.</description>

      <title>Gated Rotary-Enhanced Linear Attention for Long-term Sequential Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Sequential Recommendation Systems (SRSs), Transformer models show remarkable performance but face computation cost challenges when modeling long-term user behavior sequences due to the quadratic complexity of the dot-product attention mechanism. By approximating the dot-product attention, linear attention provides an efficient option with linear complexity. However, existing linear attention methods face two limitations: 1) they often use learnable position encodings, which incur extra computational costs in long-term sequence scenarios, and 2) they may not consider the user's fine-grained local preferences and confuse these with the actual change of long-term interests. To remedy these drawbacks, we propose a long-term sequential Recommendation model with Gated Rotary Enhanced Linear Attention (RecGRELA). Specifically, we first propose a Rotary-Enhanced Linear Attention (RELA) module to model long-range dependency within the user's historical information using rotary position encodings. We then introduce a local short operation to incorporate local preferences and demonstrate the theoretical insight. We further introduce a SiLU-based Gated mechanism for RELA (GRELA) to help the model determine whether a user's behavior indicates local interest or a genuine shift in long-term preferences. Experimental results on four public datasets demonstrate that our RecGRELA achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing SRSs while maintaining low memory overhead.</description>

      <title>Beyond One-Size-Fits-All: A Study of Neural and Behavioural Variability Across Different Recommendation Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditionally, Recommender Systems (RS) have primarily measured performance based on the accuracy and relevance of their recommendations. However, this algorithmic-centric approach overlooks how different types of recommendations impact user engagement and shape the overall quality of experience. In this paper, we shift the focus to the user and address for the first time the challenge of decoding the neural and behavioural variability across distinct recommendation categories, considering more than just relevance. Specifically, we conducted a controlled study using a comprehensive e-commerce dataset containing various recommendation types, and collected Electroencephalography and behavioural data. We analysed both neural and behavioural responses to recommendations that were categorised as Exact, Substitute, Complement, or Irrelevant products within search query results. Our findings offer novel insights into user preferences and decision-making processes, revealing meaningful relationships between behavioural and neural patterns for each category, but also indicate inter-subject variability.</description>

      <title>Tree-Based Text Retrieval via Hierarchical Clustering in RAGFrameworks: Application on Taiwanese Regulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems employ brute-force inner product search to retrieve the top-k most similar documents, then combined with the user query and passed to a language model. This allows the model to access external knowledge and reduce hallucinations. However, selecting an appropriate k value remains a significant challenge in practical applications: a small k may fail to retrieve sufficient information, while a large k can introduce excessive and irrelevant content. To address this, we propose a hierarchical clustering-based retrieval method that eliminates the need to predefine k. Our approach maintains the accuracy and relevance of system responses while adaptively selecting semantically relevant content. In the experiment stage, we applied our method to a Taiwanese legal dataset with expert-graded queries. The results show that our approach achieves superior performance in expert evaluations and maintains high precision while eliminating the need to predefine k, demonstrating improved accuracy and interpretability in legal text retrieval tasks. Our framework is simple to implement and easily integrates with existing RAG pipelines, making it a practical solution for real-world applications under limited resources.</description>

Abstract: Recommender systems have been widely used in various large-scale user-oriented platforms for many years. However, compared to the rapid developments in the AI community, recommendation systems have not achieved a breakthrough in recent years. For instance, they still rely on a multi-stage cascaded architecture rather than an end-to-end approach, leading to computational fragmentation and optimization inconsistencies, and hindering the effective application of key breakthrough technologies from the AI community in recommendation scenarios.
  To address these issues, we propose OneRec, which reshapes the recommendation system through an end-to-end generative approach and achieves promising results. Firstly, we have enhanced the computational FLOPs of the current recommendation model by 10 $\times$ and have identified the scaling laws for recommendations within certain boundaries. Secondly, reinforcement learning techniques, previously difficult to apply for optimizing recommendations, show significant potential in this framework. Lastly, through infrastructure optimizations, we have achieved 23.7% and 28.8% Model FLOPs Utilization (MFU) on flagship GPUs during training and inference, respectively, aligning closely with the LLM community. This architecture significantly reduces communication and storage overhead, resulting in operating expense that is only 10.6% of traditional recommendation pipelines. Deployed in Kuaishou/Kuaishou Lite APP, it handles 25% of total queries per second, enhancing overall App Stay Time by 0.54% and 1.24%, respectively. Additionally, we have observed significant increases in metrics such as 7-day Lifetime, which is a crucial indicator of recommendation experience. We also provide practical lessons and insights derived from developing, optimizing, and maintaining a production-scale recommendation system with significant real-world impact.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) plays a pivotal role in modern large language model applications, with numerous existing frameworks offering a wide range of functionalities to facilitate the development of RAG systems. However, we have identified several persistent challenges in these frameworks, including difficulties in algorithm reproduction and sharing, lack of new techniques, and high system overhead. To address these limitations, we introduce \textbf{FlexRAG}, an open-source framework specifically designed for research and prototyping. FlexRAG supports text-based, multimodal, and network-based RAG, providing comprehensive lifecycle support alongside efficient asynchronous processing and persistent caching capabilities. By offering a robust and flexible solution, FlexRAG enables researchers to rapidly develop, deploy, and share advanced RAG systems. Our toolkit and resources are available at \href{https://github.com/ictnlp/FlexRAG}{https://github.com/ictnlp/FlexRAG}.</description>

      <title>DoTA-RAG: Dynamic of Thought Aggregation RAG</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce DoTA-RAG (Dynamic-of-Thought Aggregation RAG), a retrieval-augmented generation system optimized for high-throughput, large-scale web knowledge indexes. Traditional RAG pipelines often suffer from high latency and limited accuracy over massive, diverse datasets. DoTA-RAG addresses these challenges with a three-stage pipeline: query rewriting, dynamic routing to specialized sub-indexes, and multi-stage retrieval and ranking. We further enhance retrieval by evaluating and selecting a superior embedding model, re-embedding the large FineWeb-10BT corpus. Moreover, we create a diverse Q&amp;A dataset of 500 questions generated via the DataMorgana setup across a broad range of WebOrganizer topics and formats. DoTA-RAG improves the answer correctness score from 0.752 (baseline, using LiveRAG pre-built vector store) to 1.478 while maintaining low latency, and it achieves a 0.929 correctness score on the Live Challenge Day. These results highlight DoTA-RAG's potential for practical deployment in domains requiring fast, reliable access to large and evolving knowledge sources.</description>

      <title>SciSage: A Multi-Agent Framework for High-Quality Scientific Survey Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid growth of scientific literature demands robust tools for automated survey-generation. However, current large language model (LLM)-based methods often lack in-depth analysis, structural coherence, and reliable citations. To address these limitations, we introduce SciSage, a multi-agent framework employing a reflect-when-you-write paradigm. SciSage features a hierarchical Reflector agent that critically evaluates drafts at outline, section, and document levels, collaborating with specialized agents for query interpretation, content retrieval, and refinement. We also release SurveyScope, a rigorously curated benchmark of 46 high-impact papers (2020-2025) across 11 computer science domains, with strict recency and citation-based quality controls. Evaluations demonstrate that SciSage outperforms state-of-the-art baselines (LLM x MapReduce-V2, AutoSurvey), achieving +1.73 points in document coherence and +32% in citation F1 scores. Human evaluations reveal mixed outcomes (3 wins vs. 7 losses against human-written surveys), but highlight SciSage's strengths in topical breadth and retrieval efficiency. Overall, SciSage offers a promising foundation for research-assistive writing tools.</description>

      <title>Versatile and Fast Location-Based Private Information Retrieval with Fully Homomorphic Encryption over the Torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Location-based services often require users to share sensitive locational data, raising privacy concerns due to potential misuse or exploitation by untrusted servers. In response, we present VeLoPIR, a versatile location-based private information retrieval (PIR) system designed to preserve user privacy while enabling efficient and scalable query processing. VeLoPIR introduces three operational modes-interval validation, coordinate validation, and identifier matching-that support a broad range of real-world applications, including information and emergency alerts. To enhance performance, VeLoPIR incorporates multi-level algorithmic optimizations with parallel structures, achieving significant scalability across both CPU and GPU platforms. We also provide formal security and privacy proofs, confirming the system's robustness under standard cryptographic assumptions. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that VeLoPIR achieves up to 11.55 times speed-up over a prior baseline. The implementation of VeLoPIR is publicly available at https://github.com/PrivStatBool/VeLoPIR.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Performance Gap Between Lexical and Semantic Models for Information Retrieval With Formulaic Legal Language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Legal passage retrieval is an important task that assists legal practitioners in the time-intensive process of finding relevant precedents to support legal arguments. This study investigates the task of retrieving legal passages or paragraphs from decisions of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU), whose language is highly structured and formulaic, leading to repetitive patterns. Understanding when lexical or semantic models are more effective at handling the repetitive nature of legal language is key to developing retrieval systems that are more accurate, efficient, and transparent for specific legal domains. To this end, we explore when this routinized legal language is better suited for retrieval using methods that rely on lexical and statistical features, such as BM25, or dense retrieval models trained to capture semantic and contextual information. A qualitative and quantitative analysis with three complementary metrics shows that both lexical and dense models perform well in scenarios with more repetitive usage of language, whereas BM25 performs better than the dense models in more nuanced scenarios where repetition and verbatim~quotes are less prevalent and in longer queries. Our experiments also show that BM25 is a strong baseline, surpassing off-the-shelf dense models in 4 out of 7 performance metrics. However, fine-tuning a dense model on domain-specific data led to improved performance, surpassing BM25 in most metrics, and we analyze the effect of the amount of data used in fine-tuning on the model's performance and temporal robustness. The code, dataset and appendix related to this work are available on: https://github.com/larimo/lexsem-legal-ir.</description>

      <title>Efficient Neuro-Symbolic Retrieval-Augmented Generation through Adaptive Query Routing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems address factual inconsistencies in Large Language Models by grounding generation in external knowledge, yet they face a fundamental efficiency problem: simple queries consume computational resources equivalent to complex multi-hop reasoning tasks. We present SymRAG, a neuro-symbolic framework that introduces adaptive query routing based on real-time complexity and system load assessments. SymRAG dynamically selects symbolic, neural, or hybrid processing paths to align resource use with query demands. Evaluated on 2,000 queries from HotpotQA and DROP using Llama-3.2-3B and Mistral-7B models, SymRAG achieves 97.6--100.0% exact match accuracy with significantly lower CPU utilization (3.6--6.2%) and processing time (0.985--3.165s). Disabling adaptive logic results in 169--1151% increase in processing time, highlighting the framework's impact. These results underscore the potential of adaptive neuro-symbolic routing for scalable, sustainable AI systems.</description>

      <title>Vector Ontologies as an LLM world view extraction method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) possess intricate internal representations of the world, yet these latent structures are notoriously difficult to interpret or repurpose beyond the original prediction task. Building on our earlier work (Rothenfusser, 2025), which introduced the concept of vector ontologies as a framework for translating high-dimensional neural representations into interpretable geometric structures, this paper provides the first empirical validation of that approach. A vector ontology defines a domain-specific vector space spanned by ontologically meaningful dimensions, allowing geometric analysis of concepts and relationships within a domain. We construct an 8-dimensional vector ontology of musical genres based on Spotify audio features and test whether an LLM's internal world model of music can be consistently and accurately projected into this space. Using GPT-4o-mini, we extract genre representations through multiple natural language prompts and analyze the consistency of these projections across linguistic variations and their alignment with ground-truth data. Our results show (1) high spatial consistency of genre projections across 47 query formulations, (2) strong alignment between LLM-inferred genre locations and real-world audio feature distributions, and (3) evidence of a direct relationship between prompt phrasing and spatial shifts in the LLM's inferred vector ontology. These findings demonstrate that LLMs internalize structured, repurposable knowledge and that vector ontologies offer a promising method for extracting and analyzing this knowledge in a transparent and verifiable way.</description>

      <title>Accessibility Barriers in Multi-Terabyte Public Datasets: The Gap Between Promise and Practice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The promise of "free and open" multi-terabyte datasets often collides with harsh realities. While these datasets may be technically accessible, practical barriers -- from processing complexity to hidden costs -- create a system that primarily serves well-funded institutions. This study examines accessibility challenges across web crawls, satellite imagery, scientific data, and collaborative projects, revealing a consistent two-tier system where theoretical openness masks practical exclusivity. Our analysis demonstrates that datasets marketed as "publicly accessible" typically require minimum investments of \$1,000+ for meaningful analysis, with complex processing pipelines demanding \$10,000-100,000+ in infrastructure costs. The infrastructure requirements -- distributed computing knowledge, domain expertise, and substantial budgets -- effectively gatekeep these datasets despite their "open" status, limiting practical accessibility to those with institutional support or substantial resources.</description>

      <title>Digital Transformation of Urban Planning in Australia: Influencing Factors and Key Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the past two decades, several governments in developing and developed countries have started their journey toward digital transformation. However, the pace and maturity of digital technologies and strategies are different between public services. Current literature indicates that research on the digital transformation of urban planning is still developing. Therefore, the aim of this study is to understand the influencing factors and key challenges for the digital transformation of urban planning in Australia. The study adopts the inter-organisational theory and Planning Support Science (PSScience) under the Technological, Organisational, and External Environmental (TOE) framework. It involves a multiple case study, administered semi-structured interviews with thirteen IT and urban planning experts across Victoria and New South Wales governments and private industries. The study findings indicate that the main challenges for digital transformation of the Australian urban planning system are related to organisational and external environmental factors. Furthermore, a digital maturity model is absent in the Australian urban planning industry. This study offers important implications to research and practice related to digital transformation in urban planning.</description>

      <title>Decompositional Reasoning for Graph Retrieval with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at many NLP tasks, but struggle with multi-hop reasoning and factual consistency, limiting their effectiveness on knowledge-intensive tasks like complex question answering (QA). Linking Knowledge Graphs (KG) and LLMs has shown promising results, but LLMs generally lack the ability to reason efficiently over graph-structured information. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel retrieval approach that integrates textual knowledge graphs into the LLM reasoning process via query decomposition. Our method decomposes complex questions into sub-questions, retrieves relevant textual subgraphs, and composes a question-specific knowledge graph to guide answer generation. For that, we use a weighted similarity function that focuses on both the complex question and the generated subquestions to extract a relevant subgraph, which allows efficient and precise retrieval for complex questions and improves the performance of LLMs on multi-hop QA tasks. This structured reasoning pipeline enhances factual grounding and interpretability while leveraging the generative strengths of LLMs. We evaluate our method on standard multi-hop QA benchmarks and show that it achieves comparable or superior performance to competitive existing methods, using smaller models and fewer LLM calls.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Multi-Positive Contrastive Learning for Patent Image Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Patent images are technical drawings that convey information about a patent's innovation. Patent image retrieval systems aim to search in vast collections and retrieve the most relevant images. Despite recent advances in information retrieval, patent images still pose significant challenges due to their technical intricacies and complex semantic information, requiring efficient fine-tuning for domain adaptation. Current methods neglect patents' hierarchical relationships, such as those defined by the Locarno International Classification (LIC) system, which groups broad categories (e.g., "furnishing") into subclasses (e.g., "seats" and "beds") and further into specific patent designs. In this work, we introduce a hierarchical multi-positive contrastive loss that leverages the LIC's taxonomy to induce such relations in the retrieval process. Our approach assigns multiple positive pairs to each patent image within a batch, with varying similarity scores based on the hierarchical taxonomy. Our experimental analysis with various vision and multimodal models on the DeepPatent2 dataset shows that the proposed method enhances the retrieval results. Notably, our method is effective with low-parameter models, which require fewer computational resources and can be deployed on environments with limited hardware.</description>

      <title>LTRR: Learning To Rank Retrievers for LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems typically rely on a single fixed retriever, despite growing evidence that no single retriever performs optimally across all query types. In this paper, we explore a query routing approach that dynamically selects from a pool of retrievers based on the query, using both train-free heuristics and learned routing models. We frame routing as a learning-to-rank (LTR) problem and introduce LTRR, a framework that learns to rank retrievers by their expected utility gain to downstream LLM performance. Our experiments, conducted on synthetic QA data with controlled query type variations, show that routing-based RAG systems can outperform the best single-retriever-based systems. Performance gains are especially pronounced in models trained with the Answer Correctness (AC) metric and with pairwise learning approaches, especially with XGBoost. We also observe improvements in generalization to out-of-distribution queries. As part of the SIGIR 2025 LiveRAG challenge, our submitted system demonstrated the practical viability of our approach, achieving competitive performance in both answer correctness and faithfulness. These findings highlight the importance of both training methodology and metric selection in query routing for RAG systems.</description>

      <title>CoLLM: Integrating Collaborative Embeddings into Large Language Models for Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19488v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Leveraging Large Language Models as Recommenders (LLMRec) has gained significant attention and introduced fresh perspectives in user preference modeling. Existing LLMRec approaches prioritize text semantics, usually neglecting the valuable collaborative information from user-item interactions in recommendations. While these text-emphasizing approaches excel in cold-start scenarios, they may yield sub-optimal performance in warm-start situations. In pursuit of superior recommendations for both cold and warm start scenarios, we introduce CoLLM, an innovative LLMRec methodology that seamlessly incorporates collaborative information into LLMs for recommendation. CoLLM captures collaborative information through an external traditional model and maps it to the input token embedding space of LLM, forming collaborative embeddings for LLM usage. Through this external integration of collaborative information, CoLLM ensures effective modeling of collaborative information without modifying the LLM itself, providing the flexibility to employ various collaborative information modeling techniques. Extensive experiments validate that CoLLM adeptly integrates collaborative information into LLMs, resulting in enhanced recommendation performance. We release the code and data at https://github.com/zyang1580/CoLLM.</description>

Abstract: Conversational search, unlike single-turn retrieval tasks, requires understanding the current question within a dialogue context. The common approach of rewrite-then-retrieve aims to decontextualize questions to be self-sufficient for off-the-shelf retrievers, but most existing methods produce sub-optimal query rewrites due to the limited ability to incorporate signals from the retrieval results. To overcome this limitation, we present a novel framework RetPO (Retriever's Preference Optimization), which is designed to optimize a language model (LM) for reformulating search queries in line with the preferences of the target retrieval systems. The process begins by prompting a large LM to produce various potential rewrites and then collects retrieval performance for these rewrites as the retrievers' preferences. Through the process, we construct a large-scale dataset called RF collection, containing Retrievers' Feedback on over 410K query rewrites across 12K conversations. Furthermore, we fine-tune a smaller LM on this dataset to align it with the retrievers' feedback. Our resulting model demonstrates superiority on two benchmarks, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art performance of rewrite-then-retrieve approaches.</description>

      <title>Contrastive Representation for Interactive Recommendation</title>

Abstract: Interactive Recommendation (IR) has gained significant attention recently for its capability to quickly capture dynamic interest and optimize both short and long term objectives. IR agents are typically implemented through Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), because DRL is inherently compatible with the dynamic nature of IR. However, DRL is currently not perfect for IR. Due to the large action space and sample inefficiency problem, training DRL recommender agents is challenging. The key point is that useful features cannot be extracted as high-quality representations for the recommender agent to optimize its policy. To tackle this problem, we propose Contrastive Representation for Interactive Recommendation (CRIR). CRIR efficiently extracts latent, high-level preference ranking features from explicit interaction, and leverages the features to enhance users' representation. Specifically, the CRIR provides representation through one representation network, and refines it through our proposed Preference Ranking Contrastive Learning (PRCL). The key insight of PRCL is that it can perform contrastive learning without relying on computations involving high-level representations or large potential action sets. Furthermore, we also propose a data exploiting mechanism and an agent training mechanism to better adapt CRIR to the DRL backbone. Extensive experiments have been carried out to show our method's superior improvement on the sample efficiency while training an DRL-based IR agent.</description>

      <title>On Synthesizing Data for Context Attribution in Question Answering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05317v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Question Answering (QA) accounts for a significant portion of LLM usage "in the wild". However, LLMs sometimes produce false or misleading responses, also known as "hallucinations". Therefore, grounding the generated answers in contextually provided information -- i.e., providing evidence for the generated text -- is paramount for LLMs' trustworthiness. Providing this information is the task of context attribution. In this paper, we systematically study LLM-based approaches for this task, namely we investigate (i) zero-shot inference, (ii) LLM ensembling, and (iii) fine-tuning of small LMs on synthetic data generated by larger LLMs. Our key contribution is SynQA: a novel generative strategy for synthesizing context attribution data. Given selected context sentences, an LLM generates QA pairs that are supported by these sentences. This leverages LLMs' natural strengths in text generation while ensuring clear attribution paths in the synthetic training data. We show that the attribution data synthesized via SynQA is highly effective for fine-tuning small LMs for context attribution in different QA tasks and domains. Finally, with a user study, we validate the usefulness of small LMs (fine-tuned on synthetic data from SynQA) in context attribution for QA.</description>

      <title>JEPA4Rec: Learning Effective Language Representations for Sequential Recommendation via Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10512v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Language representation learning has emerged as a promising approach for sequential recommendation, thanks to its ability to learn generalizable representations. However, despite its advantages, this approach still struggles with data sparsity and a limited understanding of common-sense user preferences. To address these limitations, we propose $\textbf{JEPA4Rec}$, a framework that combines $\textbf{J}$oint $\textbf{E}$mbedding $\textbf{P}$redictive $\textbf{A}$rchitecture with language modeling of item textual descriptions. JEPA4Rec captures semantically rich and transferable representations, improving recommendation performance and reducing reliance on large-scale pre-training data. Specifically, JEPA4Rec represents items as text sentences by flattening descriptive information such as $\textit{title, category}$, and other attributes. To encode these sentences, we employ a bidirectional Transformer encoder with modified embedding layers tailored for capturing item information in recommendation datasets. We apply masking to text sentences and use them to predict the representations of the unmasked sentences, helping the model learn generalizable item embeddings. To further improve recommendation performance and language understanding, we employ a two-stage training strategy incorporating self-supervised learning losses. Experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate that JEPA4Rec consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in cross-domain, cross-platform, and low-resource scenarios.</description>

      <title>A Reference Model and Patterns for Production Event Data Enrichment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11502v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the advent of digital transformation, organisations are increasingly generating large volumes of data through the execution of various processes across disparate systems. By integrating data from these heterogeneous sources, it becomes possible to derive new insights essential for tasks such as monitoring and analysing process performance. Typically, this information is extracted during a data pre-processing or engineering phase. However, this step is often performed in an ad-hoc manner and is time-consuming and labour-intensive. To streamline this process, we introduce a reference model and a collection of patterns designed to enrich production event data. The reference model provides a standard way for storing and extracting production event data. The patterns describe common information extraction tasks and how such tasks can be automated effectively. The reference model is developed by combining the ISA-95 industry standard with the Event Knowledge Graph formalism. The patterns are developed based on empirical observations from event data sets originating in manufacturing processes and are formalised using the reference model. We evaluate the relevance and applicability of these patterns by demonstrating their application to use cases.</description>

      <title>TongSearch-QR: Reinforced Query Reasoning for Retrieval</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11603v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional information retrieval (IR) methods excel at textual and semantic matching but struggle in reasoning-intensive retrieval tasks that require multi-hop inference or complex semantic understanding between queries and documents. One promising solution is to explicitly rewrite or augment queries using large language models (LLMs) to elicit reasoning-relevant content prior to retrieval. However, the widespread use of large-scale language models like GPT-4 or LLaMA3-70B remains impractical due to their high inference cost and limited deployability in real-world systems. In this work, we introduce TongSearch QR (Previously Known as "TongSearch Reasoner"), a family of small-scale language models for query reasoning and rewriting in reasoning-intensive retrieval. With a novel semi-rule-based reward function, we employ reinforcement learning approaches enabling smaller language models, e,g, Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct, to achieve query reasoning performance rivaling large-scale language models without their prohibitive inference costs. Experiment results on BRIGHT benchmark show that with BM25 as retrievers, both TongSearch QR-7B and TongSearch QR-1.5B models significantly outperform existing baselines, including prompt-based query reasoners and some latest dense retrievers trained for reasoning-intensive retrieval tasks, offering superior adaptability for real-world deployment.</description>

      <title>Generative Representational Learning of Foundation Models for Recommendation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11999v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Developing a single foundation model with the capability to excel across diverse tasks has been a long-standing objective in the field of artificial intelligence. As the wave of general-purpose foundation models sweeps across various domains, their influence has significantly extended to the field of recommendation systems. While recent efforts have explored recommendation foundation models for various generative tasks, they often overlook crucial embedding tasks and struggle with the complexities of multi-task learning, including knowledge sharing &amp; conflict resolution, and convergence speed inconsistencies. To address these limitations, we introduce RecFound, a generative representational learning framework for recommendation foundation models. We construct the first comprehensive dataset for recommendation foundation models covering both generative and embedding tasks across diverse scenarios. Based on this dataset, we propose a novel multi-task training scheme featuring a Task-wise Mixture of Low-rank Experts (TMoLE) to handle knowledge sharing &amp; conflict, a Step-wise Convergence-oriented Sample Scheduler (S2Sched) to address inconsistent convergence, and a Model Merge module to balance the performance across tasks. Experiments demonstrate that RecFound achieves state-of-the-art performance across various recommendation tasks, outperforming existing baselines.</description>

      <title>Context-Augmented Code Generation Using Programming Knowledge Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18251v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and Code-LLMs (CLLMs) have significantly improved code generation, but, they frequently face difficulties when dealing with challenging and complex problems. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this issue by retrieving and integrating external knowledge at the inference time. However, retrieval models often fail to find most relevant context, and generation models, with limited context capacity, can hallucinate when given irrelevant data. We present a novel framework that leverages a Programming Knowledge Graph (PKG) to semantically represent and retrieve code. This approach enables fine-grained code retrieval by focusing on the most relevant segments while reducing irrelevant context through a tree-pruning technique. PKG is coupled with a re-ranking mechanism to reduce even more hallucinations by selectively integrating non-RAG solutions. We propose two retrieval approaches-block-wise and function-wise-based on the PKG, optimizing context granularity. Evaluations on the HumanEval and MBPP benchmarks show our method improves pass@1 accuracy by up to 20%, and outperforms state-of-the-art models by up to 34% on MBPP. Our contributions include PKG-based retrieval, tree pruning to enhance retrieval precision, a re-ranking method for robust solution selection and a Fill-in-the-Middle (FIM) enhancer module for automatic code augmentation with relevant comments and docstrings.</description>

      <title>DKT2: Revisiting Applicable and Comprehensive Knowledge Tracing in Large-Scale Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14256v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Knowledge Tracing (KT) is a fundamental component of Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS), enabling the modeling of students' knowledge states to predict future performance. The introduction of Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT), the first deep learning-based KT (DLKT) model, has brought significant advantages in terms of applicability and comprehensiveness. However, recent DLKT models, such as Attentive Knowledge Tracing (AKT), have often prioritized predictive performance at the expense of these benefits. While deep sequential models like DKT have shown potential, they face challenges related to parallel computing, storage decision modification, and limited storage capacity. To address these limitations, we propose DKT2, a novel KT model that leverages the recently developed xLSTM architecture. DKT2 enhances applicable input representation using the Rasch model and incorporates Item Response Theory (IRT) for output interpretability, allowing for the decomposition of learned knowledge into familiar and unfamiliar knowledge. By integrating this knowledge with predicted questions, DKT2 generates comprehensive knowledge states. Extensive experiments conducted across three large-scale datasets demonstrate that DKT2 consistently outperforms 18 baseline models in various prediction tasks, underscoring its potential for real-world educational applications. This work bridges the gap between theoretical advancements and practical implementation in KT. Our code and datasets are fully available at https://github.com/zyy-2001/DKT2.</description>

      <title>Reference-Aligned Retrieval-Augmented Question Answering over Heterogeneous Proprietary Documents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19596v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Proprietary corporate documents contain rich domain-specific knowledge, but their overwhelming volume and disorganized structure make it difficult even for employees to access the right information when needed. For example, in the automotive industry, vehicle crash-collision tests, each costing hundreds of thousands of dollars, produce highly detailed documentation. However, retrieving relevant content during decision-making remains time-consuming due to the scale and complexity of the material. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based Question Answering (QA) systems offer a promising solution, building an internal RAG-QA system poses several challenges: (1) handling heterogeneous multi-modal data sources, (2) preserving data confidentiality, and (3) enabling traceability between each piece of information in the generated answer and its original source document. To address these, we propose a RAG-QA framework for internal enterprise use, consisting of: (1) a data pipeline that converts raw multi-modal documents into a structured corpus and QA pairs, (2) a fully on-premise, privacy-preserving architecture, and (3) a lightweight reference matcher that links answer segments to supporting content. Applied to the automotive domain, our system improves factual correctness (+1.79, +1.94), informativeness (+1.33, +1.16), and helpfulness (+1.08, +1.67) over a non-RAG baseline, based on 1-5 scale ratings from both human and LLM judge.</description>

      <title>Affordable AI Assistants with Knowledge Graph of Thoughts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02670v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are revolutionizing the development of AI assistants capable of performing diverse tasks across domains. However, current state-of-the-art LLM-driven agents face significant challenges, including high operational costs and limited success rates on complex benchmarks like GAIA. To address these issues, we propose Knowledge Graph of Thoughts (KGoT), an innovative AI assistant architecture that integrates LLM reasoning with dynamically constructed knowledge graphs (KGs). KGoT extracts and structures task-relevant knowledge into a dynamic KG representation, iteratively enhanced through external tools such as math solvers, web crawlers, and Python scripts. Such structured representation of task-relevant knowledge enables low-cost models to solve complex tasks effectively while also minimizing bias and noise. For example, KGoT achieves a 29% improvement in task success rates on the GAIA benchmark compared to Hugging Face Agents with GPT-4o mini. Moreover, harnessing a smaller model dramatically reduces operational costs by over 36x compared to GPT-4o. Improvements for other models (e.g., Qwen2.5-32B and Deepseek-R1-70B) and benchmarks (e.g., SimpleQA) are similar. KGoT offers a scalable, affordable, versatile, and high-performing solution for AI assistants.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08385v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scholar Inbox is a new open-access platform designed to address the challenges researchers face in staying current with the rapidly expanding volume of scientific literature. We provide personalized recommendations, continuous updates from open-access archives (arXiv, bioRxiv, etc.), visual paper summaries, semantic search, and a range of tools to streamline research workflows and promote open research access. The platform's personalized recommendation system is trained on user ratings, ensuring that recommendations are tailored to individual researchers' interests. To further enhance the user experience, Scholar Inbox also offers a map of science that provides an overview of research across domains, enabling users to easily explore specific topics. We use this map to address the cold start problem common in recommender systems, as well as an active learning strategy that iteratively prompts users to rate a selection of papers, allowing the system to learn user preferences quickly. We evaluate the quality of our recommendation system on a novel dataset of 800k user ratings, which we make publicly available, as well as via an extensive user study. https://www.scholar-inbox.com/</description>
