      <title>Schmidt quantum compressor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces the Schmidt quantum compressor, an innovative approach to quantum data compression that leverages the principles of Schmidt decomposition to encode quantum information efficiently. In contrast to traditional variational quantum autoencoders, which depend on stochastic optimization and face challenges such as shot noise, barren plateaus, and non-convex optimization landscapes, our deterministic method substantially reduces the complexity and computational overhead of quantum data compression. We evaluate the performance of the compressor through numerical experiments, demonstrating its ability to achieve high fidelity in quantum state reconstruction compared to variational quantum algorithms. Furthermore, we demonstrate the practical utility of the Schmidt quantum compressor in one-class classification tasks.</description>

      <title>Raft Distributed System for Multi-access Edge Computing Sharing Resources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Researchers all over the world are employing a variety of analysis approaches in attempt to provide a safer and faster solution for sharing resources via a Multi-access Edge Computing system. Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) is a job-sharing method within the edge server network whose main aim is to maximize the pace of the computing process, resulting in a more powerful and enhanced user experience. Although there are many other options when it comes to determining the fastest method for computing processes, our paper introduces a rather more extensive change to the system model to assure no data loss and/or task failure due to any scrutiny in the edge node cluster. RAFT, a powerful consensus algorithm, can be used to introduce an auction theory approach in our system, which enables the edge device to make the best decision possible regarding how to respond to a request from the client. Through the use of the RAFT consensus, blockchain may be used to improve the safety, security, and efficiency of applications by deploying it on trustful edge base stations. In addition to discussing the best-distributed system approach for our (MEC) system, a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm is also presented in order to reduce overall system latency. Assumed in our proposal is the existence of a cluster of N Edge nodes, each containing a series of tasks that require execution. A DDPG algorithm is implemented in this cluster so that an auction can be held within the cluster of edge nodes to decide which edge node is best suited for performing the task provided by the client.</description>

      <title>Fatigue Monitoring Using Wearables and AI: Trends, Challenges, and Future Opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monitoring fatigue is essential for improving safety, particularly for people who work long shifts or in high-demand workplaces. The development of wearable technologies, such as fitness trackers and smartwatches, has made it possible to continuously analyze physiological signals in real-time to determine a person level of exhaustion. This has allowed for timely insights into preventing hazards associated with fatigue. This review focuses on wearable technology and artificial intelligence (AI) integration for tiredness detection, adhering to the PRISMA principles. Studies that used signal processing methods to extract pertinent aspects from physiological data, such as ECG, EMG, and EEG, among others, were analyzed as part of the systematic review process. Then, to find patterns of weariness and indicators of impending fatigue, these features were examined using machine learning and deep learning models. It was demonstrated that wearable technology and cutting-edge AI methods could accurately identify weariness through multi-modal data analysis. By merging data from several sources, information fusion techniques enhanced the precision and dependability of fatigue evaluation. Significant developments in AI-driven signal analysis were noted in the assessment, which should improve real-time fatigue monitoring while requiring less interference. Wearable solutions powered by AI and multi-source data fusion present a strong option for real-time tiredness monitoring in the workplace and other crucial environments. These developments open the door for more improvements in this field and offer useful tools for enhancing safety and reducing fatigue-related hazards.</description>

      <title>On the ETHOS of AI Agents: An Ethical Technology and Holistic Oversight System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a world increasingly defined by machine intelligence, the future depends on how we govern the development and integration of AI into society. Recent initiatives, such as the EU AI Act, EDPB opinion, U.S. Bipartisan House Task Force and NIST AI Risk Management Report, highlight the urgent need for robust governance frameworks to address the challenges posed by advancing AI technologies. However, existing frameworks fail to adequately address the rise of AI agents or the ongoing debate between centralized and decentralized governance models. To bridge these gaps, we propose the Ethical Technology and Holistic Oversight System framework, which leverages Web3 technologies, including blockchain, smart contracts, decentralized autonomous organizations, and soulbound tokens, to establish a decentralized global registry for AI agents. ETHOS incorporates the concept of AI specific legal entities, enabling these systems to assume limited liability and ensuring accountability through mechanisms like insurance and compliance monitoring. Additionally, the framework emphasizes the need for a collaborative, participatory approach to AI governance, engaging diverse stakeholders through public education, transparency, and international coordination. ETHOS balances innovation with ethical accountability, providing a forward looking strategy for the responsible integration of AI agents into society. Finally, this exploration reflects the emergence of a new interdisciplinary field we define as Systems Thinking at the Intersection of AI, Web3, and Society.</description>

      <title>A Multi-AI Agent System for Autonomous Optimization of Agentic AI Solutions via Iterative Refinement and LLM-Driven Feedback Loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Agentic AI systems use specialized agents to handle tasks within complex workflows, enabling automation and efficiency. However, optimizing these systems often requires labor-intensive, manual adjustments to refine roles, tasks, and interactions. This paper introduces a framework for autonomously optimizing Agentic AI solutions across industries, such as NLP-driven enterprise applications. The system employs agents for Refinement, Execution, Evaluation, Modification, and Documentation, leveraging iterative feedback loops powered by an LLM (Llama 3.2-3B). The framework achieves optimal performance without human input by autonomously generating and testing hypotheses to improve system configurations. This approach enhances scalability and adaptability, offering a robust solution for real-world applications in dynamic environments. Case studies across diverse domains illustrate the transformative impact of this framework, showcasing significant improvements in output quality, relevance, and actionability. All data for these case studies, including original and evolved agent codes, along with their outputs, are here: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/evolver-1D11/</description>

      <title>Synergistic Integration of Blockchain and Software-Defined Networking in the Internet of Energy Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading, Smart Grids (SG), and electric vehicle energy management are integral components of the Internet of Energy (IoE) field. The integration of Software-Defined Networks (SDNs) and Blockchain (BC) technologies into the IoE domain offers potential benefits that have only been studied in the literature in a few works. In this paper, we investigate the state-of-art solutions that leverage both SDNs and blockchain within the realm of the IoE. We categorize these solutions based on the method of integrating SDN and BC into two categories. The first category is the blockchain for SDN, where blockchain enhances the SDN directly. The second category is blockchain and SDN, where both technologies are used to enhance the proposed solutions. We identify three distinct blockchain applications based on their usage: decentralizing the SDN control plane, serving as a decentralized platform, and improving security measures. Similarly, we observe that SDN serves as a performance enhancer, a substitute for traditional networking, and solely as a control and management framework. It is posited that integrating SDNs and blockchain into IoE leads to performance enhancements, improves security, enables decentralized operations, and eliminates single points of failure in the SDN control plane. Additionally, some unaddressed issues, such as energy efficiency, smart contract management, and scalability, are discussed as potential future directions.</description>

      <title>Quantum AI for Alzheimer's disease early screening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00755v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning is a new research field combining quantum information science and machine learning. Quantum computing technologies appear to be particularly well-suited for addressing problems in the health sector efficiently. They have the potential to handle large datasets more effectively than classical models and offer greater transparency and interpretability for clinicians. Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative brain disorder that mostly affects elderly people, causing important cognitive impairments. It is the most common cause of dementia and it has an effect on memory, thought, learning abilities and movement control. This type of disease has no cure, consequently an early diagnosis is fundamental for reducing its impact. The analysis of handwriting can be effective for diagnosing, as many researches have conjectured. The DARWIN (Diagnosis AlzheimeR WIth haNdwriting) dataset contains handwriting samples from people affected by Alzheimer's disease and a group of healthy people. Here we apply quantum AI to this use-case. In particular, we use this dataset to test classical methods for classification and compare their performances with the ones obtained via quantum machine learning methods. We find that quantum methods generally perform better than classical methods. Our results pave the way for future new quantum machine learning applications in early-screening diagnostics in the healthcare domain.</description>
