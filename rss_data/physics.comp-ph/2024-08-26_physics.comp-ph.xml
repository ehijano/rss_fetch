      <title>Machine-Learning-Based Construction of Molecular Potential and Its Application in Exploring the Deep-Lying-Orbital Effect in HighOrder Harmonic Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Abstract. Creating soft-Coulomb-type (SC) molecular potential within single-active-electron approximation (SAE) is essential since it allows solving time-dependent Schr\"odinger equations with fewer computational resources compared to other multielectron methods. The current available SC potentials can accurately reproduce the energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), which is sufficient for analyzing nonlinear effects in laser-molecule interactions like high-order harmonic generation (HHG). However, recent discoveries of significant effects of deep-lying molecular orbitals call for more precise potentials to analyze them. In this study, we present a fast and accurate method based on machine learning to construct SC potentials that simultaneously reproduce various molecular features, including energies, symmetries, and dipole moments of HOMO, HOMO-1, and HOMO-2. We use this ML model to create SC SAE potentials of the HCN molecule and then comprehensively analyze the fingerprints of lower-lying orbitals in HHG spectra emitted during the H-CN stretching. Our findings reveal that HOMO-1 plays a role in forming the second HHG plateau. Additionally, as the H-C distance increases, the plateau structure and the smoothness of HHG spectra are altered due to the redistribution of orbital electron density. These results are in line with other experimental and theoretical studies. Lastly, the machine learning approach using deconvolution and convolution neural networks in the present study is so general that it can be applied to construct molecular potential for other molecules and molecular dynamic processes.</description>

      <title>Anti-correlation between excitations and locally-favored structures in glass-forming systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamics that are microscopic in space and time, so-called excitations, are considered the elementary unit of relaxation in the Dynamic Facilitation (DF) theory of the glass transition. Meanwhile, geometric motifs known as locally favored structures (LFS) are associated with vitrification in many glassformers. Recent work indicates that the probability of particles both found in locally favored structures (LFS) and excitations decreases significantly upon supercooling suggesting that there is an anti-correlation between them. [Ortlieb et al, Nature Commun. 14, 2621 (2023)]. However, the spatial relationship between excitations and LFS remains unclear. By employing state-of-the-art GPU computer simulations and colloid experiments, we analyze this relationship between LFS and excitations in model glassformers. We demonstrate that there is a spatial separation between the two in deeply supercooled liquids. This may be due to the fact that LFS are well-packed, thus they are solid and stable.</description>

      <title>Neural network assisted electrostatic global gyrokinetic toroidal code using cylindrical coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gyrokinetic simulation codes are used to understand the microturbulence in the linear and nonlinear regimes of the tokamak and stellarator core. The codes that use flux coordinates to reduce computational complexities introduced by the anisotropy due to the presence of confinement magnetic fields encounter a mathematical singularity of the metric on the magnetic separatrix surface. To overcome this constraint, we develop a neural network-assisted Global Gyrokinetic Code using Cylindrical Coordinates (G2C3) to study the electrostatic microturbulence in realistic tokamak geometries. In particular, G2C3 uses a cylindrical coordinate system for particle dynamics, which allows particle motion in arbitrarily shaped flux surfaces, including the magnetic separatrix of the tokamak. We use an efficient particle locating hybrid scheme, which uses a neural network and iterative local search algorithm, for the charge deposition and field interpolation. G2C3 uses the field lines estimated by numerical integration to train the neural network in universal function approximator mode to speed up the subroutines related to gathering and scattering operations of gyrokinetic simulation. Finally, as verification of the capability of the new code, we present results from self-consistent simulations of linear ion temperature gradient modes in the core region of the DIII-D tokamak.</description>

      <title>Low-light phase retrieval with implicit generative priors</title>

Abstract: Phase retrieval (PR) is fundamentally important in scientific imaging and is crucial for nanoscale techniques like coherent diffractive imaging (CDI). Low radiation dose imaging is essential for applications involving radiation-sensitive samples. However, most PR methods struggle in low-dose scenarios due to high shot noise. Recent advancements in optical data acquisition setups, such as in-situ CDI, have shown promise for low-dose imaging, but they rely on a time series of measurements, making them unsuitable for single-image applications. Similarly, data-driven phase retrieval techniques are not easily adaptable to data-scarce situations. Zero-shot deep learning methods based on pre-trained and implicit generative priors have been effective in various imaging tasks but have shown limited success in PR. In this work, we propose low-dose deep image prior (LoDIP), which combines in-situ CDI with the power of implicit generative priors to address single-image low-dose phase retrieval. Quantitative evaluations demonstrate LoDIP's superior performance in this task and its applicability to real experimental scenarios.</description>

      <title>Quantum Many-Body Physics Calculations with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03154v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated an unprecedented ability to perform complex tasks in multiple domains, including mathematical and scientific reasoning. We demonstrate that with carefully designed prompts, LLMs can accurately carry out key calculations in research papers in theoretical physics. We focus on a broadly used approximation method in quantum physics: the Hartree-Fock method, requiring an analytic multi-step calculation deriving approximate Hamiltonian and corresponding self-consistency equations. To carry out the calculations using LLMs, we design multi-step prompt templates that break down the analytic calculation into standardized steps with placeholders for problem-specific information. We evaluate GPT-4's performance in executing the calculation for 15 research papers from the past decade, demonstrating that, with correction of intermediate steps, it can correctly derive the final Hartree-Fock Hamiltonian in 13 cases and makes minor errors in 2 cases. Aggregating across all research papers, we find an average score of 87.5 (out of 100) on the execution of individual calculation steps. Overall, the requisite skill for doing these calculations is at the graduate level in quantum condensed matter theory. We further use LLMs to mitigate the two primary bottlenecks in this evaluation process: (i) extracting information from papers to fill in templates and (ii) automatic scoring of the calculation steps, demonstrating good results in both cases. The strong performance is the first step for developing algorithms that automatically explore theoretical hypotheses at an unprecedented scale.</description>

      <title>Accelerating the Convergence of Coupled Cluster Calculations of the Homogeneous Electron Gas Using Bayesian Ridge Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04645v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The homogeneous electron gas is a system which has many applications in chemistry and physics. However, its infinite nature makes studies at the many-body level complicated due to long computational run times. Because it is size extensive, coupled cluster theory is capable of studying the homogeneous electron gas, but it still poses a large computational challenge as the time needed for precise calculations increases in a polynomial manner with the number of particles and single-particle states. Consequently, achieving convergence in energy calculations becomes challenging, if not prohibited, due to long computational run times and high computational resource requirements. This paper develops the sequential regression extrapolation (SRE) to predict the coupled cluster energies of the homogeneous electron gas in the complete basis limit using Bayesian ridge regression to make predictions from calculations at truncated basis sizes. Using the SRE method we were able to predict the coupled cluster doubles energies for the electron gas across a variety of values of N and $r_s$, for a total of 70 predictions, with an average error of 4.28x10$^{-4}$ Hartrees while saving 88.9 hours of computational time. The SRE method can accurately extrapolate electron gas energies to the complete basis limit, saving both computational time and resources. Additionally, the SRE is a general method that can be applied to a variety of systems, many-body methods, and extrapolations.</description>

      <title>RBMD: A molecular dynamics package enabling to simulate 10 million all-atom particles in a single graphics processing unit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09315v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a random-batch molecular dynamics (RBMD) package for fast simulations of particle systems at the nano/micro scale. Different from existing packages, the RBMD uses random batch methods for nonbonded interactions of particle systems. The long-range part of Coulomb interactions is calculated in Fourier space by the random batch Ewald algorithm, which achieves linear complexity and superscalability, surpassing classical lattice-based Ewald methods. For the short-range part, the random batch list algorithm is used to construct neighbor lists, significantly reducing both computational and memory costs. The RBMD is implemented on GPU-CPU heterogeneous architectures, with classical force fields for all-atom systems. Benchmark systems are used to validate accuracy and performance of the package. Comparison with the particle-particle particle-mesh method and the Verlet list method in the LAMMPS package is performed on three different NVIDIA GPUs, demonstrating high efficiency of the RBMD on heterogeneous architectures. Our results also show that the RBMD enables simulations on a single GPU with a CPU core up to 10 million particles. Typically, for systems of one million particles, the RBMD allows simulating all-atom systems with a high efficiency of 8.20 ms per step, demonstrating the attractive feature for running large-scale simulations of practical applications on a desktop machine.</description>

      <title>Excitonic Instability in Ta2Pd3Te5 Monolayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01222v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By systematic theoretical calculations, we have revealed an excitonic insulator (EI) in the Ta2Pd3Te5 monolayer. The bulk Ta2Pd3Te5 is a van der Waals (vdW) layered compound, whereas the vdW layer can be obtained through exfoliation or molecular-beam epitaxy. First-principles calculations show that the monolayer is a nearly zero-gap semiconductor with the modified Becke-Johnson functional. Due to the same symmetry of the band-edge states, the two-dimensional polarization $\alpha_{2D}$ would be finite as the band gap goes to zero, allowing for an EI state in the compound. Using the first-principles many-body perturbation theory, the GW plus Bethe-Salpeter equation calculation reveals that the exciton binding energy is larger than the single-particle band gap, indicating the excitonic instability. The computed phonon spectrum suggests that the monolayer is dynamically stable without lattice distortion. Our findings suggest that the Ta2Pd3Te5 monolayer is an excitonic insulator without structural distortion.</description>
