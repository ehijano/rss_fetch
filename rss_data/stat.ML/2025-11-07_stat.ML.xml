      <title>Friction on Demand: A Generative Framework for the Inverse Design of Metainterfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing frictional interfaces to exhibit prescribed macroscopic behavior is a challenging inverse problem, made difficult by the non-uniqueness of solutions and the computational cost of contact simulations. Traditional approaches rely on heuristic search over low-dimensional parameterizations, which limits their applicability to more complex or nonlinear friction laws. We introduce a generative modeling framework using Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to infer surface topographies from target friction laws. Trained on a synthetic dataset composed of 200 million samples constructed from a parameterized contact mechanics model, the proposed method enables efficient, simulation-free generation of candidate topographies. We examine the potential and limitations of generative modeling for this inverse design task, focusing on balancing accuracy, throughput, and diversity in the generated solutions. Our results highlight trade-offs and outline practical considerations when balancing these objectives. This approach paves the way for near-real-time control of frictional behavior through tailored surface topographies.</description>

      <title>Bifidelity Karhunen-Lo\`eve Expansion Surrogate with Active Learning for Random Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a bifidelity Karhunen-Lo\`eve expansion (KLE) surrogate model for field-valued quantities of interest (QoIs) under uncertain inputs. The approach combines the spectral efficiency of the KLE with polynomial chaos expansions (PCEs) to preserve an explicit mapping between input uncertainties and output fields. By coupling inexpensive low-fidelity (LF) simulations that capture dominant response trends with a limited number of high-fidelity (HF) simulations that correct for systematic bias, the proposed method enables accurate and computationally affordable surrogate construction. To further improve surrogate accuracy, we form an active learning strategy that adaptively selects new HF evaluations based on the surrogate's generalization error, estimated via cross-validation and modeled using Gaussian process regression. New HF samples are then acquired by maximizing an expected improvement criterion, targeting regions of high surrogate error. The resulting BF-KLE-AL framework is demonstrated on three examples of increasing complexity: a one-dimensional analytical benchmark, a two-dimensional convection-diffusion system, and a three-dimensional turbulent round jet simulation based on Reynolds-averaged Navier--Stokes (RANS) and enhanced delayed detached-eddy simulations (EDDES). Across these cases, the method achieves consistent improvements in predictive accuracy and sample efficiency relative to single-fidelity and random-sampling approaches.</description>

      <title>Learning Paths for Dynamic Measure Transport: A Control Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We bring a control perspective to the problem of identifying paths of measures for sampling via dynamic measure transport (DMT). We highlight the fact that commonly used paths may be poor choices for DMT and connect existing methods for learning alternate paths to mean-field games. Based on these connections we pose a flexible family of optimization problems for identifying tilted paths of measures for DMT and advocate for the use of objective terms which encourage smoothness of the corresponding velocities. We present a numerical algorithm for solving these problems based on recent Gaussian process methods for solution of partial differential equations and demonstrate the ability of our method to recover more efficient and smooth transport models compared to those which use an untilted reference path.</description>

      <title>A general technique for approximating high-dimensional empirical kernel matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present simple, user-friendly bounds for the expected operator norm of a random kernel matrix under general conditions on the kernel function $k(\cdot,\cdot)$. Our approach uses decoupling results for U-statistics and the non-commutative Khintchine inequality to obtain upper and lower bounds depending only on scalar statistics of the kernel function and a ``correlation kernel'' matrix corresponding to $k(\cdot,\cdot)$. We then apply our method to provide new, tighter approximations for inner-product kernel matrices on general high-dimensional data, where the sample size and data dimension are polynomially related. Our method obtains simplified proofs of existing results that rely on the moment method and combinatorial arguments while also providing novel approximation results for the case of anisotropic Gaussian data. Finally, using similar techniques to our approximation result, we show a tighter lower bound on the bias of kernel regression with anisotropic Gaussian data.</description>

      <title>High-dimensional limit theorems for SGD: Momentum and Adaptive Step-sizes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a high-dimensional scaling limit for Stochastic Gradient Descent with Polyak Momentum (SGD-M) and adaptive step-sizes. This provides a framework to rigourously compare online SGD with some of its popular variants. We show that the scaling limits of SGD-M coincide with those of online SGD after an appropriate time rescaling and a specific choice of step-size. However, if the step-size is kept the same between the two algorithms, SGD-M will amplify high-dimensional effects, potentially degrading performance relative to online SGD. We demonstrate our framework on two popular learning problems: Spiked Tensor PCA and Single Index Models. In both cases, we also examine online SGD with an adaptive step-size based on normalized gradients. In the high-dimensional regime, this algorithm yields multiple benefits: its dynamics admit fixed points closer to the population minimum and widens the range of admissible step-sizes for which the iterates converge to such solutions. These examples provide a rigorous account, aligning with empirical motivation, of how early preconditioners can stabilize and improve dynamics in settings where online SGD fails.</description>

      <title>Robust inference using density-powered Stein operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a density-power weighted variant for the Stein operator, called the $\gamma$-Stein operator. This is a novel class of operators derived from the $\gamma$-divergence, designed to build robust inference methods for unnormalized probability models. The operator's construction (weighting by the model density raised to a positive power $\gamma$ inherently down-weights the influence of outliers, providing a principled mechanism for robustness. Applying this operator yields a robust generalization of score matching that retains the crucial property of being independent of the model's normalizing constant. We extend this framework to develop two key applications: the $\gamma$-kernelized Stein discrepancy for robust goodness-of-fit testing, and $\gamma$-Stein variational gradient descent for robust Bayesian posterior approximation. Empirical results on contaminated Gaussian and quartic potential models show our methods significantly outperform standard baselines in both robustness and statistical efficiency.</description>

      <title>Online Conformal Inference with Retrospective Adjustment for Faster Adaptation to Distribution Shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conformal prediction has emerged as a powerful framework for constructing distribution-free prediction sets with guaranteed coverage assuming only the exchangeability assumption. However, this assumption is often violated in online environments where data distributions evolve over time. Several recent approaches have been proposed to address this limitation, but, typically, they slowly adapt to distribution shifts because they update predictions only in a forward manner, that is, they generate a prediction for a newly observed data point while previously computed predictions are not updated. In this paper, we propose a novel online conformal inference method with retrospective adjustment, which is designed to achieve faster adaptation to distributional shifts. Our method leverages regression approaches with efficient leave-one-out update formulas to retroactively adjust past predictions when new data arrive, thereby aligning the entire set of predictions with the most recent data distribution. Through extensive numerical studies performed on both synthetic and real-world data sets, we show that the proposed approach achieves faster coverage recalibration and improved statistical efficiency compared to existing online conformal prediction methods.</description>

      <title>Robustness of Minimum-Volume Nonnegative Matrix Factorization under an Expanded Sufficiently Scattered Condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Minimum-volume nonnegative matrix factorization (min-vol NMF) has been used successfully in many applications, such as hyperspectral imaging, chemical kinetics, spectroscopy, topic modeling, and audio source separation. However, its robustness to noise has been a long-standing open problem. In this paper, we prove that min-vol NMF identifies the groundtruth factors in the presence of noise under a condition referred to as the expanded sufficiently scattered condition which requires the data points to be sufficiently well scattered in the latent simplex generated by the basis vectors.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Optimization of Geodesics and Fr\'echet Means</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A central part of geometric statistics is to compute the Fr\'echet mean. This is a well-known intrinsic mean on a Riemannian manifold that minimizes the sum of squared Riemannian distances from the mean point to all other data points. The Fr\'echet mean is simple to define and generalizes the Euclidean mean, but for most manifolds even minimizing the Riemannian distance involves solving an optimization problem. Therefore, numerical computations of the Fr\'echet mean require solving an embedded optimization problem in each iteration. We introduce the GEORCE-FM algorithm to simultaneously compute the Fr\'echet mean and Riemannian distances in each iteration in a local chart, making it faster than previous methods. We extend the algorithm to Finsler manifolds and introduce an adaptive extension such that GEORCE-FM scales to a large number of data points. Theoretically, we show that GEORCE-FM has global convergence and local quadratic convergence and prove that the adaptive extension converges in expectation to the Fr\'echet mean. We further empirically demonstrate that GEORCE-FM outperforms existing baseline methods to estimate the Fr\'echet mean in terms of both accuracy and runtime.</description>

      <title>Online Bayesian Experimental Design for Partially Observed Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bayesian experimental design (BED) provides a principled framework for optimizing data collection, but existing approaches do not apply to crucial real-world settings such as dynamical systems with partial observability, where only noisy and incomplete observations are available. These systems are naturally modeled as state-space models (SSMs), where latent states mediate the link between parameters and data, making the likelihood -- and thus information-theoretic objectives like the expected information gain (EIG) -- intractable. In addition, the dynamical nature of the system requires online algorithms that update posterior distributions and select designs sequentially in a computationally efficient manner. We address these challenges by deriving new estimators of the EIG and its gradient that explicitly marginalize latent states, enabling scalable stochastic optimization in nonlinear SSMs. Our approach leverages nested particle filters (NPFs) for efficient online inference with convergence guarantees. Applications to realistic models, such as the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) and a moving source location task, show that our framework successfully handles both partial observability and online computation.</description>

      <title>Riesz Regression As Direct Density Ratio Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Riesz regression has garnered attention as a tool in debiased machine learning for causal and structural parameter estimation (Chernozhukov et al., 2021). This study shows that Riesz regression is closely related to direct density-ratio estimation (DRE) in important cases, including average treat- ment effect (ATE) estimation. Specifically, the idea and objective in Riesz regression coincide with the one in least-squares importance fitting (LSIF, Kanamori et al., 2009) in direct density-ratio estimation. While Riesz regression is general in the sense that it can be applied to Riesz representer estimation in a wide class of problems, the equivalence with DRE allows us to directly import exist- ing results in specific cases, including convergence-rate analyses, the selection of loss functions via Bregman-divergence minimization, and regularization techniques for flexible models, such as neural networks. Conversely, insights about the Riesz representer in debiased machine learning broaden the applications of direct density-ratio estimation methods. This paper consolidates our prior results in Kato (2025a) and Kato (2025b).</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Neural Networks and Neural Operators for Parametric PDEs: A Human-AI Collaborative Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: PDEs arise ubiquitously in science and engineering, where solutions depend on parameters (physical properties, boundary conditions, geometry). Traditional numerical methods require re-solving the PDE for each parameter, making parameter space exploration prohibitively expensive. Recent machine learning advances, particularly physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and neural operators, have revolutionized parametric PDE solving by learning solution operators that generalize across parameter spaces. We critically analyze two main paradigms: (1) PINNs, which embed physical laws as soft constraints and excel at inverse problems with sparse data, and (2) neural operators (e.g., DeepONet, Fourier Neural Operator), which learn mappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces and achieve unprecedented generalization. Through comparisons across fluid dynamics, solid mechanics, heat transfer, and electromagnetics, we show neural operators can achieve computational speedups of $10^3$ to $10^5$ times faster than traditional solvers for multi-query scenarios, while maintaining comparable accuracy. We provide practical guidance for method selection, discuss theoretical foundations (universal approximation, convergence), and identify critical open challenges: high-dimensional parameters, complex geometries, and out-of-distribution generalization. This work establishes a unified framework for understanding parametric PDE solvers via operator learning, offering a comprehensive, incrementally updated resource for this rapidly evolving field</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Causal Structure Learning with Additive Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Causal structure learning has long been the central task of inferring causal insights from data. Despite the abundance of real-world processes exhibiting higher-order mechanisms, however, an explicit treatment of interactions in causal discovery has received little attention. In this work, we focus on extending the causal additive model (CAM) to additive models with higher-order interactions. This second level of modularity we introduce to the structure learning problem is most easily represented by a directed acyclic hypergraph which extends the DAG. We introduce the necessary definitions and theoretical tools to handle the novel structure we introduce and then provide identifiability results for the hyper DAG, extending the typical Markov equivalence classes. We next provide insights into why learning the more complex hypergraph structure may actually lead to better empirical results. In particular, more restrictive assumptions like CAM correspond to easier-to-learn hyper DAGs and better finite sample complexity. We finally develop an extension of the greedy CAM algorithm which can handle the more complex hyper DAG search space and demonstrate its empirical usefulness in synthetic experiments.</description>

      <title>Conditional Score Learning for Quickest Change Detection in Markov Transition Kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the problem of quickest change detection in Markov processes with unknown transition kernels. The key idea is to learn the conditional score $\nabla_{\mathbf{y}} \log p(\mathbf{y}|\mathbf{x})$ directly from sample pairs $( \mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})$, where both $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$ are high-dimensional data generated by the same transition kernel. In this way, we avoid explicit likelihood evaluation and provide a practical way to learn the transition dynamics. Based on this estimation, we develop a score-based CUSUM procedure that uses conditional Hyvarinen score differences to detect changes in the kernel. To ensure bounded increments, we propose a truncated version of the statistic. With Hoeffding's inequality for uniformly ergodic Markov processes, we prove exponential lower bounds on the mean time to false alarm. We also prove asymptotic upper bounds on detection delay. These results give both theoretical guarantees and practical feasibility for score-based detection in high-dimensional Markov models.</description>

      <title>Non-Asymptotic Optimization and Generalization Bounds for Stochastic Gauss-Newton in Overparameterized Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An important question in deep learning is how higher-order optimization methods affect generalization. In this work, we analyze a stochastic Gauss-Newton (SGN) method with Levenberg-Marquardt damping and mini-batch sampling for training overparameterized deep neural networks with smooth activations in a regression setting. Our theoretical contributions are twofold. First, we establish finite-time convergence bounds via a variable-metric analysis in parameter space, with explicit dependencies on the batch size, network width and depth. Second, we derive non-asymptotic generalization bounds for SGN using uniform stability in the overparameterized regime, characterizing the impact of curvature, batch size, and overparameterization on generalization performance. Our theoretical results identify a favorable generalization regime for SGN in which a larger minimum eigenvalue of the Gauss-Newton matrix along the optimization path yields tighter stability bounds.</description>

      <title>Towards Scalable Meta-Learning of near-optimal Interpretable Models via Synthetic Model Generations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decision trees are widely used in high-stakes fields like finance and healthcare due to their interpretability. This work introduces an efficient, scalable method for generating synthetic pre-training data to enable meta-learning of decision trees. Our approach samples near-optimal decision trees synthetically, creating large-scale, realistic datasets. Using the MetaTree transformer architecture, we demonstrate that this method achieves performance comparable to pre-training on real-world data or with computationally expensive optimal decision trees. This strategy significantly reduces computational costs, enhances data generation flexibility, and paves the way for scalable and efficient meta-learning of interpretable decision tree models.</description>

      <title>On Joint Regularization and Calibration in Deep Ensembles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep ensembles are a powerful tool in machine learning, improving both model performance and uncertainty calibration. While ensembles are typically formed by training and tuning models individually, evidence suggests that jointly tuning the ensemble can lead to better performance. This paper investigates the impact of jointly tuning weight decay, temperature scaling, and early stopping on both predictive performance and uncertainty quantification. Additionally, we propose a partially overlapping holdout strategy as a practical compromise between enabling joint evaluation and maximizing the use of data for training. Our results demonstrate that jointly tuning the ensemble generally matches or improves performance, with significant variation in effect size across different tasks and metrics. We highlight the trade-offs between individual and joint optimization in deep ensemble training, with the overlapping holdout strategy offering an attractive practical solution. We believe our findings provide valuable insights and guidance for practitioners looking to optimize deep ensemble models.

      <title>ForecastGAN: A Decomposition-Based Adversarial Framework for Multi-Horizon Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time series forecasting is essential across domains from finance to supply chain management. This paper introduces ForecastGAN, a novel decomposition based adversarial framework addressing limitations in existing approaches for multi-horizon predictions. Although transformer models excel in long-term forecasting, they often underperform in short-term scenarios and typically ignore categorical features. ForecastGAN operates through three integrated modules: a Decomposition Module that extracts seasonality and trend components; a Model Selection Module that identifies optimal neural network configurations based on forecasting horizon; and an Adversarial Training Module that enhances prediction robustness through Conditional Generative Adversarial Network training. Unlike conventional approaches, ForecastGAN effectively integrates both numerical and categorical features. We validate our framework on eleven benchmark multivariate time series datasets that span various forecasting horizons. The results show that ForecastGAN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art transformer models for short-term forecasting while remaining competitive for long-term horizons. This research establishes a more generalizable approach to time series forecasting that adapts to specific contexts while maintaining strong performance across diverse data characteristics without extensive hyperparameter tuning.</description>

      <title>Comparing EPGP Surrogates and Finite Elements Under Degree-of-Freedom Parity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new benchmarking study comparing a boundary-constrained Ehrenpreis--Palamodov Gaussian Process (B-EPGP) surrogate with a classical finite element method combined with Crank--Nicolson time stepping (CN-FEM) for solving the two-dimensional wave equation with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions. The B-EPGP construction leverages exponential-polynomial bases derived from the characteristic variety to enforce the PDE and boundary conditions exactly and employs penalized least squares to estimate the coefficients. To ensure fairness across paradigms, we introduce a degrees-of-freedom (DoF) matching protocol. Under matched DoF, B-EPGP consistently attains lower space-time $L^2$-error and maximum-in-time $L^{2}$-error in space than CN-FEM, improving accuracy by roughly two orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Generative Bayesian Filtering and Parameter Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative Bayesian Filtering (GBF) provides a powerful and flexible framework for performing posterior inference in complex nonlinear and non-Gaussian state-space models. Our approach extends Generative Bayesian Computation (GBC) to dynamic settings, enabling recursive posterior inference using simulation-based methods powered by deep neural networks. GBF does not require explicit density evaluations, making it particularly effective when observation or transition distributions are analytically intractable. To address parameter learning, we introduce the Generative-Gibbs sampler, which bypasses explicit density evaluation by iteratively sampling each variable from its implicit full conditional distribution. Such technique is broadly applicable and enables inference in hierarchical Bayesian models with intractable densities, including state-space models. We assess the performance of the proposed methodologies through both simulated and empirical studies, including the estimation of $\alpha$-stable stochastic volatility models. Our findings indicate that GBF significantly outperforms existing likelihood-free approaches in accuracy and robustness when dealing with intractable state-space models.</description>

      <title>Geometric Decomposition of Statistical Inference through Gradient Flow and Co-Monotonicity Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding feature-outcome associations in high-dimensional data remains
  challenging when relationships vary across subpopulations, yet standard
  methods assuming global associations miss context-dependent patterns, reducing
  statistical power and interpretability. We develop a geometric decomposition
  framework offering two strategies for partitioning inference problems into
  regional analyses on data-derived Riemannian graphs. Gradient flow
  decomposition uses path-monotonicity-validated discrete Morse theory to
  partition samples into basins where outcomes exhibit monotonic behavior.
  Co-monotonicity decomposition leverages association structure: vertex-level
  coefficients measuring directional concordance between outcome and features,
  or between feature pairs, define embeddings of samples into association space.
  These embeddings induce Riemannian k-NN graphs on which biclustering
  identifies co-monotonicity cells (coherent regions) and feature modules. This
  extends naturally to multi-modal integration across multiple feature sets.
  Both strategies apply independently or jointly, with Bayesian posterior
  sampling providing credible intervals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A fundamental challenge in developing general learning algorithms is their tendency to forget past knowledge when adapting to new data. Addressing this problem requires a principled understanding of forgetting; yet, despite decades of study, no unified definition has emerged that provides insights into the underlying dynamics of learning. We propose an algorithm- and task-agnostic theory that characterises forgetting as a lack of self-consistency in a learner's predictive distribution over future experiences, manifesting as a loss of predictive information. Our theory naturally yields a general measure of an algorithm's propensity to forget. To validate the theory, we design a comprehensive set of experiments that span classification, regression, generative modelling, and reinforcement learning. We empirically demonstrate how forgetting is present across all learning settings and plays a significant role in determining learning efficiency. Together, these results establish a principled understanding of forgetting and lay the foundation for analysing and improving the information retention capabilities of general learning algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03779v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasing complexity of advanced machine learning models requires innovative approaches to manage computational resources effectively. One such method is the Early Exit strategy, which allows for adaptive computation by providing a mechanism to shorten the processing path for simpler data instances. In this paper, we propose EERO, a new methodology to translate the problem of early exiting to a problem of using multiple classifiers with reject option in order to better select the exiting head for each instance. We calibrate the probabilities of exiting at the different heads using aggregation with exponential weights to guarantee a fixed budget .We consider factors such as Bayesian risk, budget constraints, and head-specific budget consumption. Experimental results, conducted using a ResNet-18 model and a ConvNext architecture on Cifar and ImageNet datasets, demonstrate that our method not only effectively manages budget allocation but also enhances accuracy in overthinking scenarios.</description>

      <title>Beyond State Space Representation: A General Theory for Kernel Packets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04022v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gaussian process (GP) regression provides a flexible, nonparametric framework for probabilistic modeling, yet remains computationally demanding in large-scale applications. For one-dimensional data, state space (SS) models achieve linear-time inference by reformulating GPs as stochastic differential equations (SDEs). However, SS approaches are confined to gridded inputs and cannot handle multi-dimensional scattered data. We propose a new framework based on kernel packet (KP), which overcomes these limitations while retaining exactness and scalability. A KP is a compactly supported function defined as a linear combination of the GP covariance functions. In this article, we prove that KPs can be identified via the forward and backward SS representations. We also show that the KP approach enables exact inference with linear-time training and logarithmic or constant-time prediction, and extends naturally to multi-dimensional gridded or scattered data without low-rank approximations. Numerical experiments on large-scale additive and product-form GPs with millions of samples demonstrate that KPs achieve exact, memory-efficient inference where SDE-based and low-rank GP methods fail.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14570v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conformal prediction provides a framework for uncertainty quantification, specifically in the forms of prediction intervals and sets with distribution-free guaranteed coverage. While recent cross-conformal techniques such as CV+ and Jackknife+-after-bootstrap achieve better data efficiency than traditional split conformal methods, they incur substantial computational costs due to required pairwise comparisons between training and test samples' out-of-bag scores. Observing that these methods naturally extend from ensemble models, particularly random forests, we leverage existing optimized random forest implementations to enable efficient cross-conformal predictions.
  We present coverforest, a Python package that implements efficient conformal prediction methods specifically optimized for random forests. coverforest supports both regression and classification tasks through various conformal prediction methods, including split conformal, CV+, Jackknife+-after-bootstrap, and adaptive prediction sets. Our package leverages parallel computing and Cython optimizations to speed up out-of-bag calculations. Our experiments demonstrate that coverforest's predictions achieve the desired level of coverage. In addition, its training and prediction times can be faster than an existing implementation by 2--9 times. The source code for the coverforest is hosted on GitHub at https://github.com/donlap/coverforest.</description>

      <title>Information-theoretic Generalization Analysis for VQ-VAEs: A Role of Latent Variables</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19470v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Latent variables (LVs) play a crucial role in encoder-decoder models by enabling effective data compression, prediction, and generation. Although their theoretical properties, such as generalization, have been extensively studied in supervised learning, similar analyses for unsupervised models such as variational autoencoders (VAEs) remain insufficiently underexplored. In this work, we extend information-theoretic generalization analysis to vector-quantized (VQ) VAEs with discrete latent spaces, introducing a novel data-dependent prior to rigorously analyze the relationship among LVs, generalization, and data generation. We derive a novel generalization error bound of the reconstruction loss of VQ-VAEs, which depends solely on the complexity of LVs and the encoder, independent of the decoder. Additionally, we provide the upper bound of the 2-Wasserstein distance between the distributions of the true data and the generated data, explaining how the regularization of the LVs contributes to the data generation performance.</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Singular-Value Derivatives of Rectangular Real Matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03764v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a theoretical framework for deriving the general $n$-th order Fr\'echet derivatives of singular values in real rectangular matrices, by leveraging reduced resolvent operators from Kato's analytic perturbation theory for self-adjoint operators. Deriving closed-form expressions for higher-order derivatives of singular values is notoriously challenging through standard matrix-analysis techniques. To overcome this, we treat a real rectangular matrix as a compact operator on a finite-dimensional Hilbert space, and embed the rectangular matrix into a block self-adjoint operator so that non-symmetric perturbations are captured. Applying Kato's asymptotic eigenvalue expansion to this construction, we obtain a general, closed-form expression for the infinitesimal $n$-th order spectral variations. Specializing to $n=2$ and deploying on a Kronecker-product representation with matrix convention yield the Hessian of a singular value, not found in literature. By bridging abstract operator-theoretic perturbation theory with matrices, our framework equips researchers with a practical toolkit for higher-order spectral sensitivity studies in random matrix applications (e.g., adversarial perturbation in deep learning).</description>

      <title>Beyond the Kolmogorov Barrier: A Learnable Weighted Hybrid Autoencoder for Model Order Reduction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18148v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Representation learning for high-dimensional, complex physical systems aims to identify a low-dimensional intrinsic latent space, which is crucial for reduced-order modeling and modal analysis. To overcome the well-known Kolmogorov barrier, deep autoencoders (AEs) have been introduced in recent years, but they often suffer from poor convergence behavior as the rank of the latent space increases. To address this issue, we propose the learnable weighted hybrid autoencoder, a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of singular value decomposition (SVD) with deep autoencoders through a learnable weighted framework. We find that the introduction of learnable weighting parameters is essential -- without them, the resulting model would either collapse into a standard POD or fail to exhibit the desired convergence behavior. Interestingly, we empirically find that our trained model has a sharpness thousands of times smaller compared to other models. Our experiments on classical chaotic PDE systems, including the 1D Kuramoto-Sivashinsky and forced isotropic turbulence datasets, demonstrate that our approach significantly improves generalization performance compared to several competing methods. Additionally, when combining with time series modeling techniques (e.g., Koopman operator, LSTM), the proposed technique offers significant improvements for surrogate modeling of high-dimensional multi-scale PDE systems.</description>

      <title>Dispersion based Recurrent Neural Network Model for Methane Monitoring in Albertan Tailings Ponds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06741v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bitumen extraction for the production of synthetic crude oil in Canada's Athabasca Oil Sands industry has recently come under spotlight for being a significant source of greenhouse gas emission. A major cause of concern is methane, a greenhouse gas produced by the anaerobic biodegradation of hydrocarbons in oil sands residues, or tailings, stored in settle basins commonly known as oil sands tailing ponds. In order to determine the methane emitting potential of these tailing ponds and have future methane projections, we use real-time weather data, mechanistic models developed from laboratory controlled experiments, and industrial reports to train a physics constrained machine learning model. Our trained model can successfully identify the directions of active ponds and estimate their emission levels, which are generally hard to obtain due to data sampling restrictions. We found that each active oil sands tailing pond could emit between 950 to 1500 tonnes of methane per year, whose environmental impact is equivalent to carbon dioxide emissions from at least 6000 gasoline powered vehicles. Although abandoned ponds are often presumed to have insignificant emissions, our findings indicate that these ponds could become active over time and potentially emit up to 1000 tonnes of methane each year. Taking an average over all datasets that was used in model training, we estimate that emissions around major oil sands regions would need to be reduced by approximately 12% over a year, to reduce the average methane concentrations to 2005 levels.</description>

      <title>How Memory in Optimization Algorithms Implicitly Modifies the Loss</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02132v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In modern optimization methods used in deep learning, each update depends on the history of previous iterations, often referred to as memory, and this dependence decays fast as the iterates go further into the past. For example, gradient descent with momentum has exponentially decaying memory through exponentially averaged past gradients. We introduce a general technique for identifying a memoryless algorithm that approximates an optimization algorithm with memory. It is obtained by replacing all past iterates in the update by the current one, and then adding a correction term arising from memory (also a function of the current iterate). This correction term can be interpreted as a perturbation of the loss, and the nature of this perturbation can inform how memory implicitly (anti-)regularizes the optimization dynamics. As an application of our theory, we find that Lion does not have the kind of implicit anti-regularization induced by memory that AdamW does, providing a theory-based explanation for Lion's better generalization performance recently documented.</description>

      <title>Regularized least squares learning with heavy-tailed noise is minimax optimal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14214v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper examines the performance of ridge regression in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces in the presence of noise that exhibits a finite number of higher moments. We establish excess risk bounds consisting of subgaussian and polynomial terms based on the well known integral operator framework. The dominant subgaussian component allows to achieve convergence rates that have previously only been derived under subexponential noise - a prevalent assumption in related work from the last two decades. These rates are optimal under standard eigenvalue decay conditions, demonstrating the asymptotic robustness of regularized least squares against heavy-tailed noise. Our derivations are based on a Fuk-Nagaev inequality for Hilbert-space valued random variables.</description>

      <title>Explicit Density Approximation for Neural Implicit Samplers Using a Bernstein-Based Convex Divergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04700v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rank-based statistical metrics, such as the invariant statistical loss (ISL), have recently emerged as robust and practically effective tools for training implicit generative models. In this work, we introduce dual-ISL, a novel likelihood-free objective for training implicit generative models that interchanges the roles of the target and model distributions in the ISL framework, yielding a convex optimization problem in the space of model densities. We prove that the resulting rank-based discrepancy $d_K$ is i) continuous under weak convergence and with respect to the $L^1$ norm, and ii) convex in its first argument-properties not shared by classical divergences such as KL or Wasserstein distances. Building on this, we develop a theoretical framework that interprets $d_K$ as an $L^2$-projection of the density ratio $q = p/\tilde p$ onto a Bernstein polynomial basis, from which we derive exact bounds on the truncation error, precise convergence rates, and a closed-form expression for the truncated density approximation. We further extend our analysis to the multivariate setting via random one-dimensional projections, defining a sliced dual-ISL divergence that retains both convexity and continuity. We empirically show that these theoretical advantages translate into practical ones. Specifically, across several benchmarks dual-ISL converges more rapidly, delivers markedly smoother and more stable training, and more effectively prevents mode collapse than classical ISL and other leading implicit generative methods-while also providing an explicit density approximation.</description>

      <title>VERA: Variational Inference Framework for Jailbreaking Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22666v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rise of API-only access to state-of-the-art LLMs highlights the need for effective black-box jailbreak methods to identify model vulnerabilities in real-world settings. Without a principled objective for gradient-based optimization, most existing approaches rely on genetic algorithms, which are limited by their initialization and dependence on manually curated prompt pools. Furthermore, these methods require individual optimization for each prompt, failing to provide a comprehensive characterization of model vulnerabilities. To address this gap, we introduce VERA: Variational infErence fRamework for jAilbreaking. VERA casts black-box jailbreak prompting as a variational inference problem, training a small attacker LLM to approximate the target LLM's posterior over adversarial prompts. Once trained, the attacker can generate diverse, fluent jailbreak prompts for a target query without re-optimization. Experimental results show that VERA achieves strong performance across a range of target LLMs, highlighting the value of probabilistic inference for adversarial prompt generation.</description>

      <title>ADPO: Anchored Direct Preference Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18913v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is effective but brittle under annotator noise and distribution shift because it operates on hard, pairwise labels and only regularizes log-probability differences. We introduce Anchored Direct Preference Optimization (ADPO), a framework that extends preference learning to soft listwise supervision via reference anchoring. ADPO minimizes KL(q || softmax((s - s_ref) / tau_anc)), which (i) recovers supervised fine-tuning, knowledge distillation, maximum-entropy reinforcement learning, and DPO as special cases through suitable choices of target q, anchor policy, and temperature; (ii) induces an implicit trust region governed by the softmax Fisher metric, independent of the anchor; and (iii) supports stable dynamic-anchor updates. Empirically, we observe a task-dependent tradeoff: dynamic anchors improve online exploration under noise, while fixed anchors excel at offline distillation, achieving up to 170 to 5000 times reduction in student-teacher KL on our benchmarks.</description>

      <title>LLMs as In-Context Meta-Learners for Model and Hyperparameter Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26510v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Model and hyperparameter selection are critical but challenging in machine learning, typically requiring expert intuition or expensive automated search. We investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can act as in-context meta-learners for this task. By converting each dataset into interpretable metadata, we prompt an LLM to recommend both model families and hyperparameters. We study two prompting strategies: (1) a zero-shot mode relying solely on pretrained knowledge, and (2) a meta-informed mode augmented with examples of models and their performance on past tasks. Across synthetic and real-world benchmarks, we show that LLMs can exploit dataset metadata to recommend competitive models and hyperparameters without search, and that improvements from meta-informed prompting demonstrate their capacity for in-context meta-learning. These results highlight a promising new role for LLMs as lightweight, general-purpose assistants for model selection and hyperparameter optimization.</description>

      <title>Statistical Properties of Rectified Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03193v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rectified flow (Liu et al., 2022; Liu, 2022; Wu et al., 2023) is a method for defining a transport map between two distributions, and enjoys popularity in machine learning, although theoretical results supporting the validity of these methods are scant. The rectified flow can be regarded as an approximation to optimal transport, but in contrast to other transport methods that require optimization over a function space, computing the rectified flow only requires standard statistical tools such as regression or density estimation. Because of this, one can leverage standard data analysis tools for regression and density estimation to develop empirical versions of transport maps. We study some structural properties of the rectified flow, including existence, uniqueness, and regularity, as well as the related statistical properties, such as rates of convergence and central limit theorems, for some selected estimators. To do so, we analyze separately the bounded and unbounded cases as each presents unique challenges. In both cases, we are able to establish convergence at faster rates than the ones for the usual nonparametric regression and density estimation.</description>
