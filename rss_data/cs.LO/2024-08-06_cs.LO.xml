      <title>Extension preservation on dense graph classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Preservation theorems provide a direct correspondence between the syntactic structure of first-order sentences and the closure properties of their respective classes of models. A line of work has explored preservation theorems relativised to combinatorially tame classes of sparse structures [Atserias et al., JACM 2006; Atserias et al., SiCOMP 2008; Dawar, JCSS 2010; Dawar and Eleftheriadis, 2024]. In this article we initiate the study of preservation theorems for dense graph classes. In contrast to the sparse setting, we show that extension preservation fails on most natural dense classes of low complexity. Nonetheless, we isolate a technical condition which is sufficient for extension preservation to hold, providing a dense analogue to a result of [Atserias et al., SiCOMP 2008].</description>

      <title>Fast Robust Monitoring for Signal Temporal Logic with Value Freezing Operators (STL*)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Researchers have previously proposed augmenting Signal Temporal Logic (STL) with the value freezing operator in order to express engineering properties that cannot be expressed in STL. This augmented logic is known as STL*. The previous algorithms for STL* monitoring were intractable, and did not scale formulae with nested freeze variables. We present offline discrete-time monitoring algorithms with an acceleration heuristic, both for Boolean monitoring as well as for quantitative robustness monitoring. The acceleration heuristic operates over time intervals where subformulae hold true, rather than over the original trace sample-points. We present experimental validation of our algorithms, the results show that our algorithms can monitor over long traces for formulae with two or three nested freeze variables.
  Our work is the first work with monitoring algorithm implementations for STL* formulae with nested freeze variables.</description>

      <title>Towards an ontology of state actors in cyberspace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To improve cyber threat analysis practices in cybersecurity, I present a plan to build a formal ontological representation of state actors in cyberspace and of cyber operations. I argue that modelling these phenomena via ontologies allows for coherent integration of data coming from diverse sources, automated reasoning over such data, as well as intelligence extraction and reuse from and of them. Existing ontological tools in cybersecurity can be ameliorated by connecting them to neighboring domains such as law, regulations, governmental institutions, and documents. In this paper, I propose metrics to evaluate currently existing ontological tools to create formal representations in the cybersecurity domain, and I provide a plan to develop and extend them when they are lacking.</description>

      <title>Meta-Modelling in Formal Concept Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Formal Concept Analysis starts from a very basic data structure comprising objects and their attributes. Sometimes, however, it is beneficial to also define attributes of attributes (so-called meta-attributes). In this paper, we use Triadic Formal Concept Analysis(a triadic approach to Formal Concept Analysis) to develop a framework for this kind of meta-modelling in Formal Concept Analysis, including formal definitions and appropriate visualizations.</description>

      <title>Sum and Tensor of Quantitative Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.11784v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by the seminal work of Hyland, Plotkin, and Power on the combination of algebraic computational effects via sum and tensor, we develop an analogous theory for the combination of quantitative algebraic effects. Quantitative algebraic effects are monadic computational effects on categories of metric spaces, which, moreover, have an algebraic presentation in the form of quantitative equational theories, a logical framework introduced by Mardare, Panangaden, and Plotkin that generalises equational logic to account for a concept of approximate equality. As our main result, we show that the sum and tensor of two quantitative equational theories correspond to the categorical sum (i.e., coproduct) and tensor, respectively, of their effects qua monads. We further give a theory of quantitative effect transformers based on these two operations, essentially providing quantitative analogues to the following monad transformers due to Moggi: exception, resumption, reader, and writer transformers. Finally, as an application, we provide the first quantitative algebraic axiomatizations to the following coalgebraic structures: Markov processes, labelled Markov processes, Mealy machines, and Markov decision processes, each endowed with their respective bisimilarity metrics. Apart from the intrinsic interest in these axiomatizations, it is pleasing they have been obtained as the composition, via sum and tensor, of simpler quantitative equational theories.</description>

      <title>Translating Three-variable First-Order Predicate Logic to Relation Algebra, Implemented using Z3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.02513v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents the development of a software tool that enables the translation of first-order predicate logic with at most three variables into relation algebra. The tool was developed using the Z3 theorem prover, leveraging its capabilities to enhance reliability, generate code, and expedite development. The resulting standalone Python program allows users to translate first-order logic formulas into relation algebra, eliminating the need to work with relation algebra explicitly. This paper outlines the theoretical background of first-order logic, relation algebra, and the translation process. It also describes the implementation details, including validation of the software tool using Z3 for testing correctness. By demonstrating the feasibility of utilizing first-order logic as an alternative language for expressing relation algebra, this tool paves the way for integrating first-order logic into tools traditionally relying on relation algebra as input.</description>

      <title>The Index and Core of a Relation. With Applications to the Axiomatics of Relation Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.02017v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the general notions of an index and a core of a relation. We postulate a limited form of the axiom of choice -- specifically that all partial equivalence relations have an index -- and explore the consequences of adding the axiom to standard axiom systems for point-free reasoning. Examples of the theorems we prove are that a core/index of a difunction is a bijection, and that the so-called ``all or nothing'' axiom used to facilitate pointwise reasoning is derivable from our axiom of choice.</description>

      <title>COTS: Connected OpenAPI Test Synthesis for RESTful Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19614v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel model-driven approach for testing RESTful applications. We introduce a (i) domain-specific language for OpenAPI specifications and (ii) a tool to support our methodology. Our DSL is inspired by session types and enables the modelling of communication protocols between a REST client and server. Our tool, dubbed COTS, generates (randomised) model-based test executions and reports software defects. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach by applying it to test several open source applications. Our findings indicate that our methodology can identify nuanced defects in REST APIs and achieve comparable or superior code coverage when compared to much larger handcrafted test suites.</description>
