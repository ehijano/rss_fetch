      <title>Polarizabilities as Probes for P, T, and PT Violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Searches for violations of the fundamental symmetries of parity P and time reversal T in atomic and molecular systems provide a powerful tool for precise measurements of the physics of and beyond the standard model. In this work, we investigate how these symmetry violations affect the response of atoms and molecules to applied electric and magnetic fields. We recover well-known observables like the P-odd, T-odd spin-electric field coupling that is used for searches of the electron electric dipole moment (eEDM) or the effect of P-odd, T-even optical rotation in atomic gases. Besides these, we obtain several other possible observables. This includes, in particular, effects that can only be seen when using oscillating or inhomogeneous fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radium-225 (nuclear spin $I=1/2$) ions possess electronic hyperfine transitions that are first-order insensitive to magnetic field noise, which is advantageous for optical clocks and quantum information science. We report on laser cooling and trapping of radium-225 ions and hyperfine splitting measurements of the ion's $7s$ $^2S_{1/2}$, $7p$ $^2P_{1/2}$, and $6d$ $^2D_{3/2}$ states. We measured the ground state hyperfine constant, $A(^2S_{1/2}) = -27.684511056(9)\ \mathrm{GHz}$, and the quadratic Zeeman coefficient, $C_2 = 142.3(10)\ \mathrm{Hz\ G}^{-2}$, of the $^2S_{1/2} (F=0, m_F = 0) \leftrightarrow~^2S_{1/2} (F=1, m_{F} = 0)$ transition. We also measured the hyperfine constants of the $^2P_{1/2}$ state, $A(^2P_{1/2}) = -5.447(4)\ \mathrm{GHz}$, and the $^2D_{3/2}$ state, $A(^2D_{3/2}) = -619.7(11)\ \mathrm{MHz}$.</description>

      <title>Ultracold charged atom-dimer collisions: state-selective charge exchange and three-body recombination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on an accurate determination of the potential energy surfaces of Rb$_3^+$ correlated to its first asymptotic limit Rb$^+$$+$Rb($5s$)$+$Rb($5s$), we identify the presence of intersections of a pair of singlet and triplet surfaces over all interparticle distances, leading to Jahn-Teller couplings. We elaborate scenarios for charge exchange between ultracold charged atom-dimer complex (Rb$+$Rb$_2^+$ or Rb$^+$$+$Rb$_2$), predicting a strong selectivity on the preparation of the initial state of the dimer. We also demonstrate that the JT couplings must drive the three-body recombination (TBR) of Rb$^+$, Rb, and Rb at ultracold energies. Using the current analysis, we provide a consistent picture of the TBR experiments performed in ion-atom hybrid Rb samples \cite{dieterle2020inelastic,harter2012single}. We also demonstrate the presence of JT coupling as a general phenomenon in the singly-charged homonuclear alkali triatomic systems.</description>

      <title>GRASIAN: Shaping and characterization of the cold hydrogen and deuterium beams for the forthcoming first demonstration of gravitational quantum states of atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A low energy particle confined by a horizontal reflective surface and gravity settles in gravitationally bound quantum states. These gravitational quantum states (GQS) were so far only observed with neutrons. However, the existence of GQS is predicted also for atoms. The GRASIAN collaboration pursues the first observation of GQS of atoms, using a cryogenic hydrogen beam. This endeavor is motivated by the higher densities, which can be expected from hydrogen compared to neutrons, the easier access, the fact, that GQS were never observed with atoms and the accessibility to hypothetical short range interactions. In addition to enabling gravitational quantum spectroscopy, such a cryogenic hydrogen beam with very low vertical velocity components - a few cm s$^{-1}$, can be used for precision optical and microwave spectroscopy. In this article, we report on our methods developed to reduce background and to detect atoms with a low horizontal velocity, which are needed for such an experiment. Our recent measurement results on the collimation of the hydrogen beam to 2 mm, the reduction of background and improvement of signal-to-noise and finally our first detection of atoms with velocities &lt; 72 m s$^{-1}$ are presented. Furthermore, we show calculations, estimating the feasibility of the planned experiment and simulations which confirm that we can select vertical velocity components in the order of cm s$^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Distributed network of optically pumped magnetometers for space weather monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatial variation in the intensity of magnetospheric and ionospheric fluctuation during solar storms creates ground-induced currents, of importance in both infrastructure engineering and geophysical science. This activity is currently measured using a network of ground-based magnetometers, typically consisting of extensive installations at established observatory sites. We show that this network can be enhanced by the addition of remote quantum magnetometers which combine high sensitivity with intrinsic calibration. These nodes utilize scalable hardware and run independently of wired communication and power networks. We demonstrate that optically pumped magnetometers, utilizing mass-produced and miniaturized components, offer a single scalable sensor with the sensitivity and stability required for space weather observation. We describe the development and deployment of an off-grid magnetic sensing node, powered by a solar panel, present observed data from periods of low and high geomagnetic activity, and compare it to existing geomagnetic observatories.</description>

      <title>Identification of new gold lines in the 350 to 1000 nm spectral region using laser produced plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present results from a pilot study, using a laser-produced plasma, to identify new lines in the 350 to 1000 nm spectral region for the r-process element gold (Au), of relevance to studies of neutron star mergers. This was achieved via optical-IR spectroscopy of a laser-produced Au plasma, with an Au target of high purity (99.95 %) and a low vacuum pressure to remove any air contamination from the experimental spectra. Our data were recorded with a spectrometer of 750 mm focal length and 1200 lines mm-1 grating, yielding a resolution of 0.04 nm. We find 54 lines not previously identified and which are not due to the impurities (principally copper (Cu) and silver (Ag)) in our Au sample. Of these 54 lines, we provisionally match 21 strong transitions to theoretical results from collisional-radiative models that include energy levels derived from atomic structure calculations up to the 6s level. Some of the remaining 33 unidentified lines in our spectra are also strong and may be due to transitions involving energy levels which are higher-lying than those in our plasma models. Nevertheless, our experiments demonstrate that laser-produced plasmas are well suited to the identification of transitions in r-process elements, with the method applicable to spectra ranging from UV to IR wavelengths.</description>

      <title>Multi-axis inertial sensing with 2D arrays of matter waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08762v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Atom interferometers are an exquisite measurement tool for inertial forces. However, they are commonly limited to one single sensitive axis, allowing high-precision multi-dimensional sensing only through subsequent or postcorrected measurements. Here, we introduce a novel 2D-array-arrangement of Bose-Einstein Condensates (BEC) initialized utilizing time-averaged optical potentials for simultaneous multi-axis inertial sensing. Deploying a 3 x 3 BEC array covering 1.6 mm^2, we perform measurements of angular velocity and acceleration of a rotating reference mirror, as well as a linear acceleration, e.g., induced by gravity, gradients, and higher order derivatives. We anticipate increased sensitivity of our method in interferometers with large scale factors in long-baseline or satellite atom interferometry. Our work paves the way for simple high-precision multi-axis inertial sensing and we envision further applications, e.g., for three-dimensional wave front characterization.</description>

      <title>Isotope-shift factors with quantum electrodynamics effects for many-electron systems: A study of the nuclear charge radius of $^{26m}$Al</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13369v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A method for calculating the field shift contribution to isotope shifts in many-electron atoms, incorporating quantum electrodynamics (QED) effects, is introduced. We also implement the model QED approach to incorporate QED contribution to the nuclear recoil effect at the high-order correlation effects treatment level. The proposed computational scheme is used to revise the value of the root-mean-square (rms) nuclear charge radius of the isomer of aluminium-26, $^{26m}$Al. This radius is important for the global analysis of the $V_{ud}$ element of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix. The difference in mean-square nuclear charge radii of $^{27}$Al and $^{26m}$Al, obtained by combining the calculated atomic factors with recently measured isotope shift (IS) of the $3s^23p~^2P_{3/2} \to 3s^24s~^2S_{1/2}$ transition in Al, is $0.443(44)(19)~{\rm fm}^2$, where the first and second uncertainties are experimental and theoretical ones, respectively. The latter is reduced by a factor of 4 with respect to the previous study. Using this value and the known value of the rms charge radius of $^{27}$Al, the resultant value $R_c(^{26m}$Al) = 3.132(10)~fm is obtained. With the improved accuracy of the calculated IS factors the error in $R_c(^{26m}$Al) is now dominated by the experimental uncertainty. Similar revision of rms charge radii is made for the $^{28}$Al, $^{29}$Al, $^{30}$Al, $^{31}$Al and $^{32}$Al isotopes using existing IS measurements. Additionally, atomic factors are computed for the $3s^23p~^2P_{3/2} \to 3s^24s~^2S_{1/2}$, $3s^23p~^2P_{1/2} \to 3s^25s~^2S_{1/2}$ and $3s^23p~^2P_{3/2} \to 3s^25s~^2S_{1/2}$ transitions in Al, which can be used in future experimental studies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09907v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate production of cold atomic strontium (Sr) and strontium-containing molecules (SrOH) in a cryogenic buffer gas beam source via direct heating of strontium oxide (SrO) with 30 mJ laser pulses several milliseconds long. $3.7(2)\times10^{14}$ Sr atoms are released, which represents a factor of 7 increase in atomic production per pulse compared to nanosecond-scale ablation laser pulses. A peak atomic density of $1.93(6) \times 10^{12}$ atoms/cm$^3$ is achieved, which corresponds to a factor of 2 increase relative to ablation. We further propose extensions of this method to other atomic and molecular species.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03618v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose and demonstrate a modulation transfer protocol to increase the detection sensitivity of a Rydberg RF receiver to fields out of resonance from the transition between Rydberg levels. This protocol is based on a phase modulation of the control field used to create the Electromagnetically Induced Transparency (EIT) signal. The nonlinear wave-mixing of the multi-component coupling laser and the probe laser transfers the modulation to the probe laser, which is used for RF-field detection. The measurements compare well with semi-classical simulations of atom-light interaction and show an improvement in the RF bandwidth of the sensor and an improved sensitivity of the response to weak fields.</description>

      <title>Generalized Einstein Relations between Absorption and Emission Spectra at Thermodynamic Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13742v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present Einstein coefficient spectra and a detailed-balance derivation of generalized Einstein relations between them that is based on the connection between spontaneous and stimulated emission. If two broadened levels or bands overlap in energy, transitions between them need not be purely absorptive or emissive. Consequently, spontaneous emission can occur in both transition directions, and four Einstein coefficient spectra replace the three Einstein coefficients for a line. At equilibrium, the four different spectra obey five pairwise relationships and one lineshape generates all four. These relationships are independent of molecular quantum statistics and predict the Stokes' shift between forward and reverse transitions required by equilibrium with blackbody radiation. For Boltzmann statistics, the relative strengths of forward and reverse transitions depend on the formal chemical potential difference between the initial and final bands, which becomes the standard chemical potential difference for ideal solutes. The formal chemical potential of a band replaces both the energy and degeneracy of a quantum level. Like the energies of quantum levels, the formal chemical potentials of bands obey the Rydberg-Ritz combination principle. Each stimulated Einstein coefficient spectrum gives a frequency-dependent transition cross section. Transition cross sections obey causality and a detailed-balance condition with spontaneous emission, but do not directly obey generalized Einstein relations. Even with an energetic width much less than the photon energy, an absorptive forward transition with an energetic width much greater than the thermal energy can have such an extreme Stokes' shift that its reverse transition cross section becomes predominantly absorptive rather than emissive.</description>

      <title>Non-Abelian Hopf-Euler insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17305v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss a class of three-band non-Abelian topological insulators in three dimensions which carry a single bulk Hopf index protected by spatiotemporal ($\mathcal{PT}$) inversion symmetry. These phases may also host subdimensional topological invariants given by the Euler characteristic class, resulting in real Hopf-Euler insulators. Such systems naturally realize helical nodal structures in the 3D Brillouin zone, providing a physical manifestation of the linking number described by the Hopf invariant. We show that, by opening a gap between the valence bands of these systems, one finds a fully-gapped `flag' phase, which displays a three-band multi-gap Pontryagin invariant. Unlike the previously reported $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric four-band real Hopf insulator, which hosts a $\mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z}$ invariant, these phases are not unitarily equivalent to two copies of a complex two-band Hopf insulator. We show that these uncharted phases can be obtained through dimensional extension of two-dimensional Euler insulators, and that they support (1) an optical bulk integrated circular shift effect quantized by the Hopf invariant, (2) quantum-geometric breathing in the real space Wannier functions, and (3) surface Euler topology on boundaries. Consequently, our findings pave a way for novel experimental realizations of real-space quantum-geometry, as these systems may be directly simulated by utilizing synthethic dimensions in metamaterials or ultracold atoms.</description>

Abstract: Energy levels of hydrogen are calculated as one-loop matrix elements of the QED energy-momentum tensor trace in the external field approximation. An explicit connection established between the one-loop trace diagrams and the standard Lamb shift one-loop diagrams. Our calculations provide an argument against inclusion of the anomalous trace contribution in the decomposition of the QED quantum field Hamiltonian and serve as an illustration how the trace anomaly is realized in the bound state QED.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12359v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As an homage to Quantum Energy Teleportation, we generalize the idea to arbitrary physical observables, not limited to energy, and prove a rigorous upper bound on the activated ("teleported") quantity. The essence of this protocol is a quantum feedback control with respect to the entangled ground state of a quantum many-body system. To demonstrate the concept, we explore a (1+1)-dimensional chiral Dirac system and execute the protocol for the electric current and charge. One of the most significant results is the creation of long-range correlations across the system after applying control operations only to one local site. Consequently but surprisingly, the induced charge susceptibility fully reconstructs the phase diagram, despite the model initially having no charge. Moreover, we find an activation of novel chiral dynamics induced by feedback control operations, which can be experimentally confirmed using trapped ions and neutral atoms.</description>
