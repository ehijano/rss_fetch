      <title>Timed Prediction Problem for Sandpile Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the computational complexity of the timed prediction problem in two-dimensional sandpile models. This question refines the classical prediction problem, which asks whether a cell q will eventually become unstable after adding a grain at cell p from a given configuration. The prediction problem has been shown to be P-complete in several settings, including for subsets of the Moore neighborhood, but its complexity for the von Neumann neighborhood remains open. In a previous work, we provided a complete characterization of crossover gates (a key to the implementation of non-planar monotone circuits) for these small neighborhoods, leading to P-completeness proofs with only 4 and 5 neighbors among the eight adjancent cells. In this paper, we introduce the timed setting, where the goal is to determine whether cell q becomes unstable exactly at time t. We distinguish several cases: some neighborhoods support complete timed toolkits (including timed crossover gates) and exhibit P-completeness; others admit timed crossovers but suffer from synchronization issues; planar neighborhoods provably do not admit any timed crossover; and finally, for some remaining neighborhoods, we conjecture that no timed crossover is possible.</description>

      <title>Lower Bounds on Relative Error Quantum Compression and Classical Shadows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the question of how much classical communication is needed when Alice is given a classical description of a quantum state $|\psi\rangle$ for Bob to recover any expectation value $\langle \psi | M |\psi\rangle$ given an observable $M$ with $M$ Hermitian and $||M||_{\text{op}} \leq 1$. This task, whose study was initiated by Raz (ACM 1999) and more recently investigated by Gosset and Smolin (TQC 2019), can be thought of as a fully classical version of the pure state case of the well-known classical shadows problem in quantum learning theory. We show how the hardness of these two seemingly distinct problems are connected.
  We first consider the relative error version of the communication question and prove a lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{2^{n}}\epsilon^{-2})$ on the one-way randomized classical communication, improving upon an additive error lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{2^{n}})$ as shown by Gosset and Smolin. Notably, we show that this lower bound holds not only for the set of all observables but also when restricted to just the class of Pauli observables. This fact implies a $\Omega(\sqrt{2^{n}})$ versus $O(\text{poly}(n))$ separation in the compression size between the relative and additive error settings for non-adaptive Pauli classical shadows with classical memory.
  Extending this framework, we prove randomized communication lower bounds for other relative error one-way classical communication tasks: an $\Omega(2^{n}\epsilon^{-2})$ lower bound when instead Alice is given an observable and Bob is given a quantum state and they are asked to estimate the expectation value, an $\Omega(\sqrt{n}\epsilon^{-2})$ lower bound when restricted to Paulis, and an $\Omega(\sqrt{2^{n}}\epsilon^{-2})$ lower bound when Alice and Bob are both given quantum states and asked to estimate the inner product.</description>

      <title>The Autonomy of the Lightning Network: A Mathematical and Economic Proof of Structural Decoupling from BTC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19333v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a formal analysis of the Lightning Network as a monetary system structurally diverging from Bitcoin's base-layer settlement model. We demonstrate that under increasing transaction demand, BTC transaction fees rise superlinearly due to throughput constraints, while Lightning Network routing costs approach a bounded asymptote. Using mathematical modeling, game-theoretic proofs, and complexity analysis, we show that Lightning enables indefinite off-chain operation via the emergence of liquidity hub oligopolies. These hubs exhibit properties of unregulated financial intermediaries, including rent extraction, opacity, and systemic fragility. Strategic agent models show that channel closure becomes economically infeasible, and routing problems approach hardness limits in P-Space complexity. We conclude that Lightning does not merely extend Bitcoin, but constitutes a synthetic financial system with shadowbank characteristics, lacking reserve discipline, transparency, or enforceable settlement guarantees.</description>
