      <title>Silica-coated admixtures of bismuth and gadolinium oxides for 3D printed concrete applications: Rheology, hydration, strength, microstructure, and radiation shielding perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the impact of replacing up to 5 vol% of Portland cement (PC) with both pristine Bi2O3/Gd2O3 (BG) and silica-coated BG particles. Two different types of silica coatings, each with varying synthesis methods, were applied to coat the BG structures, and their impact on the fresh, hardened, microstructure and radiation-shielding performances of the 3D printable cementitious composites (3DPC) was investigated. Isothermal calorimetry demonstrated that pristine BG incorporation delays hydration, whereas silica coatings mitigate this, with type A coating being more effective. Early compressive strength was reduced in BG-containing mixes but normalised after seven days. Rheological tests showed that BG additives enhanced thixotropy and yield shear stresses, with 2.5 vol% being optimal, especially with method B coating. Green strength properties improved significantly with method B coated particles, showing up to 62.4% and 57.7% increases in strength and modulus, respectively, after 30 minutes. Micro-CT and MIP analyses confirmed reduced porosity and refined pore structure with silica coatings. Radiation shielding tests indicated superior performance in uncoated BG mixes, with method B coating providing superior shielding performance compared to that of method A coatings due to their higher surface area. In general, silica-coated BG particles enhance the mechanical, rheological, and radiation shielding properties of 3DPC, with method B coatings offering the most significant benefits.</description>

      <title>Real-Time 3D Magnetic Field Camera for a Spherical Volume</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate and efficient volumetric magnetic field measurements are essential for a wide range of applications. Conventional methods are often limited in terms of measurement speed and applicability, or suffer from scaling problems at larger volumes. This work presents the development of a magnetometer array designed to measure magnetic fields within a spherical volume at a frame rate of 10 Hz. The array consists of 3D Hall magnetometers positioned according to a spherical $t$-design, allowing simultaneous magnetic field data acquisition from the surface of the sphere. The approach enables the efficient representation of all three components of the magnetic field inside the sphere using a sixth-degree polynomial, significantly reducing measurement time compared to sequential methods. This work details the design, calibration, and measurement methods of the array. To evaluate its performance, we compare it to a sequential single-sensor measurement by examining a magnetic gradient field. The obtained measurement uncertainties of approx. 1% show the applicability for a variety of applications.</description>

      <title>Natural Frequency Dependency of Magneto-Mechanical Resonators on Magnet Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The precise derivation of physical quantities like temperature or pressure at arbitrary locations is useful in numerous contexts, e.g. medical procedures or industrial process engineering. The novel sensor technology of magneto-mechanical resonators (MMR), based on the interaction of a rotor and stator permanent magnet, allows for the combined tracking of the sensor position and orientation while simultaneously sensing an external measurand. Thereby, the quantity is coupled to the torsional oscillation frequency, e.g. by varying the magnet distance. In this paper, we analyze the (deflection angle-independent) natural frequency dependency of MMR sensors on the rotor-stator distance, and evaluate the performance of theoretical models. The presented sensors incorporate magnets of spherical and/or cylindrical geometry. We find the distance-frequency relationship to be well described by an adapted dipole model accounting for material and manufacturing uncertainties. Their combined effect can be compensated by an adjustment of a single parameter which drives the median model deviation generally below 0.2 %. Our depicted methods and results are important for the design and calibration process of new sensor types utilizing the MMR technique</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Oxidation Mechanisms of Octa-Penta Graphene: A Multidimensional Exploration from First-Principles to Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Octa-penta graphene (OPG), a novel carbon allotrope characterized by its distinctive arrangement of pentagonal and octagonal rings, has garnered considerable attention due to its exceptional structure and functional properties. This study systematically investigates the oxidation mechanisms of OPG and elucidates the oxygen migration patterns on the OPG monolayer through first-principles calculations and machine-learning-based molecular dynamics (MLMD) simulations. Specifically, the oxidation processes on OPG-L and OPG-Z involve exothermic chemisorption, where oxygen molecules dissociate at the surfaces, forming stable epoxy groups. Furthermore, the integrated-crystal orbital Hamilton population (ICOHP) and Bader charge analyses provide insights into the physical mechanisms of oxygen atom adsorption. Importantly, we found that oxidation also impact the electronic properties of OPG, with OPG-L retaining its metallic characteristics post-oxygen adsorption, whereas OPG-Z undergoes a transformation from a metallic to a semiconducting state due to the introduction of oxygen. Oxygen migration on OPG monolayer involves breaking and reforming of C-O bonds, with varying stability across adsorption sites and limited migration along the basal plane. MLMD simulations corroborate these migration patterns, offering detailed migration trajectories consistent with theoretical predictions. These findings enhance the understanding of oxygen migration dynamics on OPG, facilitate its experimental validations, and highlight its potential as a novel 2D material for applications in batteries, heat-resistant materials, and oxidation-resistant coatings.</description>

      <title>Nanometer-scale Cavities for Far-infrared Radiation via Acoustic Phonon Polariton Resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surface polaritons play a pivotal role in enabling and controlling strong light-matter interactions at the nanoscale due to their ability to carry large momentum, thus confining light to deep subwavelength dimensions. These polaritons are supported by materials with negative real-part permittivity, such as surface-plasmon-polaritons in metals, and plasmons in graphene, for example. A promising class of materials that exhibit negative permittivity is that of polar dielectrics, which can support surface phonon polaritons (SPhPs). While SPhPs offer significantly lower losses compared to other surface polaritons, their potential has been underutilized due to their limited ability to carry large momentum. In this work, we demonstrate the experimental realization of acoustic surface-phonon-polaritons (APhPs) - a hybridized SPhPs mode that can carry large momentum. We achieve this by realizing phononic resonators in a system composed of nanometric-sized silver cubes deposited on a SiC polar dielectric. The nanocube creates a mirror image of the SPhP, forming the hybridized APhP mode. We find that the APhPs resonators can confine far-infrared radiation to extremely small mode volumes, which are almost a billion times smaller than their free-space mode-volume. Moreover, we show that owing to their inherently low losses, APhPs exhibit quality factors that are an order of magnitude greater than those of surface plasmons or graphene plasmons, surpassing values of 180. Finally, we demonstrate that the spectral response and intensity of the APhP resonators can be precisely controlled by adjusting the size and concentration of the nanocubes. Our method is general, scalable, and applicable to any polar dielectric across a broad spectrum of materials and wavelengths, opening the path for controlling and manipulating strong light-matter interactions at the nanoscale in the long-wavelength range.</description>

      <title>Pervasive protonation of perovskite membranes made by the water-soluble sacrificial layer method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fabrication of perovskite oxide free-standing films (membranes) by lift-off methods using water-soluble sacrificial layers is appealing because of the new mechanical degrees of freedom that these membranes present over conventional epitaxial films. However, little is known about how their fabrication process, and in particular the exposure to water during the etching step, affects their properties. Here, we investigate how membranes of two perovskite archetypes, antiferroelectric PbZrO3 and paraelectric SrTiO3, are affected by water-based etching step. Using Raman spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction, we find evidence that hydrogen penetrates the perovskite structure. Concomitant with this protonation, the functional properties also change, and both materials display ferroelectric-like behavior that is absent in bulk ceramics or hydrogen-free films at room temperature. We also find that thermal annealing can be used to expel the hydrogen from the membranes, which henceforth recover bulk-like properties. The two main conclusions of this work are that (i) any perovskite membrane made by sacrificial layer hydrolysis is vulnerable to hydrogen penetration (protonation) that can induce important but extrinsic changes in functional properties, and (ii) the hydrogen can, and should, be expelled by annealing to recover intrinsic behaviour.</description>

      <title>Soft X-ray imaging with coherence tomography in the water window spectral range using high-harmonic generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-harmonic generation (HHG) is used as a source for various imaging applications in the extreme ultraviolet spectral range. It offers spatially coherent radiation and unique elemental contrast with the potential for attosecond time resolution. The unfavorable efficiency scaling to higher photon energies prevented the imaging application in the soft X-ray range so far. In this work we demonstrate the feasibility of using harmonics for imaging in the water window spectral region (284$\,$eV to 532$\,$eV). We achieve nondestructive depth profile imaging in a heterostructure by utilizing a broadband and noise-resistant technique called soft X-ray Coherence Tomography (SXCT) at a high-flux lab-scale HHG source. SXCT is derived from Optical Coherence Tomography, a Fourier based technique, that can use the full bandwidth of the source to reach an axial resolution of 12$\,$nm in this demonstration. The employed source covers the entire water window, with a photon flux exceeding 10$^\text{6}\,$photons/eV/s at a photon energy of 500$\,$eV. We show local cross sections of a sample consisting of Aluminium oxide and Platinum layers of varying thickness on a Zinc oxide substrate. We validate the findings with scanning and transmission electron microscopy after preparation with focused ion beam milling.</description>

      <title>Casimir-like effect driven self-assembly of graphene on molten metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Casimir effect, explained by Hendrik Casimir in 1948, is a macroscopic manifestation of quantum electrodynamics. Symmetry breaking due to space confinement of vacuum fluctuations in between two planar mirrors results in an attractive force acting between the two mirrors. Here, we show that spontaneous self-assembly of two-dimensional (2D) layered materials grown on molten metals (rheotaxy) is driven by the mechanical forces exerted by the liquid on the graphene domain and that these forces are subject to a Casimir-like effect. We present in situ environmental and ultrahigh vacuum scanning electron microscopy observations of chemical vapor deposition of graphene on both solid and molten gold and copper, which reveal that the self-assembly occurs via translational and rotational motions of graphene domains during growth on molten metals. Using high-temperature (~ 1300 K) atomic force microscopy measurements of graphene/molten-metal interfaces, coupled with density functional theory and continuum modelling of 2D layers floating on a liquid surface, we attribute the observed phenomena to Casimir-like effect of surface undulations and give further guidance for achieving seamless stitching of 2D layer domains into large scale monolayers.</description>

      <title>Influence of elastic deformations on body-wave velocity in solids: a case study considering shear deformations in concrete</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the influence of elastic deformation on the velocity of body waves in compressible isotropic materials making use of the framework of acoustoelasticity. Specifically, it examines body waves propagating at an angle to the principal deformation axes, where both shear and normal deformations are present in the coordinate system defined by the wave propagation direction. While numerous efforts have addressed this topic, the theoretical derivations have not yet to provide definitive conclusions about the response of wave velocity to applied shear stresses and strains. To derive more specific conclusions for body waves in concrete, we analyzed three examples using concrete as the medium. The key findings are that, in case of concrete materials when body waves propagate on the shear deformation plane, variations in longitudinal wave velocity are predominantly attributed to changes in normal strains, whereas transverse wave velocity is significantly influenced by both normal and shear strains. This finding can enhance the use of acoustoelasticity for detecting the magnitudes and directions of principal stresses in plane stress state applications.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the effect of adding B4C at the W-on-Si interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the W-on-Si interface and the effect of adding a B4C interlayer at such interface, using low-energy ion scattering (LEIS) spectroscopy, X-ray reflectivity, X-ray diffraction, and transmission electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. We extract the effective width of the interface in three different structures having: no-B4C, 0.24 nm, and 1.2 nm of B4C deposited in between the W and the Si films. The analysis reveals that the W distribution does not get significantly sharper when B4C atoms are deposited at the W-on-Si interface, showing that B4C does not act as a physical barrier against the diffusion of atoms during the deposition of these structures. W/Si thin-film structures are used in various applications, including X-ray optics. While many studies reported that adding a sub-nm thick B4C film at the W/Si interfaces is beneficial for the overall reflectivity of the structures, the physical mechanisms involved were not yet fully understood. In this context, being able to characterize the width of the interfaces with sub-nm resolution is key. In this study, we show how the analysis of the sub-surface signal of the LEIS spectra enables the characterization of the interface W-on-(B4C-)Si, highlighting the importance of systematically extracting the values of the effective interface width for the analysis and understanding of thin-film growth.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Soft X-ray experiments at synchrotron light sources are essential for a wide range of research fields. However, commercially available detectors for this energy range often cannot deliver the necessary combination of quantum efficiency, signal-to-noise ratio, dynamic range, speed, and radiation hardness within a single system. While hybrid detectors have addressed these challenges effectively in the hard X-ray regime, specifically with single photon counting pixel detectors extensively used in high-performance synchrotron applications, similar solutions are desired for energies below 2 keV.
  In this work, we introduce the first single-photon-counting hybrid pixel detector capable of detecting X-ray energies as low as 550 eV, utilizing the internal amplification of Low-Gain Avalanche Diode (LGAD) sensors. This detector is thoroughly characterized in terms of Signal-to-Noise Ratio and Detective Quantum Efficiency. We demonstrate its capabilities through ptychographic imaging at MAX IV 4th generation synchrotron light source at the Fe L$_3$-edge (707 eV), showcasing the enhanced detection performance of the system. This development sets a new benchmark for soft X-ray applications at synchrotrons, paving the way for significant advancements in imaging and analysis at lower photon energies.</description>

      <title>Surface-dominant transport in Weyl semimetal NbAs nanowires for next-generation interconnects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ongoing demands for smaller and more energy efficient electronic devices necessitate alternative interconnect materials with lower electrical resistivity at reduced dimensions. Despite the emergence of many promising candidates, synthesizing high quality nanostructures remains a major bottleneck in evaluating their performance. Here, we report the successful synthesis of Weyl semimetal NbAs nanowires via thermomechanical nanomolding, achieving single crystallinity and controlled diameters as small as 40 nm. Our NbAs nanowires exhibit a remarkably low room-temperature resistivity of 9.7 +/- 1.6 microOhm-cm, which is three to four times lower than their bulk counterpart. Theoretical calculations corroborate the experimental observations, attributing this exceptional resistivity reduction to surface dominant conduction with long carrier lifetime at finite temperatures. Further characterization of NbAs nanowires and bulk single crystals reveals high breakdown current density, robust stability, and superior thermal conductivity. Collectively, these properties highlight the strong potential of NbAs nanowires as next-generation interconnects, which can surpass the limitations of current copper-based interconnects. Technologically, our findings present a practical application of topological materials, while scientifically showcasing the fundamental properties uniquely accessible in nanoscale platforms.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate the simultaneous realization of nonreciprocal coupling and ultra-strong coupling in cavity magnonics. By replacing a copper cylinder with a yttrium iron garnet cylinder within the photonic crystal, we achieve an ultra-strong coupling strength of 1.18 GHz and a coupling efficiency of 10.9%. Nonreciprocal microwave transmission emerges within the photonic bandgap, due to the breaking of time-reversal symmetry through the gyromagnetic and Faraday effects. This work establishes a foundation for advanced nonreciprocal devices in hybrid cavity magnonic systems, with promising applications in quantum information processing and microwave isolation.</description>

      <title>Disordered Optical Metasurfaces: Basics, Properties, and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09425v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical metasurfaces are conventionally viewed as organized flat arrays of photonic or plasmonic nanoresonators, also called metaatoms. These metasurfaces are typically highly ordered and fabricated with precision using expensive tools. However, the inherent imperfections in large-scale nanophotonic devices, along with recent advances in bottom-up nanofabrication techniques and design strategies, have highlighted the potential benefits of incorporating disorder to achieve specific optical functionalities. This review offers an overview of the key theoretical, numerical, and experimental aspects related to the exploration of disordered optical metasurfaces. It introduces fundamental concepts of light scattering by disordered metasurfaces and outlines theoretical and numerical methodologies for analyzing their optical behavior. Various fabrication techniques are discussed, highlighting the types of disorder they deliver and their achievable precision level. The review also explores critical applications of disordered optical metasurfaces, such as light manipulation in thin film materials and the design of structural colors and visual appearances. Finally, the article offers perspectives on the burgeoning future research in this field. Disordered optical metasurfaces offer a promising alternative to their ordered counterparts, often delivering unique functionalities or enhanced performance. They present a particularly exciting opportunity in applications demanding large-scale implementation, such as sustainable renewable energy systems, as well as aesthetically vibrant coatings for luxury goods and architectural designs.</description>

      <title>The impact of local noise recorded at the ET candidate sites on the signal to noise ratio of CBC gravitational wave signals for the ET triangle configuration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02166v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an evaluation of how site dependent noise can affect the signal to noise ratio (SNR) of compact binary coalescence (CBC) signals in the future 3rd generation gravitational wave (GW) detector Einstein Telescope (ET). The design of ET is currently pushing the scientific community to study its scientific potential with respect to known, and possibly unexpected, GW signals using its design sensitivity curves. However, local ambient noise may have an impact on the ET sensitivity at low frequency and therefore affect the SNR of CBC signals at low frequency. Therefore, we study the impact of ambient noise on the ET sensitivity curve at the two sites candidate to host ET - Sardinia, in Italy, and the Euregio Meuse-Rhine (EMR) at the Netherlands-Belgium border - and infer the impact on the ET sensitivity curve and how the SNR of CBC signals at low frequencies is affected. We find that Sardinia shows results which are on par, if not better, than the design case. On the other hand, ambient noise for the current EMR sensitivity curve in Terziet causes a higher degradation of the SNR performances.</description>
