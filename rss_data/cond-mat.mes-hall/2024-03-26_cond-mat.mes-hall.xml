      <title>Tunable ultrastrong magnon magnon coupling and spin Hall magnetoresistance in a van der Waals antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antiferromagnetic (AFM) magnons and the manipulation of magnetisation via spin currents in van der Waals (vdW) materials offer substantial potential for applications in magnonics and spintronics. In this study, we demonstrate ultrastrong magnon-magnon coupling in the GHz regime within a vdW AFM, achieving a remarkable maximum normalised coupling strength of 0.47. Our investigation unveils the tunability of coupling strength through temperature-dependent magnetic anisotropies. Additionally, we show the prospect for further enhancement to the deep-strong magnon-magnon coupling regime by manipulating the anisotropy. Furthermore, we report spin Hall magnetoresistance in a vdW AFM-based device and study the field and temperature dependence. These findings highlight the transformative potential of vdW AFMs in advancing the field of spin-based technologies.</description>

      <title>Electrically Switchable Circular Photogalvanic Effect in Methylammonium Lead Iodide Microcrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the circular photogalvanic effect (CPGE) in single-crystalline methylammonium lead iodide microcrystals under a static electric field. The external electric field can enhance the magnitude of the helicity dependent photocurrent (HDPC) by two orders of magnitude and flip its sign, which we attribute to magnetic shift currents induced by the Rashba-Edelstein effect. This HDPC induced by the static electric field may be viewed as an unusually strong third-order photoresponse, which produces a current two orders of magnitude larger than second-order injection current. Furthermore, the HDPC is highly nonlocal and can be created by photoexcitation out of the device channel, indicating a spin diffusion length up to 50 $\mu$m at 78 K.</description>

      <title>Screened hydrogen model of excitons in semiconducting nanoribbons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optical response of quasi-one-dimensional systems is often dominated by tightly bound excitons, that significantly influence their basic electronic properties. Despite their importance for device performance, accurately predicting their excitonic effects typically requires computationally demanding many-body approaches. Here, we present a simplified model to describe the static macroscopic dielectric function, which depends only on the width of the quasi-one-dimensional system and its polarizability per unit length. We show that at certain interaction distances, the screened Coulomb potential is greater than its bare counterpart, which results from the enhanced repulsive electron-electron interactions. As a test case, we study fourteen different nanoribbons, twelve of them armchair graphene nanoribbons of different families. Initially, we devised a simplified equation to estimate the exciton binding energy and extension that provides results comparable to those from the full Bethe-Salpeter equation, albeit for a specific nanoribbon family. Then, we used our proposed screening potential to solve the 1D Wannier-Mott equation, which turn out to be broad approach, that is able to predict binding energies that match quite well the ones obtained with the Bethe-Salpeter equation, irrespective of the nanoribbon family.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bilinear magnetoresistance has been studied theoretically in 2D systems with isotropic cubic form of Rashba spin-orbit interaction. We have derived the effective spin-orbital field due to current-induced spin polarization and discussed its contribution to the unidirectional system response. The analysed model can be applied to the semiconductor quantum wells as well as 2DEG at the surfaces and interfaces of perovskite oxides.</description>

      <title>A Genetic Algorithm Trained Machine-Learned Interatomic Potential for the Silicon-Carbon System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A linear regression-based machine learned interatomic potential (MLIP) was developed for the silicon-carbon system. The MLIP was predominantly trained on structures discovered through a genetic algorithm, encompassing the entire silicon-carbon composition space, and uses as its foundation the Ultra-Fast Force Fields (UF3) formulation. To improve MLIP performance, the learning algorithm was modified to include higher spline interpolation resolution in regions with large potential energy surface curvature. The developed MLIP demonstrates exceptional predictive performance, accurately estimating energies and forces for structures across the silicon-carbon composition and configuration space. The MLIP predicts mechanical properties of SiC with high precision and captures fundamental volume-pressure and volume-temperature relationships. Uniquely, this silicon-carbon MLIP is adept at modeling complex high-temperature phenomena, including the peritectic decomposition of SiC and carbon dimer formation during SiC surface reconstruction, which cannot be captured with prior classical interatomic potentials for this material.</description>

      <title>Observation of the dual quantum spin Hall insulator by density-tuned correlations in a van der Waals monolayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The convergence of topology and correlations represents a highly coveted realm in the pursuit of novel quantum states of matter. Introducing electron correlations to a quantum spin Hall (QSH) insulator can lead to the emergence of a fractional topological insulator and other exotic time-reversal-symmetric topological order, not possible in quantum Hall and Chern insulator systems. However, the QSH insulator with quantized edge conductance remains rare, let alone that with significant correlations. In this work, we report a novel dual QSH insulator within the intrinsic monolayer crystal of TaIrTe4, arising from the interplay of its single-particle topology and density-tuned electron correlations. At charge neutrality, monolayer TaIrTe4 demonstrates the QSH insulator that aligns with single-particle band structure calculations, manifesting enhanced nonlocal transport and quantized helical edge conductance. Interestingly, upon introducing electrons from charge neutrality, TaIrTe4 only shows metallic behavior in a small range of charge densities but quickly goes into a new insulating state, entirely unexpected based on TaIrTe4's single-particle band structure. This insulating state could arise from a strong electronic instability near the van Hove singularities (VHS), likely leading to a charge density wave (CDW). Remarkably, within this correlated insulating gap, we observe a resurgence of the QSH state, marked by the revival of nonlocal transport and quantized helical edge conduction. Our observation of helical edge conduction in a CDW gap could bridge spin physics and charge orders. The discovery of a dual QSH insulator introduces a new method for creating topological flat minibands via CDW superlattices, which offer a promising platform for exploring time-reversal-symmetric fractional phases and electromagnetism.</description>

      <title>Quantitatively predicting angle-resolved polarized Raman intensity of black phosphorus flakes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In-plane anisotropic layered materials (ALMs), such as black phosphorus (BP), exhibit unique angle-resolved polarized Raman (ARPR) spectroscopy characteristics, as attributed to birefringence, linear dichroism and complex Raman tensor. Moreover, the ARPR intensity profiles of BP flakes deposited on multilayer dielectrics are notably sensitive to their thickness, owing to interference effects. The intricate anisotropic effects present challenges in accurately predicting the ARPR intensity of BP flakes. In this study, we propose a comprehensive strategy for predicting the ARPR intensity of BP flakes by explicitly considering optical anisotropy, encompassing birefringence, linear dichroism, and anisotropic cavity interference effects within multilayered structures. Through this approach, we have identified the intrinsic complex Raman tensors for phonon modes, independent of the BP flake thickness. By leveraging this methodology, we have elucidated the flake thickness-dependent effective complex Raman tensor elements, allowing for precise prediction of the observed ARPR intensity profile for the BP flake. This work provides a profound understanding of ARPR behaviors for ALM flakes.</description>

      <title>Ideal spin-polarized Weyl-half-semimetal with a single pair of Weyl points in half-Heusler compounds XCrTe (X=K, Rb)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Realizing ideal Weyl semimetal state with a single pair of Weyl points has been a long-sought goal in the field of topological semimetals. Here, we reveal such a state in the Cr-based half-Heusler compounds XCrTe (X=K, Rb). We show that these materials have a half metal ground state, with Fermi level crossing only one spin channel. Importantly, the Fermi surface is clean, consisting of the minimal number (i.e., a single pair) of spin-polarized Weyl points, so the state represents an ideal Weyl half semimetal. We show that the locations of the two Weyl points and the associated Chern vector can be flexibly tuned by rotating the magnetization vector. The minimal surface Fermi arc pattern and its contribution to anomalous Hall transport are discussed. Our finding offers an ideal material platform for exploring magnetic Weyl fermions, which will also facilitate the interplay between Weyl physics and spintronics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The performance and accuracy of quantum electronics is substantially degraded when the temperature of the electrons in the devices is too high. The electron temperature can be reduced with appropriate thermal anchoring and by filtering both the low frequency and radio frequency noise. Ultimately, for high performance filters the electron temperature can approach the phonon temperature (as measured by resistive thermometers) in a dilution refrigerator. In this application note, the method for measuring the electron temperature in a typical quantum electronics device using Coulomb blockade thermometry is described. This technique is applied to find the readily achievable electron temperature in the device when using the QFilter provided by QDevil. With our thermometry measurements, using a single GaAs/AlGaAs quantum dot in an optimized experimental setup, we determined an electron temperature of 28 $\pm$ 2 mK for a dilution refrigerator base temperature of 18 mK.</description>

      <title>Giant Hall effect in two-dimensional CoSi$_2$ granular arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Granular metals offer tailorable electronic properties and play crucial roles in device and sensor applications. We have fabricated a series of nonmagnetic granular CoSi2 thin films and studied the Hall effect and transport properties. We observed a two orders of magnitude enhancement in the Hall coefficient in films fall slightly above the metal-insulator transition. This giant Hall effect (GHE) is ascribed to the local quantum-interference effect induced reduction of the charge carriers. Transmission electron microscopy images and transport properties indicate that our films form two dimensional granular arrays. The GHE may provide useful and sensitive applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum states of an ellipsoidal nanocluster of a heterophase system InAs / GaAs are studied using an exact analytical approach, in contrast to the generally accepted theoretical model based on the adiabatic approximation. It is shown that the spectrum of a nanoobject is formed from local groups, consisting of discrete levels, separated by terahertz frequency intervals. A double random degeneration of certain spectrum states is revealed. Allowed mid-infrared (IR) optical transitions between different spectral states are analyzed. The role of dimensional parameters and features of the shape of a nanoobject in the characteristics of unipolar transitions is assessed. The absorption spectrum for the transition in the lower part of the substructure spectrum is calculated.</description>

      <title>Electrically tunable, rapid spin-orbit torque induced modulation of colossal magnetoresistance in Mn$_3$Si$_2$Te$_6$ nanoflakes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a quasi-layered ferrimagnetic material, Mn$_3$Si$_2$Te$_6$ nanoflakes exhibit magnetoresistance behaviour that is fundamentally different from their bulk crystal counterparts. They offer three key properties crucial for spintronics. Firstly, at least 10^6 times faster response comparing to that exhibited by bulk crystals has been observed in current-controlled resistance and magnetoresistance. Secondly, ultra-low current density is required for resistance modulation (~ 5 A/cm$^2$). Thirdly, electrically gate-tunable magnetoresistance has been realized. Theoretical calculations reveal that the unique magnetoresistance behaviour in the Mn$_3$Si$_2$Te$_6$ nanoflakes arises from a magnetic field induced band gap shift across the Fermi level. The rapid current induced resistance variation is attributed to spin-orbit torque, an intrinsically ultra-fast process (~nanoseconds). This study suggests promising avenues for spintronic applications. In addition, it highlights Mn$_3$Si$_2$Te$_6$ nanoflakes as a suitable platform for investigating the intriguing physics underlying chiral orbital moments, magnetic field induced band variation and spin torque.</description>

      <title>Layer Control of Magneto-Optical Effects and Their Quantization in Spin-Valley Splitting Antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magneto-optical effects (MOE), interfacing the fundamental interplay between magnetism and light, have served as a powerful probe for magnetic order, band topology, and valley index. Here, based on multiferroic and topological bilayer antiferromagnets (AFMs), we propose a layer control of MOE (L-MOE), which is created and annihilated by layer-stacking or an electric field effect. The key character of L-MOE is the sign-reversible response controlled by ferroelectric polarization, the Neel vector, or the electric field direction. Moreover, the sign-reversible L-MOE can be quantized in topologically insulating AFMs. We reveal that the switchable L-MOE originates from the combined contributions of spin-conserving and spin-flip interband transitions in spin-valley splitting AFMs, a phenomenon not observed in conventional AFMs. Our findings bridge the ancient MOE to the emergent realms of layertronics, valleytronics, and multiferroics and may hold immense potential in these fields.</description>

      <title>Skyrmionic device for three dimensional magnetic field sensing enabled by spin-orbit torques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions are topologically protected local magnetic solitons that are promising for storage, logic or general computing applications. In this work, we demonstrate that we can use a skyrmion device based on [W/CoFeB/MgO] 1 0 multilayers for three-dimensional magnetic field sensing enabled by spin-orbit torques (SOT). We stabilize isolated chiral skyrmions and stripe domains in the multilayers, as shown by magnetic force microscopy images and micromagnetic simulations. We perform magnetic transport measurements to show that we can sense both in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic fields by means of a differential measurement scheme in which the symmetry of the SOT leads to cancelation of the DC offset. With the magnetic parameters obtained by vibrating sample magnetometry and ferromagnetic resonance measurements, we perform finite-temperature micromagnetic simulations, where we investigate the fundamental origin of the sensing signal. We identify the topological transformation between skyrmions, stripes and type-II bubbles that leads to a change in the resistance that is read-out by the anomalous Hall effect. Our study presents a novel application for skyrmions, where a differential measurement sensing concept is applied to quantify external magnetic fields paving the way towards more energy efficient applications in skyrmionics based spintronics.</description>

      <title>A gate tunable transmon qubit in planar Ge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gate-tunable transmons (gatemons) employing semiconductor Josephson junctions have recently emerged as building blocks for hybrid quantum circuits. In this study, we present a gatemon fabricated in planar Germanium. We induce superconductivity in a two-dimensional hole gas by evaporating aluminum atop a thin spacer, which separates the superconductor from the Ge quantum well. The Josephson junction is then integrated into an Xmon circuit and capacitively coupled to a transmission line resonator. We showcase the qubit tunability in a broad frequency range with resonator and two-tone spectroscopy. Time-domain characterizations reveal energy relaxation and coherence times up to 75 ns. Our results, combined with the recent advances in the spin qubit field, pave the way towards novel hybrid and protected qubits in a group IV, CMOS-compatible material.</description>

Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions are topologically nontrivial spin configurations that possess particle-like properties. Earlier research was mainly focused on a specific type of skyrmion with topological charge Q = -1. However, theoretical analyses of two-dimensional chiral magnets have predicted the existence of skyrmion bags -- solitons with arbitrary positive or negative topological charge. Although such spin textures are metastable states, recent experimental observations have confirmed the stability of isolated skyrmion bags in a limited range of applied magnetic fields. Here, by utilizing Lorentz transmission electron microscopy, we show the extraordinary stability of skyrmion bags in thin plates of B20-type FeGe. In particular, we show that skyrmion bags embedded within a skyrmion lattice remain stable even in zero or inverted external magnetic fields. A robust protocol for nucleating such embedded skyrmion bags is provided. Our results agree perfectly with micromagnetic simulations and establish thin plates of cubic chiral magnets as a powerful platform for exploring a broad spectrum of topological magnetic solitons.</description>

Abstract: In the ongoing effort towards a scalable quantum computer, multiple technologies have been proposed. Some of them exploit topological materials to process quantum information. In this work, we propose a lattice of photonic cavities with alternating hoppings to create a modified multidomain SSH chain, that is, a sequence of topological insulators made from chains of dimers. A qubit is then coupled to each boundary. We show this system is well suited for quantum information processing because topological transfer of photons through this one-dimensional lattice can entangle any set of qubits on demand, providing a scalable quantum platform. We verify this claim evaluating entanglement measures and witnesses proving that bipartite and multipartite entanglement is produced, even in the presence of some disorder.</description>

      <title>Axion-like Interactions and CFT in Topological Matter, Anomaly Sum Rules and the Faraday Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss fundamental aspects of chiral anomaly-driven interactions in conformal field theory (CFT) in four spacetime dimensions. They find application in very general contexts, from early universe plasma to topological condensed matter. We outline the key shared characteristics of these interactions, specifically addressing the case of chiral anomalies, both for vector currents and gravitons. In the case of topological materials, the gravitational chiral anomaly is generated by thermal gradients via the (Tolman-Ehrenfest) Luttinger relation. In the CFT framework, a nonlocal effective action, derived through perturbation theory, indicates that the interaction is mediated by an excitation in the form of an anomaly pole, which appears in the conformal limit of the vertex. To illustrate this, we demonstrate how conformal Ward identities (CWIs) in momentum space allow us to reconstruct the entire chiral anomaly interaction in its longitudinal and transverse sectors just by inclusion of a pole in the longitudinal sector. Both sectors are coupled in amplitudes with an intermediate chiral fermion or a bilinear Chern-Simons current with intermediate photons. In the presence of fermion mass corrections, the pole transforms into a cut, but the absorption amplitude in the axial-vector channel satisfies mass-independent sum rules related to the anomaly in any chiral interaction. The detection of an axion-like/quasiparticle in these materials may rely on a combined investigation of these sum rules, along with the measurement of the angle of rotation of the plane of polarization of incident light when subjected to a chiral perturbation. This phenomenon serves as an analogue of a similar one in ordinary axion physics, in the presence of an axion-like condensate, that we rederive using axion electrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Efficient semiclassical approximation for bound states in graphene in magnetic field with a small trigonal warping correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the construction of efficient (simple to implement) explicit semiclassical asymptotic eigenfunctions of the Dirac operator for high-energy bound states in graphene in magnetic field. When considering excited states in graphene, a distortion called trigonal warping begins to play an~important role, see [7], [12]. We are dealing with a~trigonal warping correction, considering it to be small. While the standard semiclassical methods allow one to solve the eigenequations for operators if and only if quantization conditions are met, we, based on article [1], develop approaches that can be used in case these conditions are violated. The complete symbol turns out to be only close to integrable, which brings its own difficulties. The present paper relies heavily on the results from [3].</description>

      <title>The role of rare-earth atoms in the anisotropy and antiferromagnetic exchange coupling at a hybrid metal-organic interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic anisotropy and magnetic exchange interactions are crucial parameters that characterize the hybrid metal-organic interface, key component of an organic spintronic device. We show that the incorporation of 4$f$ RE atoms to hybrid metal-organic interfaces of CuPc/REAu$_2$ type (RE= Gd, Ho) constitutes a feasible approach towards on-demand magnetic properties and functionalities. The GdAu$_2$ and HoAu$_2$ substrates differ in their magnetic anisotropy behavior. Remarkably, the HoAu$_2$ surface boosts the inherent out-of-plane anisotropy of CuPc, owing to the match between the anisotropy axis of substrate and molecule. Furthermore, the presence of RE atoms leads to a spontaneous antiferromagnetic (AFM) exchange coupling at the interface, induced by the 3$d$-4$f$ superexchange interaction between the unpaired 3$d$ electron of CuPc and the 4$f$ electrons of the RE atoms. We show that 4$f$ RE atoms with unquenched quantum orbital momentum ($L$), as it is the case of Ho, induce an anisotropic interfacial exchange coupling.</description>

      <title>The fractional quantum Hall nematics on the first Landau level in a tilted field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigated the behavior of fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states in a two-dimensional electron system with layer thickness and an in-plane magnetic field. Our comparisons across various filling factors within the first Landau level revealed a crucial observation. A slight in-plane magnetic field specifically enhances the nematic order of the $\nu = 7/3$ FQH state. For this particular filling, through calculating the energy gap, the Ising nematic order parameter, the pair-correlation function, and the static structure factor, we observed that as the in-plane magnetic field increases, the system first enters into an anisotropic FQH phase without closing the spectrum gap, then the FQH nematic (FQHN) phase after neutral gap closing. The system eventually enters a gapless one-dimensional charge density wave (CDW) phase for a large in-plane field. We thus provide a full phase diagram of the $\nu = 7/3$ state in a tilted magnetic field, demonstrating the existence of the FQHN, which aligns with recent resonant inelastic light scattering (RILS) experimental observations.</description>

      <title>Toward Optimum Coupling between Free Electrons and Confined Optical Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Free electrons are unique tools to probe and manipulate nanoscale optical fields with emerging applications in ultrafast spectromicroscopy and quantum metrology. However, advances in this field are hindered by the small probability associated with the excitation of single optical modes by individual free electrons. Here, we theoretically investigate the scaling properties of the electron-driven excitation probability for a wide variety of optical modes including plasmons in metallic nanostructures and Mie resonances in dielectric cavities, spanning a broad spectral range that extends from the ultraviolet to the infrared. The highest probabilities for the direct generation of three-dimensionally confined modes are observed at low electron and mode energies in small structures, with order-unity ($\sim100$\%) coupling demanding the use of $&lt;100$~eV electrons interacting with $&lt;1$~eV polaritons confined down to tens of nm. Electronic transitions in artificial atoms also emerge as practical systems to realize strong coupling to few-eV free electrons. In contrast, conventional dielectric cavities reach a maximum probability in the few-percent range. In addition, we show that waveguide modes can be generated with higher-than-unity efficiency by phase-matched interaction with grazing electrons, suggesting an efficient method to create multiple excitations of a localized optical mode by an individual electron through funneling the so-generated propagating photons into a confining cavity -- an alternative approach to direct electron-cavity interaction. Our work provides a roadmap to optimize electron-photon coupling with potential applications in electron spectromicroscopy as well as nonlinear and quantum optics at the nanoscale.</description>

      <title>Application of Floquet-Magnus expansion and Fer expansion to investigate the chemical shift anisotropy in solid-state NMR when irradiated with the triple oscillating field technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Floquet-Magnus and Fer expansion schemes were introduced in solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) in 2011 and 2006, respectively. Key features of the Floquet magnus expansion are its ability to account for the calculations developed in a finite-dimensional Hilbert space instead of an infinite-dimensional space within the Floquet theory as well as its use of its distinguishable function from other theories such as average Hamiltonian theory, Floquet theory, and Fer expansion, which facilitates the evaluation of the spin behavior in between the stroboscopic observation points. This article focuses on revisiting the Floquet-Magnus and Fer expansion approaches and applying both methods to calculate the effective Hamiltonians and propagators, which control the spin system evolution during the Triple Oscillating Field Technique radiation experiment (TOFU). The TOFU pulse sequence is an important technique that was shown to avoid the dipolar truncation problem and form a new basis for accurate distance measurement by solid-state NMR. We take advantage of the interaction frequencies and the time modulation arising from the TOFU pulse sequence allowing selective recoupling of specific terms in the Hamiltonian that fulfill determined specific conditions. The work presented unifies and generalizes existing results of the Floquet-Magnus and Fer expansions and delivers illustrations of novel springs that boost previous applications that are based on the classical information. We believe that the generality of this work points to potential applications in problems related to theoretical developments of spectroscopy as well as interdisciplinary research areas whenever they include the spin dynamics concepts.</description>

      <title>In situ growth of hydrophilic nickel-cobalt layered double hydroxides nanosheets on biomass waste-derived porous carbon for high-performance hybrid supercapacitors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rational design and cost-effective fabrication of layered double hydroxides (LDHs) nanosheets with extraordinary electrochemical performance is a key challenge for hybrid supercapacitors (HSCs). Herein, we report a facile in situ growth methodology to eco-friendly synthesize hydrophilic NiCo-LDHs nanosheets on biomass waste-derived porous carbon (BC) for robust high-performance HSC cathode. The in situ growth process under ultrasonication realizes the rational arrangement of NiCo-LDHs nanosheets on the surface of BC, which effectively increases the specific surface area, promotes the electronic conductivity and enhances the wettability of NiCo-LDHs nanosheets without affecting their thickness values. With the beneficial effects of ultrathin thickness of LDHs nanosheets (6.20 nm), large specific surface area (2324.1 m2 g-1), low charge transfer resistance (1.65 ohm), and high wettability with electrolyte (34-35 degree), the obtained Ni2Co1-LDHs/BC50 electrode possesses an ultra-high specific capacitance of 2390 F g-1 (956 C g-1) at 1 A g-1, which is superior to most reported values. Furthermore, an assembled Ni2Co1-LDHs/BC50//YP-80F HSC delivers a maximum specific energy of 52.47 Wh kg-1 at 375 W kg-1, and maintains a high capacitance retention of 75.9% even after 4000 cycles. This work provides a facile approach to fabricate LDHs nanosheets based cathode materials for high-performance HSCs.</description>

      <title>Orientation-Driven Large Magnetic Hysteresis of Er(III) Cyclooctatetraenide-Based Single-Ion Magnets Adsorbed on Ag(100)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The molecular self-assembly and the magnetic properties of two cyclooctatetraenide (COT) - based single-ion magnets (SIM) adsorbed on Ag(100) in the sub-monolayer range are reported. Our study combines scanning-tunneling microscopy, X-ray photoemission spectroscopy and polarized X-ray absorption spectroscopy to show that Cp*ErCOT (Cp* = 1,2,3,4,5-pentamethylcyclopentadienide anion) SIMs self-assemble as alternating compact parallel rows including standing-up and lying-down conformations, following the main crystallographic directions of the substrate. Conversely, K[Er(COT)$_2$], obtained from subliming the [K(18-c-6)][Er(COT)$_2$]$\cdot$ 2THF salt, forms uniaxially ordered domains with the (COT)$^{2-}$ rings perpendicular to the substrate plane. The polarization-dependent X-ray absorption spectra reproduced by the multiX simulations suggest that the strong in-plane magnetic anisotropy of K[Er(COT)$_2$]/Ag(100) and the weak out-of-plane anisotropy of Cp*ErCOT/Ag(100) can be attributed to the strikingly different surface ordering of these two complexes. Compared to the bulk phase, surface-supported K[Er(COT)$_2$] exhibits a similarly large hysteresis opening, while the Cp*ErCOT shows a rather small opening. This result reveals that despite structural similarities, the two organometallic SMMs have strongly different magnetic properties when adsorbed on the metal substrate, attributed to the different orientations and the resulting interactions of the ligand rings with the surface.</description>

Abstract: Heat capacity of the nuclear spin system (NSS) in GaAs-based microstructures has been shown to be much greater than expected from dipolar coupling between nuclei, thus limiting the efficiency of NSS cooling by adiabatic demagnetization. It was suggested that quadrupole interaction induced by some small residual strain could provide this additional reservoir for the heat storage. We check and validate this hypothesis by combining nuclear spin relaxation measurements with adiabatic remagnetization and nuclear magnetic resonance experiments, using electron spin noise spectroscopy as a unique tool for detection of nuclear magnetization. Our results confirm and quantify the role of the quadrupole splitting in the heat storage within NSS and provide additional insight into fundamental, but still actively debated relation between a mechanical strain and the resulting electric field gradients in GaAs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.06072v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The influence of a rectangular potential barrier on the quantum transport of fermions in silicene is explored. Specifically, analytical solutions are presented to derive transmission and reflection probabilities together with conductance. It is shown that the transmission is highly sensitive to both the barrier height and incident energy. As a result, the occurrence of Klein and resonant tunnelings is observed, with a significant dependence on the barrier width. Notably, it is found that perfect transmission extends beyond normal incidence, occurring at various oblique angles. Moreover, the transmission pattern exhibits a more fragmented structure with increasing barrier width, reminiscent of Fabry-P\'erot resonances. In contrast, the conductance displays a non-monotonic dependence on incident energy and features rapid oscillations with a rising barrier height. However, at a constant barrier height, there is a minimal disparity among conductance profiles for high incident energy values. When incident energy equals the barrier height, the conductance experiences a local minimum. For a thin barrier, a substantial reduction in conductance is observed, unlike the oscillatory behavior seen with a thicker barrier. These findings underscore the progress in silicene research and offer a fresh perspective on the relativistic applications of tunneling in this material.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.11211v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Owing to the Klein tunneling phenomenon, the permanent confinement or localization of electrons within a graphene quantum dot is unattainable. Nonetheless, a constant magnetic field can transiently ensnare an electron within the quantum dot, giving rise to what are known as quasi-bound states characterized by finite lifetimes. To prolong the retention of electrons within the quantum dot, we introduce a mass term into the Hamiltonian, thereby inducing an energy gap. We resolve the Dirac equation to ascertain the eigenspinors, and by ensuring their continuity at the boundaries, we investigate the scattering behavior. Our findings indicate that the presence of an energy gap can extend the lifetimes of these quasi-bound states within the quantum dot. In particular, we demonstrate that even in the absence of a magnetic field, the scattering efficiency attains significant levels when the energy gap gets closed to the incident energy of an electron traversing the quantum dot. It is found that an augmentation in the electron density within the quantum dot results in an enhancement of the electron-trapping time.</description>

      <title>Magnetic field effect on tunneling through triple barrier in AB bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.12479v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate electron tunneling in AB bilayer graphene through a triple electrostatic barrier of heights $U_i (i=2,3,4)$ subjected to a perpendicular magnetic field. By way of the transfer matrix method and using the continuity conditions at the different interfaces, the transmission probability is determined. Additional resonances appear for two-band tunneling at normal incidence, and their number is proportional to the value of $U_4$ in the case of $U_2&lt;U_4$. However, when $U_2&gt;U_4$, anti-Klein tunneling increases with $U_2$. The transmission probability exhibits an interesting oscillatory behavior when $U_3&gt;U_2=U_4$ and $U_3 &lt;U_2=U_4$. For fixed energy $E=0.39\gamma_1$, increasing barrier widths increases the number of oscillations and decreases Klein tunneling. The interlayer bias creates a gap for $U_2&lt;U_3&lt;U_4$ and $U_3&gt;U_2=U_4$. In the four-band tunneling case, the transmission decreases in $T^+_+$, $T^-_+$ and $T^-_-$ channels in comparison with the single barrier case. It does, however, increase for $T^+_-$ when compared to the single barrier case. Transmission is suppressed in the gap region when an interlayer bias is introduced. This is reflected in the total conductance $G_{\text{tot}}$ in the region of zero conductance. Our results are relevant for electron confinement in AB bilayer graphene and for the development of graphene-based transistors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.02221v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe a scheme to exchange fermion parity between two pairs of Majorana bound states mediated by coupling with a centralized quantum dot. We specifically formulate such a scheme for Majorana bound states nucleated in the Josephson vortices formed in a four-fold crossroads junction of planar topological superconductors in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field. This platform yields several advantages to the execution of our scheme as compared to similar ideas proposed in wire geometries, including control over the positions of the MBS and hence, a tunable coupling with the quantum dot. We show that moving the MBS along the junctions through voltage pulses can facilitate parity exchange via a two-step process, with intermediate projective measurements of the quantum dot charge. Thus, we formulate a way to achieve single qubit operations for MBS in extended Josephson junctions through projective measurements of quantum dot charge. We also discuss the physical viability of our scheme with a particular focus on changes in quantum dot energy levels as a measurable indicator of the success of the scheme.</description>

      <title>Disorder effects on the so-called Andreev band in Majorana nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.10041v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We comment on a recent publication Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 207001 (2023), pointing out that the periodic model for the superconducting gap and/or the spin splitting used by the authors is artificial and does not apply to any real systems. In addition, we show that the resulting Andreev band introduced by this artificial and unrealistic periodicity is suppressed by the potential disorder invariably present in all experimental systems. The results of this model are therefore contrived and do not apply to any experimental system.</description>

      <title>Topology reconstruction for asymmetric systems by isomorphic mapping or perturbation approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12104v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The systems without symmetries, e.g. the spatial and chiral symmetries, are generally thought to be improper for topological study and no conventional integral topological invariant can be well defined. In this work, with multi-band asymmetric Rice-Mele-like systems as examples, for the first time we show that the topology of all gaps can be reconstructed by two general methods and topological origin of many phenomena are revealed. A new integral topological invariant, i.e. the renormalized real-space winding number, can properly characterize the topology and bulk-edge correspondence of such systems. For the first method, an isomorphic mapping relationship between a Rice-Mele-like system and its chiral counterpart is set up, which accounts for the topology reconstruction in the half-filling gaps. For the second method, the Hilbert space of asymmetric systems could be reduced into degenerate subspaces by perturbation approximation, so that the topology in subspaces accounts for the topology reconstruction in the fractional-filling gaps. Surprisingly, the topology reconstructed by perturbation approximation exhibits extraordinary robustness since the topological edge states even exist far beyond the weak perturbation limit. We also show that both methods can be widely used for other asymmetric systems, e.g. the two-dimensional (2D) Rice-Mele systems and the superconductor systems. At last, for the asymmetric photonic systems, we predict different topological edge states by our topology-reconstruction theory and experimentally observe them in the laboratory, which agrees with each other very well. Our findings open a door for investigating new topological phenomena in asymmetric systems by various topological reconstruction methods which should greatly expand the category of topology study.</description>

      <title>Transmission anomalies in 2D photonic crystals from the checkerboard family: From broken to hidden symmetries and plasmon "spoofing"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.05391v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a field representation, the main symmetry of the electromagnetic response of complementary metal film structures is described by the Babinet principle, expected to be obeyed by structures in vanishingly thin films of a perfect electric conductor. A softer transmittance Babinet principle (TBP) is not so restrictive. The goal of this work is to study how severely this broken symmetry affects the optical response of such structures. We consider two geometrically distinct series of planar complementary structures from the checkerboard family: regular and bowtie. The self-complementary structure of these series is very singular and breaks even the rigorous Babinet principle. We study complete simulated transmittance spectral maps (T-Maps) that accumulate the whole spectral response of an entire series of structures in a single plot. The ab initio T-Maps of these 2D photonic crystals were simulated for linearly polarized waves propagating perpendicular to the planar structures, made in a vanishingly thin film of a perfect electric conductor. While confirming the expected long wavelength validity of the TBP, we show that in the frequency range where diffraction effects dominate, the standard derivation of the TBP no longer applies, and with the help of our T-Maps, we demonstrate a total collapse of the TBP in the structures considered. This broken symmetry practically eliminates all but one transmission band on the hole side of the T-Maps, the remaining strong band being a "spoof" plasmon, free of multiple frequency replicas, an important feature for filter applications. By symmetry arguments and simulations, we discovered that the T-Maps for bowtie and doubled-period regular structures are identical. We discuss how this hidden symmetry can benefit applications by providing a convenient scaling, whereby simplified structures can deliver a tailored response.</description>

      <title>Quantum Criticality in Open Quantum Spin Chains with Nonreciprocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.03714v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of nonreciprocity on universality and critical phenomena in open quantum interacting many-body systems. Nonreciprocal open quantum systems often have an exotic spectral sensitivity to boundary conditions, known as the Liouvillian skin effect (LSE). By considering an open quantum XXZ spin chain that exhibits LSE, we demonstrate the existence of a universal scaling regime that is not affected by the presence of the LSE. We resolve the critical exponents, which differ from those of free fermions, via tensor network methods and demonstrate that observables exhibit a universal scaling collapse, irrespective of the reciprocity. We find that the LSE only becomes relevant when a healing length scale $\xi_{\rm heal}$ at the system's edge (which is different to the localization length of the eigenstate of the Liouvillian) exceeds the system size, allowing edge properties to dominate the physics. We expect this result to be a generic feature of nonreciprocal models in the vicinity of a critical point. The driven-dissipative quantum criticality we observe has no classical analogue and stems from the existence of multiple dark states.</description>

      <title>Equal contribution of even and odd frequency pairing to transport across normal metal-superconductor junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05623v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Odd-frequency pairing is an unconventional type of Cooper pairing in superconductors related to the frequency dependence of the corresponding anomalous Green function. We show by a combination of analytical and numerical methods that odd-frequency pairing is ubiquitously present in the current of Andreev-scattered particles across a junction formed by a normal metal (N) and a superconductor (S), even if the superconducting pairing is of conventional $s$-wave, spin singlet type. We carefully analyze the conductance of NS junctions with different pairing symmetries ($s$-wave, $p$-wave, $d$-wave). In all cases, we identify a generic equal balance of even and odd frequency pairing to the contributions related to Andreev reflection. This analysis shows in retrospect that the presence of odd-frequency pairing in electric currents across NS junctions is rather the rule, not the exception. This insight stems from an alternative approach of analyzing the transport problem of hybrid structures. It is based on the Kubo-Greenwood formula with direct access to symmetries of the anomalous Green functions characterizing the superconducting pairing. We expect that our predictions substantially enrich the interpretation of transport data across NS junctions in many material combinations.</description>

      <title>Superfluidity of Total Angular Momentum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.12068v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spontaneous symmetry breaking of a U(1) symmetry leads to superfluidity of a corresponding conserved charge. We generalize the superfluidity to systems with U(1) symmetries acting on both matter fields and two-dimensional spatial coordinates. Such systems can be effectively realized in easy-plane ferromagnetic systems with spin-orbit coupling where the conserved charge is a total angular momentum. We clarify that under a steady injection of spin angular momentum, the superfluid of the total angular momentum shows spacetime oscillations of the spin density and geometry-dependent spin hydrodynamics. We also demonstrate that the steady spin injection destabilizes the superfluid of total angular momentum, causing a dissipation effect in its spin hydrodynamic properties. Our study broadens the comprehension of superfluidity and sheds new light on the interplay between symmetries and phases of matter.</description>

      <title>Generalized Dynamical Keldysh Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08118v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a certain class of exactly solvable models, describing spectral properties an electron moving in random in time external field with different statistical characteristics. This electron can be band - like or belong to a quantum well. The known dynamical Keldysh model is generalized for the case of fields with finite correlation time of fluctuations and for finite transfer frequencies of these fluctuations. In all cases we are able to perform the complete summation of all Feynman diagrams of corresponding perturbation series for the Green's function. This can be done either by the reduction of this series to some continuous fraction or by the use of the generalized Ward identity from which we can derive recurrence relations for the Green's function. In the case of a random field with finite transferred frequency there appear the interesting effects of modulation of spectral density and density of states.

      <title>Quantum entanglement transfer assisted via Duffing nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16809v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a scheme to enhance quantum entanglement in an optomechanical system by exploiting the so-called Duffing nonlinearity. Our model system consists of two mechanically coupled mechanical resonators, both driven by an optical field. One resonator supports Duffing nonlinearity, while the other does not. The resonators are coupled to each other via the so-called phonon hopping mechanism. The hopping rate is $\theta$-phase-dependent that induces Exceptional Points (EPs) singularities in the system. Interestingly, while the resonator with Duffing nonlinearity exhibits vanishing bipartite entanglement, we observe an entanglement transfer phenomenon into the other mechanical resonator. This nonlinearly induced entanglement demonstrates superior robustness against thermal fluctuations compared to entanglement generated without the nonlinearity. Additionally, this entanglement features the sudden death and revival phenomenon, where the peaks happen at the multiple of $\theta=\frac{\pi}{2}$. This work opens a new avenue for exploiting nonlinear resources to generate robust quantum entanglement, paving the way for advancements in quantum information processing, quantum sensing, and quantum computing within complex systems.</description>

      <title>Lattice Polaron in a Bose-Einstein Condensate of Hard-Core Bosons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13635v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lattice polarons, quasiparticles arising from the interaction between an impurity and its surrounding bosonic environment confined to a lattice system, have emerged as a platform for generating complex few-body states, probing many-body phenomena, and addressing long-standing problems in physics. In this study, we employ a variational ansatz to investigate the quasiparticle and spectral properties of an impurity coupled to a condensate gas of hard-core bosons in a two-dimensional optical lattice. Our findings demonstrate that the polaron features can be tuned by adjusting the filling factor of the bath, revealing intriguing polaron characteristics in the strongly interacting regime. These results offer valuable insights for lattice polaron experiments with ultracold gases and can serve as a guide for new experiments in emergent quantum devices, such as moir\'e materials, where optical excitations can be described in terms of hard-core bosons.</description>
