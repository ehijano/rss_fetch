      <title>A Generalized Method for Characterizing 21-cm Power Spectrum Signal Loss from Temporal Filtering of Drift-scanning Visibilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A successful detection of the cosmological 21-cm signal from intensity mapping experiments (for example, during the Epoch of Reioinization or Cosmic Dawn) is contingent on the suppression of subtle systematic effects in the data. Some of these systematic effects, with mutual coupling a major concern in interferometric data, manifest with temporal variability distinct from that of the cosmological signal. Fringe-rate filtering -- a time-based Fourier filtering technique -- is a powerful tool for mitigating these effects; however, fringe-rate filters also attenuate the cosmological signal. Analyses that employ fringe-rate filters must therefore be supplemented by careful accounting of the signal loss incurred by the filters. In this paper, we present a generalized formalism for characterizing how the cosmological 21-cm signal is attenuated by linear time-based filters applied to interferometric visibilities from drift-scanning telescopes. Our formalism primarily relies on analytic calculations and therefore has a greatly reduced computational cost relative to traditional Monte Carlo signal loss analyses. We apply our signal loss formalism to a filtering strategy used by the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA) and compare our analytic predictions against signal loss estimates obtained through a Monte Carlo analysis. We find excellent agreement between the analytic predictions and Monte Carlo estimates and therefore conclude that HERA, as well as any other drift-scanning interferometric experiment, should use our signal loss formalism when applying linear, time-based filters to the visibilities.</description>

      <title>Structure formation with primordial black holes: collisional dynamics, binaries, and gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) could compose the dark matter content of the Universe. We present the first simulations of cosmological structure formation with PBH dark matter that consistently include collisional few-body effects, post-Newtonian orbit corrections, orbital decay due to gravitational wave emission, and black-hole mergers. We carefully construct initial conditions by considering the evolution during radiation domination as well as early-forming binary systems. We identify numerous dynamical effects due to the collisional nature of PBH dark matter, including evolution of the internal structures of PBH halos and the formation of a hot component of PBHs. We also study the properties of the emergent population of PBH binary systems, distinguishing those that form at primordial times from those that form during the nonlinear structure formation process. These results will be crucial to sharpen constraints on the PBH scenario derived from observational constraints on the gravitational wave background. Even under conservative assumptions, the gravitational radiation emitted over the course of the simulation appears to exceed current limits from ground-based experiments, but this depends on the evolution of the gravitational wave spectrum and PBH merger rate toward lower redshifts.</description>

      <title>Testing the robustness of the BAO determination in the presence of massive neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the robustness of the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) feature in galaxy clustering in the presence of massive neutrinos. In the standard BAO analysis pipeline a reference cosmological model is assumed to boost the BAO peak through the so-called reconstruction technique and in the modelling of the BAO feature to extract the cosmological information. State-of-the art spectroscopic BAO measurements, such as the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument claim an aggregate precision of 0.52$\%$ on the BAO scale, with a systematic error of 0.1$\%$ associated to the assumption of a reference cosmology when measuring and analyzing the BAO feature. While the systematic effect induced by this arbitrary choice of fiducial cosmology has been studied for a wide range of $\Lambda$CDM-like models, it has not yet been tested for reference cosmologies with massive neutrinos with the precision afforded by next generation surveys. In this context, we employ the Quijote high-resolution dark-matter simulations with haloes above a mass of $M\sim 2\times10^{13} h^{-1}M_{\odot}$, with different values for the total sum of neutrinos masses, $\sum m_\nu[{\rm eV}] = 0,\, 0.1,\, 0,2,\, 0.4$ to study and quantify the impact of the pipeline's built-in assumption of massless neutrinos on the measurement of the BAO signal, with a special focus on the BAO reconstruction technique. We determine that any additional systematic bias introduced by the assumption of massless neutrinos is no greater than $0.1\%$ ($0.2\%$) for the isotropic (anisotropic) measurement. We expect these conclusions also hold for galaxies provided that neutrino properties do not alter the galaxy-halo connection.</description>

      <title>Fast Radio Bursts as probes of the late-time universe: a new insight on the Hubble tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are bright radio transient events, a subset of which have been localized to their host galaxies. Their high dispersion measures offer valuable insights into the ionized plasma along their line of sight, enabling them to serve as probes of cosmological parameters. One of the major challenges in contemporary cosmology is the Hubble tension -- an unresolved discrepancy between two independent methods of determining the Universe's expansion rate, yielding differing values for the Hubble constant. In this study, we analyze a sample of 64 extragalactic, localized FRBs observed by various telescopes, employing Bayesian analysis with distinct likelihood functions. Our findings suggest that FRBs serve as tracers of the Hubble constant in the late-time Universe. Notably, our results exhibit smaller error bars compared to previous studies, and the derived Hubble constant with 1$\sigma$ error bars no longer overlap with those obtained from early-Universe measurements. These results underscore the continuing tension between early- and late-time measurements of the Hubble constant.</description>

      <title>Non-parametric reconstruction of cosmological observables using Gaussian Processes Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The current accelerated expansion of the Universe remains ones of the most intriguing topics in modern cosmology, driving the search for innovative statistical techniques. Recent advancements in machine learning have significantly enhanced its application across various scientific fields, including physics, and particularly cosmology, where data analysis plays a crucial role in problem-solving. In this work, a non-parametric regression method with Gaussian processes is presented along with several applications to reconstruct some cosmological observables, such as the deceleration parameter and the dark energy equation of state, in order to contribute with some information that helps to clarify the behavior of the Universe. It was found that the results are consistent with $\Lambda$CDM and the predicted value of the Hubble parameter at redshift zero is $H_{0}=68.798\pm 6.340(1\sigma) \text{ km}\text{ Mpc}^{-1} \text{ s}^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Evidence for relativistic Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect in Planck CMB maps with an average electron-gas temperature of $T_{\rm e}\simeq 5$ keV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stacking the public Planck CMB temperature maps (NILC, SMICA, SEVEM, or Commander) on galaxy clusters from Planck catalogues reveals substantial residual contamination from thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich (tSZ) emission. Unexpectedly, stacking "tSZ-free" CMB maps, like the Planck SMICA-noSZ CMB map or the Planck Constrained ILC (CILC) CMB map, still shows noticeable non-zero residual contamination from galaxy clusters. We demonstrate that this persisting residual stems from neglected relativistic SZ (rSZ) corrections in the CMB map estimation. Employing the component separation method outlined in Remazeilles &amp; Chluba (2020) on Planck data, we map the rSZ first-order moment field $y(T_{\rm e}-\bar{T}_{\rm e})$ over the sky for different pivot temperatures $\bar{T}_{\rm e}$ ranging from 2 to 10 keV. Stacking these $y(T_{\rm e}-\bar{T}_{\rm e})$-maps on Planck galaxy clusters exhibits either an intensity decrement or increment at the centre, contingent upon whether $\bar{T}_{\rm e}$ is above or below the actual ensemble-averaged cluster temperature $T_{\rm e}$. For the pivot value $\bar{T}_{\rm e}=5$ keV, a vanishing intensity is observed in the stacked Planck $y(T_{\rm e}-\bar{T}_{\rm e})$-map, enabling us to infer the average gas temperature of $T_{\rm e}\simeq 5$ keV for the Planck galaxy clusters. Building upon this finding, we revisit the Planck tSZ-free CMB map by deprojecting the complete rSZ emission using CILC, assuming an rSZ spectrum with $T_{\rm e} = 5$ keV. Our new, rSZ-free Planck CMB map, when stacked on Planck galaxy clusters, shows a clear cancellation of the residual SZ contamination in contrast to prior (non-relativistic) tSZ-free Planck CMB maps. Our map-based approach provides compelling evidence for an average temperature of the Planck galaxy clusters of $T_{\rm e} = 4.9 \pm 2.6$ keV using the rSZ effect.</description>

      <title>Optical galaxy cluster mock catalogs with realistic projection effects: validations with the SDSS redMaPPer clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy clusters identified in optical imaging surveys suffer from projection effects: physically unassociated galaxies along a cluster's line of sight can be counted as its members and boost the observed richness (the number of cluster members). To model the impact projection on cluster cosmology analyses, we apply a halo occupation distribution model to N-body simulations to simulate the red galaxies contributing to cluster members, and we use the number of galaxies in a cylinder along the line-of-sight (counts-in-cylinders) to model the impact of projection on cluster richness. We compare three projection models: uniform, quadratic, and Gaussian, and we convert between them by matching their effective cylinder volumes. We validate our mock catalogs using SDSS redMaPPer data vectors, including cluster abundance vs. richness, stacked lensing signal, spectroscopic redshift distribution of member galaxies, and richness re-measured on a redshift grid. We find the former two are insensitive to the projection model, while the latter two favor a quadratic projection model with a width of 180 Mpc/h (equivalent to the volume of a uniform model with a width of 100 Mpc/h and a Gaussian model with a width of 110 Mpc/h, or a Gaussian redshift error of 0.04). Our framework provides an efficient and flexible way to model optical cluster data vectors, paving the way for a simulation-based joint analysis for clusters, galaxies, and shear.</description>

      <title>Constraining cosmology with N-body simulations for future spectroscopic galaxy surveys at $2\leq z\leq 3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determining the spatial curvature ($\Omega_k$) independent of cosmic microwave background observations plays a key role in revealing the physics of the early universe. The Hubble tension is one of the most serious issues in modern cosmology. We investigate halo catalogs identified from $N$-body simulations at $z=2$ and 3, mimicking high-redshift galaxy surveys. We measure redshift-space correlation functions of halos from the two snapshots. We detect clear features of baryon acoustic oscillations and redshift-space distortions. We find that we can obtain a few percent constraints on both the geometric distances and growth of structure at the distant universe in future surveys. By taking into account the information of the underlying matter power spectrum, we demonstrate that we can also achieve constraint on the Hubble constant $H_0$ with a few percent as well as the spatial curvature with $|\Omega_k|\lesssim 0.1$ by observing galaxies with the number density with $\bar{n}_{\rm g}\simeq 10^{-4} (~h^3{\rm ~Mpc}^{-3})$. Our analysis provides a timely forecast for the upcoming spectroscopic surveys, which target emission line galaxy or dusty star-forming galaxy samples.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Hole Mergers as Probes of Dark Matter in Galactic Center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) from the early Universe that can contribute to dark matter (DM) abundance have been linked to gravitational wave observations. Super-massive black holes (SMBHs) at the centers of galaxies are expected to modify distribution of DM in their vicinity, and can result in highly concentrated DM spikes. We revisit PBH merger rates in the presence of DM spikes, tracking their history. We find novel peaked structure in the redshift-evolution of PBH merger rates at low redshifts around $z \sim 5$. These effects are generic and are present for distinct PBH mass functions and spike profiles, and also can be linked to peaked structure in redshift evolution of star formation rate. Redshift evolution characteristics of PBH merger rates can be distinguished from astrophysical black hole contributions and observable with gravitational waves, enabling them to serve as probes of DM in galactic centers.</description>

      <title>On the nature of the missing mass of galaxy clusters in MOND: the view from gravitational lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) has long been known to fail in galaxy clusters, implying a residual missing mass problem for clusters in this context. Here, using mass profiles derived from strong- and weak-lensing shear, as well as magnification data, for a sample of clusters from the CLASH survey, we characterize the density profile of this residual MOND missing mass in the central Mpc of galaxy clusters. In line with results obtained in the literature from the hydrostatic equilibrium of hot gas, we find that an inner constant density core and an outer power-law slope between $-4$ and $-6$ provides a good description within $\sim 1$ Mpc. We also show that the data in the central parts of clusters can be even better represented by a `dark mass-follows-gas' profile with an exponential cut-off. Clusters with X-ray emitting gas masses $M_\text{gas} \geq 10^{14}\, {\rm M}_\odot$ display a remarkable uniformity for the missing-to-hot-gas density ratio in the inner parts, of order $\sim$10, and for the exponential cut-off radius, of order $\sim 450$ kpc. Clusters with lower observed gas mass display larger and more scattered values for both the density ratio and cut-off radius. These lensing results can in principle serve as a crucible for relativistic theories of MOND in galaxy clusters, or for any other tentative hypothesis regarding the nature of the clusters residual missing mass in the MOND context.</description>

      <title>The three phases of self-gravitating scalar field ground states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is generally assumed that scalar field dark matter halos would contain solitonic cores -- spherically symmetric ground state configurations -- at their centers. This is especially interesting in the case of ultralight dark matter (ULDM), where the solitons sizes are on the order of galaxies. In this work, we show that the paradigm of a spherically symmetric soliton embedded in the center of each halo is not universally valid in a scenario with multiple interacting scalar fields. In particular, sufficiently strong repulsive interspecies interactions make the fields immiscible. In such models, the ground state configuration can fall into a number of different phases that depend on the fields' relative densities, masses, and interaction strengths. This raises the possibility that the inner regions of ULDM halos are more complex and diverse than previously assumed.</description>

      <title>Matter power spectrum induced by primordial magnetic fields: from the linear to the non-linear regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linear theory predicts that primordial magnetic fields (PMFs) enhance the matter power spectrum on small scales. However, the linear approximation breaks down on sufficiently small scales where PMF-induced baryon perturbations back-react onto the magnetic fields. Previous studies assumed that the baryon power spectrum would be sharply suppressed in this non-linear regime, based on arguments related to the magnetic Jeans scale. For the first time, we perform dedicated magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations to investigate the transition from the linear to the non-linear regime. Our simulations confirm the expected linear behavior on large scales. In the non-linear regime, however, we find that the dimensionless baryon power spectrum saturates to an $\mathcal{O}(1)$ value, which contrasts with previous analytical expectations. Additionally, our results show that several past studies overestimated the total matter power spectrum by orders of magnitude near the transition to non-linearity. Thus, the results presented in this work are useful to obtain more accurate constraints on PMFs from structure formation processes and/or different tracers of cosmic structures.</description>

      <title>All the Little Things in Abell 2744: $&gt;$1000 Gravitationally Lensed Dwarf Galaxies at $z=0-9$ from JWST NIRCam Grism Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dwarf galaxies hold the key to crucial frontiers of astrophysics, however, their faintness renders spectroscopy challenging. Here we present the JWST Cycle 2 survey, All the Little Things (ALT, PID 3516), which is designed to seek late-forming Pop III stars and the drivers of reionization at $z\sim6-7$. ALT has acquired the deepest NIRCam grism spectroscopy yet (7-27 hr), at JWST's most sensitive wavelengths (3-4 $\mu$m), covering the powerful lensing cluster Abell 2744. Over the same 30 arcmin$^2$, ALT's ultra-deep F070W+F090W imaging ($\sim$30 mag) enables selection of very faint sources at $z&gt;6$. We demonstrate the success of ALT's novel ``butterfly" mosaic to solve spectral confusion and contamination, and introduce the ``Allegro" method for emission line identification. By collecting spectra for every source in the field of view, ALT has measured precise ($R\sim1600$) redshifts for 1630 sources at $z=0.2-8.5$. This includes one of the largest samples of distant dwarf galaxies: [1015, 475, 50] sources less massive than the SMC, Fornax, and Sculptor with $\log(M_{*}/M_{\odot})&lt;$[8.5, 7.5, 6.5]. We showcase ALT's discovery space with: (i) spatially resolved spectra of lensed clumps in galaxies as faint as $M_{\rm{UV}}\sim-15$; (ii) large-scale clustering -- overdensities at $z$=[2.50, 2.58, 3.97, 4.30, 5.66, 5.77, 6.33] hosting massive galaxies with striking Balmer breaks; (iii) small-scale clustering -- a system of satellites around a Milky Way analog at $z\sim6$; (iv) spectroscopically confirmed multiple images that help constrain the lensing model underlying all science in this legacy field; (v) sensitive star-formation maps based on dust-insensitive tracers such as Pa$\alpha$; (vi) direct spectroscopic discovery of rare sources such as AGN with ionized outflows.

      <title>The next step in galaxy cluster strong lensing: modeling the surface brightness of multiply-imaged sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Overcoming both modeling and computational challenges, we present, for the first time, the extended surface-brightness distribution model of a strongly-lensed source in a complex galaxy-cluster-scale system. We exploit the high-resolution Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging and extensive Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer spectroscopy to build an extended strong-lensing model, in a full multi-plane formalism, of SDSS J1029+2623, a lens cluster at $z = 0.588$ with three multiple images of a background quasar ($z = 2.1992$). Going beyond typical cluster strong-lensing modeling techniques, we include as observables both the positions of 26 pointlike multiple images from seven background sources, spanning a wide redshift range between 1.02 and 5.06, and the extended surface-brightness distribution of the strongly-lensed quasar host galaxy, over $\sim78000$ HST pixels. In addition, we model the light distribution of seven objects, angularly close to the strongly-lensed quasar host, over $\sim9300$ HST pixels. Our extended lens model reproduces well both the observed intensity and morphology of the quasar host galaxy in the HST F160W band (with a 0''.03 pixel scale). The reconstructed source shows a single, compact, and smooth surface-brightness distribution, for which we estimate an intrinsic magnitude of 23.3 $\pm$ 0.1 in the F160W band and a half-light radius of (2.39 $\pm$ 0.03) kpc. The increased number of observables enables the accurate determination of the total mass of line-of-sight halos lying angularly close to the extended arc. This work paves the way for a new generation of galaxy cluster strong-lens models, where additional, complementary lensing observables are directly incorporated as model constraints.</description>

      <title>Diffusive interactions between photons and electrons: an application to cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The gradient force is the conservative component of many types of forces exerted by light on particles. When it is derived from a potential, there is no heat transferred to the particle interacting with the light field. However, most theoretical descriptions of the gradient force use simplified configurations of the light field and particle interactions which overlook small amounts of heating. It is known that quantum fluctuations contribute to a very small but measurable momentum diffusion of atoms and a corresponding increase in their temperature. This paper examines the contribution to momentum diffusion from a gradient force described as a quantum interaction between electron wave packets and a classical electromagnetic field. Stimulated transfers of photons between interfering light beams produce a small amount of heating that is difficult to detect in laboratory experiments. However the solar corona, with its thermal electrons irradiated by an intense electromagnetic field, provides ideal conditions for such a measurement. Heating from stimulated transfers is calculated to contribute a large fraction of the observed coronal heating. Furthermore, the energy removed from the light field produces a wavelength shift of its spectrum as it travels through free electrons. Theory predicts a stimulated transfer redshift comparable to the redshift of distant objects observed in astronomy.</description>

      <title>Detection of Gamma-ray Halos around Nearby Late-type Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Various theoretical models predict existence of extended gamma-ray halo around normal galaxies, that could be produced by interactions of cosmic rays with the circumgalactic medium or by annihilation or decay of hypothetical dark matter particles. Observations of the closest massive galaxy M31 also corroborate this possibility. In this study we search for gamma-ray emission from the galaxies within 15 Mpc at energies higher than 2 GeV and try to assess its spatial extension. We use the latest catalog of local galaxies and apply a simple yet robust method of aperture photometry. By imposing the mass, energy, and spatial cuts, we selected a set of 16 late-type galaxies and found a statistically significant excess above the background level ($p-\mathrm{val}=4.8\times10^{-9}$). More importantly, our analysis shows that this excess can be ascribed to an extended source with a radius $\sim 0.3^\circ$ rather than a point-like one. In contrast, 6 early-type galaxies, which satisfied the same cuts, showed no excess. Our results are supported by the stacking likelihood analysis technique. The difference between the late- and early-type galaxies and a rather irregular shape of the extended source that we found indicate that this high-energy emission is not due to DM annihilation/decay but rather originates from cosmic ray interaction with the circumgalactic medium.</description>

      <title>Constructing Viable Interacting Dark Matter and Dark Energy Models: A Dynamical Systems Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the evolution of $k=-1$ FLRW cosmological models for two interacting Dark Matter-Dark Energy Models using dynamical system analysis. Since we are interested in late time evolution, the sign of the interaction term is chosen such that it facilitates the transfer of energy from dark matter to dark energy. We also explore the $k=0$ invariant subspace of these models. We find that both these models have sectors which have a stable fixed point where we can recover an accelerating universe with a negative equation of state. This indicates these can be viable models for our universe. We also rule out certain sectors of these models because they do not give the correct late time observational features. We observe that although we start with a dust-like Dark Matter, its effective equation of state evolves due to its interaction with Dark Energy. As a result, the Dark Matter can display features of stiff matter and exotic matter in the course of evolution.</description>

      <title>Improved quantum algorithm for calculating eigenvalues of differential operators and its application to estimating the decay rate of the perturbation distribution tail in stochastic inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum algorithms for scientific computing and their applications have been studied actively. In this paper, we propose a quantum algorithm for estimating the first eigenvalue of a differential operator $\mathcal{L}$ on $\mathbb{R}^d$ and its application to cosmic inflation theory. A common approach for this eigenvalue problem involves applying the finite-difference discretization to $\mathcal{L}$ and computing the eigenvalues of the resulting matrix, but this method suffers from the curse of dimensionality, namely the exponential complexity with respect to $d$. Our first contribution is the development of a new quantum algorithm for this task, leveraging recent quantum singular value transformation-based methods. Given a trial function that overlaps well with the eigenfunction, our method runs with query complexity scaling as $\widetilde{O}(d^3/\epsilon^2)$ with $d$ and estimation accuracy $\epsilon$, which is polynomial in $d$ and shows an improvement over existing quantum algorithms. Then, we consider the application of our method to a problem in a theoretical framework for cosmic inflation known as stochastic inflation, specifically calculating the eigenvalue of the adjoint Fokker--Planck operator, which is related to the decay rate of the tail of the probability distribution for the primordial density perturbation. We numerically see that in some cases, simple trial functions overlap well with the first eigenfunction, indicating our method is promising for this problem.</description>

      <title>LMC Calls, Milky Way Halo Answers: Disentangling the Effects of the MW--LMC Interaction on Stellar Stream Populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The infall of the LMC into the Milky Way (MW) has dynamical implications throughout the MW's dark matter halo. We study the impact of this merger on the statistical properties of populations of simulated stellar streams. Specifically, we investigate the radial and on-sky angular dependence of stream perturbations caused by the direct effect of stream-LMC interactions and/or the response of the MW dark matter halo. We use a time-evolving MW--LMC simulation described by basis function expansions to simulate streams. We quantify the degree of perturbation using a set of stream property statistics including the misalignment of proper motions with the stream track. In the outer halo, direct stream--LMC interactions produce a statistically significant effect, boosting the fraction of misaligned proper motions by ~25% compared to the model with no LMC. Moreover, there is on-sky angular dependence of stream perturbations:~the highest fractions of perturbed streams coincide with the same on-sky quadrant as the present-day LMC location. In the inner halo, the MW halo dipole response primarily drives stream perturbations, but it remains uncertain whether this is a detectable signature distinct from the LMC's influence. For the fiducial MW--LMC model, we find agreement between the predicted fraction of streams with significantly misaligned proper motions, $\bar{\vartheta}&gt;10^{\circ}$, and Dark Energy Survey data. Finally, we predict this fraction for the Vera Rubin Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) footprint. Using LSST data will improve our constraints on dark matter models and LMC properties as it is sensitive to both.</description>

      <title>Looking for WIMPs through the neutrino fogs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the expected sensitivity of large-scale xenon detectors to Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs). Assuming current primary noise sources can be mitigated, we find that with the present discrimination power between nuclear and electron recoils, the experimental sensitivity is limited not only by atmospheric neutrinos' nuclear recoils (''nuclear recoil neutrino fog'') but also by solar neutrinos' electron-recoil events (''electron recoil neutrino fog''). While this is known by experimentalists, it is often missed or misunderstood by theorists, and we therefore emphasize this effect. We set up a realistic detector simulation to quantify the contamination of the WIMP signal from both these neutrino backgrounds. We observe that the electron-recoil background remains significant even for signal rates exceeding those of atmospheric neutrinos, as predicted by most electroweak WIMP candidates. We update the projections for the required exposure to exclude/discover a given electroweak WIMP, streamlining the computation of their signal rates and uncertainties. We show that all of the real WIMPs with zero hypercharge can be excluded (discovered) with a 50 tonne year (300 tonne year) exposure. A similar exposure will allow to probe a large portion of the viable parameter space for complex WIMP with non-zero hypercharge.</description>

      <title>Parameter free Hubble constant from the quadruply lensed quasar SDSS J1004 + 4112</title>

Abstract: We present a free-form lens model for the multiply lensed quasar in the galaxy cluster SDSS J$1004+4112$. Our lens model makes minimal assumptions about the distribution of mass in the lens plane. We pay particular attention to the model uncertainties on the predicted time delay, originating from the particular configuration of model variables. Taking into account this uncertainty, we obtain a value of the Hubble constant of $H_0= 74^{+9}_{-13}$km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, consistent with independent recent estimates. The predicted time delay between the central image E and image C (the first to arrive), is $\Delta T_{E-C}=3200\pm 200$ days. Future measurements of $\Delta T_{E-C}$ will allow to impose a tighter constrain on $H_0$ from this cluster-QSO system.</description>

Abstract: We provide a new scaling relation between $Y_{\text{SZ}}$, the integrated Sunyaev-Zeldovich signal and $M_{500}^{Y_{\text{X}}}$, the cluster mass derived from X-ray observations, using a sample of clusters from the Planck Early Sunyaev-Zeldovich (ESZ) catalogue observed in X-rays by Chandra, and compare it to the results of the Planck collaboration obtained from XMM-Newton observations of a subsample of the ESZ. We calibrated a mass bias on a subset of the Planck cosmological cluster sample using published weak-lensing data from CCCP and MENeaCS, for the new scaling relation as well as that from the Planck collaboration. We propose a novel method to account for selection effects and find a mass bias of $(1-b)=0.89\pm0.04$ for the Chandra-calibrated scaling relation, and $(1-b)=0.76\pm0.04$ for the XMM-Newton-calibrated scaling relation. We apply the scaling relations we derived to the full Planck cosmological cluster sample and obtain identical cosmological constraints regardless of the X-ray sample used, with $\sigma_8 =0.77\pm0.02$, $\Omega_m=0.31\pm0.02$, and $S_8= \sigma_8 \sqrt{\Omega_m / 0.3}=0.78\pm0.02$. We also provide constraints with a redshift evolution of the scaling relation fitted from the data instead of fixing it to the self-similar value. We find a redshift evolution significantly deviating from the self-similar value, leading to a higher value of $S_8=0.81\pm0.02$. We compare our results to those from various cosmological probes, and find that our $S_8$ constraints are competitive with the tightest constraints from the literature. When assuming a self-similar redshift evolution, our constraints are in agreement with most late-time probes and in tension with constraints from the CMB primary anisotropies. When relaxing the assumption of redshift evolution and fitting it to the data, we find no significant tension with results from either late-time probes or the CMB.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03220v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present optimal Bayesian field-level cosmological constraints from nonlinear tracers of the large-scale structure, specifically the amplitude $\sigma_8$ of linear matter fluctuations inferred from rest-frame simulated dark matter halos in a comoving volume of $8\,(h^{-1}\mathrm{Gpc})^3$. Our constraint on $\sigma_8$ is entirely due to nonlinear information, and obtained by explicitly sampling the initial conditions along with bias and noise parameters via a Lagrangian EFT-based forward model, LEFTfield. The comparison with a simulation-based inference analysis employing the power spectrum and bispectrum -- likewise using the LEFTfield forward model -- shows that, when including precisely the same modes of the same data up to $k_{\mathrm{max}}= 0.10\,h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ ($0.12\,h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$), the field-level approach yields a factor of 3.5 (5.2) improvement on the $\sigma_8$ constraint, from 20.0% to 5.7% (17.0% to 3.3%). This study provides direct insights into cosmological information encoded in galaxy clustering beyond low-order $n$-point functions.</description>

Abstract: The $James \ Webb \ Space \ Telescope \ (JWST)$ recently reported a large population of UV luminous galaxies at high redshifts, $ z &gt; 10$, as well as Lyman-$\alpha$ emitting (LAE) galaxies out to $z \sim 11$. We use the observed UV luminosities along with a data-driven approach at lower redshifts to place constraints on the observability of the intergalactic Lyman-$\alpha$ intensity, scattered in the form of Loeb-Rybicki haloes, during the pre-reionization and reionization epochs ($z \sim 9-16$). We forecast the sensitivity and resolution required to detect these intergalactic haloes, finding that individual haloes with LAE luminosities $&gt; 10^{43}$ ergs/s are detectable at a few sigma level at $z \lesssim 9$, while stacking of $\sim 10$ haloes is expected to result in detections out to $z \sim 16$. Finding these haloes is expected to shed light on the neutral intergalactic hydrogen during cosmic reionization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13871v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Primordial black holes still represent a viable candidate for a significant fraction, if not for the totality, of dark matter. If these compact objects have masses of order tens of solar masses, their coalescence can be observed by current and future ground-based gravitational wave detectors. Therefore, finding new gravitational wave signatures associated with this dark matter candidate can either lead to their detection or help constraining their abundance. In this work we consider the phenomenology of primordial black holes in dense environments, in particular globular clusters. We model the internal structure of globular clusters in a semi-analytical fashion, and we derive the expected merger rate. We show that, if primordial black holes are present in globular clusters, their contribution to the GW background can be comparable to other well-known channels, such as early- and late-time binaries, thus enhancing the detectability prospects of primordial black holes and demonstrating that this contribution needs to be taken into account.</description>

      <title>Observational test for $f(Q)$ gravity with weak gravitational lensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00242v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we confront a class of $f(Q)$ gravity models with observational data of galaxy-galaxy lensing. Specifically, we consider the $f(Q)$ gravity models containing a small quadratic correction when compared with General Relativity (GR), and quantify this correction by a model parameter $\alpha$. To derive the observational constraints, we start by extracting the spherically symmetric solutions which correspond to the deviations from the Schwarzschild solution that depends on the model parameter in a two-fold way, i.e., a renormalized mass and a new term proportional to $r^{-2}$. Then, we calculate the effective lensing potential, the deflection angle, the shear component, and the effective Excess Surface Density (ESD) profile. After that, we employ the group catalog and shape catalog from the SDSS DR7 for the lens and source samples respectively. Moreover, we handle the off-center radius as a free parameter and constrain it using the MCMC. Concerning the deviation parameter from GR we derive $\alpha=1.202^{+0.277}_{-0.179}\times 10^{-6} {\rm Mpc}^{-2}$ at 1 $\sigma$ confidence level, and then compare the fitting efficiency with the standard $\Lambda$CDM paradigm by applying the AIC and BIC information criteria. Our results indicate that the $f(Q)$ corrections alongside off-center effects yield a scenario that is slightly favored.</description>

      <title>Modeling optical systematics for the Taurus CMB experiment</title>

Abstract: We simulate a variety of optical systematics for Taurus, a balloon-borne cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarisation experiment, to assess their impact on large-scale E-mode polarisation measurements and constraints of the optical depth to reionisation {\tau}. We model a one-month flight of Taurus from Wanaka, New Zealand aboard a super-pressure balloon (SPB). We simulate night-time scans of both the CMB and dust foregrounds in the 150GHz band, one of Taurus's four observing bands. We consider a variety of possible systematics that may affect Taurus's observations, including non-gaussian beams, pointing reconstruction error, and half-wave plate (HWP) non-idealities. For each of these, we evaluate the residual power in the difference between maps simulated with and without the systematic, and compare this to the expected signal level corresponding to Taurus's science goals. Our results indicate that most of the HWP-related systematics can be mitigated to be smaller than sample variance by calibrating with Planck's TT spectrum and using an achromatic HWP model, with a preference for five layers of sapphire to ensure good systematic control. However, additional beam characterization will be required to mitigate far-sidelobe pickup from dust on larger scales.</description>

      <title>Third-order corrections to the slow-roll expansion: calculation and constraints with Planck, ACT, SPT, and BICEP/Keck</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05210v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the primordial power spectra (PPS) of scalar and tensor perturbations, derived through the slow-roll approximation. By solving the Mukhanov-Sasaki equation and the tensor perturbation equation with Green's function techniques, we extend the PPS calculations to third-order corrections, providing a comprehensive perturbative expansion in terms of slow-roll parameters. We investigate the accuracy of the analytic predictions with the numerical solutions of the perturbation equations for a selection of single-field slow-roll inflationary models. We derive the constraints on the Hubble flow functions $\epsilon_i$ from Planck, ACT, SPT, and BICEP/Keck data. We find an upper bound $\epsilon_1 \lesssim 0.002$ at 95\% CL dominated by BICEP/Keck data and robust to all the different combination of datasets. We derive the constraint $\epsilon_2 \simeq 0.031 \pm 0.004$ at 68\% confidence level (CL) from the combination of Planck data and late-time probes such as baryon acoustic oscillations, redshift space distortions, and supernovae data at first order in the slow-roll expansion. The uncertainty on $\epsilon_2$ gets larger including second- and third-order corrections, allowing for a non-vanishing running and running of the running respectively, leading to $\epsilon_2 \simeq 0.034 \pm 0.007$ at 68\% CL. We find $\epsilon_3 \simeq 0.1 \pm 0.4$ at 95\% CL both at second and at third order in the slow-roll expansion of the spectra. $\epsilon_4$ remains always unconstrained. The combination of Planck and SPT data leads to slightly tighter constraints on $\epsilon_2$ and $\epsilon_3$. On the contrary, the combination of Planck data with ACT measurements, which point to higher values of the scalar spectral index compared to Planck findings, leads to shifts in the means and maximum likelihood values for $\epsilon_2$ and $\epsilon_3$.</description>

      <title>Forecasts for Helium Reionization Detection with Fast Radio Bursts in the Era of Square Kilometre Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01543v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The observed dispersion measures (DMs) of fast radio bursts (FRBs) are a good indicator of the amount of ionized material along the propagation paths. In this work, we present a forecast of He II reionization detection using the DM and redshift measurements of FRBs from the upcoming Square Kilometre Array (SKA). Assuming a model of the Universe in which He II reionization occurred at a specific redshift $z_{\rm re}$, we analyze what extent the signal-to-noise ratio ($\mathrm{S/N}$) for the detection of the amplitude of reionization can be achieved in the era of SKA. Using $10^{6}$ mock FRB data from a one-year observation of the second phase of SKA, we find that the $\mathrm{S/N}$ for detecting He II reionization can approach the $32-50\sigma$ level and the uncertainty on the reionization redshift can be constrained to be $\sigma(z_{\rm re})\approx 0.022-0.031$, depending on the assumed FRB redshift distribution. This is the first quantitative analysis on the detection significance of He II reionization in the SKA era. We also examine the influence of different fiducial $z_{\rm re}$ values, finding that this effect has a modest impact on the forecasts. Our results demonstrate the potentially remarkable capability of SKA-era FRBs in constraining the epoch of He II reionization.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Structure Formation: the Early Emergence of Massive Galaxies and Clusters of Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17930v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Galaxies in the early universe appear to have grown too big too fast, assembling into massive, monolithic objects more rapidly than anticipated in the hierarchical $\Lambda$CDM structure formation paradigm. The available photometric data are consistent with there being a population of massive galaxies that form early ($z \gtrsim 10$) and quench rapidly over a short ($\lesssim 1$ Gyr) timescale, consistent with the traditional picture for the evolution of giant elliptical galaxies. Similarly, kinematic observations as a function of redshift show that massive spirals and their scaling relations were in place at early times. Explaining the early emergence of massive galaxies requires either an extremely efficient conversion of baryons into stars at $z&gt;10$ or a more rapid assembly of baryons than anticipated in $\Lambda$CDM. The latter possibility was explicitly predicted in advance by MOND. We discuss some further predictions of MOND, such as the early emergence of clusters of galaxies and early reionization.</description>

      <title>New Integrable Chiral Cosmological Models with Two Scalar Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12732v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct integrable chiral cosmological models with two scalar fields and potentials represented in terms of hyperbolic functions. Using the conformal transformation of the metric and the corresponding models with induced gravity terms, we obtain the general solutions in the spatially flat, open and closed Friedmann universes and the corresponding integrals of motion. The obtained general solutions can be written in terms of the Jacobi elliptic functions of the conformal time.</description>

      <title>Axion signals from neutron star populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19028v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutron stars provide a powerful probe of axion dark matter, especially in higher frequency ranges where there remain fewer laboratory constraints. Populations of neutron stars near the Galactic Centre have been proposed as a means to place strong constraints on axion dark matter. One downside of this approach is that there are very few direct observations of neutron stars in this region, introducing uncertainties in the total number of neutron stars in this ``invisible" population at the Galactic Centre, whose size must be inferred through birth rate modelling. We suggest this number could also be reduced due to stellar dynamics carrying stars away from the Galactic Centre via large kick velocities at birth. We attempt to circumvent the uncertainty on the Galactic Centre population size by modelling the axion signal from better understood populations outside the Galactic Centre using {\tt PsrPopPy} which is normalised against pulsar observations. We consider lower-frequency, wider-angle searches for this signal via a range of instruments including MeerKAT and SKA-low but find that the sensitivity is not competitive with existing constraints. Finally, returning to the Galactic Centre, we compare populations to single objects as targets for axion detection. Using the latest modelling of axion-photon conversion in the Galactic Centre magnetar, we conclude that within astrophysical uncertainties, the Galactic Centre population and the magnetar could give comparable sensitivities to axion dark matter, suggesting one should continue to search for both signals in future surveys.</description>

      <title>Self-interacting scalar dark matter around binary black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01937v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves can provide crucial insights about the environments in which black holes live. In this work, we use numerical relativity simulations to study the behaviour of self-interacting scalar (wave-like) dark matter clouds accreting onto isolated and binary black holes. We find that repulsive self-interactions smoothen the ``spike'' of an isolated black hole and saturate the density. Attractive self-interactions enhance the growth and result in more cuspy profiles, but can become unstable and undergo explosions akin to the superradiant bosenova that reduce the local cloud density. We quantify the impact of self-interactions on an equal-mass black hole merger by computing the dephasing of the gravitational-wave signal for a range of couplings. We find that repulsive self-interactions saturate the density of the cloud, thereby reducing the dephasing. For attractive self-interactions, the dephasing may be larger, but if these interactions dominate prior to the merger, the dark matter can undergo bosenova during the inspiral phase, disrupting the cloud and subsequently reducing the dephasing.</description>
