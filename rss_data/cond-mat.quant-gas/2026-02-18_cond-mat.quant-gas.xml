      <title>Engineering interactions shape in resonantly driven bosonic gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In systems with fast periodic driving, there are special subsets of (resonant) states, which behavior can be described with effective, time-independent Hamiltonian in a rotating reference frame. Here, we show that experimentally feasible system of ultracold bosonic atoms on a ring with rapidly oscillating scattering length can be used to simulate time-independent two-component atomic mixture with exotic, long-range interactions.</description>

      <title>Stability of Bose-Fermi mixtures in two dimensions: a lowest-order constrained variational approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15598v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the problem of mechanical stability in two-dimensional Bose-Fermi mixtures at zero temperature, focusing on systems with a tunable Bose-Fermi (BF) interaction and a weak but finite boson-boson (BB) repulsion. The analysis is carried out within the framework of the lowest-order constrained variational (LOCV) approach, which allows for a non-perturbative treatment of strong interspecies correlations while retaining analytical transparency. The BF interaction is modeled by a properly regularized attractive contact potential, enabling the exploration of both the attractive and repulsive energy branches. We determine the minimal BB repulsion required to ensure mechanical stability of the mixture by evaluating the inverse compressibility matrix over the full range of BF coupling strengths, within the domain of validity of the LOCV approximation. The interaction contribution to the energy is benchmarked against available experimental data and Quantum Monte Carlo results in the single-impurity limit, showing good agreement. Our analysis reveals how the critical BB coupling depends on interaction strength, density imbalance, and mass ratio. In particular, we find that mixtures with equal boson and fermion masses exhibit enhanced stability, requiring the smallest BB repulsion to prevent mechanical instability. In this case, a relatively small BB interaction is sufficient to stabilize attractive mixtures for all values of the BF interaction. These results provide a theoretical framework for assessing stability conditions in experimentally realizable two-dimensional Bose-Fermi mixtures with tunable interactions.</description>

      <title>Signatures of Quantum Phase Transitions in Driven Dissipative Spin Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20518v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Open driven quantum systems have defined a powerful paradigm of nonequilibrium phases and phase transitions; however, quantum phase transitions are generically not expected in this setting due to the decohering effect of dissipation. In this Letter, we consider a quantum Ising model subject to bulk dissipation (at rate $\Gamma$) and show that, although the correlation length remains finite (hence no phase transition), it develops a pronounced peak close to the ground-state quantum critical point. While standard techniques fail in this regime, we develop a versatile analytical approach that becomes exact with vanishing dissipation ($\Gamma\to 0$ but finite $\Gamma t$). On a technical level, our approach builds on previous work where the state of the system is described by a slowly evolving generalized Gibbs ensemble that accounts for the integrability of the Hamiltonian while treating dissipation perturbatively. Finally, we demonstrate a kind of universality in that integrability-breaking perturbations of the Hamiltonian lead to the same behavior. To this end, we first show that the steady state of a chaotic Ising Hamiltonian under local Markovian dissipation that preserves the Ising symmetry, and in the limit $\Gamma \to 0$, is identical to that of quench dynamics in the absence of dissipation. This intriguing connection then allows us to draw on recent findings about quantum phase transition signatures in quench dynamics.</description>

      <title>Quasi-particle residue and charge of the one-dimensional Fermi polaron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17558v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a mobile impurity coupled to an ideal Fermi gas in one spatial dimension through an attractive contact interaction. We calculate the quasi-particle residue $Z$ exactly, based on Bethe Ansatz and diagrammatic Monte Carlo methods, and with varational Ansatz up to one particle-hole excitation of the Fermi sea. We find that the exact quasi-particle residue vanishes in the thermodynamic limit as a power law in the number of particles, consistent with the Luttinger-liquid paradigm and the breakdown of Fermi-liquid theory. The variational Ansatz, however, predicts a finite value of $Z$, even in the thermodynamic limit. We also study how the presence of the impurity affects the density of the spin-up sea by calculating the pair correlation function. Subtracting the homogeneous background and integrating over all distances gives the charge $Q$. This charge turns out to grow continuously from 0 at zero coupling to 1 in the strong-coupling limit. The varational Ansatz predicts $Q=0$ at all couplings. So, although the variational Ansatz has been shown to be remarkably accurate for the energy and the effective mass, it fails even qualitatively when predicting $Z$ and the pair correlation function in the thermodynamic limit.</description>

      <title>Exact kinetic propagators for coherent state complex Langevin simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11057v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce and benchmark an improved algorithm for complex Langevin simulations of bosonic coherent state path integrals. Our approach utilizes a Strang splitting of the imaginary-time propagator rather than the conventional linear-order Taylor expansion, allowing us to construct an action that incorporates higher-order terms at negligible computational cost. The resulting algorithm enjoys guaranteed linear stability independent of the imaginary-time discretization, enabling more resource-efficient simulations. We demonstrate this improved performance for single-species bosons and for two-component bosons with Rashba spin-orbit coupling.</description>

      <title>Mass-imbalance effect on the cluster formation in a one-dimensional Fermi gas with coexistent $s$- and $p$-wave interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14211v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the mass-imbalance effect on the clustering in a one-dimensional two-component Fermi gas with coexistent even- and odd-wave interactions resulting in different configurations of clustering phases. We obtain the solutions of both stable two- and three-body cluster states with different mass ratios and configurations by solving the corresponding variational equations. We numerically map out phase diagrams consisting of the $s$- and $p$-wave pairing phases, and {trimer} phase with different configurations, in a plane of $s$- and $p$-wave pairing strengths. Within the explored ranges of $s$- and $p$-wave pairing strengths, the in-vacuum three-body states are always more deeply bound than the two-body ones. While for the in-medium case, the Cooper {trimer} phase dominates over the pairing phases when both $s$- and $p$-wave interactions are moderately strong. There is also a competition between different clustering configurations of three-body clustering.</description>

      <title>The Ising dual-reflection interface: $\mathbb{Z}_4$ symmetry and Majorana strong zero modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06377v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate an interface in the transverse field quantum Ising chain connecting an ordered ferromagnetic phase and a disordered paramagnetic phase that are Kramers-Wannier duals of each other. Unlike prior studies focused on non-invertible defects, this interface exhibits a symmetry that combines Kramers-Wannier transformation with spatial reflection. We demonstrate that, under open boundary conditions, this setup gives rise to a discrete $\mathbb{Z}_4$ symmetry, encompassing the conventional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Ising parity as a subgroup, while in a closed geometry a non-invertible symmetry emerges. Using the Jordan-Wigner transformation, we map the spin chain onto a solvable quadratic Majorana fermion system. In this formulation, the $\mathbb{Z}_4$ symmetry is realized manifestly as a parity-dependent reflection with respect to a Majorana site, in contrast to the conventional reflection which mirrors with respect to the central link of the Majorana chain. Additionally, we construct Majorana strong zero modes that retain the $\mathbb{Z}_4$ symmetry, ensure degeneracies of all energy eigenstates, and are robust under generic local symmetry-preserving perturbations of the fermion model, including interactions. Finally, we develop quantum circuit realizations of our model paving the way towards the creation of exact Majorana strong zero modes with digital quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Fundamentals of Trapped Ions and Quantum Simulation of Chemical Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20412v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Trapped atomic ions are among the most advanced platforms for quantum simulation, computation, and metrology, offering long coherence times and precise, individual control over both internal and motional degrees of freedom. In this review, we present a pedagogical introduction to trapped-ion systems, covering the physics of ion trapping, qubit encodings, and laser-ion interactions. We explain how spin-dependent forces generated by light fields enable both analog and digital quantum simulations of spin and spin-boson models, as well as high-fidelity quantum logic gates. We then highlight an emerging frontier in the simulation of chemical dynamics, summarizing recent experiments that demonstrate the capability of trapped ions to simulate vibronic models and excitation-transfer processes. Finally, we outline future directions in quantum simulation and discuss open challenges in scaling up trapped-ion architectures.</description>

      <title>Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH) for off-diagonal matrix elements in integrable spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23602v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate off-diagonal matrix elements of local operators in integrable spin chains, focusing on the isotropic spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg chain ($XXX$ chain). We employ state-of-the-art Algebraic Bethe Ansatz results, which allow us to efficiently compute matrix elements of operators with support up to two sites between generic energy eigenstates. We consider both matrix elements between eigenstates that are in the same thermodynamic macrostate, as well as eigenstates that belong to different macrostates. In the former case, focusing on thermal states we numerically show that matrix elements are compatible with the exponential decay as $\exp(-L |{M}^{\scriptscriptstyle{\mathcal{O}}}_{ij}|)$. The probability distribution functions of ${M}_{ij}^{\scriptscriptstyle{\mathcal{O}}}$ depend on the observable and on the macrostate, and are well described by Gumbel distributions. On the other hand, matrix elements between eigenstates in different macrostates decay faster as $\exp(-|{M'}_{ij}^{\scriptscriptstyle{\mathcal{O}}}|L^2)$, with ${M'}_{ij}^{\scriptscriptstyle \mathcal{O}}$, again, compatible with a Gumbel distribution.</description>

      <title>Real-time collisions of fractional charges in a trapped-ion Jackiw-Rebbi field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07748v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose and analyze a trapped-ion quantum simulator of the Jackiw-Rebbi model, a paradigmatic quantum field theory in (1+1) dimensions where solitonic excitations of a scalar field can bind fermionic zero modes leading to fractionally-charged excitations. In our approach, the scalar field is a coarse-grained description of the planar zigzag ion displacements in the vicinity of a structural phase transition. The internal electronic states of the ions encode spins with interactions mediated by the transverse phonons and in-plane spin-phonon couplings with a zigzag pattern, which together correspond to a Yukawa-coupled Dirac field. Instead of assuming a fixed soliton background, we study the effect of back-reaction and quantum fluctuations on the coupled dynamics of the full fermion-boson system. We start by applying a Born-Oppenheimer approximation to obtain an effective Peierls-Nabarro potential for the topological kink, unveiling how the fermionic back-reaction can lead to localization of the kink. Beyond this limit, a truncated Wigner approximation combined with fermionic Gaussian states captures the quantum spreading and localization of a kink and kink-antikink scattering. Our results reveal how back-reaction and quantum fluctuations modify the stability and real-time evolution of fractionalized fermions, predicting experimentally accessible signatures in current trapped-ion architectures.</description>
