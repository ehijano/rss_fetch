      <title>GiantHunter: Accurate detection of giant virus in metagenomic data using reinforcement-learning and Monte Carlo tree search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivation: Nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses (NCLDVs) are notable for their large genomes and extensive gene repertoires, which contribute to their widespread environmental presence and critical roles in processes such as host metabolic reprogramming and nutrient cycling. Metagenomic sequencing has emerged as a powerful tool for uncovering novel NCLDVs in environmental samples. However, identifying NCLDV sequences in metagenomic data remains challenging due to their high genomic diversity, limited reference genomes, and shared regions with other microbes. Existing alignment-based and machine learning methods struggle with achieving optimal trade-offs between sensitivity and precision. Results: In this work, we present GiantHunter, a reinforcement learning-based tool for identifying NCLDVs from metagenomic data. By employing a Monte Carlo tree search strategy, GiantHunter dynamically selects representative non-NCLDV sequences as the negative training data, enabling the model to establish a robust decision boundary. Benchmarking on rigorously designed experiments shows that GiantHunter achieves high precision while maintaining competitive sensitivity, improving the F1-score by 10% and reducing computational cost by 90% compared to the second-best method. To demonstrate its real-world utility, we applied GiantHunter to 60 metagenomic datasets collected from six cities along the Yangtze River, located both upstream and downstream of the Three Gorges Dam. The results reveal significant differences in NCLDV diversity correlated with proximity to the dam, likely influenced by reduced flow velocity caused by the dam. These findings highlight the potential of GiantSeeker to advance our understanding of NCLDVs and their ecological roles in diverse environments.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Alphabet: Deep Signal Embedding for Enhanced DNA Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06188v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The emerging field of DNA storage employs strands of DNA bases (A/T/C/G) as a storage medium for digital information to enable massive density and durability. The DNA storage pipeline includes: (1) encoding the raw data into sequences of DNA bases; (2) synthesizing the sequences as DNA \textit{strands} that are stored over time as an unordered set; (3) sequencing the DNA strands to generate DNA \textit{reads}; and (4) deducing the original data. The DNA synthesis and sequencing stages each generate several independent error-prone duplicates of each strand which are then utilized in the final stage to reconstruct the best estimate for the original strand. Specifically, the reads are first \textit{clustered} into groups likely originating from the same strand (based on their similarity to each other), and then each group approximates the strand that led to the reads of that group. This work improves the DNA clustering stage by embedding it as part of the DNA sequencing. Traditional DNA storage solutions begin after the DNA sequencing process generates discrete DNA reads (A/T/C/G), yet we identify that there is untapped potential in using the raw signals generated by the Nanopore DNA sequencing machine before they are discretized into bases, a process known as \textit{basecalling}, which is done using a deep neural network. We propose a deep neural network that clusters these signals directly, demonstrating superior accuracy, and reduced computation times compared to current approaches that cluster after basecalling.</description>
