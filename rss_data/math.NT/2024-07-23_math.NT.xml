      <title>Tetragonal intermediate modular curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For every group $\{\pm1\}\subseteq \Delta\subseteq (\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z})^\times$, there exists an intermediate modular curve $X_\Delta(N)$. In this paper we determine all curves $X_\Delta(N)$ whose $\mathbb{Q}$-gonality is equal to $4$, all curves $X_\Delta(N)$ whose $\mathbb{C}$-gonality is equal to $4$, and all curves $X_\Delta(N)$ whose $\mathbb{Q}$-gonality is equal to $5$. We also determine the $\mathbb{Q}$-gonality of all curves $X_\Delta(N)$ for $N\leq 40$ and $\{\pm1\}\subsetneq \Delta \subsetneq (\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z})^\times$.</description>

      <title>A Random Matrix Model for a Family of Cusp Forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Katz-Sarnak philosophy states that statistics of zeros of $L$-function families near the central point as the conductors tend to infinity agree with those of eigenvalues of random matrix ensembles as the matrix size tends to infinity. While numerous results support this conjecture, S. J. Miller observed that for finite conductors, very different behavior can occur for zeros near the central point in elliptic curve $L$-function families. This led to the creation of the excised model of Due\~{n}ez, Huynh, Keating, Miller, and Snaith, whose predictions for quadratic twists of a given elliptic curve are well fit by the data. The key ingredients are relating the discretization of central values of the $L$-functions to excising matrices based on the value of the characteristic polynomials at 1 and using lower order terms (in statistics such as the one-level density and pair-correlation) to adjust the matrix size. We extended this model for a family of twists of an $L$-function associated to a given holomorphic cuspidal newform of odd prime level and arbitrary weight. We derive the corresponding "effective" matrix size for a given form by computing the one-level density and pair-correlation statistics for a chosen family of twists, and we show there is no repulsion for forms with weight greater than 2 and principal nebentype. We experimentally verify the accuracy of the model, and as expected, our model recovers the elliptic curve model.</description>

Abstract: Let $p$ be prime and $e,k$ be positive integers, and let $R = {\mathbb Z}_p[\sqrt[e]{p}]$. We calculate the Waring numbers $g_R(k)$ for many values of $p, e$, and $k$, and investigate how the Waring numbers for $p=2$ change as $e$ and $k$ vary.</description>

      <title>On the Pair Correlation of Zeros of $L$-Functions for Non-CM Newforms in Shifted Ranges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the pair correlation between zeros of a shifted auxiliary $ L $-function attached to a non-CM newform, the scale of which is a fixed constant. We prove an unconditional asymptotic result for the pair correlation and introduce a simplicity hypothesis for the zeros of this function, which if true means that multiple zeros of the original $ L $-function cannot be separated by the same fixed distance. Our results provide macroscopic information in contrast to the pair correlation of the original $ L $-function which is of microscopic nature.</description>

      <title>More on the sum-freedom of the multiplicative inverse function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In two papers entitled ``Two generalizations of almost perfect nonlinearity" and ``On the vector subspaces of $\mathbb F_{2^n}$ over which the multiplicative inverse function sums to zero", the first author has introduced and studied the notion of sum-freedom of vectorial functions, which expresses that a function sums to nonzero values over all affine subspaces of $\Bbb F_{2^n}$ of a given dimension $k\geq 2$, and he then focused on the $k$th order sum-freedom of the multiplicative inverse function $x\in \Bbb F_{2^n}\mapsto x^{2^n-2}$. Some general results were given for this function (in particular, the case of affine spaces that do not contain 0 was solved positively), and the cases of $k\in \{3,n-3\}$ and of $k$ not co-prime with $n$ were solved as well (negatively); but the cases of those linear subspaces of dimension $k\in [\![ 4;n-4]\!]$, co-prime with $n$, were left open. The present paper is a continuation of the previous work. After studying, from two different angles, the particular case of those linear subspaces that are stable under the Frobenius automorphism, we deduce from the second approach that, for $k$ small enough (approximately, $3\le k\leq n/10$), the multiplicative inverse function is not $k$th order sum-free. Finally, we extend a result previously obtained in the second paper mentioned above, and we deduce in particular that, for any even $n$ and every $2\leq k\leq n-2$, the multiplicative inverse function is not $k$th order sum-free.</description>

      <title>Approximation of adelic divisors and equidistribution of small points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic distribution of Galois orbits of algebraic points with small height in a projective variety over a number field. Our main result is a generalization of Yuan's equidistribution theorem that does not require Zhang's lower bound for the essential minimum to be attained. It extends to all projective varieties a theorem of Burgos Gil, Philippon, Rivera-Letelier and the second author for toric varieties, and implies the semiabelian equidistribution theorem of K\"uhne. We also generalize previous work of Chambert-Loir and Thuillier to prove new logarithmic equidistribution results. In the last section, we extend our main theorem to the quasi-projective setting recently introduced by Yuan and Zhang.</description>

      <title>Algebraic relations of special $v$-adic arithmetic gamma values and their period interpretations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $v$ be a finite place of $\mathbb{F}_q(\theta)$. We show that algebraic relations of $v$-adic arithmetic gamma values over $\mathbb{F}_q(\theta)$ are explained by the standard functional equations together with Thakur's analogue of the Gross-Koblitz formula. A key step is working out a formula expressing $v$-adic crystalline-de Rham periods of Carlitz motives with Complex Multiplication as products of these special gamma values (a $v$-adic Chowla-Selberg formula). The algebraic independence of those periods in question results from determining the dimension of the motivic Galois groups, adapting and further developing existing tools.</description>

When $q=2$, our result is sharp.</description>

      <title>$q$-weighted analogue of the Trollope-Delange formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $s(n)$ denote the number of "$1$"s in the dyadic representation of a positive integer $n$ and sequence $S(n) = s(1)+s(2)+\dots+s(n-1)$. The Trollope-Delange formula is a classic result that represents the sequence $S$ in terms of the Takagi function. In this work, we extend this result by introducing a weighted analog of $s(n)$, deriving a variant of the Trollope-Delange formula for this generalization.</description>

      <title>Covering systems with the sum of the reciprocals of the moduli close to $1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1952, H. Davenport posed the problem of determining a condition on the minimum modulus $m_{0}$ in a finite distinct covering system that would imply that the sum of the reciprocals of the moduli in the covering system is bounded away from $1$. In 1973, P. Erdos and J. Selfridge indicated that they believed that $m_{0} &gt; 4$ would suffice. We provide a proof that this is the case.</description>

      <title>A note on congruences for generalized cubic partitions modulo primes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Amdeberhan, Sellers and Singh introduced the notion of a generalized cubic partition function $a_c(n)$ and proved two isolated congruences via modular forms, namely $a_3(7n+4)\equiv 0\pmod{7}$ and $a_5(11n+10)\equiv 0\pmod{11}$. In this paper, we prove these congruences using $q$-series manipulations and provide additional congruences for $a_c(n)$ modulo certain primes via modular forms.</description>

      <title>Elliptic curves and spin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the early 2000s, Ramakrishna asked the question: For the elliptic curve $$ E: y^2 = x^3 - x, $$ what is the density of primes $p$ for which the Fourier coefficient $a_p(E)$ is a cube modulo $p$? As a generalization of this question, Weston--Zaurova formulated conjectures concerning the distribution of power residues of degree $m$ of the Fourier coefficients of elliptic curves $E/\mathbb{Q}$ with complex multiplication. In this paper, we prove their conjecture for cubic residues using the analytic theory of spin. Our proof works for all elliptic curves $E$ with complex multiplication.</description>

Abstract: Let $p$ be a fixed prime number, and $F$ a global function field of characteristic not equal to $p$. In this paper, we shall study the growth of the Sylow $p$-subgroups of the even $K$-groups in a $p$-adic Lie extension of $F$, where the $p$-adic Lie extension is assumed to contain the cyclotomic $\mathbb{Z}_p$-extension of $F$. We also establish a duality between the direct limit and inverse limit of the even $K$-groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study some aspects of the geometric side of the Jacquet-Rallis relative trace formula. Globally, we compute each geometric term of the Jacquet-Rallis relative trace formula on the general linear group for regular supported test functions. We prove that it can be described by the regular orbital integral. Locally, we show that the regular orbital integral can be compared with the semisimple orbital integral on the unitary group.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Viazovska's solution of the sphere packing problem in eight dimensions is based on a remarkable construction of certain special functions using modular forms. Great mathematics has consequences far beyond the problems that originally inspired it, and Viazovska's work is no exception. In this article, we'll examine how it has led to new interpolation theorems in Fourier analysis, specifically a theorem of Radchenko and Viazovska.</description>

      <title>A description of the integral depth-$r$ Bernstein center</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we give a description of the depth-$r$ Bernstein center for non-negative integers $r$ of a reductive simply connected group $G$ over a non-archimedean local field as a limit of depth-$r$ standard parahoric Hecke algebras. Using the description, we construct maps from the algebra of stable functions on the $r$-th Moy-Prasad filtration quotient of hyperspecial parahorics to the depth-$r$ Bernstein center and use them to attach to each depth-$r$ irreducible representation $\pi$ an invariant $\theta(\pi)$, called the depth-$r$ Deligne-Lusztig parameter of $\pi$. We show that $\theta(\pi)$ is equal to the semi-simple part of minimal $K$-types of $\pi$.</description>

      <title>The finite products of shifted primes and Moreira's Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $r\in\mathbb{N}$ and $\mathbb{N}=\bigcup_{i=1}^{r}C_{i}$. Do there exist $x,y\in\mathbb{N}$ and $r\in\left\{1,2,\ldots,r\right\}$ such that $\left\{x,y,xy,x+y\right\}\subseteq C_{i}$? This is still an unanswered question asked by N. Hindman. Joel Moreira in [J. Moreira, Monochromatic sums and products in N, Annals of Mathematics 185 (2017) 1069-1090] established a partial answer to this question and proved that for infinitely many $x,y\in\mathbb{N}$, $\left\{x,xy,x+y\right\}\subseteq C_{i}$ for some $i\in\left\{1,2,\ldots,r\right\}$, which is called Moreira's Theorem. Recently, H. Hindman and D. Strauss established a refinement of Moreira's Theorem and proved that for infinitely many $y$, $\left\{x\in\mathbb{N}:\left\{x,xy,x+y\right\}\subseteq C_{i}\right\}$ is a piecewise syndetic set. In this article, we will prove infinitely many $y\in FP\left(\mathbb{P}-1\right)$ such that $\left\{x\in\mathbb{N}:\left\{xy,x+f(y):f\in F\right\}\subseteq C_{i}\right\}$ is piecewise syndetic, where $F$ is a finite subset of $x\mathbb{Z}\left[x\right]$. $\mathbb{P}$ is the set of prime numbers in $\mathbb{N}$ and $FP\left(\mathbb{P}-1\right)$ is the set of all finite products of $\mathbb{P}-1$.</description>

      <title>Distribution of the zeros of polynomials near the unit circle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We estimate the number of zeros of a polynomial in $\mathbb{C}[z]$ within any small circular disc centered on the unit circle, which improves and comprehensively extends a result established by Borwein, Erd{\'e}lyi, and Littmann~\cite{BE1} in 2008. Furthermore, by combining this result with Euclidean geometry, we derive an upper bound on the number of zeros of such a polynomial within a region resembling a gear wheel. Additionally, we obtain a sharp upper bound on the annular discrepancy of such zeros near the unit circle. Our approach builds upon a modified version of the method described in \cite{BE1}, combined with the refined version of the best-known upper bound for angular discrepancy of zeros of polynomials.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the (crystalline) prismatic crystals on a scheme $\mathfrak{X}$. We classify the crystals by $p$-connections on a certain ring and prove a cohomological comparison theorem. This equivalence is more general than the Ogus' equivalence. Moreover, we will prove the equivalence between the crystalline crystals and prismatic crystals by gluing local Ogus-Vologodsky correspondence.</description>

      <title>Some new properties of the beta function and Ramanujan R-function</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, the power series and hypergeometric series representations of the beta and Ramanujan functions \begin{equation*} \mathcal{B}\left( x\right) =\frac{\Gamma \left( x\right)^{2}}{\Gamma \left( 2x\right) }\text{ and }\mathcal{R}\left( x\right) =-2\psi \left( x\right) -2\gamma \end{equation*} are presented, which yield higher order monotonicity results related to $ \mathcal{B}(x)$ and $\mathcal{R}(x)$; the decreasing property of the functions $\mathcal{R}\left( x\right) /\mathcal{B}\left( x\right) $ and $[ \mathcal{B}(x) -\mathcal{R}(x)] /x^{2}$ on $\left( 0,\infty \right)$ are proved. Moreover, a conjecture put forward by Qiu et al. in [17] is proved to be true. As applications, several inequalities and identities are deduced. These results obtained in this paper may be helpful for the study of certain special functions. Finally, an interesting infinite series similar to Riemann zeta functions is observed initially.</description>

      <title>Parahoric Hecke Ext-algebras in characteristic $p$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathfrak{F}$ be a nonarchimedean local field of residual characteristic $p$, and let $G$ denote the group of $\mathfrak{F}$-points of a connected reductive group over $\mathfrak{F}$. For an open compact subgroup $\mathcal{U}$ of $G$ and a unital commutative ring $k$, we let $\mathbf{X}_{\mathcal{U}}$ denote the space of compactly supported $k$-valued functions on $G/\mathcal{U}$. Building on work of Ollivier--Schneider, we investigate the graded $\textrm{Ext}$-algebra $E_{\mathcal{U}}^* := \textrm{Ext}_G^*(\mathbf{X}_{\mathcal{U}},\mathbf{X}_{\mathcal{U}})^{\textrm{op}}$. In particular, we describe the Yoneda product, an involutive anti-automorphism, and (when $k$ is a field of characteristic $p$ and $\mathcal{U}$ has no $p$-torsion) a duality operation. We allow for the reductive group to be non-split, and for the open compact subgroup $\mathcal{U}$ to be non-pro-$p$.
  Specializing further to the case $G = \textrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{Q}_p)$ with $p \geq 5$ and a coefficient field of characteristic $p$, we obtain more precise results when $\mathcal{U}$ is equal to an Iwahori subgroup $J$ or a hyperspecial maximal compact subgroup $K$. In particular, we compute the structure of $E_J^*$ as an $E_J^0$-bimodule, obtain an explicit description of the center $\mathcal{Z}(E_J^*)$ of $E_J^*$, and construct a surjective morphism of algebras $\mathcal{Z}(E_J^*) \longrightarrow E_K^*$ (analogous to the compatibility between Bernstein and Satake isomorphisms in characteristic 0). From this we deduce the (somewhat surprising) fact that $E_K^*$ is not graded-commutative, contrary to what happens for almost all $\ell$-modular characteristics.</description>

Abstract: Let $F$ be a $p$-adic field and $(\pi, V)$ an irreducible complex representation of $G=GSp(4, F)$ with trivial central character. Let ${\rm Si}(\mathfrak{p}^2)\subset G$ denote the Siegel congruence subgroup of level $\mathfrak{p}^2$ and $u\in N_G({\rm Si}(\mathfrak{p}^2))$ the Atkin-Lehner element. We compute the dimension of the space of ${\rm Si}(\mathfrak{p}^2)$-fixed vectors in $V$ as well as the signatures of the involutions $\pi(u)$ acting on these spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1909.02608v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give iterative constructions for irreducible polynomials over F_q of degree nt^r for all nonnegative integers r, starting from irreducible polynomials of degree n. The iterative constructions correspond modulo fractional linear transformations to compositions with power functions x^t. The R-transform introduced by Cohen is recovered as a particular case corresponding to x^2, hence we obtain a generalization of Cohen's R-transform (t=2) to arbitrary degrees t bigger that two. Important properties like self-reciprocity and invariance of roots under certain automorphisms are deduced from invariance under multiplication by appropriate roots of unity. Extending to quadratic extensions of F_q we recover and generalize a recently obtained recursive construction of Panario, Reis and Wang.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.09882v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There are a number of sporadic coefficient-vanishing results associated with theta series, which suggest certain underlying patterns. By expanding theta powers as linear combinations of products of theta functions, we present two strategies that will provide a unified treatment. Our approaches rely on studying the behavior of products of two theta series under the action of the huffing operator. For this purpose, some explicit criteria are given. We may use the presented methods to not only verify experimentally discovered coefficient-vanishing results, but also to produce a series of general phenomena.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we show the nonvanishing of some Hecke characters on cyclotomic fields. The main ingredient of this paper is a computation of eigenfunctions and the action of Weil representation at some primes including the primes above $2$. As an application, we show that for each isogeny factor of the Jacobian of the $p$-th Fermat curve where $2$ is a quadratic residue modulo $p$, there are infinitely many twists whose analytic rank is zero. Also, for a certain hyperelliptic curve over the $11$-th cyclotomic field whose Jacobian has complex multiplication, there are infinitely many twists whose analytic rank is zero.</description>

Abstract: Let $K$ be a local field of residue characteristic $p&gt;0$. We explain how to compute the semistable reduction of $K$-curves $Y$ equipped with a degree-$p$ morphism from $Y$ to the projective line. This includes the reduction at $p$ of superelliptic curves of degree $p$, but our approach is not limited to Galois covers. We give particular attention to the reduction of plane quartics at $p=3$, which case is implemented in SageMath. We use the language of non-archimedean analytic geometry in the sense of Berkovich. A key tool is the different function of Cohen, Temkin, and Trushin.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01474v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a letter to Weierstrass Riemann asserted that the number $N_0(T)$ of zeros of $\zeta(s)$ on the critical line to height $T$ is approximately equal to the total number of zeros to this height $N(T)$. Siegel studied some posthumous papers of Riemann trying to find a proof of this. He found a function $\mathop{\mathcal R }(s)$ whose zeros are related to the zeros of the function $\zeta(s)$. Siegel concluded that Riemann's papers contained no ideas for a proof of his assertion, connected the position of the zeros of $\mathop{\mathcal R }(s)$ with the position of the zeros of $\zeta(s)$ and asked about the position of the zeros of $\mathop{\mathcal R }(s)$. This paper is a summary of several papers that we will soon upload to arXiv, in which we try to answer Siegel's question about the position of the zeros of $\mathop{\mathcal R }(s)$. The articles contain also improvements on Siegel's results and also other possible ways to prove Riemann's assertion, but without achieving this goal.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08203v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For $k\geq 0$, a $k$-generalized Markov number is an integer which appears in some positive integer solution to the $k$-generalized Markov equation $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + k(yz + zx + xy) = (3 + 3k)xyz$. In this paper, we discuss a combinatorial structure of generalized Markov numbers. To investigate this structure in detail, we use two families of matrices: the $k$-generalized Cohn matrices and the $k$-Markov-monodromy matrices, which are elements of $SL(2, \mathbb{Z})$ whose $(1,2)$-entries are $k$-generalized Markov numbers. We show that these two families of matrices recover the tree structure of the positive integer solutions to the generalized Markov equation, and we give geometric interpretations and a combinatorial interpretation of $k$-generalized Markov numbers. As an application, we provide a computation algorithm of classical Markov number from a one-dimensional dynamical viewpoint. Moreover, we clarify a relation between $k$-generalized Markov numbers and toric surface singularities via continued fractions.</description>

      <title>Tamagawa number conjecture for CM modular forms and Rankin--Selberg convolutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11891v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $E/F$ be an elliptic curve defined over a number field $F$ with complex multiplication by the ring of integers of an imaginary quadratic field $K$ such that the torsion points of $E$ generate over $F$ an abelian extension of $K$. In this paper we prove the $p$-part of the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer formula for $E/F$ in analytic rank $1$ for primes $p&gt;3$ split in $K$. This was previously known for $F=\mathbb{Q}$ by work of Rubin as a consequence of his proof of the Mazur--Swinnerton-Dyer ``main conjecture'' for rational CM elliptic curves, but the problem remained wide open for general $F$.
  The approach in this paper, based on a novel application of an idea of Bertolini--Darmon--Prasanna to consider a carefully chosen decomposable Rankin--Selberg convolution of two CM modular forms having the Hecke $L$-function of interest as one of the factors, circumvents the use of $p$-adic heights and Bertrand's $p$-adic transcendence results in previous approaches. It also yields a proof of similar results for CM abelian varieties $A/K$, and for CM modular forms of higher weight.</description>

      <title>Coincidences of Division Fields of an elliptic curve defined over a number field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14370v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For an elliptic curve defined over a number field, the absolute Galois group acts on the group of torsion points of the elliptic curve, giving rise to a Galois representation in $\mathrm{GL}_2(\hat{\mathbb{Z}})$. The obstructions to the surjectivity of this representation are either local (i.e. at a prime), or due to nonsurjectivity on the product of local Galois images. In this article, we study an extreme case: the coincidence i.e. the equality of $n$-division fields, generated by the $n$-torsion points, attached to different positive integers $n$. We give necessary conditions for coincidences, dealing separately with vertical coincidences, at a given prime, and horizontal coincidences, across multiple primes, in particular when the Galois group on the $n$-torsion contains the special linear group.

      <title>The subspace structure of maximum cliques in pseudo-Paley graphs from unions of cyclotomic classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.07176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.07176v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Blokhuis showed that all maximum cliques in Paley graphs of square order have a subfield structure. Recently, it has been shown that in Peisert-type graphs, all maximum cliques are affine subspaces, and yet some maximum cliques do not arise from a subfield. In this paper, we investigate the existence of a clique of size $\sqrt{q}$ with a subspace structure in pseudo-Paley graphs of order $q$ from unions of semi-primitive cyclotomic classes. We show that such a clique must have an equal contribution from each cyclotomic class and that most such pseudo-Paley graphs do not admit such cliques, suggesting that the Delsarte bound $\sqrt{q}$ on the clique number can be improved in general. We also prove that generalized Peisert graphs are not isomorphic to Paley graphs or Peisert graphs, confirming a conjecture of Mullin.</description>

      <title>Polynomial-exponential equations -- some new cases of solvability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.05592v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently Brownawell and the second author proved a "non-degenerate" case of the (unproved) "Zilber Nullstellensatz" in connexion with "Strong Exponential Closure". Here we treat some significant new cases. In particular these settle completely the problem of solving polynomial-exponential equations in two complex variables. The methods of proof are also new, as is the consequence, for example, that there are infinitely many complex $z$ with $e^z+e^{1/z}=1$.</description>

      <title>$\ell$-adic local systems and Higgs bundles: the generic case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.06637v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a projective smooth geometrically connected curve defined over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$ of cardinality $q$. Let $S$ be a finite set of closed points of $X$. Let $\bar{X}$ and $\bar{S}$ be the base change of $X$, $S$ to an algebraic closure. We consider the set of $\ell$-adic ($\ell\nmid q$) local systems of rank $n$ over $\bar{X}-\bar{S}$ with prescribed tame regular semisimple and generic ramifications in $\bar{S}$. The genericity ensures that such an $\ell$-adic local system is automatically irreducible. We show that the number of these $\ell$-adic local systems fixed by Frobenius endomorphism equals the number of stable logarithmic Higgs bundles of rank $n$ and degree $e$ coprime to $n$, with a fixed residue, up to a power of $q$. In the split case, this number is equal to the number of stable parabolic Higgs bundles (with full flag structures) fixed by $\mathbb{G}_m$-action with generic parabolic weights.</description>

      <title>Purely periodic continued fractions and graph-directed iterated function systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.16658v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe Gauss-type maps as geometric realizations of certain codes in the monoid of nonnegative matrices in the extended modular group. Each such code, together with an appropriate choice of unimodular intervals in P^1R, determines a dual pair of graph-directed iterated function systems, whose attractors contain intervals and constitute the domains of a dual pair of Gauss-type maps. Our framework covers many continued fraction algorithms (such as Farey fractions, Ceiling, Even and Odd, Nearest Integer, ...) and provides explicit dual algorithms and characterizations of those quadratic irrationals having a purely periodic expansion.</description>

      <title>Hyperplane absolute winning property of bounded orbits under diagonalizable flows on $\mathrm{SL}_3(\mathbb{C})/\mathrm{SL}_3(\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{K}})$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16671v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the work of An, Guan and Kleinbock on bounded orbits of diagonalizable flows on $\mathrm{SL}_3(\mathbb{R})/\mathrm{SL}_3(\mathbb{Z})$ to $\mathrm{SL}_3(\mathbb{C})/\mathrm{SL}_3(\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{K}})$, where $\mathbb{K}$ is an imaginary quadratic field. To achieve this, we first prove a complex analogue of Minkowski's Linear Forms Theorem. We then set up an appropriate Schmidt game in $\mathbb{C}^3$ such that bounded orbits correspond to a hyperplane-absolute-winning set consisting of certain vectors in $\mathbb{C}^3$ relative to an approximation by imaginary quadratic rationals in $\mathbb{K}$.</description>

      <title>How Much String to String a Cardioid?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15101v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A residue design is an artistic geometric construction in which we have $n$ equally-spaced points on a circle numbered 0 through $n-1$ and we join with a line segment each point $k$ to $ak$ modulo $n$ for some fixed $a\ge 2.$ The envelopes of these lines are epicycloids, like cardioids. In this article, we prove that the sum of the lengths of these line segments has a surprisingly simple closed form. In particular, if one wants to make one of these designs with string, it is easy to calculate how much string is required.</description>
