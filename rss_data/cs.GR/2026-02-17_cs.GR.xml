      <title>From Pixels to Policies: Reinforcing Spatial Reasoning in Language Models for Content-Aware Layout Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce LaySPA, a reinforcement learning framework that equips large language models (LLMs) with explicit and interpretable spatial reasoning for content-aware graphic layout design. LaySPA addresses two key challenges: LLMs' limited spatial reasoning and the lack of opacity in design decision making. Instead of operating at the pixel level, we reformulate layout design as a policy learning problem over a structured textual spatial environment that explicitly encodes canvas geometry, element attributes, and inter-element relationships. LaySPA produces dual-level outputs comprising interpretable reasoning traces and structured layout specifications, enabling transparent and controllable design decision making. Layout design policy is optimized via a multi-objective spatial critique that decomposes layout quality into geometric validity, relational coherence, and aesthetic consistency, and is trained using relative group optimization to stabilize learning in open-ended design spaces. Experiments demonstrate that LaySPA improves structural validity and visual quality, outperforming larger proprietary LLMs and achieving performance comparable to specialized SOTA layout generators while requiring fewer annotated samples and reduced latency.</description>

      <title>ProAct: A Dual-System Framework for Proactive Embodied Social Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Embodied social agents have recently advanced in generating synchronized speech and gestures. However, most interactive systems remain fundamentally reactive, responding only to current sensory inputs within a short temporal window. Proactive social behavior, in contrast, requires deliberation over accumulated context and intent inference, which conflicts with the strict latency budget of real-time interaction. We present \emph{ProAct}, a dual-system framework that reconciles this time-scale conflict by decoupling a low-latency \emph{Behavioral System} for streaming multimodal interaction from a slower \emph{Cognitive System} which performs long-horizon social reasoning and produces high-level proactive intentions. To translate deliberative intentions into continuous non-verbal behaviors without disrupting fluency, we introduce a streaming flow-matching model conditioned on intentions via ControlNet. This mechanism supports asynchronous intention injection, enabling seamless transitions between reactive and proactive gestures within a single motion stream. We deploy ProAct on a physical humanoid robot and evaluate both motion quality and interactive effectiveness. In real-world interaction user studies, participants and observers consistently prefer ProAct over reactive variants in perceived proactivity, social presence, and overall engagement, demonstrating the benefits of dual-system proactive control for embodied social interaction.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Mesh Renderer for Lightweight Differentiable Rendering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has enabled high-fidelity virtualization with fast rendering and optimization for novel view synthesis. On the other hand, triangle mesh models still remain a popular choice for surface reconstruction but suffer from slow or heavy optimization in traditional mesh-based differentiable renderers. To address this problem, we propose a new lightweight differentiable mesh renderer leveraging the efficient rasterization process of 3DGS, named Gaussian Mesh Renderer (GMR), which tightly integrates the Gaussian and mesh representations. Each Gaussian primitive is analytically derived from the corresponding mesh triangle, preserving structural fidelity and enabling the gradient flow. Compared to the traditional mesh renderers, our method achieves smoother gradients, which especially contributes to better optimization using smaller batch sizes with limited memory. Our implementation is available in the public GitHub repository at https://github.com/huntorochi/Gaussian-Mesh-Renderer.</description>

      <title>Multi-Spectral Gaussian Splatting with Neural Color Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03407v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present MS-Splatting -- a multi-spectral 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) framework that is able to generate multi-view consistent novel views from images of multiple, independent cameras with different spectral domains. In contrast to previous approaches, our method does not require cross-modal camera calibration and is versatile enough to model a variety of different spectra, including thermal and near-infra red, without any algorithmic changes.
  Unlike existing 3DGS-based frameworks that treat each modality separately (by optimizing per-channel spherical harmonics) and therefore fail to exploit the underlying spectral and spatial correlations, our method leverages a novel neural color representation that encodes multi-spectral information into a learned, compact, per-splat feature embedding. A shallow multi-layer perceptron (MLP) then decodes this embedding to obtain spectral color values, enabling joint learning of all bands within a unified representation.
  Our experiments show that this simple yet effective strategy is able to improve multi-spectral rendering quality, while also leading to improved per-spectra rendering quality over state-of-the-art methods. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technique in agricultural applications to render vegetation indices, such as normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI).</description>

      <title>Efficient Computation of Voronoi Diagrams Using Point-in-Cell Tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07175v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since the Voronoi diagram appears in many applications, the topic of improving its computational efficiency remains attractive. We propose a novel yet efficient method to compute Voronoi diagrams bounded by a given domain, i.e., the clipped or restricted Voronoi diagrams. The intersection of the domain and a Voronoi cell (domain-cell intersection) is generated by removing the part outside the cell from the domain, which can be accomplished by several clippings. Different from the existing methods, we present an edge-based search scheme to find clipping planes (bisectors). A test called point-in-cell is first set up to tell whether a space point is in a target Voronoi cell or not. Then, for each edge of the intermediate domain-cell intersection, we will launch a clipping only if its two endpoints are respectively inside and outside the corresponding Voronoi cell, where the bisector for the clipping can be found by using a few times of point-in-cell tests. Therefore, our method only involves the clippings that contribute to the final results, which is a great advantage over the state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, because each domain-cell intersection can be generated independently, we extend the proposed method to the GPUs for computing Voronoi diagrams in parallel. The experimental results show the best performance of our method compared to state-of-the-art ones, regardless of site distribution. This paper was first submitted to SIGGRAPH Asia 2025.</description>

      <title>TexSpot: 3D Texture Enhancement with Spatially-uniform Point Latent Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12157v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-quality 3D texture generation remains a fundamental challenge due to the view-inconsistency inherent in current mainstream multi-view diffusion pipelines. Existing representations either rely on UV maps, which suffer from distortion during unwrapping, or point-based methods, which tightly couple texture fidelity to geometric density that limits high-resolution texture generation. To address these limitations, we introduce TexSpot, a diffusion-based texture enhancement framework. At its core is Texlet, a novel 3D texture representation that merges the geometric expressiveness of point-based 3D textures with the compactness of UV-based representation. Each Texlet latent vector encodes a local texture patch via a 2D encoder and is further aggregated using a 3D encoder to incorporate global shape context. A cascaded 3D-to-2D decoder reconstructs high-quality texture patches, enabling the Texlet space learning. Leveraging this representation, we train a diffusion transformer conditioned on Texlets to refine and enhance textures produced by multi-view diffusion methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TexSpot significantly improves visual fidelity, geometric consistency, and robustness over existing state-of-the-art 3D texture generation and enhancement approaches.
