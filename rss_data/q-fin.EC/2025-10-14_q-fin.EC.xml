      <title>AI-assisted Programming May Decrease the Productivity of Experienced Developers by Increasing Maintenance Burden</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative AI solutions like GitHub Copilot have been shown to increase the productivity of software developers. Yet prior work remains unclear on the quality of code produced and the challenges of maintaining it in software projects. If quality declines as volume grows, experienced developers face increased workloads reviewing and reworking code from less-experienced contributors. We analyze developer activity in Open Source Software (OSS) projects following the introduction of GitHub Copilot. We find that productivity indeed increases. However, the increase in productivity is primarily driven by less-experienced (peripheral) developers. We also find that code written after the adoption of AI requires more rework. Importantly, the added rework burden falls on the more experienced (core) developers, who review 6.5% more code after Copilot's introduction, but show a 19% drop in their original code productivity. More broadly, this finding raises caution that productivity gains of AI may mask the growing burden of maintenance on a shrinking pool of experts.</description>

      <title>Measuring Innovation Patterns in Iran and Neighboring Countries: A Time Series Similarity Approach Using STL and Dynamic Time Warping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Innovation is becoming ever more pivotal to national development strategies but measuring and comparing innovation performance across nations is still a methodological challenges. This research devises a new time-series similarity method that integrates Seasonal-Trend decomposition (STL) with Fast Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) to examine Irans innovation trends by comparison with its regional peers. Owing to data availability constraints of Global Innovation Index data , research and development spending as a proportion of GDP is used as a proxy with its limitations clearly noted. Based on World Bank indicators and an Autoencoder based imputation technique for missing values, the research compares cross-country similarities and determines theme domains best aligned with Irans innovation path. Findings indicate that poverty and health metrics manifest the strongest statistical similarity with R and D spending in Iran, while Saudi Arabia, Oman, and Kuwait show the most similar cross country proximity. Implications are that Iranian innovation is more intrinsically connected with social development dynamics rather than conventional economic or infrastructure drivers, with region-specific implications for STI policy.</description>

      <title>Women's inheritance rights reforms and impact on women's empowerment: evidence from India</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the influence of inheritance rights on women' empowerment in India. We employ the quasi-natural experiment framework wherein; five states amended the Hindu Succession Act (HSA) from 1976 to 1994 before it was federally amended in 2005. Further, we apply difference-in-difference (DID) strategy and consider triangulation approach to identify women empowerment indicators namely: access to resources, agency, and outcomes to measure varying dimensions of empowerment. Using the India Human Development Survey (IHDS-I), our results indicate a positive impact on marriage choice, intimate partner violence, physical, and civil autonomy. However, negative impact on household autonomy and no significant on economic participation for women exposed to state amendments. Further, exploring the heterogeneities in terms of socio-economic status, location, level of patriarchy in a state, gender of the head of the household. Overall, the study highlights that the impact of inheritance law is not unfirm across different groups.</description>

      <title>Harvests and Hooky in the Hills: Crop Yield Variability and Gendered School Enrollment in Rwanda</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the trade-off that households in agrarian economies face between immediate production needs and long-term human capital investment. We ask how exogenous agricultural productivity shocks affect primary and secondary school enrollment in Rwanda, a country characterized by a heavy reliance on rain-fed agriculture alongside ambitious development goals. Using a district-level panel dataset for the years 2010-2021, we employ a two-stage least squares (2SLS) instrumental variable strategy. Plausibly exogenous variation in annual rainfall is used to instrument for a satellite-derived measure of vegetation health and agricultural productivity, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), allowing for a causal interpretation of the results. For primary education, where direct costs are low, enrollment is countercyclical: positive productivity shocks are associated with lower enrollment. Notably, boys' primary enrollment is found to be significantly more elastic to these shocks than girls' enrollment. Conversely, for secondary education, which entails additional financial outlays, enrollment is strongly procyclical. Positive productivity shocks lead to significant increases in enrollment. Further, a sustained positive shock is associated with a subsequent decline in female secondary enrollment. The results challenge previous regional findings supporting the "girls as a buffer" hypothesis and investigate the dynamic and gendered responses to the persistence of economic shocks.</description>

      <title>Disentangling the Distributional Effects of Financial Shocks in the Euro Area</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We estimate the dynamic distributional effects of financial shocks in the Euro Area using survey-based microdata on personal incomes. We find that positive financial shocks increase inequality, with heterogeneity across different income groups. Much of the response emerges in the tails of the income distribution. By decomposing individual incomes into financial and labor components, we identify two distinct transmission mechanisms: financial income inequality rises, likely due to differences in asset holdings. In contrast, labor income inequality increases through a skill premium channel. We then consider a nonlinear model framework, distinguishing the sign of the shock, allowing us to document the presence of asymmetric effects. While positive shocks lead to income disparities, adverse shocks have the opposite effect. Notably, middle-income groups are only affected following a negative shock, highlighting differential vulnerabilities across the income distribution.</description>

      <title>Spatial and Temporal Boundaries in Difference-in-Differences: A Framework from Navier-Stokes Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a unified framework for identifying spatial and temporal boundaries of treatment effects in difference-in-differences designs. Starting from fundamental fluid dynamics equations (Navier-Stokes), we derive conditions under which treatment effects decay exponentially in space and time, enabling researchers to calculate explicit boundaries beyond which effects become undetectable. The framework encompasses both linear (pure diffusion) and nonlinear (advection-diffusion with chemical reactions) regimes, with testable scope conditions based on dimensionless numbers from physics (P\'eclet and Reynolds numbers). We demonstrate the framework's diagnostic capability using air pollution from coal-fired power plants. Analyzing 791 ground-based PM$_{2.5}$ monitors and 189,564 satellite-based NO$_2$ grid cells in the Western United States over 2019-2021, we find striking regional heterogeneity: within 100 km of coal plants, both pollutants show positive spatial decay (PM$_{2.5}$: $\kappa_s = 0.00200$, $d^* = 1,153$ km; NO$_2$: $\kappa_s = 0.00112$, $d^* = 2,062$ km), validating the framework. Beyond 100 km, negative decay parameters correctly signal that urban sources dominate and diffusion assumptions fail. Ground-level PM$_{2.5}$ decays approximately twice as fast as satellite column NO$_2$, consistent with atmospheric transport physics. The framework successfully diagnoses its own validity in four of eight analyzed regions, providing researchers with physics-based tools to assess whether their spatial difference-in-differences setting satisfies diffusion assumptions before applying the estimator. Our results demonstrate that rigorous boundary detection requires both theoretical derivation from first principles and empirical validation of underlying physical assumptions.</description>

      <title>Stabilizing the Staking Rate, Dynamically Distributed Inflation and Delay Induced Oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamically distributed inflation is a common mechanism used to guide a blockchain's staking rate towards a desired equilibrium between network security and token liquidity.
  However, the high sensitivity of the annual percentage yield to changes in the staking rate, coupled with the inherent feedback delays in staker responses, can induce undesirable oscillations around this equilibrium.
  This paper investigates this instability phenomenon. We analyze the dynamics of inflation-based reward systems and propose a novel distribution model designed to stabilize the staking rate. Our solution effectively dampens oscillations, stabilizing the yield within a target staking range.</description>

      <title>Mean-Field Price Formation on Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we combine the mean-field game theory with the classical idea of binomial tree framework, pioneered by Sharpe and Cox, Ross &amp; Rubinstein, to solve the equilibrium price formation problem for the stock. For agents with exponential utilities and recursive utilities of exponential type, we prove the existence of a unique mean-field equilibrium and derive an explicit formula for equilibrium transition probabilities of the stock price by restricting its trajectories onto a binomial tree. The agents are subject to stochastic terminal liabilities and incremental endowments, both of which are dependent on unhedgeable common and idiosyncratic factors, in addition to the stock price path. Finally, we provide numerical examples to illustrate the qualitative effects of these components on the equilibrium price distribution.</description>

      <title>Demand Estimation with Text and Image Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20711v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a demand estimation method that leverages unstructured text and image data to infer substitution patterns. Using pre-trained deep learning models, we extract embeddings from product images and textual descriptions and incorporate them into a random coefficients logit model. This approach enables researchers to estimate demand even when they lack data on product attributes or when consumers value hard-to-quantify attributes, such as visual design or functional benefits. Using data from a choice experiment, we show that our approach outperforms standard attribute-based models in counterfactual predictions of consumers' second choices. We also apply it across 40 product categories on Amazon and consistently find that text and image data help identify close substitutes within each category.</description>

      <title>The Circular Flow Revisited: A Comparative Exposition of Leontief's Input-Output Analysis and Sraffa's Production of Commodities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13936v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper delves into the foundational contributions of Wassily Leontief and Piero Sraffa to the understanding of economic systems as circular processes of production. It provides a comprehensive analysis of Leontief's Input-Output (I-O) framework and Sraffa's model of "Production of Commodities by Means of Commodities," highlighting their distinct yet complementary perspectives on the structure of modern economies. By meticulously examining the mathematical underpinnings and economic assumptions of both models, this paper elucidates their respective treatments of prices, quantities, surplus, and the role of technology. The analysis extends to a comparative exploration of their approaches to value, distribution, and the representation of economic systems, drawing upon detailed examples and the theoretical frameworks presented in the foundational texts. The paper argues that a synergistic understanding of Leontief's empirical framework and Sraffa's theoretical critique offers profound insights into the intricate web of inter-industry relationships that characterise contemporary economies. The appendix part of this paper proposes a rigorous mathematical unification of the classical price theory of Piero Sraffa and the empirical input-output analysis of Wassily Leontief. While both frameworks model the economy as a circular process of production, their theoretical foundations and applications have often been treated separately. We demonstrate that they are two facets of a single, underlying algebraic structure.</description>

      <title>Pixels to Prices: Visual Traits, Market Cycles, and the Economics of NFT Valuation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24879v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pixels and market cycles both move NFT prices. Using 94,039 transactions from 26 major generative Ethereum collections, this study extracts 196 machine-quantified image descriptors -- color, composition, palette structure, geometry, texture, and deep-learning embeddings -- and applies a three-stage filter to identify stable predictors for hedonic regression. A static mixed-effects model shows that market sentiment and transparent, interpretable image traits have significant and independent pricing power: higher focal saturation, tighter compositional concentration, and greater curvature are rewarded, while clutter, heavy line work, and dispersed palettes are discounted; deep embeddings add limited incremental value once explicit traits are included. To assess state dependence, a Bayesian dynamic mixed-effects panel with cycle effects is estimated, allowing \emph{Composition Focus -- Saturation} -- the ratio of saturation in the central region to the whole image, capturing vividness and concentration at the focal area -- to vary across market regimes. Collection-level heterogeneity (brand premia) is absorbed by random effects. The time-varying coefficients exhibit clear regime sensitivity, with stronger premia in expansionary phases and weaker or negative loadings in downturns, while the grand-mean effect is small on average. Overall, NFT prices reflect both observable digital product characteristics and market regimes, and the framework offers a cycle-aware tool for asset pricing, platform strategy, and market design in digital art markets.</description>

      <title>Fake News in Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.06233</link>
      <description>arXiv:1708.06233v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose multi-agent reinforcement learning as a new method for modeling fake news in social networks. This method allows us to model human behavior in social networks both in unaccustomed populations and in populations that have adapted to the presence of fake news. In particular the latter is challenging for existing methods. We find that a fake-news attack is more effective if it targets highly connected people and people with weaker private information. Attacks are more effective when the disinformation is spread across several agents than when the disinformation is concentrated with more intensity on fewer agents. Furthermore, fake news spread less well in balanced networks than in clustered networks. We test a part of our findings in a human-subject experiment. The experimental evidence provides support for the predictions from the model, suggesting that the model is suitable to analyze the spread of fake news in social networks.</description>

      <title>A Unified Framework for Spatial and Temporal Treatment Effect Boundaries: Theory and Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00754v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a unified theoretical framework for detecting and estimating boundaries in treatment effects across both spatial and temporal dimensions. We formalize the concept of treatment effect boundaries as structural parameters characterizing regime transitions where causal effects cease to operate. Building on reaction-diffusion models of information propagation, we establish conditions under which spatial and temporal boundaries share common dynamics governed by diffusion parameters (delta, lambda), yielding the testable prediction d^*/tau^* = 3.32 lambda sqrt{delta} for standard detection thresholds. We derive formal identification results under staggered treatment adoption and develop a three-stage estimation procedure implementable with standard panel data. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate excellent finite-sample performance, with boundary estimates achieving RMSE below 10% in realistic configurations. We apply the framework to two empirical settings: EU broadband diffusion (2006-2021) and US wildfire economic impacts (2017-2022). The broadband application reveals a scope limitation -- our framework assumes depreciation dynamics and fails when effects exhibit increasing returns through network externalities. The wildfire application provides strong validation: estimated boundaries satisfy d^* = 198 km and tau^* = 2.7 years, with the empirical ratio (72.5) exactly matching the theoretical prediction 3.32 lambda sqrt{delta} = 72.5. The framework provides practical tools for detecting when localized treatments become systemic and identifying critical thresholds for policy intervention.</description>
