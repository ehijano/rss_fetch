      <title>Asymmetric domain walls in modified $\phi^{4}$ theory: Excitation spectra, scattering, and decay of bions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a two-dimensional Lorentz-invariant field model with a $\phi^{4}$ potential modified by a term that introduces asymmetries at the manifold space. In this framework, the model recovers its original symmetry only when $p=0$. The asymmetry introduced in the potential suggests that, even when one of the minima diverges asymptotically, kink/antikink-like configurations emerge in the theory, shifting the critical point of the energy density away from the center of the kink-like solutions. Hence, we note that the model supports asymmetrical kink/antikink-like topological solutions. Furthermore, an analysis of the excitation spectrum of these solutions revealed the absence of vibrational modes. Finally, we examine the dynamical solutions for different values of initial speed by allowing us to verify the effects of asymmetries on the collision properties.</description>

      <title>Twisted times, the Schwarzian and its deformations in DSSYK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The IR dynamics of SYK is that of the Schwarzian theory, the effective theory of broken reparametrization invariance. In the double scaling limit, SYK is completely solvable by chord diagrams, whose generating functional is a bilocal Liouville theory. At low temperatures a set of modes in this description becomes soft. We interpret them as reparametrization of some twisted time coordinates, and show explicitly that they lead to the nonlinear Schwarzian theory. We further consider deformations of the theory in the double scaling limit, giving rise to diagrams with multiple species of chords, and show that the generating functional is now a Liouville theory with multiple fields. These deformations can be tracked to the IR and we discuss how they affect the Schwarzian.</description>

      <title>Zero energy modes with gaussian, exponential, or polynomial decay: Exact solutions in hermitian and nonhermitian regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological zero modes in topological insulators or superconductors are exponentially localized at the phase transition between a topologically trivial and nontrivial phase. These modes are solutions of a Jackiw-Rebbi equation modified with an additional term which is quadratic in the momentum. Moreover, localized fermionic modes can also be induced by harmonic potentials in superfluids and superconductors or in atomic nuclei. Here, by using inverse methods, we consider in the same framework exponentially-localized zero modes, as well as gaussian modes induced by harmonic potentials (with superexponential decay) and polynomially decaying modes (with subexponential decay), and derive the explicit and analytical form of the modified Jackiw-Rebbi equation (and of the Schr\"odinger equation) which admits these modes as solutions. We find that the asymptotic behavior of the mass term is crucial in determining the decay properties of the modes. Furthermore, these considerations naturally extend to the nonhermitian regime. These findings allow us to classify and understand topological and nontopological boundary modes in topological insulators and superconductors.</description>

      <title>Deformations of AdS and exact sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give some examples of Ext groups relevant to computations in the AdS supergravity, using the pure spinor formalism. Our main examples are deformations of $AdS_5\times S^5$ transforming in finite-dimensional representations of the superconformal algebra at the linearized level. In the study of correlation functions, it is important to compute the resolution of BRST-exact products of vertex operators. The resolution is typically non-covariant, because of cohomological obstacles. We develop a framework to describe these obstacles, and formulate conjectures about their structure.</description>

      <title>Fractionalization of flux tubes in 3d and screening by emergent electric charges in 2d</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a class of 3d theories with a $\mathbb Z_n$ magnetic symmetry in which confinement is generated by charge $n$ clusters of monopoles. Such theories naturally arise in quantum antiferromagnets in 2+1, QCD-like theories on $\mathbb R^3 \times S^1$, and $U(1)$ lattice theory with restricted monopole sums. A confining string fractionates into $n$ strings which each carry $1/n$ electric flux. We construct a twisted compactification (equivalently periodic compactification with a topological defect insertion) on $\mathbb R^2 \times S^1$ that preserves the vacuum structure. Despite the absence of electric degrees of freedom in the microscopic Lagrangian, we show that large Wilson loops are completely/partially screened for even/odd $n$, even when the compactification scale is much larger than the Debye length. We show the emergence of fractional electric charges $(\pm 2/n)$ at the junctions of the domain lines and topological defects. We end with some remarks on screening vs. confinement.</description>

      <title>Soft edges: the many links between soft and edge modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Boundaries in gauge theory and gravity give rise to symmetries and charges at both finite and asymptotic distance. Due to their structural similarities, it is often held that soft modes are some kind of asymptotic limit of edge modes. Here, we show in Maxwell theory that there is an arguably more interesting relationship between the \emph{asymptotic} symmetries and their charges, on one hand, and their \emph{finite-distance} counterparts, on the other, without the need of a limit. Key to this observation is to embed the finite region in the global spacetime and identify edge modes as dynamical $\rm{U}(1)$-reference frames for dressing subregion variables. Distinguishing \emph{intrinsic} and \emph{extrinsic} frames, according to whether they are built from field content in- or outside the region, we find that non-trivial corner symmetries arise only for extrinsic frames. Further, the asymptotic-to-finite relation requires asymptotically charged ones (like Wilson lines). Such frames, called \emph{soft edges}, extend to asymptotia and realize the corner charge algebra by ``pulling in'' the asymptotic one from infinity. Realizing an infinite-dimensional algebra requires a new set of \emph{soft boundary conditions}, relying on the distinction between extrinsic and intrinsic data. We identify the subregion Goldstone mode as the relational observable between extrinsic and intrinsic frames and clarify the meaning of vacuum degeneracy. We also connect the asymptotic memory effect with a more operational \emph{quasi-local} one. A main conclusion is that the relationship between asymptotia and finite distance is \emph{frame-dependent}; each choice of soft edge mode probes distinct cross-boundary data of the global theory. Our work combines the study of boundary symmetries with the program of dynamical reference frames and we anticipate that core insights extend to Yang-Mills theory and gravity.</description>

      <title>Quantum aspects of heterotic $G_2$ systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compactifications of the heterotic string, to first order in the $\alpha'$ expansion, on manifolds with integrable $G_2$ structure give rise to three-dimensional ${\cal N} = 1$ supergravity theories that admit Minkowski and AdS ground states. As shown in arXiv:1904.01027, such vacua correspond to critical loci of a real superpotential $W$. We perform a perturbative study around a supersymmetric vacuum of the theory, which confirms that the first order variation of the superpotential, $\delta W$, reproduces the BPS conditions for the system, and furthermore shows that $\delta^2 W=0$ gives the equations for infinitesimal moduli. This allows us to identify a nilpotent differential, and a symplectic pairing, which we use to construct a bicomplex, or a double complex, for the heterotic $G_2$ system. Using this complex, we determine infinitesimal moduli and their obstructions in terms of related cohomology groups. Finally, by interpreting $\delta^2 W$ as an action, we compute the one-loop partition function of the heterotic $G_2$ system and show it can be decomposed into a product of one-loop partition functions of Abelian and non-Abelian instanton gauge theories.</description>

      <title>New Modes for Vector Bosons in the Static Patch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a massive vector Boson in a static patch of $D$-dimensional de Sitter space (dS$_D$). We argue that this field is controlled by an effective physical (squared) mass $\mu_{\mathrm{v}}^2 = m_{\mathrm{v}}^2 + 2(D-1)\ell_{\mathrm{dS}}^{-2}$ which differs from the naive "Lagrangian" (squared) mass $m_{\mathrm{v}}^2$ that appears in the usual form of the Proca Lagrangian/action. In particular, we conjecture that the theory remains well-defined in the naively tachyonic Lagrangian mass range $-2(D-1) &lt; m_{\mathrm{v}}^2\ell_{\mathrm{dS}}^2 &lt; 0$. We identify several interesting physical features of the "edge of stability" $m_{\mathrm{v}}^2\ell_{\mathrm{dS}}^2 = -2(D-1)$. Fixing a static patch breaks the $D$-dimensional de Sitter isometries down to a "static patch subgroup", which explains why our theory may continue to be well-defined in the above mass range despite not fitting into a unitary irreducible representation of SO$(D,1)$. We conjecture that for situations such as ours, the usual $\mathrm{SO}(D,1)$ "Higuchi bound" on unitarity is replaced by the concept of the edge of stability. In $D = 3$ spacetime dimensions, the $s$-wave sector of our theory remarkably simplifies, becoming equivalent to the $p$-wave sector of an ordinary massive scalar. In this case we can explicitly check that the $D = 3$ $s$-wave sector remains well-defined -- both classically and quantum mechanically -- in the above mass range. In the course of our analysis, we will derive the general classical solution and the quasinormal frequency spectrum for the massive vector Boson in the static patch of dS$_D$, generalizing previous work by Higuchi [1], which was done for the special case $D = 4$. While this work was being completed, we became aware of upcoming work by Grewal, Law, and Lochab [2] which will contain a similar derivation.</description>

      <title>Holographic subregion complexity in a moving strongly coupled plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study holographic subregion complexity in a moving strongly coupled plasma in dimensions d = 2, 3, 4, which is holographically dual to a boosted black brane metric in a higher dimensional geometry. The proposal we employ is the one that identifies the complexity of a mixed state by the volume of codimensional-one hypersurface enclosed by Hubeny-Rangamani-Takayanagi surface. Using the finite difference method, the numerical calculations reveal that temperature, velocity, and subregion length all have an increasing effect on holographic subregion complexity. For arbitrary values of temperature and subregion length, as velocity approaches its relativistic upper limit, holographic subregion complexity exhibits a divergence. This divergence behavior observed in d = 2, 3, 4 seems to demonstrate a universal behavior and is characterized by the Lorentz factor squared, {\gamma}2.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear soft mode action for the large-$p$ SYK model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The physics of the SYK model at low temperatures is dominated by a soft mode governed by the Schwarzian action. In arXiv:1604.07818 the linearised action was derived from the soft mode contribution to the four-point function, and physical arguments were presented for its nonlinear completion to the Schwarzian. In this paper, we give two derivations of the full nonlinear effective action in the large $p$ limit, where $p$ is the number of fermions in the interaction terms of the Hamiltonian. The first derivation uses that the collective field action of the large-$p$ SYK model is Liouville theory with a non-conformal boundary condition that we study in conformal perturbation theory. This derivation can be viewed as an explicit version of the renormalisation group argument for the nonlinear soft mode action in arXiv:1711.08467. The second derivation uses an Ansatz for how the soft mode embeds into the microscopic configuration space of the collective fields. We generalise our results for the large-$p$ SYK chain and obtain a "Schwarzian chain" effective action for it. These derivations showcase that the large-$p$ SYK model is a rare system, in which there is sufficient control over the microscopic dynamics, so that an effective description can be derived for it without the need for extra assumptions or matching (in the effective field theory sense).</description>

      <title>$\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal gravitino in harmonic superspace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the harmonic superspace formulation of $\mathcal{N}=2$ gravitino multiplet, the simplest $\mathcal{N}=2$ half-integer spin gauge supermultiplet. It is shown that, quite similar to other $\mathcal{N}=2$ gauge multiplets, the gravitino supermultiplet is described by unconstrained analytic prepotentials $h^{++\alpha}$ and $h^{+++}$ which contain a conformal gravitino in the Wess-Zumino gauge. The analytic prepotentials naturally come out from the study of $\mathcal{N}=2$ supercurrents associated with hidden symmetries of $\mathcal{N}=2$ vector-hypermultiplet system. We construct the covariant $\mathcal{N}=2$ superfield strengths and the invariant $\mathcal{N}=2$ superfield actions and sketch their component contents. We observe that, at cost of introducing new auxiliary coordinates $\Psi^\alpha$ and $\omega^+$, the gravitino analytic prepotentials acquire a nice geometric interpretation as extra veilbeins of the covariant harmonic derivative $\mathfrak{D}^{++}$. We speculate on a possible origin of the additional coordinates, including their relationship with $\mathcal{N}=2$ supertwistors.</description>

      <title>Diagrammatic Derivation of Hidden Zeros and Exact Factorisation of Pion Scattering Amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pion scattering amplitudes were recently found to vanish on specific kinematic loci, and to factorise close to these loci into a product of two lower-point amplitudes of an extended theory. We propose a diagrammatic representation of pion amplitudes that makes their vanishing on the loci manifest diagram by diagram. Moreover, we provide evidence that there is a closed-form expression for the amplitudes that generalises the near-zero factorisation in an exact manner, not only close to the loci but for all kinematic configurations. Our approach crucially relies on a novel formulation of the effective field theory of pions, in which tree-level scattering amplitudes are extracted from classical field equations for a set of covariantly conserved currents and emergent composite gauge fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a dilaton Weyl multiplet for $N = 3$ conformal supergravity in four dimensions. We couple an on-shell vector multiplet to the standard Weyl multiplet and use the field equations of the vector multiplet to replace some of the components of the auxiliary fields of the standard Weyl multiplet with the fields of the vector multiplet and some dual gauge fields. The R-symmetry of the multiplet is $SU(2) \times U(1) \times U(1)$. Furthermore, we gauge fix one of the two $U(1)$ symmetries and rewrite the result for the dilaton Weyl multiplet with $SU(2) \times U(1)$ R-symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a mirror derivation of the quiver description of open topological strings known as the knots-quivers correspondence, based on enumerative invariants of augmentation curves encoded by exponential networks. Quivers are obtained by studying M2 branes wrapping holomorphic disks with Lagrangian boundary conditions on an M5 brane, through their identification with a distinguished sector of BPS kinky vortices in the 3d-3d dual QFT. Our proposal suggests that holomorphic disks with Lagrangian boundary conditions are mirror to calibrated 1-chains on the associated augmentation curve, whose intersections encode the linking of boundaries.</description>

      <title>Field-dependent diffeomorphisms and the transformation of surface charges between gauges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When studying gauge theories in the presence of boundaries, local symmetry transformations are typically classified as gauge or physical depending on whether the associated charges vanish or not. Here, we propose that physical charges should further be refined into "dynamical" or "kinematical" depending on whether they are associated with flux-balance laws or not. To support this proposal, we analyze (A)dS$_3$ gravity with boundary Weyl rescalings and compare the solution spaces in Bondi-Sachs and Fefferman-Graham coordinates. Our results show that the Weyl charge vanishes in the Bondi-Sachs gauge but not in the Fefferman-Graham gauge. Conversely, the charges arising from the metric Chern-Simons Lagrangian behave in the opposite way. This indicates that the gauge-dependent Weyl charge differs fundamentally from charges like mass and angular momentum. This interpretation is reinforced by two key observations: the Weyl conformal factor does not satisfy any flux-balance law, and the associated charge arises from a corner term in the symplectic structure. These properties justify assigning the Weyl charge a kinematical status. These results can also be derived using the field-dependent diffeomorphism that maps between the two gauges. Importantly, this diffeomorphism does not act tensorially on the variational bi-complex due to its field dependency, and is able to "toggle" charges on or off. This provides an example of a large diffeomorphism $\textit{between}$ gauges, as opposed to a residual diffeomorphism $\textit{within}$ a gauge.</description>

      <title>Surface Defects in $A$-type Little String Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $A$-type Little String Theories (LSTs) are engineered from parallel M5-branes on a circle $\mathbb{S}_\perp^1$, probing a transverse $\mathbb{R}^4/\mathbb{Z}_M$ background. Below the scale of the radius of $\mathbb{S}_\perp^1$, these theories resemble a circular quiver gauge theory with $M$ nodes of gauge group $U(N)$ and matter in the bifundamental representation (or adjoint in the case of $M=1$). In this paper, we study these LSTs in the presence of a surface defect, which is introduced through the action of a $\mathbb{Z}_N$ orbifold that breaks the gauge groups into $[U(1)]^N$. We provide a combinatoric expression for the non-perturbative BPS partition function for this system. This form allows us to argue that a number of non-perturbative symmetries, that have previously been established for the LSTs, are preserved in the presence of the defect. Furthermore, we discuss the Nekrasov-Shatashvili (NS) limit of the defect partition function: focusing in detail on the case $(M,N)=(1,2)$, we analyse two distinct proposals made in the literature. We unravel an algebraic structure that is responsible for the cancellation of singular terms in the NS limit, which we generalise to generic $(M,N)$. In view of the dualities of higher dimensional gauge theories to quantum many-body systems, we provide indications that our combinatoric expression for the defect partition are useful in constructing and analysing quantum integrable systems in the future.</description>

      <title>Inflation in non-local hybrid metric-Palatini gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the framework of hybrid metric-Palatini gravity, we incorporate non-localities introduced via the inverse of the d'Alembert operators acting on the scalar curvature. We analyse the dynamical structure of the theory and, adopting a scalar-tensor perspective, assess the stability conditions to ensure the absence of ghost instabilities. Focusing on a special class of well-defined hybrid actions -- where local and non-local contributions are carried by distinct types of curvature -- we investigate the feasibility of inflation within the resulting Einstein-frame multi-field scenario. We examine how the non-minimal kinetic couplings between the fields, reflecting the non-local structure of the original frame, influence the number of e-folds and the field trajectories. To clarify the physical interpretation of our results, we draw analogies with benchmark single-field inflation scenarios that include spectator fields.</description>

      <title>Islands, Double Holography, and the Entanglement Membrane</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum extremal island rule allows us to compute the Page curves of Hawking radiation in semi-classical gravity. In this work, we study the connection between these calculations and the thermalisation of chaotic quantum many-body systems, using a coarse-grained description of entanglement dynamics known as the entanglement membrane. Starting from a double-holographic model of eternal two-sided asymptotically AdS$_d$ ($d&gt;2$) black hole each coupled to a flat $d$-dimensional bath, we show that the entanglement dynamics in the late-time, large-subregion limit is described by entanglement membrane, thereby establishing a quantitative equivalence between a semi-classical gravity and a chaotic quantum many-body system calculation of the Page curve.</description>

      <title>Circle compactifications of Minkowski$_D$ solutions, flux vacua and solitonic branes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: G-structure techniques are used to construct broad classes of circle compactifications of Mink$_{D+1}$ solutions to Mink$_{D}$ embedded into type II supergravity for $D=1,...5$. Under a certain assumptions we show that the conditions that imply supersymmetry for Mink$_{D+1}$ imply those of the Mink$_{D}$ solution, but that Bianchi identities of the fluxes must be modified. This realises an off shell solution generating technique for supersymmetric solutions or a "supersymmetry generating" technique. Along the way it is necessary for us to derive G structure conditions for general ${\cal N}=(1,0)$ supersymmetric Mink$_2$ solutions and a restricted class of Mink$_1$ solutions. We apply our results to construct some simple Minkowski flux vacua before turning our attention to "solitonic branes" which are generalisations of the AdS soliton. We are able to generalise known examples in two ways: 1) to embed them in terms of generic Sasaki Einstein manifolds. 2) To modify the harmonic factor to include D$p$ brane sources at one end of the space.</description>

      <title>From black hole interior to quantum complexity through operator rank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been conjectured that the size of the black hole interior captures the quantum gate complexity of the underlying boundary evolution. In this short note we aim to provide a further microscopic evidence for this by directly relating the area of a certain codimension-two surface traversing the interior to the depth of the quantum circuit. Our arguments are based on establishing such relation rigorously at early times using the notion of operator Schmidt rank and then extrapolating it to later times by mapping bulk surfaces to cuts in the circuit representation.</description>

      <title>On the New Factorizations of Yang-Mills Amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we prove the new factorization pattern for tree-level Yang-Mills (YM) amplitudes proposed in a companion paper. This pattern reveals a decomposition of amplitudes into a sum of gluings of lower-point amplitudes under specific kinematic constraints, making the hidden zeros of YM amplitudes manifest. Utilizing the Cachazo-He-Yuan (CHY) formalism, we rigorously derive these factorizations by systematically analyzing the contributions of singular solutions to the scattering equations. Through the identification and application of key algebraic identities, we demonstrate how cancellations among terms uncover a recursive structure intricately tied to the hidden zeros. This work not only conclusively validates the proposed factorization but also provides new insights into the geometric and algebraic organization of YM amplitudes within the CHY framework.</description>

      <title>A Central Charge for sub-AdS Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We synthesize and sharpen various observations about sub-AdS holography in the literature to associate a central charge to sub-AdS scales of AdS x $X$ geometries. A key ingredient in our proposal is the idea that the AdS length is the length of the long string in a stack of $N$ $backreacted$ D-branes. This allows us to make statements about sub-AdS scales by considering long strings in sub-stacks of $M &lt; N$ branes. Our proposal applies in general dimensions, connects with and refines previous ideas about sub-matrix deconfinement &amp; long strings, makes crucial use of the compact space, and is consistent with the expected thermodynamics of small black holes localized on $X$. Some of our arguments draw intuition from separating branes, and have natural connections to (heating up) the Coulomb branch of the gauge theory. We apply related ideas to non-conformal D-branes at zero and finite temperature, discuss the holographic bound and IR/UV duality in theories with 16 supercharges, and find broad consistency.</description>

      <title>A Pathway to Decay and Fission of Orthosymplectic Quiver Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an algorithm to extract the Coulomb branch Hasse diagram of orthosymplectic 3d $\mathcal{N}=4$ quiver gauge theories. The algorithm systematically predicts all descendant theories arising from Coulomb branch Higgsing, thereby detailing the stratification of the symplectic singularity defined by the initial Coulomb branch. Leveraging the Lie algebra isomorphism $\mathfrak{su}(4) \cong \mathfrak{so}(6)$, we validate our algorithm via the 3d mirror of 4d theories of class $\mathcal{S}$ of such type. This comparison involves moduli spaces that admit both orthosymplectic and unitary quiver realisations, the latter being well-understood via standard techniques such as Decay and Fission. Higgsing on the Coulomb branch of the 3d mirror or magnetic quiver translates to Higgs branch renormalization group flows of the corresponding higher-dimensional SCFTs. Thus, we benchmark our method via Higgsing 6d $\mathcal{N}=(1,0)$ D-type orbi-instanton theories, predicting novel Higgsing patterns involving products of interacting fixed points, and class $\mathcal{S}$ theories of type $\mathfrak{so}(2N)$, demonstrating Higgsing to products of theories of types specified by Levi subalgebras of $\mathfrak{so}(2N)$.</description>

      <title>Astrometry meets Pulsar Timing Arrays: Synergies for Gravitational Wave Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-precision astrometry offers a promising approach to detect low-frequency gravitational waves, complementing pulsar timing array (PTA) observations. We explore the response of astrometric measurements to a stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) in synergy with PTA data. Analytical, covariant expressions for this response are derived, accounting for the presence of a possible dipolar anisotropy in the SGWB. We identify the optimal estimator for extracting SGWB information from astrometric observations and examine how sensitivity to SGWB properties varies with the sky positions of stars and pulsars. Using representative examples of current PTA capabilities and near-future astrometric sensitivity, we demonstrate that cross-correlating astrometric and PTA data can improve constraints on SGWB properties, compared to PTA data alone. The improvement is quantified through Fisher forecasts for the SGWB amplitude, spectral tilt, and dipolar anisotropy amplitude. In the future, such joint constraints could play a crucial role in identifying the origin of SGWB signals detected by PTAs.</description>

      <title>Effective String Theory of three-dimensional SU(N) gauge theories beyond the Nambu--Got\=o approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the effective bosonic string that describes confining flux tubes in three-dimensional SU(N) Yang--Mills theories. Although the low-energy properties are universal and well described by the Nambu--Got\=o action, the subtle dependence on the gauge group is embedded in a series of corrections, which remain undetermined, appearing in the expansion around the limit of an infinitely long string. We extract the first two of these corrections from a set of high-precision Monte Carlo simulations of Polyakov loop correlators at finite temperatures close to the deconfinement transition. We present and compare the results of new lattice simulations for theories with N=3 and N=6 color charges, along with an improved estimate for the N=2 case, discussing the approach to the large-N limit. We show that our results are compatible with analytical bounds derived from the S-matrix bootstrap approach. Additionally, we present a new test of the Svetitsky--Yaffe conjecture for the SU(3) theory in three dimensions, showing that our results for the correlator of Polyakov loops perfectly agree with the predictions obtained using a conformal perturbation approach to the two-dimensional three-state Potts model</description>

Abstract: We find an exact black hole solution for the Einstein gravity in the presence of Ay\'on--Beato--Garc\'ia non-linear electrodynamics and a cloud of strings. The resulting black hole solution is singular, and the solution becomes non-singular when gravity is coupled with Ay\'on--Beato--Garc\'ia non-linear electrodynamics only. This solution interpolates between Ay\'on--Beato--Garc\'ia black hole, Letelier black hole and Schwarzschild black hole { in the absence of cloud of strings parameter, magnetic monopole charge and both of them, respectively}. We also discuss the thermal properties of this black hole and find that the solution follows the modified first law of black hole thermodynamics. Furthermore, we estimate the solution's black hole shadow and quasinormal modes.</description>

      <title>The Two Scales of New Physics in Loop-Induced Higgs Couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Probing new physics through precise measurements of Higgs boson couplings is a central objective of the particle collider program at the high-energy frontier. An anomaly in Higgs couplings induced solely by new fermions allows one to compute an upper bound on the mass scale of new bosons. This new bosonic scale is necessary to prevent Landau poles or vacuum instability. Consequently, a single anomalous measurement can provide insight into two distinct new physics scales. In this article, we apply this approach to the loop-induced couplings of the Higgs boson to digluons ($gg$), diphotons ($\gamma \gamma$), and $Z \gamma$, and we compare our results to the projected sensitivities of the HL-LHC and future lepton colliders. This work naturally extends our previous analysis of Higgs couplings to weak dibosons ($WW$ and $ZZ$).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monopoles are generally expected in Grand Unified Theories (GUTs) where they can catalyze baryon decay at an unsuppressed rate by the Callan-Rubakov effect. For the first time, we show this catalysis effect can generate the observed baryon asymmetry at GeV scale temperatures. We study the minimal SU(5) GUT model and demonstrate that monopoles-fermion scattering with a $CP$-violating $\theta$-term leads to realistic baryogenesis even when $\theta\lesssim 10^{-10}$ is below the neutron EDM bound, potentially detectable in the future measurements. Our calculation also shows that to generate the observed baryon asymmetry, the abundance of the monopoles is below the current experiential bounds.</description>

      <title>Metric-induced nonhermitian physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I consider the long-standing issue of the hermicity of the Dirac equation in curved spacetime metrics. Instead of imposing hermiticity by adding ad hoc terms, I renormalize the field by a scaling function, which is related to the determinant of the metric, and then regularize the renormalized field on a discrete lattice. I found that, for time-independent and diagonal metrics such as the Rindler, de~Sitter, and anti-de~Sitter metrics, the Dirac equation returns a hermitian or pseudohermitian ($\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric) Hamiltonian when properly regularized on the lattice. Notably, the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry is unbroken in the pseudohermitian cases, assuring a real energy spectrum with unitary time evolution. Conversely, considering a more general class of time-dependent metrics, which includes the Weyl metric, the Dirac equation returns a nonhermitian Hamiltonian with nonunitary time evolution. Arguably, this nonhermicity is physical, with the time dependence of the metric corresponding to local nonhermitian processes on the lattice and nonunitary growth or decay of the time evolution of the field. This suggests a duality between nonhermitian gain and loss phenomena and spacetime contractions and expansions. This metric-induced nonhermiticity unveils an unexpected connection between spacetime metric and nonhermitian phases of matter.</description>

      <title>Quantum entropy and QCD factorization for low-$Q^2$ $\nu$DIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deeply inelastic scattering (DIS) is an essential process for exploring the structure of visible matter and testing the standard model. At the same time, the theoretical interpretation of DIS measurements depends on QCD factorization theorems whose validity deteriorates at the lower values of $Q^2$ and $W^2$ typical of neutrino DIS in accelerator-based oscillation searches. For this reason, progress in understanding the origin and limits of QCD factorization is invaluable to the accuracy and precision of predictions for these upcoming neutrino experiments. In these short proceedings, we introduce a novel approach based on the quantum entropy associated with continuous distributions in QCD, using it to characterize the limits of factorization theorems relevant for the description of neutrino DIS. This work suggests an additional avenue for dissecting factorization-breaking dynamics through the quantum entropy, which could also play a role in quantum simulations of related systems.</description>

Abstract: Four-dimensional asymptotically flat spacetimes have been central to recent developments in infrared physics. Gravitational waves reaching the asymptotic boundary reveal an infinite-dimensional symmetry group known as the Bondi--Metzner--Sachs (BMS) group. The vacuum structure breaks this symmetry, giving rise to Goldstone modes that play a pivotal role in the analysis of scattering amplitudes. However, these modes must be added to the phase space of the metric formulation. In this work, we explore an alternative formulation of general relativity, teleparallel gravity, which is dynamically equivalent to the standard metric description in the bulk. This framework relies on a tetrad field to encode the gravitational degrees of freedom and a flat connection to represent inertial effects. Leveraging this decomposition, we propose a novel encoding of the Goldstone modes within the flat connection. We examine the implications of this approach in the covariant phase space framework, focusing on the symplectic potential and its connection to the Wald--Zoupas prescription.</description>

      <title>Inflation without an Inflaton</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel scenario in which scalar perturbations, that seed the large scale structure of the Universe, are generated without relying on a scalar field (the inflaton). In this framework, inflation is driven by a de Sitter space-time (dS), where tensor metric fluctuations (i.e., gravitational waves) naturally arise from quantum vacuum oscillations, and scalar fluctuations are generated via second-order tensor effects. We compute the power spectrum of such scalar fluctuations and show it to be consistent with near scale-invariance. We derive the necessary conditions under which scalar perturbations become significant and much larger than the tensor modes, and we identify a natural mechanism to end inflation via a transition to a radiation-dominated phase. Our proposed mechanism could remove the need for a model-dependent scenario: the choice of a scalar field, as the inflaton, to drive inflation.</description>

      <title>Many-body spectral transitions through the lens of variable-range SYK2 model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model is a cornerstone in the study of quantum chaos and holographic quantum matter. Real-world implementations, however, deviate from the idealized all-to-all connectivity, raising questions about the robustness of its chaotic properties. In this work, we investigate a quadratic SYK model with distance-dependent interactions governed by a power-law decay. By analytically and numerically studying the spectral form factor (SFF), we uncover how the single particle transitions manifest in the many-body system. While the SFF demonstrates robustness under slightly reduced interaction ranges, further suppression leads to a breakdown of perturbation theory and new spectral regimes, marked by a higher dip and the emergence of a secondary plateau. Our results highlight the interplay between single-particle criticality and many-body dynamics, offering new insights into the quantum chaos-to-localization transition and its reflection in spectral statistics.</description>

      <title>Using SimTeEx to simplify polynomial expressions with tensors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computations with tensors are ubiquitous in fundamental physics, and so is the usage of Einstein's dummy index convention for the contraction of indices. For instance, $T_{ia}U_{aj}$ is readily recognized as the same as $T_{ib}U_{bj}$, but a computer does not know that T[i,a]U[a,j] is equal to T[i,b]U[b,j]. Furthermore, tensors may have symmetries which can be used to simply expressions: if $U_{ij}$ is antisymmetric, then $\alpha T_{ia}U_{aj}+\beta T_{ib}U_{jb}=\left(\alpha-\beta\right)T_{ia}U_{aj}$. The fact that tensors can have elaborate symmetries, together with the problem of dummy indices, makes it complicated to simplify polynomial expressions with tensors. In this work I will present an algorithm for doing so, which was implemented in the Mathematica package SimTeEx (Simplify Tensor Expressions). It can handle any kind of tensor symmetry.</description>

      <title>Quantum Fisher Information Reveals UV-IR Mixing in the Strange Metal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The density-density response in optimally doped Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$ has recently been shown to exhibit conformal symmetry. Using, the experimentally inferred conformal dynamic susceptibility, we compute the resultant quantum Fisher information (QFI), a witness to multi-partite entanglement. In contrast to a Fermi liquid in which the QFI is approximately temperature independent much below the Fermi energy scale, we find that the QFI increases as a power law at low temperatures but ultimately extrapolates to a constant at $T=0$. The constant is of the form, $\omega_g^{2\Delta}$, where $\Delta$ is the conformal dimension and $\omega_g$ is the UV cutoff which is on the order of the pseudogap. As this constant {depends on both UV and IR properties}, it illustrates that multipartite entanglement in a strange metal exhibits UV-IR mixing, a benchmark feature of doped Mott insulators as exemplified by dynamical spectral weight transfer. We conclude with a discussion of the implication of our results for low-energy reductions of the Hubbard model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss a large class of non-relativistic continuum field theories where the Euclidean spatial symmetry of the classical theory is violated in the quantum theory by an Adler-Bell-Jackiw-like anomaly. In particular, the continuous translation symmetry of the classical theory is broken in the quantum theory to a discrete symmetry. Furthermore, that discrete symmetry is extended by an internal symmetry, making it non-Abelian. This presentation streamlines and extends the discussion in [1]. In an Appendix, we present an elementary introduction to 't Hooft and Adler-Bell-Jackiw anomalies using a well-known system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lagrangian multiform theory is a variational framework for integrable systems. In this article we introduce a new formulation which is based on symplectic geometry and which treats position, momentum and time coordinates of a finite-dimensional integrable hierarchy on an equal footing. This formulation allows a streamlined one-step derivation of both the multi-time Euler-Lagrange equations and the closure relation (encoding integrability). We argue that any Lagrangian one-form for a finite-dimensional system can be recast in our new framework. We also show that our new framework easily extends to non-commuting flows corresponding to nonabelian Lie groups. Thus Hamiltonian Lie group actions can be derived from a variational principle.</description>

Abstract: We describe the global structure of a particle model with dark matter called G2HDM, which incorporates a dark sector represented by $SU(2)_{H} \times U(1)_{X}\;$. The gauge group of such model is $\tilde{G}=U(1)_{Y} \times SU(2)_{L} \times SU(3)_{C} \times SU(2)_{H} \times U(1)_{X} \;$, with an ambiguity that it may actually be $G= \tilde{G} / {\Gamma} \;$, where $\Gamma$ is a subgroup of its center. We also describe how the electric and magnetic charges depend on $\Gamma$ and the periodicity of theta angles for any choice of $G$. Finally, we describe the minimal charges that arise after electroweak symmetry breaking for any choice of $\Gamma$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Categorical symmetries have recently been shown to generalize the classification of phases of matter, significantly broadening the traditional Landau paradigm. To test these predictions, we propose a simple spin chain model that encompasses all gapped phases and second-order phase transitions governed by the categorical symmetry $\mathsf{Rep}(D_8)$. This model not only captures the essential features of non-invertible phases but is also straightforward enough to enable practical realization. Specifically, we outline an implementation using neutral atoms trapped in optical tweezer arrays. Employing a dual-species setup and Rydberg blockade, we propose a digital simulation approach that can efficiently implement the many-body evolution in several nontrivial quantum phases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the gravitational perturbations of black holes in quadratic gravity, in which the Einstein-Hilbert term is supplemented by quadratic terms in the curvature tensor. In this class of theories, the Schwarzschild solution can coexist with modified black hole solutions, and both families are radially stable in a wide region of the parameter space. Here we study non-radial perturbations of both families of static, spherically symmetric black holes, computing the quasi-normal modes with axial parity and finding strong numerical evidence for the stability of these solutions under axial perturbations. The perturbation equations describe the propagation of a massless and a massive spin-two fields. We show that the Schwarzschild solution admits the same quasi-normal modes as in general relativity, together with new classes of modes corresponding to the massive spin-two degrees of freedom. The spectrum of the modified black hole solution has the same structure, but all modes are different from those of general relativity. We argue that both classes of modes can be excited in physical processes, suggesting that a characteristic signature of this theory is the presence of massive spin-two modes in the gravitational ringdown, even when the stationary solution is the same as in general relativity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the study of light interacting with QCD axion domain walls from the perspective of the non-linear axion coupling to photons, $g(a) F \tilde F$, which encodes the effects related to the breaking of the axion shift symmetry including the well-known mixing with meson states. As the axion makes an $\mathcal{O}(1)$ excursion of its fundamental period around strings and domain walls, the standard linear coupling to photons is generally insufficient to accurately describe the interaction of light with the defects, and one needs to consider the full structure of $g(a)$. We take this into account in evaluating the friction experienced by axion domain walls moving in a thermal bath of photons, as well as in deriving the birefringent properties of the walls. This clarifies some results in the literature dealing with a special cancellation that takes place for the QCD axion with the electromagnetic and color anomaly as predicted by minimal Grand Unified Theories.</description>

      <title>Primordial Gravitational Wave Probes of Non-Standard Thermal Histories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primordial gravitational waves propagate almost unimpeded from the moment they are generated to the present epoch. Nevertheless, they are subject to convolution with a non-trivial transfer function. Within the standard thermal history, shifts in the temperature-redshift relation combine with damping effects by free streaming neutrinos to non-trivially process different wavelengths during radiation domination, with subsequently negligible effects at later times. Presuming a nearly scale invariant primordial spectrum, one obtains a characteristic late time spectrum, deviations from which would indicate departures from the standard thermal history. Given the paucity of probes of the early universe physics before nucleosynthesis, it is useful to classify how deviations from the standard thermal history of the early universe can be constrained from observations of the late time stochastic background. The late time spectral density has a plateau at high frequencies that can in principle be significantly enhanced or suppressed relative to the standard thermal history depending on the equation of state of the epoch intervening reheating and the terminal phase of radiation domination, imprinting additional features from bursts of entropy production, and additional damping at intermediate scales via anisotropic stress production. In this paper, we survey phenomenologically motivated scenarios of early matter domination, kination, and late time decaying particles as representative non-standard thermal histories, elaborate on their late time stochastic background, and discuss constraints on different model scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the Page curve and resolving the black hole information puzzle in terms of the entanglement dynamics of black holes has been a key question in fundamental physics. In principle, the current quantum computing can provide insights into the entanglement dynamics of black holes within some simplified models. In this regard, we utilize quantum computers to investigate the entropy of Hawking radiation using the qubit transport model, a toy qubit model of black hole evaporation. Specifically, we implement the quantum simulation of the scrambling dynamics in black holes using an efficient random unitary circuit. Furthermore, we employ the swap-based many-body interference protocol for the first time and the randomized measurement protocol to measure the entanglement entropy of Hawking radiation qubits in IBM's superconducting quantum computers. Our findings indicate that while both entanglement entropy measurement protocols accurately estimate the R\'enyi entropy in numerical simulation, the randomized measurement protocol has a particular advantage over the swap-based many-body interference protocol in IBM's superconducting quantum computers. Finally, by incorporating quantum error mitigation techniques, we establish that the current quantum computers are robust tools for measuring the entanglement entropy of complex quantum systems and can probe black hole dynamics within simplified toy qubit models.</description>

      <title>Vertex algebras with big center and a Kazhdan-Lusztig Correspondence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.13337v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Certain deformable families of vertex algebras acquire at a limit of the deformation parameter a large center, similar to affine Lie algebras at critical level. Then the vertex algebra and its representation category become a bundle over the variety defined by this large center. The zero-fibre becomes a vertex algebra, the other fibres become twisted modules over this vertex algebra.
  We explore these ideas and a conjectural correspondence in a class of vertex algebras $A^{(p)}[\mathfrak{g},\kappa]$ associated to a choice of a finite-dimensional semisimple Lie algebra and an integer $(\mathfrak{g},p)$ and a level $\kappa$, and some related algebras. These algebras were introduced under the name quantum geometric Langlands kernels and have an interpretation in 4-dimensional quantum field theory. In the limit $\kappa\to \infty$, they acquire a large central subalgebra identified with the ring of functions on the space of $\mathfrak{g}$-connections. The zero fibre is expected to be the Feigin-Tipunin algebra $W_p(\mathfrak{g})$, whose category of representations is expected to be equivalent to the small quantum group by the logarithmic Kazhdan Lusztig conjecture.
  Our rigorous results focus on the cases $(\mathfrak{g},1)$ and $(\mathfrak{sl}_2,2)$. In the first part of the paper, which might be of independent interest, we discuss the twisted modules (including twists by unipotent elements) of the affine Lie algebra and of the triplet algebra $W_2(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$, and introduce a method of twisted free field realization to obtain twisted modules for arbitrary $(\mathfrak{g},p)$. We also match our findings to the respective quantum group with big center. In the second part of the paper we match the results to the vertex algebra bundle we compute from the limit of $A^{(p)}[\mathfrak{g},\kappa]$, which in our cases have realizations as GKO coset resp. N=4 superconformal algebras.</description>

      <title>A note on the bulk interpretation of the Quantum Extremal Surface formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.03193v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Defining quantum information quantities directly in bulk quantum gravity is a difficult problem due to the fluctuations of spacetime. Some progress was made recently in \cite{Mertens:2022ujr}, which provided a bulk interpretation of the Bekenstein Hawking formula for two sided BTZ black holes in terms of the entanglement entropy of gravitational edge modes. We generalize those results to give a bulk entanglement entropy interpretation of the quantum extremal surface formula in AdS3 gravity, as applied to a single interval in the boundary theory. Our computation further supports the proposal that AdS3 gravity can be viewed as a topological phase in which the bulk gravity edge modes are anyons transforming under the quantum group $\SL^{+}_{q}(2,\mathbb{R})$. These edge modes appear when we cut open the Euclidean path integral along bulk co-dimension 2 slices, and satisfies a shrinkable boundary condition which ensures that the Gibbons-Hawking calculation gives the correct state counting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08969v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new factorization pattern for tree-level Yang-Mills (YM) amplitudes, where they decompose into a sum of gluings of two lower-point amplitudes by setting specific two-point non-planar Mandelstam variables within a rectangular configuration to zero. This approach manifests the hidden zeros of YM amplitudes recently identified. Furthermore, by setting specific Lorentz products involving polarization vectors to zero, the amplitudes further reduce to a sum of products of three currents. These novel factorizations provide a fresh perspective on the structure of YM amplitudes, potentially enhancing our understanding and calculation of these fundamental quantities.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic structure of scalar-Maxwell theory at the null boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13866v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply the Hamiltonian formalism to investigate the massless sector of scalar field theory coupled with Maxwell electrodynamics through the Pontryagin term. Specifically, we analyze asymptotic symmetries at the null infinity of this theory, conserved charges, and their algebra. We find that the theory possesses asymptotic shift symmetries of the fields not present in the bulk manifold coming from the zero modes of the symplectic matrix of constraints. Consequently, we conclude that the real scalar field also contains asymptotic symmetries previously found in the literature by a different approach. We show that these symmetries are the origin of the electric-magnetic duality in electromagnetism with the topological Pontryagin term, and obtain non-trivial central extension between the electric and magnetic conserved charges. Finally, we examine the full interacting theory and find that, due to the interaction, the symmetry generators are more difficult to identify among the constraints, such that we obtain them in the weak-coupling limit. We find that the asymptotic structure of the theory simplifies due to a fast fall-off of the scalar field, leading to decoupled scalar and Maxwell asymptotic sectors, and losing the electric-magnetic duality.</description>

Abstract: We examine the giant graviton expansions of the Coulomb and Higgs indices for the M2-brane SCFTs to find the closed-form expressions for the indices that encode the spectra of the $1/4$-BPS M5-brane giant gravitons and the $1/3$-BPS orbifold M5-brane giant gravitons. Consequently, we get exact forms of the twisted indices for the 6d $(2,0)$ theories describing a stack of $N$ M5-branes which generalize the unrefined indices. We confirm that they are also beautifully expanded with respect to the indices for the M2-brane giant gravitons which are obtained from the Coulomb and Higgs indices for the M2-brane SCFTs upon the change of variables.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08720v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The theory of a free spin-2 field on Minkowski spacetime has 1-form and $(d-3)$-form symmetries associated with conserved currents formed by contractions of the linearised Riemann tensor with conformal Killing-Yano 2-forms. We show that a subset of these can be interpreted as Noether currents for specific shift symmetries of the graviton that involve a Killing vector and a closed 1-form parameter. We give a systematic method to gauge these 1-form symmetries by coupling the currents to background gauge fields and introducing a particular set of counter-terms involving the background fields. The simultaneous gauging of certain pairs of 1-form and $(d-3)$-form symmetries is obstructed by the presence of mixed 't Hooft anomalies. The anomalous pairs of symmetries are those which are related by gravitational duality. The implications of these anomalies are discussed.</description>

      <title>Massless fermions in uniform flux background on $T^2\times R$: Vacuum quantum numbers from single-particle filled modes using lattice regulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19984v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantum numbers of monopoles in $R^3$ in the presence of massless fermions have been analyzed using a uniform flux background in $S^2\times R$ coupled to fermions. An analogous study in $T^2\times R$ is performed by studying the discrete symmetries of the Dirac Hamiltonian in the presence of a static uniform field on $T^2$ with a total flux of $Q$ in the continuum. The degenerate ground states are classified based on their transformation properties under $\frac{\pi}{2}$ rotations of $T^2$ that leave the background field invariant. We find that the lattice analysis with overlap fermions exactly reproduces the transformation properties of the single particle zero modes in the continuum. Whereas the transformation properties of the single particle negative energy states can be studied in the continuum and the lattice, we are also able to study the transformation properties and the particle number (charge) of the many-body ground state on a finite lattice, and we show that the contributions from the fully filled single-particle states cannot be ignored.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23837v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We conduct a mode analysis of a general U(1)-charged first-order relativistic hydrodynamics within the framework of the effective field theory of dissipative fluids in a Minkowski background. The most general quadratic action for collective excitations around hydrodynamic solutions -- specifically, the Nambu-Goldstone (NG) modes associated with the symmetry-breaking pattern induced by external fields -- is derived. It is found that the hydrodynamical frame invariants write the first-order dispersion relations in the low energy limit. In thermodynamical viscous fluids realized by integrating out fast modes, unitarity and local KMS symmetry for its underlying UV theory are guaranteed. Then, we find that first-order hydrodynamics are stable if the null energy condition is satisfied. As the NG modes nonlinearly realize the diffeomorphism symmetries, our mode analysis is valid in any coordinate systems, including Lorentz-transformed references. We also comment on the causal structure for the diffusive modes based on the retarded Green functions for the stochastic NG mode.</description>

      <title>Finite Landscape of 6d N=(1,0) Supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19155v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a bottom-up argument showing that the number of massless fields in six-dimensional quantum gravitational theories with eight supercharges is uniformly bounded. Specifically, we show that the number of tensor multiplets is bounded by $T\leq 193$, and the rank of the gauge group is restricted to $r(V)\leq 480$. Given that F-theory compactifications on elliptic CY 3-folds are a subset, this provides a bound on the Hodge numbers of elliptic CY 3-folds: $h^{1,1}({\rm CY_3})\leq 491$, $h^{1,1}({\rm Base})\leq 194$ which are saturated by special elliptic CY 3-folds. This establishes that our bounds are sharp and also provides further evidence for the string lamppost principle. These results are derived by a comprehensive examination of the boundaries of the tensor moduli branch, showing that any consistent supergravity theory with $T\neq0$ must include a BPS string in its spectrum corresponding to a "little string theory" (LST) or a critical heterotic string. From this tensor branch analysis, we establish a containment relationship between SCFTs and LSTs embedded within a gravitational theory. Combined with the classification of 6d SCFTs and LSTs, this then leads to the above bounds. Together with previous works, this establishes the finiteness of the supergravity landscape for $d\geq 6$.</description>

      <title>Compactification on Calabi-Yau threefolds: Consistent truncation to pure supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00186v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study compactifications of eleven- and ten-dimensional maximal supergravity on Calabi-Yau threefolds. We explicitly construct truncations to pure supergravity with eight supercharges in five and four dimensions and show that they are consistent, i.e. that every solution of the lower-dimensional equations of motion fully solves the higher-dimensional ones. We furthermore match the supersymmetry transformations and demonstrate the consistency to full non-linear order in fermions. Our construction is independent of the choice of Calabi-Yau threefold and only involves the universal structures such as the K\"ahler form and the holomorphic three-form, in agreement with implicit constructions in the generalised geometry literature. As an immediate application, we embed four-dimensional extremal black holes in the higher-dimensional supergravities. We furthermore propose Ans\"atze for consistent truncations on all universal structures, leading to supergravities with additional matter multiples. An extensive list of equations of motion and supersymmetry transformations for various supergravity theories is provided in the appendix.</description>

Abstract: The current flow of high accuracy astrophysical data, among which are the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) measurements by the Planck satellite, offers an unprecedented opportunity to constrain the inflationary theory. This is however a challenging project given the size of the inflationary landscape which contains hundreds of different scenarios. Given that there is currently no observational evidence for primordial non-Gaussianities, isocurvature perturbations or any other non-minimal extension of the inflationary paradigm, a reasonable approach is to consider the simplest models first, namely the slow-roll single field models with minimal kinetic terms. This still leaves us with a very populated landscape, the exploration of which requires new and efficient strategies. It has been customary to tackle this problem by means of approximate model independent methods while a more ambitious alternative is to study the inflationary scenarios one by one. We have developed the publicly available runtime library ASPIC to implement this last approach. The ASPIC code provides all routines needed to quickly derive reheating-consistent observable predictions within this class of scenarios. ASPIC has been designed as an evolutive code which presently supports 118 different models. In this paper, for each of the ASPIC models, we present and collect new results in a systematic manner, thereby constituting the first Encyclopaedia Inflationaris.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1308.0100v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new unified formulation of the current algebra theory in terms of supergeometry. We take a QP-structure, i.e. a differential graded symplectic structure, on a graded cotangent bundle as a fundamental framework. A Poisson bracket in a current algebra is constructed by the so called derived bracket of the graded Poisson structure induced from the above symplectic structure. By taking a canonical transformation on a QP-manifold, correct anomalous terms in physical theories are derived. A large class of current algebras with and without anomalous terms are constructed from this structure. Moreover, a new class of current algebras related higher structures are obtained systematically.</description>

Abstract: The axion, originally postulated by Peccei and Quinn to solve the strong CP problem, has become of great interest in particle and astroparticle phenomenology. Yet it has a problem. It is widely assumed that the axion leaves the nonperturbative features of QCD unscathed. This is, however, not the case. On the contrary, the axion extension is found to be in conflict with seminal results on the low-energy properties of QCD. The key is that the anomalous coupling of the axion to the gauge bosons can be integrated out, leaving behind a path integral over topologically trivial gauge potentials.</description>

Abstract: Expanding the results of [1], [2], [3], we demonstrate a network of algebraic connections between six well-known particle theories. These are the Spin(10) model, the Georgi-Glashow model, the Pati-Salam model, the Left-Right Symmetric model, the Standard Model both pre- and post-Higgs mechanism.
  A new inclusion of a quaternionic reflection within the network further differentiates $W^{\pm}$ bosons from the $Z^0$ boson in comparison to the Standard Model. It may introduce subtle new considerations for the phenomenology of electroweak symmetry breaking.</description>

      <title>Quantum reference frames, measurement schemes and the type of local algebras in quantum field theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11973v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop an operational framework, combining relativistic quantum measurement theory with quantum reference frames (QRFs), in which local measurements of a quantum field on a background with symmetries are performed relative to a QRF. This yields a joint algebra of quantum-field and reference-frame observables that is invariant under the natural action of the group of spacetime isometries. For the appropriate class of quantum reference frames, this algebra is parameterised in terms of crossed products. Provided that the quantum field has good thermal properties (expressed by the existence of a KMS state at some nonzero temperature), one can use modular theory to show that the invariant algebra admits a semifinite trace. If furthermore the quantum reference frame has good thermal behaviour (expressed in terms of the properties of a KMS weight) at the same temperature, this trace is finite. We give precise conditions for the invariant algebra of physical observables to be a type $II_1$ factor. Our results build upon recent work of Chandrasekaran, Longo, Penington and Witten [JHEP $\mathbf{2023}$, 82 (2023)], providing both a significant mathematical generalisation of these findings and a refined operational understanding of their model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11319v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe a general procedure for computing renormalized curvature integrals on Poincar\'e-Einstein manifolds. In particular, we explain the connection between the Gauss-Bonnet-type formulas of Albin and Chang-Qing-Yang for the renormalized volume, and explicitly identify a scalar conformal invariant in the latter formula. Our approach constructs scalar conformal invariants of weight $-n$ on $n$-manifolds, $n \geq 8$, that are natural divergences; these imply that the scalar invariant in the Chang-Qing-Yang formula is not unique in dimension $n \geq 8$. Our procedure also produces explicit conformally invariant Gauss--Bonnet-type formulas for compact Einstein manifolds.</description>

      <title>Derivative coupling enables genuine entanglement harvesting in causal communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14637v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that particle detectors coupled to a massless quantum field through its derivative can genuinely harvest entanglement form the field even when they are in causal contact in flat spacetime. This is particularly relevant since the derivative coupling model captures some interesting experimentally realizable systems and since the harvested entanglement peaks at full light contact.</description>

      <title>New renormalization group study of the 3-state Potts model and related statistical models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15497v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The critical behavior of three-state statistical models invariant under the full symmetry group $S_3$ and its dependence on space dimension have been a matter of interest and debate. In particular, the phase transition of the 3-state Potts model in three dimensions is believed to be of the first order, without a definitive proof of absence of scale invariance in three-dimensional field theory with $S_3$ symmetry. This scale invariance should appear as a non-trivial fixed point of the renormalization group, which has not been found. Our new search, with the non-perturbative renormalization group, finds such a fixed point, as a bifurcation from the trivial fixed point at the critical space dimension $d=10/3$, which extends continuously to $d=3$. It does not correspond to a second-order phase transition of the 3-state Potts model, but is interesting in its own right. In particular, it shows how the $\varepsilon$-expansion can fail.</description>

      <title>Black Holes, Warp Drives, and Energy Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04495v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Following the work of H. Ellis, we study warp drives in the gravitational field of a Schwarzschild black hole. We find that as long as the warp drive crosses the black hole horizon at a subluminal speed, the horizon would be effectively absent inside the warp bubble. Moreover, we discover that the black hole's gravitational field can alleviate the violations of the weak energy condition (WEC) and the null energy condition (NEC) and therefore decrease the amount of negative energy required to sustain a warp drive, which may be instrumental for creating microscopic warp drives in lab experiments. We also consider the thermodynamics of a warp bubble interacting with a black hole and point out some paradoxes that may indicate a gap in our understanding of them from the thermodynamic point of view.</description>

      <title>Symmetric Mass Generation with four SU(2) doublet fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02062v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a single exactly massless staggered fermion in the fundamental representation of an $SU(2)$ gauge group. We utilize an nHYP-smeared fermion action supplemented with additional heavy Pauli-Villars fields which serve to decrease lattice artifacts. The phase diagram exhibits a clear two-phase structure with a conformal phase at weak coupling and a novel new phase, the Symmetric Mass Generation (SMG) phase, appearing at strong coupling. The SMG phase is confining with all states gapped and chiral symmetry unbroken. Our finite size scaling analysis provides strong evidence that the phase transition between these two phases is continuous, which would allow for the existence of a continuum SMG phase. Furthermore, the RG flows are consistent with a $\beta$-function that vanishes quadratically at the new fixed point suggesting that the $N_f=4$ flavor SU(2) gauge theory lies at the opening of the conformal window.</description>

      <title>Remarks on a nonlinear electromagnetic extension in AdS Reissner-Nordstr\"om spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23165v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the gravitational properties of a nonlinear electromagnetic extension of an AdS Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole. Our study begins with an analysis of the metric function and horizon structure, followed by calculations of the Ricci and Kretschmann scalars and an evaluation of the non-vanishing Christoffel symbols. These calculations allow us to examine geodesics and their influence on the photon sphere, shadow formation, and bending angle. In the thermodynamic framework, we evaluate essential quantities, including the Hawking temperature, entropy, heat capacity, Gibbs free energy, and Hawking radiation emission. We further investigate black hole evaporation by estimating the evaporation timescale as the black hole approaches its final state. Additionally, quasinormal modes for scalar and vector perturbations are computed using the WKB approximation to characterize oscillatory behavior of the system. Finally, a time-domain analysis is provided in order to examine the evolution of these perturbations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06718v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the flavour sector of the supersymmetric $SU(5)$ Grand Unified Theory (GUT) model using machine learning techniques. The minimal $SU(5)$ model is known to predict fermion masses that disagree with observed values in nature. There are two well-known approaches to address this issue: one involves introducing a 45-representation Higgs field, while the other employs a higher-dimensional operator involving the 24-representation GUT Higgs field. We compare these two approaches by numerically optimising a loss function, defined as the ratio of determinants of mass matrices. Our findings indicate that the 24-Higgs approach achieves the observed fermion masses with smaller modifications to the original minimal $SU(5)$ model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12628v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This collection of perspective pieces captures recent advancements and reflections from a dynamic research community dedicated to bridging quantum gravity, hydrodynamics, and emergent cosmology. It explores four key research areas: (a) the interplay between hydrodynamics and cosmology, including analog gravity systems; (b) phase transitions, continuum limits and emergent geometry in quantum gravity; (c) relational perspectives in gravity and quantum gravity; and (d) the emergence of cosmological models rooted in quantum gravity frameworks. Each contribution presents the distinct perspectives of its respective authors. Additionally, the introduction by the editors proposes an integrative view, suggesting how these thematic units could serve as foundational pillars for a novel theoretical cosmology framework termed "hydrodynamics on superspace".</description>

      <title>Anisotropy in the cosmic acceleration inferred from supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14758v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Under the assumption that they are standard(isable) candles, the lightcurves of Type Ia supernovae have been analyzed in the framework of the standard Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker cosmology to conclude that the expansion rate of the Universe is accelerating due to dark energy. While the original claims in the late 1990s were made using overlapping samples of less than 100 supernovae in total, catalogues of nearly 2000 supernovae are now available. In light of recent developments such as the cosmic dipole anomaly and the larger than expected bulk flow in the local Universe (which does not converge to the Cosmic Rest Frame), we analyze the newer datasets using a Maximum Likelihood Estimator and find that the acceleration of the expansion rate of the Universe is unequivocally anisotropic. The associated debate in the literature highlights the artifices of using supernovae as standardisable candles, while also providing deeper insights into a consistent relativistic view of peculiar motions as departures from the Hubble expansion of the Universe. The effects of our being `tilted observers' embedded in a deep bulk flow may have been mistaken for cosmic acceleration.</description>

      <title>Twisted vertex algebra modules for irregular connections: A case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16272v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A vertex algebra with an action of a group $G$ comes with a notion of $g$-twisted modules, forming a $G$-crossed braided tensor category. For a Lie group $G$, one might instead wish for a notion of $(\mathrm{d}+A)$-twisted modules for any $\mathfrak{g}$-connection on the formal punctured disc. For connections with a regular singularity, this reduces to $g$-twisted modules, where $g$ is the monodromy around the puncture. The case of an irregular singularity is much richer and involved, and we are not aware that it has appeared in vertex algebra language. The present article is intended to spark such a treatment, by providing a list of expectations and an explicit worked-through example with interesting applications.
  Concretely, we consider the vertex super algebra of symplectic fermions, or equivalently the triplet vertex algebra $\mathcal{W}_p(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ for $p=2$, and study its twisted module with respect to irregular $\mathfrak{sl}_2$-connections. We first determine the category of representations, depending on the formal type of the connection. Then we prove that a Sugawara type construction gives a Virasoro action and we prove that as Virasoro modules our representations are direct sums of Whittaker modules.
  Conformal field theory with irregular singularities resp. wild ramification appear in the context of geometric Langlands correspondence, and in particular in work by Witten, higher dimensional field theories and AGT correspondence. Our original motivation comes from semiclassical limits of the generalized quantum Langlands kernel, which fibres over the space of connections [FL24], similar to the affine Lie algebra at critical level. Our present article now describes, in the smallest case, the fibres of this category over irregular connections.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19696v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Euler discriminant of a family of very affine varieties is defined as the locus where the Euler characteristic drops. In this work, we study the Euler discriminant of families of complements of hyperplanes. We prove that the Euler discriminant is a hypersurface in the space of coefficients, and provide its defining equation in two cases: (1) when the coefficients are generic, and (2) when they are constrained to a proper subspace. In the generic case, we show that the multiplicities of the components can be recovered combinatorially. This analysis also recovers the singularities of an Euler integral. In the appendix, we discuss a relation to cosmological correlators.</description>

      <title>Entanglement asymmetry in periodically driven quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03654v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of entanglement asymmetry in periodically driven quantum systems. Using a periodically driven XY chain as a model for a driven integrable quantum system, we provide semi-analytic results for the behavior of the dynamics of the entanglement asymmetry, $\Delta S$, as a function of the drive frequency. Our analysis identifies special drive frequencies at which the driven XY chain exhibits dynamic symmetry restoration and displays quantum Mpemba effect over a long timescale; we identify an emergent approximate symmetry in its Floquet Hamiltonian which plays a crucial role for realization of both these phenomena. We follow these results by numerical computation of $\Delta S$ for the non-integrable driven Rydberg atom chain and obtain similar emergent-symmetry-induced symmetry restoration and quantum Mpemba effect in the prethermal regime for such a system. Finally, we provide an exact analytic computation of the entanglement asymmetry for a periodically driven conformal field theory (CFT) on a strip. Such a driven CFT, depending on the drive amplitude and frequency, exhibits two distinct phases, heating and non-heating, that are separated by a critical line. Our results show that for $m$ cycles of a periodic drive with time period $T$, $\Delta S \sim \ln mT$ [$\ln (\ln mT)$] in the heating phase [on the critical line] for a generic CFT; in contrast, in the non-heating phase, $\Delta S$ displays small amplitude oscillations around it's initial value as a function of $mT$. We provide a phase diagram for the behavior of $\Delta S$ for such driven CFTs as a function of the drive frequency and amplitude.</description>

      <title>Extended Poincare Symmetry Dictates Massive Scattering Amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03762v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We identify an extended Poincare symmetry $ISO(2) \times ISO(3,1)$ for on-shell massive scattering amplitudes, transforming under the $U(2)$ Little group symmetry. Thus the one-particle state involves in both spin and transversality $t$ (related to chirality), and the spin-spinors are extended to the spin-transverality spinors. The massive spin-$s$ spinors with different transversality can be related by the $SO(5,1)$ symmetry, although the $U(2)$ Little group breaks the symmetry explicitly. The three-point massive amplitudes can be fully determined from the $T^\pm$ and $m$ generators, diagrammatically denoted as the mass insertion and chirality flip, which provide correspondence between massless ultraviolet and massive chiral-eigenstate amplitudes. Thus the massless on-shell technique can be utilized to construct higher-point tree- and loop-level massive amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Bayesian evidence for two peaks in the sound speed in cold dense QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08760v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I show that in addition to the well-known peak inside massive neutron stars, the sound speed in cold dense QCD matter likely exhibits another peak above neutron star densities before it asymptotes to $c_s=\sqrt{C_s}=\sqrt{1/3}$. Based on the framework reported in arxiv:2408.16738, this approach does not rely on any assumption about the ultra-dense matter not realized in nature. Current multimessenger observation of neutron stars favors the two-peak scenario with a Bayes factor $5.1_{-0.7}^{+0.9}$, where the uncertainties are systematics due to models of neutron star inner cores. This evidence grows to $27_{-8}^{+11}$ if the $2.6M_\odot$ component of GW190814 is a neutron star. The trough in $C_s$ separating the two peaks is inferred to be below $0.05^{+0.04}_{-0.02}$ (at the $50\%$ level) if $2.6M_\odot$ neutron stars exist. The second peak above $1/3$ beyond baryon chemical potential $\mu_B=1.6-1.9$ GeV most likely signals non-perturbative effects in cold quark matter, for instance color superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Parastatistics and a secret communication challenge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13360v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the most unconventional features of topological phases of matter is the emergence of quasiparticles with exotic statistics, such as non-Abelian anyons in two dimensional systems. Recently, a different type of exotic particle statistics that is consistently defined in any dimension, called parastatistics, is also shown to be possible in a special family of topological phases. However, the physical significance of emergent parastatistics still remains elusive. Here we demonstrate a distinctive physical consequence of parastatistics by proposing a challenge game that can only be won using physical systems hosting paraparticles, as passing the challenge requires the two participating players to secretly communicate in an indirect way by exploiting the nontrivial exchange statistics of the quasiparticles. The winning strategy using emergent paraparticles is robust against noise, as well as the most relevant class of eavesdropping via local measurements. This provides both an operational definition and an experimental identity test for paraparticles, alongside a potential application in secret communication.</description>
