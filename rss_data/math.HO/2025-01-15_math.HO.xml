      <title>Operators in the mind: Jan Lukasiewicz and Polish notation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1929 Jan Lukasiewicz used, apparently for the first time, his Polish notation to represent the operations of formal logic. This is a parenthesis-free notation, which also implies that logical functions are operators preceding the variables on which they act. In the 1980s, within the framework of research into mathematical models on the parallel processing of neural systems, a group of operators emerged -- neurally inspired and based on matrix algebra -- which computed logical operations automatically. These matrix operators reproduce the order of operators and variables of Polish notation. These logical matrices can also generate a three-valued logic with broad similarities to Lukasiewicz's three-valued logic. In this paper, a parallel is drawn between relevant formulas represented in Polish notation, and their counterparts in terms of neurally based matrix operators. Lukasiewicz's three-valued logic, shown in Polish notation has several points of contact with what matrices produce when they process uncertain truth vectors. This formal parallelism opens up scientific and philosophical perspectives that deserve to be further explored.</description>

      <title>Max/Min Puzzles in Geometry II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.08352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.08352v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we continue the investigation of finding the max/min polygons which can be inscribed in a given triangle. Here we are concerned with equilateral triangles. This may seem uninteresting or benign at first, but there are some surprises later.</description>
