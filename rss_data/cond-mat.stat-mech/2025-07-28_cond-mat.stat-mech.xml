      <title>Quantifying Coupled Dynamics in Phase-Space from State Distribution Snapshots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We quantify nonlinear interactions between coupled complex processes, when the system is subject to noise and not all its components are measurable. Our method is applicable even when the system cannot be continuously monitored over time, but is rather observed only in snapshots. Having only partial information about the local topology of the network and observations of relevant interacting variables is sufficient to translate qualitative knowledge of interactions into a quantitative characterization of the coupled dynamics. This approach turns a globally intractable problem into a sequence of solvable inference problems, to quantify complex interaction networks from incomplete snapshots of their statistical state.</description>

      <title>Kibble-Zurek mechanism for dissipative discrete time crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM) holds for open systems transitioning from a disordered phase to a discrete time crystal (DTC). Specifically, we observe the main signatures of the KZM when the system is quenched into a DTC, which are the characteristic power-law scaling with quench time of the number of spatial defects and the transition delay measured from the time at which the system crosses the critical point. We show analytically that this universal behavior can be traced back to how systems that can be mapped onto a dissipative linear parametric oscillator (DLPO) satisfy the adiabatic-impulse (AI) approximation, evinced by the divergence of the relaxation time of the DLPO near a critical point. We verify our predictions in both the classical and quantum regimes by considering two systems: the Sine-Gordon model, which is a paradigmatic system for emulating classical DTCs; and the open Dicke lattice model, an array of spin-boson systems subjected to quantum fluctuations. For both systems, the DTCs can be tuned from a ferromagnetic to an antiferromagnetic order by varying the driving frequency, thus allowing us to test the validity of KZM for arbitrary spatiotemporal ordering.</description>

      <title>$1/f^{3/2}$ Power Spectrum at the Phonon Bottleneck</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The common observation of a `$1/f^\alpha$' power spectrum with $\alpha&lt;2$ constitutes one of the enduring mysteries of condensed matter physics. Here it is shown that a $1/f^{\alpha}$ power spectrum, with $\alpha = 3/2$, can arise when an ensemble of two--level systems is coupled to a heat bath by means of a system of Bosonic quasiparticles. The model considered is the classic model of Faughnan and Strandberg of the phonon bottleneck, and the anomalous relaxation is associated with an approximate non-equilibrium steady state of the phonons maintained by slow spin relaxation. It is shown that a frequency-dependent susceptibility can be defined in the steady state and that the prediction $\alpha=3/2$, or the equivalent stretched exponential relaxation with exponent $\beta = 2-\alpha = 1/2$, is consistent with existing experimental data. These results give an insight into the origins of anomalous relaxation in condensed matter and the practical behaviour of two-level systems.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions in voting simulated by an intelligent Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Voting is an important social activity for expressing public opinions. By conceptually considering a group of voting agents to be intelligent matter, the impact of real-time information on voting results is quantitatively studied by an intelligent Ising model, which is formed by adding nonlinear instantaneous feedback of the overall magnetization to the conventional Ising model. In the new model, the interaction strength becomes a variable depending on the total magnetization rather than a constant, which mimics the scenario that the decision of an individual during vote influenced by the dynamically changing polling result during the election process. Our analytical derivations along with Mote Carlo simulations reveal that, with a positive feedback, the intelligent Ising model exhibits phase transitions at any finite temperatures, a feature lacked in the conventional one-dimensional Ising model. In all dimensions, by varying the feedback strength, the system changes from going through a second-order phase transition to going through a first-order phase transition with increasing temperature, and the two types of phase transitions are connected by a tricritical point. This study on the one hand demonstrates that the intelligent matter with a nonlinear adaptive interaction can exhibit qualitatively different phase behaviors from conventional matter, and on the other hand shows that, during voting, even unbiased feedback may possibly induce spontaneous symmetry breaking, leading to a biased outcome where one side of the vote becomes favored.</description>

      <title>Eliminating leading and subleading corrections to scaling in the three-dimensional XY universality class</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the $(q+1)$-state clock model on the simple cubic lattice by using Monte Carlo simulations. In addition to the nearest neighbor coupling we consider a next-to-next-to-nearest neighbor coupling. For a certain range of the parameters, the phase transition of the model shares the XY universality class. Leading corrections to scaling are studied by using finite size scaling of dimensionless quantities, such as the Binder cumulant $U_4$. The spatial unisotropy, which causes subleading corrections, is studied by computing the exponential correlation length $\xi_{exp}$ in the high temperature phase for different directions. In the case of the $q$-state clock model it turns out that by tuning the ratio of the two coupling constants, we can eliminate either leading or subleading corrections to scaling. These points on the critical line are close to each other. Hence in the improved model, where leading corrections to scaling vanish, also subleading corrections are small. By using a finite size scaling analysis of our high statistics data we obtain $\eta=0.03816(2)$ and $y_t =1/\nu=1.48872(5)$ as estimates of the critical exponents.</description>

      <title>Time-energy tradeoff in stochastic resetting using optimal control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19387v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic resetting is a driving mechanism that is known to minimize the first passage time to reach a target, at the cost of energy expenditure. The choice of the physical implementation of each resetting event determines the tradeoff between the acceleration of the search process and its energetic cost. Here, we present an optimal transport protocol that balances the duration and the energetic cost of each resetting event. This protocol drives a harmonically trapped Brownian particle between two equilibrium states within a finite time and with minimal energetic cost. An explicit comparison with other types of finite-time protocols further shows its specific thermodynamic properties. Its cost is both a lower bound on the cost of unoptimized shortcut protocols and an upper bound on the cost of optimal protocols which do not ensure final equilibrium. When applying the optimal transport protocol to implement stochastic resetting, a single lower time-energy bound is reached: this protocol allows to reach the best tradeoff between energetic cost and search time.</description>

      <title>Correspondence principle, dissipation, and Ginibre ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The correspondence between quantum and classical behavior has been essential since the advent of quantum mechanics. This principle serves as a cornerstone for understanding quantum chaos, which has garnered increased attention due to its strong impact in various theoretical and experimental fields. When dissipation is considered, quantum chaos takes concepts from isolated quantum chaos to link classical chaotic motion with spectral correlations of Ginibre ensembles. This correspondence was first identified in periodically kicked systems with damping, but it has been shown to break down in dissipative atom-photon systems [Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 240404 (2024)]. In this contribution, we revisit the original kicked model and perform a systematic exploration across a broad parameter space, reaching a genuine semiclassical limit. Our results demonstrate that the correspondence principle, as defined through this spectral connection, fails even in this prototypical system. These findings provide conclusive evidence that Ginibre spectral correlations are neither a robust nor a universal diagnostic of dissipative quantum chaos.</description>

      <title>Average-computation benchmarking for local expectation values in digital quantum devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As quantum devices progress towards a quantum advantage regime, they become harder to benchmark. A particularly relevant challenge is to assess the quality of the whole computation, beyond testing the performance of each single operation. Here we introduce a scheme for this task that combines the target computation with variants of it, which, when averaged, allow for classically solvable correlation functions. Importantly, the variants exactly preserve the circuit architecture and depth, without simplifying the gates into a classically-simulable set. The method is based on replacing each gate by an ensemble of similar gates, which when averaged together form space-time channels [P. Kos and G. Styliaris, Quantum 7, 1020 (2023)]. We introduce explicit constructions for ensembles producing such channels, all applicable to arbitrary brickwork circuits, and provide a general recipe to find new ones through semidefinite programming. The resulting average computation retains important information about the original circuit and is able to detect noise beyond a Clifford benchmarking regime. Moreover, we provide evidence that estimating average-computation expectation values requires running only a limited number of different circuit realizations.</description>

      <title>Chaotic signatures in free field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider free scalar relativistic field theory in finite volume taken out-of-equilibrium and show how the chaotic behavior emerges in such a quantum system for particular quench protocols. Namely, we show that for the operator local quench, correlation functions exhibit statistical properties quite close to that of the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble of random matrices. Moreover, we show that the spectral form factor for the excited state after the local quench reveals a dip-ramp-plateau structure which also supports our conjecture. Finally, we show that the spectral form factor computed directly from the spectrum clearly demonstrates this structure as well.</description>

      <title>Continuous and discontinuous shape transitions in the spatial distribution of self-propelling particles in power-law potential wells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the stationary states of an active Brownian particle and run-and-tumble particle in a two dimensional power-law potential well, in the limit where translational diffusion is negligible. The potential energy of the particle is taken to have the form $U(r)\propto r^{n}$, where $n\geq 2$ and even. We derive an exact equation for the positional probability distribution $\phi({\bf r})$ in two dimensions, and solve for the same, under the assumption that the particle's orientation angle is a Gaussian variable. We show that $\phi({\bf r})$ has compact support and undergoes a phase transition-like change in shape as the active velocity increases. For active Brownian particle, our theory predicts a continuous transition in shape for $n=2$ and a discontinuous transition for $n&gt;2$, both of which agree with simulation results. In the strongly active regime, the orientational probability distribution is unimodal near the outer boundary but becomes bimodal towards the interior, signifying orbiting motion. The unimodal-bimodal transition in the angular distribution is nearly absent for run-and-tumble particle.</description>

      <title>Cosmic-ray transport in inhomogeneous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A theory of cosmic-ray transport in multi-phase diffusive media is developed, with the specific application to cases in which the cosmic-ray diffusion coefficient has large spatial fluctuations that may be inherently multi-scale. We demonstrate that the resulting transport of cosmic rays is diffusive in the long-time limit, with an average diffusion coefficient equal to the harmonic mean of the spatially varying diffusion coefficient. Thus, cosmic-ray transport is dominated by areas of low diffusion even if these areas occupy a relatively small, but not infinitesimal, fraction of the volume. On intermediate time scales, the cosmic rays experience transient effective sub-diffusion, as a result of low-diffusion regions interrupting long flights through high-diffusion regions. In the simplified case of a two-phase medium, we show that the extent and extremity of the sub-diffusivity of cosmic-ray transport is controlled by the spectral exponent of the distribution of patch sizes of each of the phases. We finally show that, despite strongly influencing the confinement times, the multi-phase medium is only capable of altering the energy dependence of cosmic-ray transport when there is a moderate (but not excessive) level of perpendicular diffusion across magnetic-field lines.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore a pulse-based variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm for Rydberg atoms in optical tweezer arrays and evaluate its performance on prototypical quantum spin models. We numerically demonstrate that the ground states of the one-dimensional antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model and the mixed-field Ising model can be accurately prepared using an adaptive update algorithm that randomly segments pulse sequences, for systems of up to ten qubits. Furthermore, we propose and validate a hybrid scheme that integrates this pulse-level analog quantum algorithm with a variational quantum gate approach, where digital quantum gates are approximated by optimized analog pulses. This enables efficient measurement of the cost function for target many-body Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics in the Sine-Gordon model: the NLIE approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we derive Kl\"umper-Batchelor-Pearce-Destri-de Vega type nonlinear integral equations for describing the thermodynamics in the sine-Gordon model, when a chemical potential coupled to the topological charge
  is also present in the theory. The equations are valid at any value of the coupling constant and are particularly useful for computing the expectation values of local operators and some currents as functions of the temperature and the chemical potential. The equations are also extended to the case, when an extra term corresponding to the momentum conservation, is added to the thermodynamic potential.
  The benefits of this description are twofold. On the one hand, it can serve as an appropriate testing ground for other promising theoretical methods, like the method of random surfaces. On the other hand, the efficient computation of vertex operator expectation values, allows one to provide useful theoretical data, for the experimentally measurable coherence factors of a tunnel-coupled cold atomic condensate system.</description>

Abstract: We prove that the Kipnis-Marchioro-Presutti (KMP) process converges to the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation, as time $t$ goes to infinity, in a properly scaled observation window shifted by $t^{3/4}$. Our proof is based on identifying the KMP process with a stochastic flow of kernels describing transition probabilities in a certain model of random walk in space-time random environment. This allows to apply a recent result of arXiv:2401.06073 proving convergence of the density field of random walks in random environment to the KPZ equation in a suitably general sense.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many-body correlations in strongly coupled liquids and plasmas are critical for many applications in nanofluids, biology, and fusion-related plasma physics, but their description in fully heterogeneous environments remains challenging due to the high-dimensional equations involved. Recently, tensor network decompositions have emerged as powerful tools for tackling such equations by reducing memory usage and computational complexity. In this paper, we solve for equilibrium density and density-density correlation functions of liquids in confined heterogeneous environments using tensor network methods. We demonstrate that these functions admit high compression when their lengthscale dependence is encoded via quantized tensor trains or when their spatial-coordinate dependence is represented in standard tensor-train format, but not with respect to their dependence on distinct particle coordinates.</description>

      <title>Paused in translation: A model for the transcript length-dependent impact of ribosome-targeting antibiotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ribosome-targeting antibiotics, such as chloramphenicol, stall elongating ribosomes during protein synthesis, disrupting mRNA translation. These antibiotic-induced pauses occur stochastically, alter collective ribosome dynamics and transiently block protein production on the affected transcript. Existing models of ribosome traffic often rely on idealized assumptions, such as infinitely long mRNAs and simplified pausing dynamics, overlooking key biological constraints. Here, we develop a Totally Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Process (TASEP) that incorporates stochastic particle pausing, using experimentally determined pausing and unpausing rates to model the effects of ribosome-targeting antibiotics. We introduce a Single-Cluster approximation, which is analytically treatable, tailored to capture the biologically relevant regime of rare and long antibiotic-induced pauses. This biologically constrained model reveals three key insights: (i) the inhibition of antibiotic-induced translation strongly depends on transcript length, with longer transcripts being disproportionately affected; (ii) reducing ribosome initiation rates significantly mitigates antibiotic vulnerability; and (iii) inhibition of translation is governed more by collective ribosome dynamics than by single-ribosome properties. Our analytical predictions match Gillespie simulations, align quantitatively with experimental observations, and yield testable hypotheses for future experiments. These findings may have broader implications for the mechanistic modeling of other biological transport processes (e.g., RNAP dynamics), and more generally for the community studying traffic models.</description>

      <title>Rough or crumpled: Strong coupling phases of a generalized Kardar-Parisi-Zhang surface</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15026v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a generalized Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation [Jana et al., Phys. Rev. E 109, L032104 (2024)] that sets the paradigm for universality in roughening of growing nonequilibrium surfaces without any conservation laws but with competing local and nonlocal nonlinear effects. This equation in two dimensions exhibits two distinct strong coupling regimes: a rough phase and a crumpled phase, in addition to a weak coupling phase. The conformation fluctuations of such a rough surface are given by nonuniversal scaling exponents, with orientational long-range order and positional short-range order, whereas the crumpled phase has positional and orientational short-range order.</description>

      <title>Recurrent neural network analysis of single trajectories switching between anomalous diffusion states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09422v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusive dynamics abound in nature and have been especially studied in physical, biological, and financial systems. These dynamics are characterised by a linear growth of the mean squared displacement (MSD) with time. Often, the conditions that give rise to simple diffusion are violated, and many systems, such as biomolecules inside cells, microswimmers, or particles in turbulent flows, undergo anomalous diffusion, featuring an MSD that grows following a power law with an exponent $\alpha$. Precisely determining this exponent and the generalised diffusion coefficient provides valuable information on the systems under consideration, but it is a very challenging task when only a few short trajectories are available, which is common in non-equilibrium and living systems. Estimating the exponent becomes overwhelmingly difficult when the diffusive dynamics switches between different behaviours, characterised by different exponents $\alpha$ or diffusion coefficients $K$. We develop a method based on recurrent neural networks that successfully estimates the anomalous diffusion exponents and generalised diffusion coefficients of individual trajectories that switch between multiple diffusive states. Our method returns the $\alpha$ and $K$ as a function of time and identifies the times at which the dynamics switches between different behaviours. We showcase the method's capabilities on the dataset of the 2024 Anomalous Diffusion Challenge.</description>

      <title>Dichotomy theorem separating complete integrability and non-integrability of isotropic spin chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14315v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the integrability and non-integrability of isotropic spin chains with nearest-neighbor interaction with general spin $S$ in terms of the presence or absence of local conserved quantities. We prove a dichotomy theorem that whether a single quantity is zero or not sharply separates two scenarios: (i) this system has $k$-local conserved quantities for all $k$ (completely integrable), or (ii) this system has no nontrivial local conserved quantity (non-integrable). This result excludes the possibility of an intermediate system with some but not all local conserved quantities, which solves in the affirmative the Grabowski-Mathieu conjecture. This theorem also serves as a complete classification of integrability and non-integrability for $S\leq 13.5$, suggesting that all the integrable models are in the scope of the Yang-Baxter equation.</description>

      <title>Finite time path field theory and a new type of universal quantum spin chain quench behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17402v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss different quench protocols for Ising and XY spin chains in a transverse magnetic field. With a sudden local magnetic field quench as a starting point, we generalize our approach to a large class of local non-sudden quenches. Using finite time path field theory (FTPFT) perturbative methods, we show that the difference between the sudden quench and a class of quenches with non-sudden switching on the perturbation vanishes exponentially with time, apart from non-substantial modifications that are systematically accounted for. As the consequence of causality and analytic properties of functions describing the discussed class of quenches, this is true at any order of perturbation expansion and thus for the resummed perturbation series. The only requirements on functions describing the perturbation strength switched on at a finite time $t=0$ are as follows: (1) their Fourier transform $f(p)$ is a function that is analytic everywhere in the lower complex semiplane, except at the simple pole at $p=0$ and possibly others with $\Im (p) &lt; 0$; and (2) $f(p)/p$ converges to zero at infinity in the lower complex semiplane. A prototypical function of this class is $\tanh(\eta t)$, to which the perturbation strength is proportional after the switching at time $t=0$. In the limit of large $\eta$, such a perturbation approaches the case of a sudden quench. It is shown that, because of this new type of universal behavior of Loschmidt echo (LE) that emerges in an exponentially short time scale, our previous results for the sudden local magnetic field quench of Ising and XY chains, obtained by the resummation of the perturbative expansion, extend in the long-time limit to all non-sudden quench protocols in this class, with non-substantial modifications systematically taken into account. We also show that analogous universal behavior exists in disorder quenches, and ultimately global ones.</description>

      <title>Error Mitigation Thresholds in Noisy Random Quantum Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.04278v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extracting useful information from noisy near-term quantum simulations requires error mitigation strategies. A broad class of these strategies rely on precise characterization of the noise source. We study the robustness of probabilistic error cancellation and tensor network error mitigation when the noise is imperfectly characterized. We adapt an Imry-Ma argument to predict the existence of a threshold in the robustness of these error mitigation methods for random spatially local circuits in spatial dimensions $D \geq 2$: noise characterization disorder below the threshold rate allows for error mitigation up to times that scale with the number of qubits. For one-dimensional circuits, by contrast, mitigation fails at an $\mathcal{O}(1)$ time for any imperfection in the characterization of disorder. As a result, error mitigation is only a practical method for sufficiently well-characterized noise. We discuss further implications for tests of quantum computational advantage, fault-tolerant probes of measurement-induced phase transitions, and quantum algorithms in near-term devices.</description>

      <title>Equilibration of Non-interacting Photons and Quantum Signatures of Chaos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.13200v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Equilibration plays a fundamental role in our understanding of statistical mechanics and the long-time dynamics of many-body systems. In quantum systems, the route to equilibration is intimately related to level repulsion and quantum signatures of chaos that are encoded in their unitary evolution. Chaotic quantum systems exhibit the level statistics characteristic of ensembles of random matrices. In this work, we demonstrate that single-particle chaos leads to equilibration of many non-interacting photons. We show that the underlying mechanisms for equilibration are operator spreading and quantum interference. More specifically, we demonstrate that the unitary dynamics of a general Floquet system implemented using single-mode phase shifters and multiport beamsplitters leads to equilibration of photons. We propose a realistic photonic implementation of the multiparticle kicked rotor, which is a Floquet system that we use as a concrete example of our general approach.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the Many Body Localization Crossover as a Metal-Insulator Transition: Localization length from Polarization and Quantum Metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12280v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many body localization (MBL) represents a unique physical phenomenon, providing a testing ground for exploring thermalization, or more precisely its failure. Here we characterize the MBL regime geometrically by the many-body quantum metric (MBQM), defined in the parameter space of twist boundary, and the localization parameter as defined in the modern theory of polarization and insulators. First, we demonstrate that the quantum metric can be used to characterize disordered insulating states by applying this theoretical framework to excited states of the 1D Anderson insulator. There we observe that the MBQM and localization parameter are related in finite realizations despite the states being gapless in the thermodynamic limit. Then, we consider a disordered 1D Bose-Hubbard model and find that we can characterize the ergodic-MBL crossover by comparing the MBQM and localization parameter. We find that we can extract a natural localization length in the MBL regime that characterizes the real space spread of the wave function and can be measured by extracting the quantum metric. Our analysis provides complementary insight into the MBL regime focusing on its insulating properties and providing a localization length whose definition is consistent across a range of insulating phases.</description>

      <title>Trade-off between diagonal and off-diagonal elements in the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08297v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To bypass the reliance on local observables in verifying the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), we introduce an observable-independent measure of distinguishability based on the variance of a rescaled local operator. We establish a universal trade-off relation between the diagonal and off-diagonal elements of this measure, rigorously connecting it to eigenstate typicality and spatially averaged observables. This trade-off reveals that exponential growth in the number of off-diagonal terms enforces their suppression, indirectly constraining diagonal deviations. Numerical simulations on a one-dimensional Ising spin chain with tunable transverse and longitudinal fields demonstrate stark contrasts between integrable and non-integrable regimes: While off-diagonal elements are universally suppressed with system size, diagonal suppression fails in integrable systems due to the absence of chaotic dynamics. Our results unify subsystem ETH, weak ETH, and macroscopic observables under a single framework, offering new insights into thermalization mechanisms.</description>

      <title>The moments of the spectral form factor in SYK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18737v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In chaotic quantum systems the spectral form factor exhibits a universal linear ramp and plateau structure with superimposed erratic oscillations. The mean signal and the statistics of the noise can be probed by the moments of the spectral form factor, also known as higher-point spectral form factors. We identify saddle points in the SYK model that describe the moments during the ramp region. Perturbative corrections around the saddle point indicate that SYK mimics random matrix statistics for the low order moments, while large deviations for the high order moments arise from fluctuations near the edge of the spectrum. The leading correction scales inversely with the number of random parameters in the SYK Hamiltonian and is amplified in a sparsified version of the SYK model, which we study numerically, even in regimes where a linear ramp persists. Finally, we study the $q=2$ SYK model, whose spectral form factor exhibits an exponential ramp with increased noise. These findings reveal how deviations from random matrix universality arise in disordered systems and motivate their interpretation from a bulk gravitational perspective.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11153v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a mathematical equivalence between Support Vector Machine (SVM) kernel functions and quantum propagators represented by time-dependent Green's functions, which has remained largely unexplored.
  We demonstrate that many common SVM kernels correspond naturally to Green's functions via operator inversion theory. The sigmoid kernel does not always satisfy Mercer's theorem, and therefore the corresponding Green's function may also fail to perform optimally.
  We further introduce a Kernel Polynomial Method (KPM) for designing customized kernels that align with Green's functions.
  Our numerical experiments confirm that employing positive-semidefinite kernels that correspond to Green's functions significantly improves predictive accuracy of SVM models in physical systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17841v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a framework to quantify and utilize interdisciplinarity in science and engineering curricula at the university-level higher education. We analyze interdisciplinary relations by standardizing large-scale official educational data in Korea using a cutting-edge large language model and constructing knowledge maps for disciplines of scientific education. We design and evaluate single-field and integrated dual-field curricula by adapting pedagogical theory and utilizing information theory-based metrics. We develop standard curricula for individual disciplines and integrated curricula combining two fields, with their interdisciplinarity quantified by the curriculum synergy score. The results indicate higher interdisciplinarity for combinations within or across closely related fields, especially in engineering fields. Based on the analysis, engineering fields constitute the core structure of our design for curriculum interdisciplinarity, while basic natural science fields are located at peripheral stems to provide fundamental concepts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03668v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the one dimensional, critical transverse field Ising model is Yang-Baxter integrable. This is done by constructing commuting transfer matrices built out of a $R$-matrix satisfying the Yang-Baxter equation with additive spectral parameters. The $R$-matrix is non-local, as it is expressed in terms of Majorana fermions. It is also non-regular. Nevertheless, we show that the quantum inverse scattering method can still be suitably adapted. We then recursively obtain the conserved quantities [in the infinite volume] by the boost operator method. Remarkably, among the conserved charges we also find the Kramers-Wannier duality and other non-invertible symmetries for the periodic transverse field Ising model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23600v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate how observables with optimal sensitivity to environmental properties can be constructed explicitly from the master equation of an open-quantum system. Our approach does not rely on the explicit solution of the master equation. This makes the symmetric logarithmic derivative (SLD), the operator of optimal sensitivity and key quantity in quantum metrology, available to a large class of systems of interest, both in and out-of-equilibrium. We validate our approach by reproducing the SLD for temperature in quantum Brownian motion and demonstrate its versatility by constructing the optimal observable for the non-equilibrium relaxation rate.</description>
