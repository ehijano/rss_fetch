      <title>Minimal Autocorrelation in Hybrid Monte Carlo simulations using Exact Fourier Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm is a ubiquitous method in computational physics with applications ranging from condensed matter to lattice QCD and beyond. However, HMC simulations often suffer from long autocorrelation times, severely reducing their efficiency. In this work two of the main sources of autocorrelations are identified and eliminated. The first source is the sampling of the canonical momenta from a sub-optimal normal distribution, the second is a badly chosen trajectory length. Analytic solutions to both problems are presented and implemented in the exact Fourier acceleration (EFA) method. It completely removes autocorrelations for near-harmonic potentials and consistently yields (close-to-) optimal results for numerical simulations of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger and the Ising models as well as in lattice gauge theory, in some cases reducing the autocorrelation by multiple orders of magnitude. EFA is advantageous for and easily applicable to any HMC simulation of an action that includes a quadratic part.</description>

      <title>Hard Thermal Loop -- theory and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this review, we present the most key aspects of modern thermal perturbation theory based on hard thermal loop (HTL) approximation including its theoretical foundations and discuss some applications within quantum electrodynamics (QED) and quantum chromodynamics (QCD) plasma. To maintain conciseness, our discussion is confined to thermal equilibrium scenarios, but consider a variety of different quantities and settings. Specifically, we discuss both bulk thermodynamic properties and real-time observables, spanning the domain of high temperatures, relevant for heavy-ion physics.</description>

      <title>A complete analysis of the Landau-gauge three-gluon vertex from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several continuum and lattice investigations of the QCD three-gluon vertex have recently exposed its key properties, some intimately connected with the low-momentum behavior of the two-point gluon Green's function and specially relevant for the emergence of a mass scale in this latter, via the Schwinger mechanism. In the present study, we report on a lattice determination of the Landau-gauge, transversely projected three-gluon vertex, particularly scrutinizing an outstanding one of these properties, termed planar degeneracy, exploring its implications and capitalizing on it to gain further insight on the low-momentum running of both the three-gluon vertex and its associated strong coupling.</description>

      <title>Experimental entanglement entropy without twin copy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that it is possible to estimate experimentally the von Neuman entanglement entropy $S_{A}^{vN}$ of a symmetric bi-partite quantum system $AB$ by using the basic measurement counts for a *single* copy of a prepared state. We use the entropy $S_{AB}^X$ associated with the experimental measurements for this state and the reduced entropy $S_A^X$ obtained by tracing the experimental probabilities over the $B$ half of the system. We conjecture that $S_{A}^{vN}\propto (2S_A^X-S_{AB}^X)$ and demonstrate that it is verified in good approximation using exact diagonalization and analog calculations performed with the publicly available QuEra facilities for chains and ladders of Rydberg atoms. The approximate proportionality constant is of order one for the examples considered. $2S_A^X-S_{AB}^X$ can be calculated easily for many other qubit platforms and appears to be generically robust under measurement errors, although a general proof remains to be found. Similar results are found for the second order R\'enyi entanglement entropy.</description>

      <title>Boosting Determinant Quantum Monte Carlo with Submatrix Updates: Unveiling the Phase Diagram of the 3D Hubbard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of strongly correlated fermionic systems, crucial for understanding condensed matter physics, has been significantly advanced by numerical computational methods. Among these, the Determinant Quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) method stands out for its ability to provide exact numerical solutions. However, the computational complexity of DQMC, particularly in dealing with large system sizes and the notorious sign problem, limits its applicability. We introduce an innovative approach to enhance DQMC efficiency through the implementation of submatrix updates. Building upon the foundational work of conventional fast updates and delay updates, our method leverages a generalized submatrix update algorithm to address challenges in simulating strongly correlated fermionic systems with both onsite and extended interactions at both finite and zero temperatures. We demonstrate the method's superiority by comparing it with previous update methods in terms of computational complexity and efficiency. Specifically, our submatrix update method significantly reduces the computational overhead, enabling the simulation of system sizes up to 8,000 sites without pushing hard. This advancement allows for a more accurate determination of the finite temperature phase diagram of the 3D Hubbard model at half-filling. Our findings not only shed light on the phase transitions within these complex systems but also pave the way for more effective simulations of strongly correlated electrons, potentially guiding experimental efforts in cold atom simulations of the 3D Hubbard model.</description>

      <title>Exploring Lee-Yang and Fisher Zeros in the 2D Ising model through multipoint Pad\'e approximants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03178v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a numerical calculation of the Lee-Yang and Fisher zeros of the 2D Ising model using multi-point Pad\'{e} approximants. We perform simulations for the 2D Ising model with ferromagnetic couplings both in the absence and in the presence of a magnetic field using a cluster spin-flip algorithm. We show that it is possible to extract genuine signature of Lee Yang and Fisher zeros of the theory through the poles of magnetization and specific heat, using multi-point Pad\'{e} method. We extract the poles of magnetization using Pad\'{e} approximants and compare their scaling with known results. We verify the circle theorem associated to the well known behaviour of Lee Yang zeros. We present our finite volume scaling analysis of the zeros done at $T=T_c$ for a few lattice sizes, extracting to a good precision the (combination of) critical exponents $\beta \delta$. The computation at the critical temperature is performed after the latter has been determined via the study of Fisher zeros, thus extracting both $\beta_c$ and the critical exponent $\nu$. Results already exist for extracting the critical exponents for the Ising model in 2 and 3 dimensions making use of Fisher and Lee Yang zeros. In this work, multi-point Pad\'{e} is shown to be competitive with this respect and thus a powerful tool to study phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Nonperturbative Collins-Soper Kernel from Chiral Quarks with Physical Masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00664v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a lattice QCD calculation of the rapidity anomalous dimension of quark transverse-momentum-dependent distributions, i.e., the Collins-Soper (CS) kernel, up to transverse separations of about 1 fm. This unitary lattice calculation is conducted, for the first time, employing the chiral-symmetry-preserving domain wall fermion discretization and physical values of light and strange quark masses. The CS kernel is extracted from the ratios of pion quasi-transverse-momentum-dependent wave functions (quasi-TMDWFs) at next-to-leading logarithmic perturbative accuracy. Also for the first time, we utilize the recently proposed Coulomb-gauge-fixed quasi-TMDWF correlator without a Wilson line. We observe significantly slower signal decay with increasing quark separations compared to the established gauge-invariant method with a staple-shaped Wilson line. This enables us to determine the CS kernel at large nonperturbative transverse separations and find its near-linear dependence on the latter. Our result is consistent with the recent lattice calculation using gauge-invariant quasi-TMDWFs, and agrees with various recent phenomenological parametrizations of experimental data.</description>

      <title>Quark mass dependence of the $D_{s0}^*(2317)$ and $D_{s1}(2460)$ resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.01848v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We determine the quark mass dependence - light and heavy - of the $D_{s0}^*(2317)$ and $D_{s1}(2460)$ properties, such as, mass, coupling to $DK$, scattering lengths and compositeness, from a global analysis of $DK$ energy levels from LQCD. In particular, we analyze the HSC energy levels for $DK$ scattering in $I=0$ for different boosts and two pion masses. The formalism is based in the local hidden-gauge interaction of Weinberg-Tomozawa type which respects chiral and heavy quark spin symmetries, supplemented by a term that takes into account the $D^{(*)}K$ coupling to a bare $c\bar{s}$ component. The isospin violating decay of the $D_{s0}^*(2317)\to D_{s}^+\pi^0$ is also evaluated.</description>

      <title>Study (using a chiral effective Lagrangian model) of the scalar and pseudoscalar meson mass spectrum of QCD at finite temperature, above $T_c$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.10339v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we analyze (using a chiral effective Lagrangian model) the scalar and pseudoscalar meson mass spectrum of QCD at finite temperature, above the chiral transition at $T_c$, in the realistic case with $N_f = 2 + 1$ light quark flavors (that is, with $m_{u,d} \to 0$ and $m_s \neq 0$), looking, in particular, for signatures of the breaking of the $U(1)$ axial symmetry above $T_c$. A critical comparison with the corresponding results obtained (in a previous study) in the two limit cases $N_f = 2$ and $N_f = 3$ and with the available lattice results is performed, together with a discussion on the limits of validity of a description in terms of a chiral effective Lagrangian model.</description>

      <title>Improved Standard-Model prediction for ${K_L\to \ell^+\ell^-}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17689v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive calculation of the $K_L\to\gamma^*\gamma^*$ form factor in dispersion theory, using input from the leptonic decays $K_L\to\ell^+\ell^-\gamma$, $K_L\to \ell_1^+\ell_1^-\ell_2^+\ell_2^-$, the hadronic mode $K_L\to \pi^+\pi^-\gamma$, the normalization $K_L\to\gamma\gamma$, and the matching to asymptotic constraints. As key result we obtain an improved determination of the long-distance contribution to $K_L\to\ell^+\ell^-$, leading to the Standard-Model predictions $\text{Br}[K_L\to\mu^+\mu^-]=7.44^{+0.41}_{-0.34}\times 10^{-9}$, $\text{Br}[K_L\to e^+e^-]=8.46(37)\times 10^{-12}$, and more stringent limits on physics beyond the Standard Model. We provide a detailed breakdown of the current uncertainty, and delineate how future experiments and the interplay with lattice QCD could help further improve the precision.</description>

      <title>Doubly heavy dibaryons as seen by string theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09026v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose the stringy description of the system consisting of two heavy and four light quarks in the case of two light flavors of equal mass. As an application, we consider the three low-lying Born-Oppenheimer potentials as a function of the heavy quark separation. Our analysis shows that the ground state potential is described in terms of both hadro-quarkonia and hadronic molecules. A connected string configuration makes the dominant contribution to the potential of an excited state at small separations, and for separations larger than $0.1\,\text{fm}$, it exhibits the diquark-diquark-diquark structure $[Qq][Qq][qq]$. For better understanding the quark organization inside the system, we introduce several critical separations related to the processes of string reconnection, breaking and junction annihilation. We also discuss the simplest string configurations including the five-string junctions and their implications for the system, in particular the emergence of composite quark objects different from diquarks and the process of junction fusion.</description>
