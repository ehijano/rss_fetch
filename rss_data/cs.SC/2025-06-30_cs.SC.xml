      <title>Efficient Tensor Decomposition via Moment Matrix Extension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by a flurry of recent work on efficient tensor decomposition algorithms, we show that the celebrated moment matrix extension algorithm of Brachat, Comon, Mourrain, and Tsigaridas for symmetric tensor canonical polyadic (CP) decomposition can be made efficient under the right conditions. We first show that the crucial property determining the complexity of the algorithm is the regularity of a target decomposition. This allows us to reduce the complexity of the vanilla algorithm, while also unifying results from previous works. We then show that for tensors in $S^d\mathbb{C}^{n+1}$ with $d$ even, low enough regularity can reduce finding a symmetric tensor decomposition to solving a system of linear equations. For order-$4$ tensors we prove that generic tensors of rank up to $r=2n+1$ can be decomposed efficiently via moment matrix extension, exceeding the rank threshold allowed by simultaneous diagonalization. We then formulate a conjecture that states for generic order-$4$ tensors of rank $r=O(n^2)$ the induced linear system is sufficient for efficient tensor decomposition, matching the asymptotics of existing algorithms and in fact improving the leading coefficient. Towards this conjecture we give computer assisted proofs that the statement holds for $n=2, \dots, 17$. Next we demonstrate that classes of nonidentifiable tensors can be decomposed efficiently via the moment matrix extension algorithm, bypassing the usual need for uniqueness of decomposition. Of particular interest is the class of monomials, for which the extension algorithm is not only efficient but also improves on existing theory by explicitly parameterizing the space of decompositions. Code for implementations of the efficient algorithm for generic tensors and monomials are provided, along with several numerical examples.</description>

      <title>One-Parametric Presburger Arithmetic has Quantifier Elimination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a quantifier elimination procedure for one-parametric Presburger arithmetic, the extension of Presburger arithmetic with the function $x \mapsto t \cdot x$, where $t$ is a fixed free variable ranging over the integers. This resolves an open problem proposed in [Bogart et al., Discrete Analysis, 2017]. As conjectured in [Goodrick, Arch. Math. Logic, 2018], quantifier elimination is obtained for the extended structure featuring all integer division functions $x \mapsto \lfloor{\frac{x}{f(t)}}\rfloor$, one for each integer polynomial $f$.
  Our algorithm works by iteratively eliminating blocks of existential quantifiers. The elimination of a block builds on two sub-procedures, both running in non-deterministic polynomial time. The first one is an adaptation of a recently developed and efficient quantifier elimination procedure for Presburger arithmetic, modified to handle formulae with coefficients over the ring $\mathbb{Z}[t]$ of univariate polynomials. The second is reminiscent of the so-called "base $t$ division method" used by Bogart et al. As a result, we deduce that the satisfiability problem for the existential fragment of one-parametric Presburger arithmetic (which encompasses a broad class of non-linear integer programs) is in NP, and that the smallest solution to a satisfiable formula in this fragment is of polynomial bit size.</description>

      <title>Symbolic Sets for Proving Bounds on Rado Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12085v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a linear equation $\cal E$ of the form $ax + by = cz$ where $a$, $b$, $c$ are positive integers, the $k$-colour Rado number $R_k({\cal E})$ is the smallest positive integer $n$, if it exists, such that every $k$-colouring of the positive integers $\{1, 2, \dotsc, n\}$ contains a monochromatic solution to $\cal E$. In this paper, we consider $k = 3$ and the linear equations $ax + by = bz$ and $ax + ay = bz$. Using SAT solvers, we compute a number of previously unknown Rado numbers corresponding to these equations. We prove new general bounds on Rado numbers inspired by the satisfying assignments discovered by the SAT solver. Our proofs require extensive case-based analyses that are difficult to check for correctness by hand, so we automate checking the correctness of our proofs via an approach which makes use of a new tool we developed with support for operations on symbolically-defined sets -- e.g., unions or intersections of sets of the form $\{f(1), f(2), \dotsc, f(a)\}$ where $a$ is a symbolic variable and $f$ is a function possibly dependent on $a$. No computer algebra system that we are aware of currently has sufficiently capable support for symbolic sets, leading us to develop a tool supporting symbolic sets using the Python symbolic computation library SymPy coupled with the Satisfiability Modulo Theories solver Z3.</description>
