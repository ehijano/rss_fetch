      <title>The Design and Performance of Meteorological Sensors for WindBorne Global Sounding Balloons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: WindBorne Systems has developed a constellation of long-duration atmospheric balloons to collect meteorological data across the globe, filling gaps in current in-situ data collection methods. Each Global Sounding Balloon (GSB) is capable of flying for weeks or months and performing dozens of soundings while measuring pressure, temperature, humidity, and GNSS-derived position, altitude, and wind velocity. This data is transmitted to ground via satellite, processed, and made available within minutes of being collected. The current meteorological sensor package has remained largely unchanged since mid-2024 and has flown on thousands of GSBs totaling over one million hours of flight time. Here we present the design and performance of this sensor package. The custom readout architecture and housing allow for data collection across nearly all in-flight conditions while minimizing sources of bias and noise. Uncertainty is characterized via sounding reproducibility studies and in-house calibration of pressure, humidity, and temperature sensors. The calibration and data processing procedures have been optimized and validated by comparison with external datasets. We present external validation in the form of 1) side-by-side radiosonde launches performed in collaboration with the Center for Western Weather and Water Extremes at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, which show agreement within expected uncertainty limits, and 2) intercomparison studies with European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis v5, which show an aggregate root mean square difference of: Geopotential height -- 14 m; Pressure -- 0.36 hPa; Temperature -- 0.91 K; Wind speed u -- 2.45 m/s; Wind speed v -- 2.50 m/s; Relative humidity -- 13%.</description>

      <title>Addressing the World War 2 Warm Anomaly in HadSST.4.2.0.0</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an update to the Hadley Centre Sea-Surface Temperature dataset (HadSST.4.2.0.0) that addresses residual warm bias during the Second World War (WW2). Using an existing quantitative definition of the WW2 warm anomaly we identify Engine Room Intake (ERI) bias corrections as the dominant factor in this warm bias in HadSST4, and use this to propose new constraints on ERI bias estimates prior to 1950. In addition, we implement corrections for truncation bias in observations from the Japanese Kobe Collection, spanning the period from 1933 to 1961. We evaluate the effects of these changes with respect to the previous version of HadSST and compare with the most recent iterations of other SST datasets including ERSSTv6, COBE-SST3 and DCENT. We show that it is possible to remove the WW2 warm anomaly using a physically-based approach that maintains the independence of HadSST from land surface temperature records, and preserves structural diversity within the range of available global SST datasets.</description>

      <title>Using OPTiMEM and the Heat Conjecture to Estimate Future Social Cost of Greenhouse Gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an entirely new physics founded approach to estimating the social cost of carbon (SCC). For this, we developed our Ocean-Heat-Content Physics and Time Macro Economic Model (OPTiMEM) to estimate future heat content (separately published). The heat conjecture assumes that weather damages curves are stochastically proportional to ocean heat increase. We model carbon combustion, validate to datasets for greenhouse gas (GHG), temperature, and ocean heat content (OHC). We show that the social cost of 4 GHGs: CO2, CH4, N2O and halogenated hydrocarbons, cannot be single values, but must be represented by a kind of economic phase space.
  We propose very long-term carbon bonds to implement real discounting. This obviates the Gordian knot of the descriptivist versus prescriptivist discount disagreement that is unsolvable. Implementing these bonds leads to a new monitoring metric: real-dollar spending and bond discount rates compared to SC-GHG cost with variation on the discount scale, where the discount has no relationship to the pure rate of time preference (PRTP).
  This heat conjecture is based on OPTiMEM. OPTiMEM initiates from a fossil fuel consumption function to produce CO2, with 18 scenarios implemented to provide the uncertainty range. We provide 1:N year loss risk models (1:10, 1:100, 1:1000) that government, engineers, and actuaries should find useful.
  A scenario implementing DICE family of models carbon and growth assumptions shows +18{\deg} C is breached by 2210 CE, and +110{\deg} C by 2300 CE -- both of which outcomes are obviously not compatible with the fairly rosy conclusions of DICE models.
  Concerns are raised about having enough low-cost fossil fuel for conversion to minimal CO$_2$ maximal energy return on energy invested (EROEI) power if nations wait too long, and low EROEI power is questioned because monetary value is dependent on energy.</description>

      <title>Decision-oriented benchmarking to transform AI weather forecast access: Application to the Indian monsoon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence weather prediction (AIWP) models now often outperform traditional physics-based models on common metrics while requiring orders-of-magnitude less computing resources and time. Open-access AIWP models thus hold promise as transformational tools for helping low- and middle-income populations make decisions in the face of high-impact weather shocks. Yet, current approaches to evaluating AIWP models focus mainly on aggregated meteorological metrics without considering local stakeholders' needs in decision-oriented, operational frameworks. Here, we introduce such a framework that connects meteorology, AI, and social sciences. As an example, we apply it to the 150-year-old problem of Indian monsoon forecasting, focusing on benefits to rain-fed agriculture, which is highly susceptible to climate change. AIWP models skillfully predict an agriculturally relevant onset index at regional scales weeks in advance when evaluated out-of-sample using deterministic and probabilistic metrics. This framework informed a government-led effort in 2025 to send 38 million Indian farmers AI-based monsoon onset forecasts, which captured an unusual weeks-long pause in monsoon progression. This decision-oriented benchmarking framework provides a key component of a blueprint for harnessing the power of AIWP models to help large vulnerable populations adapt to weather shocks in the face of climate variability and change.</description>

      <title>Predicting Beyond Training Data via Extrapolation versus Translocation: AI Weather Models and Dubai's Unprecedented 2024 Rainfall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10241v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) models have transformed weather forecasting, but their skill for gray swan extremes is unclear. Here, we analyze GraphCast, AIFS, and FuXi forecasts of the unprecedented 2024 Dubai storm, which had twice the training set's highest rainfall in that region. Remarkably, GraphCast and AIFS accurately forecast this event up to 8 days ahead. FuXi forecasts the event, but underestimates the rainfall. Fine-tuning and receptive field analyses suggest that these models' success stems from "translocation": learning from comparable/stronger dynamically similar events in other regions during training. Evidence of "extrapolation" (learning from weaker events) is not found. Even events within the global distribution's tail are poorly forecasted, which is not just due to data imbalance (generalization error) but also spectral bias (optimization error). These findings demonstrate the potential of AI models to forecast regional gray swans and the opportunity to improve them through understanding the mechanisms behind their successes/limitations.</description>
