      <title>Shearless barriers in the conservative Ikeda map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of the Ikeda map in the conservative limit, where it is represented as a two-dimensional area-preserving map governed by two control parameters, $\theta$ and $\phi$. We demonstrate that the map can be interpreted as a composition of a rotation and a translation of the state vector. In the integrable case ($\phi = 0$), the map reduces to a uniform rotation by angle $\theta$ about a fixed point, independent of initial conditions. For $\phi \ne 0$, the system becomes nonintegrable, and the rotation angle acquires a coordinate dependence. The resulting rotation number profile exhibits extrema as a function of position, indicating the formation of shearless barriers. We analyze the emergence, persistence, and breakup of these barriers as the control parameters vary.</description>

      <title>Phase space geometry of a Four-wings chaotic attractor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The well known butterfly effect got its nomenclature from its two wings geometrical structure in phase space. There are chaotic dynamics from simple one-wing to multiple-wings complex structures in phase space. In this communication we demonstrate, both with direct numerical solutions and using Nambu mechanics, how does a four-wings complex structure in the phase space arise for a chaotic dynamical system. We further explore the properties of these structures and demonstrate that an attractor is produced out of dynamical intersections of Hamiltonian kind of Nambu functions. We also find, analytically, the specific conditions on system parameters for the formation of localized region of an attractor.</description>

      <title>On Nonlinear Dynamics Of A Nonideal Magnetic System With Shape Memory Alloy To Energy Harvesting Using Uncertainty Exponent And Entropy Of Basin Of Attractions Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we dealt the dynamic behavior of a magnetic structure, considering a shape memory spring and a non-ideal motor as excitation. It has fractal behavior of tits basins of attraction, for a set of parameters for energy harvesting. We also considered a set of initial conditions and performed the nonlinear dynamics analysis of the dimensionless mathematical model, and then established their chaotic and periodic regions. We also established the regions of maximum and minimum average power output, which was generated by the vibrations, caused by the considered non-ideal motor.</description>

      <title>High Energy States of Recurrent Chaotic Trajectories in Time-Dependent Potential Well</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this numerical study, recurrence quantification analysis of chaotic trajectories is explored to detect atypical dynamical behaviour in non-linear Hamiltonian systems. An ensemble of initial conditions is evolved up to a maximum iteration time, and the recurrence rate of each orbit is computed, allowing a subset of trajectories exhibiting significantly higher recurrences than the ensemble average to be identified. These special trajectories are determined through a suitable statistical distribution, within which peak detection reveals the respective initial condition that is evolved into a highly recurrent chaotic orbit, a phenomenon known as stickiness. By applying this methodology to a model of a classical particle in a time-dependent potential well, it is demonstrated that, for specific parameter values and initial conditions, such recurrent chaotic trajectories can give rise to transient high-energy states.</description>

      <title>Approach to predicting extreme events in time series of chaotic dynamical systems using machine learning techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work proposes an innovative approach using machine learning to predict extreme events in time series of chaotic dynamical systems. The research focuses on the time series of the H\'enon map, a two-dimensional model known for its chaotic behavior. The method consists of identifying time windows that anticipate extreme events, using convolutional neural networks to classify the system states. By reconstructing attractors and classifying (normal and transitional) regimes, the model shows high accuracy in predicting normal regimes, although forecasting transitional regimes remains challenging, particularly for longer intervals and rarer events. The method presents a result above 80% of success for predicting the transition regime up to 3 steps before the occurrence of the extreme event. Despite limitations posed by the chaotic nature of the system, the approach opens avenues for further exploration of alternative neural network architectures and broader datasets to enhance forecasting capabilities.</description>

      <title>On-Manifold Low-Thrust Maneuvering of Quasi-Periodic Orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A bi-level optimal control framework is introduced to solve the low-thrust re-phasing problem on quasi-periodic invariant tori in multi-body environments where deviations away from the torus during maneuver are considered unsafe or irresponsible. It is shown for a large class of mechanical systems that conformity to the torus manifold during periods of non-zero control input is infeasible. The most feasible trajectories on the torus surface are generated through the minimization of fictitious control input in the torus space using phase space control variables mapped via the torus function. These reference trajectories are then transitioned to the phase space both through a minimum tracking error homotopy and minimum time patched solutions. Results are compared to torus agnostic low-thrust transfers using measures of fuel consumption, cumulative torus error, and coast time spent on the torus during maneuver. Modifications to the framework are made for the inclusion of quasi-periodically forced dynamical systems. Lastly, minimum time recovery trajectories with free final torus conditions expose the disparity between the proposed framework and torus agnostic approaches. Examples are drawn from the circular and elliptical restricted three-body problems.</description>

      <title>Confined and deconfined chaos in classical spin systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Weakly perturbed integrable many-body systems are typically chaotic and thermal at late times. However, there are distinct relationships between the timescales for thermalization and chaos. The typical relationship is confined chaos: when trajectories are still confined to regions in phase space with constant conserved quantities (actions), the conjugate angle variables are already unstable. Confined chaos thus far precedes thermalization. In a different relationship, which we term deconfined chaos, chaotic instabilities and thermalization occur on the same timescale. We investigate these two qualitatively distinct scenarios through numerical and analytical studies of two perturbed integrable classical spin models: the Ishimori spin chain (confined chaos), and the central spin model with XX interactions (deconfined chaos). We analytically establish (super)-integrability in the latter model in a microcanonical shell. Deconfined chaos emerges through the separation of phase space into large quasi-integrable regions and a thin chaotic manifold. The latter causes chaos and thermalization on the fastest possible timescale, which is proportional to the inverse perturbation strength. This behavior is reminiscent of the quantum SYK models and strange metals.</description>

      <title>Way More Than the Sum of Their Parts: From Statistical to Structural Mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that mixtures comprised of multicomponent systems typically are much more structurally complex than the sum of their parts; sometimes, infinitely more complex. We contrast this with the more familiar notion of statistical mixtures, demonstrating how statistical mixtures miss key aspects of emergent hierarchical organization. This leads us to identify a new kind of structural complexity inherent in multicomponent systems and to draw out broad consequences for system ergodicity.</description>

      <title>On the classical geometry of chaotic Green functions and Wigner functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semiclassical approximations for various representations of a quantum state are constructed on a single (Lagrangian) surface in phase space, but it is not available for chaotic systems. An analogous evolution surface underlies semiclassical representations of the evolution operator, albeit in a doubled phase space. It is here shown that, corresponding to the Fourier transform on a unitary operator, represented as a Green function or spectral Wigner function, a Legendre transform generates a resolvent surface as the classical basis for semiclassical representations of the resolvent operator in double phase space, independently of the integrable or chaotic nature of the system. This surface coincides with derivatives of action functions (or generating functions) depending on the choice of appropriate coordinates and its growth departs from the energy shell following trajectories in double phase space. In an initial study of the resolvent surface based on its caustics, its complex nature is revealed to be analogous to a multidimensional sponge.
  Resummation of the trace of the resolvent in terms of linear combinations of periodic orbits, known as pseudo orbits or composite orbits, provides a cutoff to the semiclassical sum at the Heisenberg time. It is here shown that the corresponding actions for higher times can be approximately included within true secondary periodic orbits, in which multiple windings of short periodic orbits are joined by heteroclinic orbits into larger circuits.</description>

      <title>The equilibrium distribution function for strongly nonlinear systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The equilibrium distribution function determines macroscopic observables in statistical physics. While conventional methods correct equilibrium distributions in weakly nonlinear or near-integrable systems, they fail in strongly nonlinear regimes. We develop a framework to get the equilibrium distributions and dispersion relations in strongly nonlinear many-body systems, incorporating corrections beyond the random phase approximation and capturing intrinsic nonlinear effects. The theory is verified on the nonlinear Schrodinger equation, the Majda-McLaughlin-Tabak model, and the FPUT-beta model, demonstrating its accuracy across distinct types of nonlinear systems. Numerical results show substantial improvements over existing approaches, even in strong nonlinear regimes. This work establishes a theoretical foundation for equilibrium statistical properties in strongly nonlinear systems.</description>

      <title>Single-particle Non-linear Beam Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The investigation of single-particle dynamics in circular particle accelerators can be traced back to pioneering works in the 1950s. Traditionally, the design of new circular accelerators has focused on optimising linear dynamics, striving to minimise non-linear effects. When encountered, these effects were managed using suitable correction techniques. However, in recent years, this methodology has undergone significant reconsideration, leading to a more favourable view of non-linear beam dynamics. Notably, several new concepts have been promoted to improve the description and modelling of non-linear beam dynamics. Furthermore, new proposals have emerged that leverage the extensive potential of non-linear beam dynamics to enhance the control and manipulation of the characteristic features of charged particle beams. This article provides a detailed review and discussion of all these innovative approaches.</description>

      <title>Instability in Ostwald ripening processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is a dimensionless parameter which enters into the equation for the evolution of supersaturation in Ostwald ripening processes. This parameter is typically a large number. Here it is argued that the consequent stiffness of the equation results in the evolution of the supersaturation being unstable. The instability is evident in numerical simulations of Ostwald ripening.</description>
