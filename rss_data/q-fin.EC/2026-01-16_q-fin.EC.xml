      <title>The behavioral effects of index insurance in fisheries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fisheries are vulnerable to environmental shocks that impact stock health and fisher income. Index insurance is a promising financial tool to protect fishers from environmental risk. However, insurance may change fisher's behavior. It is imperative to understand the direction fishers change their behavior before implementing new policies as fisheries are vulnerable to overfishing. We provide the first theoretical application of index insurance on fisher's behavior change to predict if index insurance will incentivize higher or lower harvests in unregulated settings. We find that using traditional fishery models with production variability only originating through stock abundance leads fishers to increase harvest with index insurance. However, fishers are adaptable and experience multiple sources of risk. Using a more flexible specification of production shows that index insurance could raise or lower harvest depending on the risk mitigation strategies available for fishers and the design of the insurance contract. We demonstrate the magnitude of potential change by simulating from parameters estimated for three Norwegian fisheries. Fisheries with index insurance contracts protecting extraction risks may increase harvest by 10% or decrease by 2% depending on the risk effects of inputs. Insurance contracts protecting stock risk will lead to 6-20% increases in harvest. Before widespread adoption, careful consideration must be given to how index insurance will incentivize or disincentivize overfishing.</description>

      <title>Power and Control in Complex Networks: A Taxonomy and Critical Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper reviews the main network analysis methods used to measure structural power, which refers to the ability to shape outcomes through network position and influence, and the ability to affect others through network connections. These approaches have been applied in fields such as corporate control, global value chains, and technology supply networks. Despite significant advances, a unified framework that systematically connects these methodologies to their conceptual foundations has yet to emerge. To fill this gap, the paper introduces a taxonomy that categorizes existing methods into six families: centrality-based approaches, game-theoretic models, concentration measures, flow-based methods, optimization frameworks, and hybrid approaches that combine elements from different approaches. This classification clarifies their assumptions, analytical focus, and relative strengths, offering a coherent view of how power is structured and transmitted in complex economic and political systems. The paper concludes by outlining future research directions to refine hybrid models linking decision-making and network flows.</description>

      <title>The hidden structure of innovation networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Innovation emerges from complex collaboration patterns - among inventors, firms, or institutions. However, not much is known about the overall mesoscopic structure around which inventive activity self-organizes. Here, we tackle this problem by employing patent data to analyze both individual (\emph{co-inventorship}) and organization (\emph{co-ownership}) networks in three strategic domains (\emph{artificial intelligence}, \emph{biotechnology} and \emph{semiconductors}). We characterize the mesoscale structure (in terms of clusters) of each domain by comparing two alternative methods: a standard baseline - modularity maximization - and one based on the minimization of the Bayesian Information Criterion, within the Stochastic Block Model and its degree-corrected variant. We find that, across sectors, inventor networks are denser and more clustered than organization ones - consistent with the presence of small recurrent teams embedded into broader institutional hierarchies - whereas organization networks have neater hierarchical role-based structures, with few bridging firms coordinating the most peripheral ones. We also find that the discovered meso-structures are connected to innovation output. In particular, Lorenz curves of forward citations show a pervasive inequality in technological influence: across sectors and methods, both inventor (especially) and organization networks consistently show high levels of concentration of citations in a few of the discovered clusters. Our results demonstrate that the baseline modularity-based method may not be capable of fully capturing the way collaborations drive the spreading of inventive impact across technological domains. This is due to the presence of local hierarchies that call for more refined tools based on Bayesian inference.</description>

      <title>Antisocial behavior towards large language model users: experimental evidence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid spread of large language models (LLMs) has raised concerns about the social reactions they provoke. Prior research documents negative attitudes toward AI users, but it remains unclear whether such disapproval translates into costly action. We address this question in a two-phase online experiment (N = 491 Phase II participants; Phase I provided targets) where participants could spend part of their own endowment to reduce the earnings of peers who had previously completed a real-effort task with or without LLM support. On average, participants destroyed 36% of the earnings of those who relied exclusively on the model, with punishment increasing monotonically with actual LLM use. Disclosure about LLM use created a credibility gap: self-reported null use was punished more harshly than actual null use, suggesting that declarations of "no use" are treated with suspicion. Conversely, at high levels of use, actual reliance on the model was punished more strongly than self-reported reliance. Taken together, these findings provide the first behavioral evidence that the efficiency gains of LLMs come at the cost of social sanctions.</description>

      <title>Transforming Crises into Opportunities: From Chaos to Urban Antifragility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Urban crises - floods, pandemics, economic shocks, and conflicts - function as accelerators of urban change, exposing structural vulnerabilities while creating windows for reinvention. Building on a prior theoretical contribution that identified fifteen principles of urban antifragility, this paper tests and operationalizes the framework through an empirical assessment of 26 cities selected for their post-crisis adaptation trajectories. Using a tailored diagnostic methodology, we benchmark cities' Stress Response Strategies (SRS) and then evaluate Urban Development Trajectories (UDT) across four weighted dimensions, positioning each case along a fragility-robustness-resilience-antifragility continuum and applying a balanced-threshold rule to confirm antifragile status. Results show that "resilience enhanced by innovation and technology" is the most effective response typology (86.9/100), and that six cities meet the antifragile trajectory criteria. By mapping best practices to activated principles and analysing co-activations, the study identifies a robust "hard core" of principles - Sustainable Resilience (O), Strategic Diversity (F), Proactive Innovation (I), and Active Prevention (N) - supplemented by operational enablers (e.g., anticipation, mobilization, shock absorption). The paper concludes by proposing an evidence-based, SDG-aligned operational model that links high-impact principle pairings to measurable indicators, offering a practical roadmap for cities seeking to convert crises into sustained transformation. Keywords: Post-crisis strategies, Urban antifragility, Sustainable cities and communities, Disaster resilience and urban regeneration, Risk governance and Black Swan adaptation.</description>

      <title>Supply Chain Disruptions, the Structure of Production Networks, and the Impact of Globalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03660v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a parsimonious multi-sector model of international production and use it to study the impact of a disruption in the production of some goods propagates to other goods and consumers, and how that impact depends on the goods' positions in, and overall structure of, the production network. We show that the short-run impact of a disruption can be dramatically larger than the long-run impact. The short-run disruption depends on the value of all of the final goods whose supply chains involve a disrupted good, while by contrast the long-run disruption depends only on the cost of the disrupted goods. We use the model to show how increased complexity of supply chains leads to increased fragility in terms of the probability and expected short-run size of a disruption. We also show how decreased transportation costs can lead to increased specialization in production, lowering the chances for disruption but increasing the impact conditional upon disruption. We use the model to characterize the power that a country has over others via diversions of its production as well as quotas on imports and exports.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Impacts of Traffic Regulations in Complex Mobility Systems Using Scenario-Based Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07735v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Urban traffic regulation policies are increasingly used to address congestion, emissions, and accessibility in cities, yet their impacts are difficult to assess due to the socio-technical complexity of urban mobility systems. Recent advances in data availability and computational power enable new forms of model-driven, simulation-based decision support for transportation policy design. This paper proposes a novel simulation paradigm for the ex-ante evaluation of both direct impacts (e.g., traffic conditions, modal shift, emissions) and indirect impacts spanning transportation-related effects and economic accessibility. The approach integrates a multi-layer urban mobility model combining a physical layer of mobility flows and emissions with a social layer capturing behavioral responses and adaptation to policy changes. Real-world data are used to instantiate the current as-is scenario, while policy alternatives and behavioral assumptions are encoded as model parameters to generate multiple what-if scenarios. The framework supports systematic comparison across scenarios by analyzing variations in simulated outcomes induced by policy interventions. The proposed approach is illustrated through a case study that aims to assess the impacts of the introduction of broad urban traffic restriction schemes. Results demonstrate the framework's ability to explore alternative regulatory designs and user responses, supporting informed and anticipatory evaluation of urban traffic policies.</description>
