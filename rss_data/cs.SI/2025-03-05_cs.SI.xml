      <title>Differences-in-Neighbors for Network Interference in Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Experiments in online platforms frequently suffer from network interference, in which a treatment applied to a given unit affects outcomes for other units connected via the platform. This SUTVA violation biases naive approaches to experiment design and estimation. A common solution is to reduce interference by clustering connected units, and randomizing treatments at the cluster level, typically followed by estimation using one of two extremes: either a simple difference-in-means (DM) estimator, which ignores remaining interference; or an unbiased Horvitz-Thompson (HT) estimator, which eliminates interference at great cost in variance. Even combined with clustered designs, this presents a limited set of achievable bias variance tradeoffs. We propose a new estimator, dubbed Differences-in-Neighbors (DN), designed explicitly to mitigate network interference. Compared to DM estimators, DN achieves bias second order in the magnitude of the interference effect, while its variance is exponentially smaller than that of HT estimators. When combined with clustered designs, DN offers improved bias-variance tradeoffs not achievable by existing approaches. Empirical evaluations on a large-scale social network and a city-level ride-sharing simulator demonstrate the superior performance of DN in experiments at practical scale.</description>

      <title>New centrality measure: ksi-centrality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce new centrality measures called ksi-centrality and normalized ksi-centrality which defined the importance of vertex up to importance of its neighbors. First, we show that normalized ksi-centrality can be rewritten in terms of Laplacian matrix such that its expression will be similar to local clustering coefficient. After that we introduce average normalized ksi-coefficient and show that for random Erdos-Renyi graph it is almost the same as average clustering coefficient. Also, it shows similar behavior to clustering coefficient for Windmill and Wheel graphs. In the end, we show that distributions of ksi-centrality and normalized ksi-centrality differentiate networks based on real data from the artificial networks including small-world networks Watts-Strogatz and Barabasi-Albert. In addition we show the connection between normalized ksi-centrality and average normalized ksi-coefficient and algebraic connectivity of a graph.</description>

      <title>Mixing Time Matters: Accelerating Effective Resistance Estimation via Bidirectional Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of efficiently approximating the \textit{effective resistance} (ER) on undirected graphs, where ER is a widely used node proximity measure with applications in graph spectral sparsification, multi-class graph clustering, network robustness analysis, graph machine learning, and more. Specifically, given any nodes $s$ and $t$ in an undirected graph $G$, we aim to efficiently estimate the ER value $R(s,t)$ between nodes $s$ and $t$, ensuring a small absolute error $\epsilon$. The previous best algorithm for this problem has a worst-case computational complexity of $\tilde{O}\left(\frac{L_{\max}^3}{\epsilon^2 d^2}\right)$, where the value of $L_{\max}$ depends on the mixing time of random walks on $G$, $d = \min\{d(s), d(t)\}$, and $d(s)$, $d(t)$ denote the degrees of nodes $s$ and $t$, respectively. We improve this complexity to $\tilde{O}\left(\min\left\{\frac{L_{\max}^{7/3}}{\epsilon^{2/3}}, \frac{L_{\max}^3}{\epsilon^2d^2}, mL_{\max}\right\}\right)$, achieving a theoretical improvement of $\tilde{O}\left(\max\left\{\frac{L_{\max}^{2/3}}{\epsilon^{4/3} d^2}, 1, \frac{L_{\max}^2}{\epsilon^2 d^2 m}\right\}\right)$ over previous results. Here, $m$ denotes the number of edges. Given that $L_{\max}$ is often very large in real-world networks (e.g., $L_{\max} &gt; 10^4$), our improvement on $L_{\max}$ is significant, especially for real-world networks. We also conduct extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic graph datasets to empirically demonstrate the superiority of our method. The experimental results show that our method achieves a $10\times$ to $1000\times$ speedup in running time while maintaining the same absolute error compared to baseline methods.</description>

      <title>Trust and Friction: Negotiating How Information Flows Through Decentralized Social Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decentralized social media protocols enable users in independent, user-hosted servers (i.e., instances) to interact with each other while they self-govern. This community-based model of social media governance opens up new opportunities for tailored decision-making about information flows -- i.e., what user data is shared to whom and when -- and in turn, for protecting user privacy. To better understand how community governance shapes privacy expectations on decentralized social media, we conducted a semi-structured interview with 23 users of the Fediverse, a decentralized social media network. Our findings illustrate important factors that shape a community's understandings of information flows, such as rules and proactive efforts from admins who are perceived as trustworthy. We also highlight ''governance frictions'' between communities that raise new privacy risks due to incompatibilities in values, security practices, and software. Our findings highlight the unique challenges of decentralized social media, suggest design opportunities to address frictions, and outline the role of participatory decision-making to realize the full potential of decentralization.</description>

      <title>Limited Effectiveness of LLM-based Data Augmentation for COVID-19 Misinformation Stance Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Misinformation surrounding emerging outbreaks poses a serious societal threat, making robust countermeasures essential. One promising approach is stance detection (SD), which identifies whether social media posts support or oppose misleading claims. In this work, we finetune classifiers on COVID-19 misinformation SD datasets consisting of claims and corresponding tweets. Specifically, we test controllable misinformation generation (CMG) using large language models (LLMs) as a method for data augmentation. While CMG demonstrates the potential for expanding training datasets, our experiments reveal that performance gains over traditional augmentation methods are often minimal and inconsistent, primarily due to built-in safeguards within LLMs. We release our code and datasets to facilitate further research on misinformation detection and generation.</description>

      <title>NodeNAS: Node-Specific Graph Neural Architecture Search for Out-of-Distribution Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph neural architecture search (GraphNAS) has demonstrated advantages in mitigating performance degradation of graph neural networks (GNNs) due to distribution shifts. Recent approaches introduce weight sharing across tailored architectures, generating unique GNN architectures for each graph end-to-end. However, existing GraphNAS methods do not account for distribution patterns across different graphs and heavily rely on extensive training data. With sparse or single training graphs, these methods struggle to discover optimal mappings between graphs and architectures, failing to generalize to out-of-distribution (OOD) data. In this paper, we propose node-specific graph neural architecture search(NodeNAS), which aims to tailor distinct aggregation methods for different nodes through disentangling node topology and graph distribution with limited datasets. We further propose adaptive aggregation attention based multi-dim NodeNAS method(MNNAS), which learns an node-specific architecture customizer with good generalizability. Specifically, we extend the vertical depth of the search space, supporting simultaneous node-specific architecture customization across multiple dimensions. Moreover, we model the power-law distribution of node degrees under varying assortativity, encoding structure invariant information to guide architecture customization across each dimension. Extensive experiments across supervised and unsupervised tasks demonstrate that MNNAS surpasses state-of-the-art algorithms and achieves excellent OOD generalization.</description>

      <title>To Vaccinate or not to Vaccinate? Analyzing $\mathbb{X}$ Power over the Pandemic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly affected the normal course of life -- from lock-downs and virtual meetings to the unprecedentedly swift creation of vaccines. To halt the COVID-19 pandemic, the world has started preparing for the global vaccine roll-out. In an effort to navigate the immense volume of information about COVID-19, the public has turned to social networks. Among them, $\mathbb{X}$ (formerly Twitter) has played a key role in distributing related information. Most people are not trained to interpret medical research and remain skeptical about the efficacy of new vaccines. Measuring their reactions and perceptions is gaining significance in the fight against COVID-19. To assess the public perception regarding the COVID-19 vaccine, our work applies a sentiment analysis approach, using natural language processing of $\mathbb{X}$ data. We show how to use textual analytics and textual data visualization to discover early insights (for example, by analyzing the most frequently used keywords and hashtags). Furthermore, we look at how people's sentiments vary across the countries. Our results indicate that although the overall reaction to the vaccine is positive, there are also negative sentiments associated with the tweets, especially when examined at the country level. Additionally, from the extracted tweets, we manually labeled 100 tweets as positive and 100 tweets as negative and trained various One-Class Classifiers (OCCs). The experimental results indicate that the S-SVDD classifiers outperform other OCCs.</description>

      <title>Geodesic Length Distribution in Sparse Network Ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.02330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.02330v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A key task in the study of networked systems is to derive local and global properties that impact connectivity, synchronizability, and robustness; computing shortest paths or geodesics yields measures of network connectivity that can explain such phenomena. We derive an analytic distribution of geodesic lengths on the giant component in the supercritical regime -- when the giant component exists -- or on small components in the subcritical regime, of any sparse (and possibly directed) network with conditionally independent edges, in the infinite-size limit. We provide specific results for widely used network models like stochastic block models, dot product graphs, random geometric graphs, and sparse graphons. The survival function of the geodesic length distribution possesses a simple closed-form expression which is asymptotically tight for finite lengths, has a natural interpretation of traversing independent geodesics in the network, and delivers novel insight into the aforementioned network families.</description>

      <title>Graph sub-sampling for divide-and-conquer algorithms in large networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06994v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As networks continue to increase in size, current methods must be capable of handling large numbers of nodes and edges in order to be practically relevant. Instead of working directly with the entire (large) network, analyzing sub-networks has become a popular approach. Due to a network's inherent inter-connectedness, however, sub-sampling is not a trivial task. While this problem has gained popularity in recent years, it has not received sufficient attention from the statistics community. In this work, we provide a thorough comparison of seven graph sub-sampling algorithms by applying them to divide-and-conquer algorithms for community structure and core-periphery (CP) structure. After discussing the various algorithms and sub-sampling routines, we derive theoretical results for the mis-classification rate of the divide-and-conquer algorithm for CP structure under various sub-sampling schemes. We then perform extensive experiments on both simulated and real-world data to compare the various methods. For the community detection task, we found that sampling nodes uniformly at random yields the best performance, but that sometimes the base algorithm applied to the entire network yields better results both in terms of identification and computational time. For CP structure on the other hand, there was no single winner, but algorithms which sampled core nodes at a higher rate consistently outperformed other sampling routines, e.g., random edge sampling and random walk sampling. Unlike community detection, the CP divide-and-conquer algorithm tends to yield better identification results while also being faster than the base algorithm. The varying performance of the sampling algorithms on different tasks demonstrates the importance of carefully selecting a sub-sampling routine for the specific application.</description>

      <title>Hashtag Re-Appropriation for Audience Control on Recommendation-Driven Social Media Xiaohongshu (rednote)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18210v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Algorithms have played a central role in personalized recommendations on social media. However, they also present significant obstacles for content creators trying to predict and manage their audience reach. This issue is particularly challenging for marginalized groups seeking to maintain safe spaces. Our study explores how women on Xiaohongshu (rednote), a recommendation-driven social platform, proactively re-appropriate hashtags (e.g., #Baby Supplemental Food) by using them in posts unrelated to their literal meaning. The hashtags were strategically chosen from topics that would be uninteresting to the male audience they wanted to block. Through a mixed-methods approach, we analyzed the practice of hashtag re-appropriation based on 5,800 collected posts and interviewed 24 active users from diverse backgrounds to uncover users' motivations and reactions towards the re-appropriation. This practice highlights how users can reclaim agency over content distribution on recommendation-driven platforms, offering insights into self-governance within algorithmic-centered power structures.</description>
