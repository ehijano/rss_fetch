      <title>Resilience of the slow component in timescale separated synchronized oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physiological networks are usually made of a large number of biological oscillators evolving on a multitude of different timescales. Phase oscillators are particularly useful in the modelling of the synchronization dynamics of such systems. If the coupling is strong enough compared to the heterogeneity of the internal parameters, synchronized states might emerge where phase oscillators start to behave coherently. Here, we focus on the case where synchronized oscillators are divided into a fast and a slow component so that the two subsets evolve on separated timescales. We assess the resilience of the slow component by reducing the dynamics of the fast one and evaluating the variance of the phase deviations when the oscillators in the two components are subject to noise with possibly distinct correlation times. From the general expression for the variance, we consider specific network structures and show how the noise transmission between the fast and slow components is affected. Interestingly, we find that oscillators that are among the most robust when there is only a single timescale, might become the most vulnerable when the system separates into two timescales. We also find that layered networks seem to be insensitive to timescale separations when the noise has homogeneous correlation time.</description>

      <title>Looking for Complexity at Phase Boundaries in Continuous Cellular Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17848v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One key challenge in Artificial Life is designing systems that display an emergence of complex behaviors. Many such systems depend on a high-dimensional parameter space, only a small subset of which displays interesting dynamics. Focusing on the case of continuous systems, we introduce the 'Phase Transition Finder'(PTF) algorithm, which can be used to efficiently generate parameters lying at the border between two phases. We argue that such points are more likely to display complex behaviors, and confirm this by applying PTF to Lenia showing it can increase the frequency of interesting behaviors more than two-fold, while remaining efficient enough for large-scale searches.</description>
