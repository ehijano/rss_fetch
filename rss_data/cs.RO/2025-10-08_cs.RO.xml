      <title>VER: Vision Expert Transformer for Robot Learning via Foundation Distillation and Dynamic Routing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pretrained vision foundation models (VFMs) advance robotic learning via rich visual representations, yet individual VFMs typically excel only in specific domains, limiting generality across tasks. Distilling multiple VFMs into a unified representation for policy can mitigate this limitation but often yields inflexible task-specific feature selection and requires costly full re-training to incorporate robot-domain knowledge. We propose VER, a Vision Expert transformer for Robot learning. During pretraining, VER distills multiple VFMs into a vision expert library. It then fine-tunes only a lightweight routing network (fewer than 0.4% of parameters) to dynamically select task-relevant experts from the pretrained library for downstream robot tasks. We further introduce Patchwise Expert Routing with Curriculum Top-K Annealing to improve both flexibility and precision of dynamic expert selection. Moreover, VER supports parameter-efficient finetuning for scalable expert utilization and adaptive robot-domain knowledge integration. Across 17 diverse robotic tasks and multiple policy heads, VER achieves state-of-the-art performance. We find that VER reduces large-norm outliers in task-irrelevant regions (e.g., background) and concentrates on task-critical regions.

      <title>Adaptive Dynamics Planning for Robot Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous robot navigation systems often rely on hierarchical planning, where global planners compute collision-free paths without considering dynamics, and local planners enforce dynamics constraints to produce executable commands. This discontinuity in dynamics often leads to trajectory tracking failure in highly constrained environments. Recent approaches integrate dynamics within the entire planning process by gradually decreasing its fidelity, e.g., increasing integration steps and reducing collision checking resolution, for real-time planning efficiency. However, they assume that the fidelity of the dynamics should decrease according to a manually designed scheme. Such static settings fail to adapt to environmental complexity variations, resulting in computational overhead in simple environments or insufficient dynamics consideration in obstacle-rich scenarios. To overcome this limitation, we propose Adaptive Dynamics Planning (ADP), a learning-augmented paradigm that uses reinforcement learning to dynamically adjust robot dynamics properties, enabling planners to adapt across diverse environments. We integrate ADP into three different planners and further design a standalone ADP-based navigation system, benchmarking them against other baselines. Experiments in both simulation and real-world tests show that ADP consistently improves navigation success, safety, and efficiency.</description>

      <title>A multi-modal tactile fingertip design for robotic hands to enhance dexterous manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tactile sensing holds great promise for enhancing manipulation precision and versatility, but its adoption in robotic hands remains limited due to high sensor costs, manufacturing and integration challenges, and difficulties in extracting expressive and reliable information from signals. In this work, we present a low-cost, easy-to-make, adaptable, and compact fingertip design for robotic hands that integrates multi-modal tactile sensors. We use strain gauge sensors to capture static forces and a contact microphone sensor to measure high-frequency vibrations during contact. These tactile sensors are integrated into a compact design with a minimal sensor footprint, and all sensors are internal to the fingertip and therefore not susceptible to direct wear and tear from interactions. From sensor characterization, we show that strain gauge sensors provide repeatable 2D planar force measurements in the 0-5 N range and the contact microphone sensor has the capability to distinguish contact material properties. We apply our design to three dexterous manipulation tasks that range from zero to full visual occlusion. Given the expressiveness and reliability of tactile sensor readings, we show that different tactile sensing modalities can be used flexibly in different stages of manipulation, solely or together with visual observations to achieve improved task performance. For instance, we can precisely count and unstack a desired number of paper cups from a stack with 100\% success rate which is hard to achieve with vision only.</description>

      <title>Towards Online Robot Interaction Adaptation to Human Upper-limb Mobility Impairments in Return-to-Work Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Work environments are often inadequate and lack inclusivity for individuals with upper-body disabilities. This paper presents a novel online framework for adaptive human-robot interaction (HRI) that accommodates users' arm mobility impairments, ultimately aiming to promote active work participation. Unlike traditional human-robot collaboration approaches that assume able-bodied users, our method integrates a mobility model for specific joint limitations into a hierarchical optimal controller. This allows the robot to generate reactive, mobility-aware behaviour online and guides the user's impaired limb to exploit residual functional mobility. The framework was tested in handover tasks involving different upper-limb mobility impairments (i.e., emulated elbow and shoulder arthritis, and wrist blockage), under both standing and seated configurations with task constraints using a mobile manipulator, and complemented by quantitative and qualitative comparisons with state-of-the-art ergonomic HRI approaches. Preliminary results indicated that the framework can personalise the interaction to fit within the user's impaired range of motion and encourage joint usage based on the severity of their functional limitations.</description>

      <title>Active Semantic Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an approach for active semantic perception which refers to using the semantics of the scene for tasks such as exploration. We build a compact, hierarchical multi-layer scene graph that can represent large, complex indoor environments at various levels of abstraction, e.g., nodes corresponding to rooms, objects, walls, windows etc. as well as fine-grained details of their geometry. We develop a procedure based on large language models (LLMs) to sample plausible scene graphs of unobserved regions that are consistent with partial observations of the scene. These samples are used to compute an information gain of a potential waypoint for sophisticated spatial reasoning, e.g., the two doors in the living room can lead to either a kitchen or a bedroom. We evaluate this approach in complex, realistic 3D indoor environments in simulation. We show using qualitative and quantitative experiments that our approach can pin down the semantics of the environment quicker and more accurately than baseline approaches.</description>

      <title>AD-NODE: Adaptive Dynamics Learning with Neural ODEs for Mobile Robots Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mobile robots, such as ground vehicles and quadrotors, are becoming increasingly important in various fields, from logistics to agriculture, where they automate processes in environments that are difficult to access for humans. However, to perform effectively in uncertain environments using model-based controllers, these systems require dynamics models capable of responding to environmental variations, especially when direct access to environmental information is limited. To enable such adaptivity and facilitate integration with model predictive control, we propose an adaptive dynamics model which bypasses the need for direct environmental knowledge by inferring operational environments from state-action history. The dynamics model is based on neural ordinary equations, and a two-phase training procedure is used to learn latent environment representations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through goal-reaching and path-tracking tasks on three robotic platforms of increasing complexity: a 2D differential wheeled robot with changing wheel contact conditions, a 3D quadrotor in variational wind fields, and the Sphero BOLT robot under two contact conditions for real-world deployment. Empirical results corroborate that our method can handle temporally and spatially varying environmental changes in both simulation and real-world systems.</description>

      <title>Correlation-Aware Dual-View Pose and Velocity Estimation for Dynamic Robotic Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate pose and velocity estimation is essential for effective spatial task planning in robotic manipulators. While centralized sensor fusion has traditionally been used to improve pose estimation accuracy, this paper presents a novel decentralized fusion approach to estimate both pose and velocity. We use dual-view measurements from an eye-in-hand and an eye-to-hand vision sensor configuration mounted on a manipulator to track a target object whose motion is modeled as random walk (stochastic acceleration model). The robot runs two independent adaptive extended Kalman filters formulated on a matrix Lie group, developed as part of this work. These filters predict poses and velocities on the manifold $\mathbb{SE}(3) \times \mathbb{R}^3 \times \mathbb{R}^3$ and update the state on the manifold $\mathbb{SE}(3)$. The final fused state comprising the fused pose and velocities of the target is obtained using a correlation-aware fusion rule on Lie groups. The proposed method is evaluated on a UFactory xArm 850 equipped with Intel RealSense cameras, tracking a moving target. Experimental results validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed decentralized dual-view estimation framework, showing consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>ARRC: Advanced Reasoning Robot Control - Knowledge-Driven Autonomous Manipulation Using Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present ARRC (Advanced Reasoning Robot Control), a practical system that connects natural-language instructions to safe local robotic control by combining Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with RGB-D perception and guarded execution on an affordable robot arm. The system indexes curated robot knowledge (movement patterns, task templates, and safety heuristics) in a vector database, retrieves task-relevant context for each instruction, and conditions a large language model (LLM) to produce JSON-structured action plans. Plans are executed on a UFactory xArm 850 fitted with a Dynamixel-driven parallel gripper and an Intel RealSense D435 camera. Perception uses AprilTag detections fused with depth to produce object-centric metric poses. Execution is enforced via software safety gates: workspace bounds, speed and force caps, timeouts, and bounded retries. We describe the architecture, knowledge design, integration choices, and a reproducible evaluation protocol for tabletop scan, approach, and pick-place tasks. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach. Our design shows that RAG-based planning can substantially improve plan validity and adaptability while keeping perception and low-level control local to the robot.</description>

      <title>GO-Flock: Goal-Oriented Flocking in 3D Unknown Environments with Depth Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial Potential Field (APF) methods are widely used for reactive flocking control, but they often suffer from challenges such as deadlocks and local minima, especially in the presence of obstacles. Existing solutions to address these issues are typically passive, leading to slow and inefficient collective navigation. As a result, many APF approaches have only been validated in obstacle-free environments or simplified, pseudo 3D simulations. This paper presents GO-Flock, a hybrid flocking framework that integrates planning with reactive APF-based control. GO-Flock consists of an upstream Perception Module, which processes depth maps to extract waypoints and virtual agents for obstacle avoidance, and a downstream Collective Navigation Module, which applies a novel APF strategy to achieve effective flocking behavior in cluttered environments. We evaluate GO-Flock against passive APF-based approaches to demonstrate their respective merits, such as their flocking behavior and the ability to overcome local minima. Finally, we validate GO-Flock through obstacle-filled environment and also hardware-in-the-loop experiments where we successfully flocked a team of nine drones, six physical and three virtual, in a forest environment.</description>

      <title>DeLTa: Demonstration and Language-Guided Novel Transparent Object Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the prevalence of transparent object interactions in human everyday life, transparent robotic manipulation research remains limited to short-horizon tasks and basic grasping capabilities.Although some methods have partially addressed these issues, most of them have limitations in generalizability to novel objects and are insufficient for precise long-horizon robot manipulation. To address this limitation, we propose DeLTa (Demonstration and Language-Guided Novel Transparent Object Manipulation), a novel framework that integrates depth estimation, 6D pose estimation, and vision-language planning for precise long-horizon manipulation of transparent objects guided by natural task instructions. A key advantage of our method is its single-demonstration approach, which generalizes 6D trajectories to novel transparent objects without requiring category-level priors or additional training. Additionally, we present a task planner that refines the VLM-generated plan to account for the constraints of a single-arm, eye-in-hand robot for long-horizon object manipulation tasks. Through comprehensive evaluation, we demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing transparent object manipulation approaches, particularly in long-horizon scenarios requiring precise manipulation capabilities.

      <title>Verifier-free Test-Time Sampling for Vision Language Action Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in robot control. However, they remain fundamentally limited in tasks that require high precision due to their single-inference paradigm. While test-time scaling approaches using external verifiers have shown promise, they require additional training and fail to generalize to unseen conditions. We propose Masking Distribution Guided Selection (MG-Select), a novel test-time scaling framework for VLAs that leverages the model's internal properties without requiring additional training or external modules. Our approach utilizes KL divergence from a reference action token distribution as a confidence metric for selecting the optimal action from multiple candidates. We introduce a reference distribution generated by the same VLA but with randomly masked states and language conditions as inputs, ensuring maximum uncertainty while remaining aligned with the target task distribution. Additionally, we propose a joint training strategy that enables the model to learn both conditional and unconditional distributions by applying dropout to state and language conditions, thereby further improving the quality of the reference distribution. Our experiments demonstrate that MG-Select achieves significant performance improvements, including a 28%/35% improvement in real-world in-distribution/out-of-distribution tasks, along with a 168% relative gain on RoboCasa pick-and-place tasks trained with 30 demonstrations.</description>

      <title>Oracle-Guided Masked Contrastive Reinforcement Learning for Visuomotor Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A prevailing approach for learning visuomotor policies is to employ reinforcement learning to map high-dimensional visual observations directly to action commands. However, the combination of high-dimensional visual inputs and agile maneuver outputs leads to long-standing challenges, including low sample efficiency and significant sim-to-real gaps. To address these issues, we propose Oracle-Guided Masked Contrastive Reinforcement Learning (OMC-RL), a novel framework designed to improve the sample efficiency and asymptotic performance of visuomotor policy learning. OMC-RL explicitly decouples the learning process into two stages: an upstream representation learning stage and a downstream policy learning stage. In the upstream stage, a masked Transformer module is trained with temporal modeling and contrastive learning to extract temporally-aware and task-relevant representations from sequential visual inputs. After training, the learned encoder is frozen and used to extract visual representations from consecutive frames, while the Transformer module is discarded. In the downstream stage, an oracle teacher policy with privileged access to global state information supervises the agent during early training to provide informative guidance and accelerate early policy learning. This guidance is gradually reduced to allow independent exploration as training progresses. Extensive experiments in simulated and real-world environments demonstrate that OMC-RL achieves superior sample efficiency and asymptotic policy performance, while also improving generalization across diverse and perceptually complex scenarios.</description>

      <title>Stable Robot Motions on Manifolds: Learning Lyapunov-Constrained Neural Manifold ODEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning stable dynamical systems from data is crucial for safe and reliable robot motion planning and control. However, extending stability guarantees to trajectories defined on Riemannian manifolds poses significant challenges due to the manifold's geometric constraints. To address this, we propose a general framework for learning stable dynamical systems on Riemannian manifolds using neural ordinary differential equations. Our method guarantees stability by projecting the neural vector field evolving on the manifold so that it strictly satisfies the Lyapunov stability criterion, ensuring stability at every system state. By leveraging a flexible neural parameterisation for both the base vector field and the Lyapunov function, our framework can accurately represent complex trajectories while respecting manifold constraints by evolving solutions directly on the manifold. We provide an efficient training strategy for applying our framework and demonstrate its utility by solving Riemannian LASA datasets on the unit quaternion (S^3) and symmetric positive-definite matrix manifolds, as well as robotic motions evolving on \mathbb{R}^3 \times S^3. We demonstrate the performance, scalability, and practical applicability of our approach through extensive simulations and by learning robot motions in a real-world experiment.</description>

      <title>Federated Split Learning for Resource-Constrained Robots in Industrial IoT: Framework Comparison, Optimization Strategies, and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated split learning (FedSL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for enabling collaborative intelligence in industrial Internet of Things (IoT) systems, particularly in smart factories where data privacy, communication efficiency, and device heterogeneity are critical concerns. In this article, we present a comprehensive study of FedSL frameworks tailored for resource-constrained robots in industrial scenarios. We compare synchronous, asynchronous, hierarchical, and heterogeneous FedSL frameworks in terms of workflow, scalability, adaptability, and limitations under dynamic industrial conditions. Furthermore, we systematically categorize token fusion strategies into three paradigms: input-level (pre-fusion), intermediate-level (intra-fusion), and output-level (post-fusion), and summarize their respective strengths in industrial applications. We also provide adaptive optimization techniques to enhance the efficiency and feasibility of FedSL implementation, including model compression, split layer selection, computing frequency allocation, and wireless resource management. Simulation results validate the performance of these frameworks under industrial detection scenarios. Finally, we outline open issues and research directions of FedSL in future smart manufacturing systems.</description>

      <title>Precise and Efficient Collision Prediction under Uncertainty in Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research introduces two efficient methods to estimate the collision risk of planned trajectories in autonomous driving under uncertain driving conditions. Deterministic collision checks of planned trajectories are often inaccurate or overly conservative, as noisy perception, localization errors, and uncertain predictions of other traffic participants introduce significant uncertainty into the planning process. This paper presents two semi-analytic methods to compute the collision probability of planned trajectories with arbitrary convex obstacles. The first approach evaluates the probability of spatial overlap between an autonomous vehicle and surrounding obstacles, while the second estimates the collision probability based on stochastic boundary crossings. Both formulations incorporate full state uncertainties, including position, orientation, and velocity, and achieve high accuracy at computational costs suitable for real-time planning. Simulation studies verify that the proposed methods closely match Monte Carlo results while providing significant runtime advantages, enabling their use in risk-aware trajectory planning. The collision estimation methods are available as open-source software: https://github.com/TUM-AVS/Collision-Probability-Estimation</description>

      <title>Human-in-the-loop Optimisation in Robot-assisted Gait Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wearable robots offer a promising solution for quantitatively monitoring gait and providing systematic, adaptive assistance to promote patient independence and improve gait. However, due to significant interpersonal and intrapersonal variability in walking patterns, it is important to design robot controllers that can adapt to the unique characteristics of each individual. This paper investigates the potential of human-in-the-loop optimisation (HILO) to deliver personalised assistance in gait training. The Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) was employed to continuously optimise an assist-as-needed controller of a lower-limb exoskeleton. Six healthy individuals participated over a two-day experiment. Our results suggest that while the CMA-ES appears to converge to a unique set of stiffnesses for each individual, no measurable impact on the subjects' performance was observed during the validation trials. These findings highlight the impact of human-robot co-adaptation and human behaviour variability, whose effect may be greater than potential benefits of personalising rule-based assistive controllers. Our work contributes to understanding the limitations of current personalisation approaches in exoskeleton-assisted gait rehabilitation and identifies key challenges for effective implementation of human-in-the-loop optimisation in this domain.</description>

      <title>VCoT-Grasp: Grasp Foundation Models with Visual Chain-of-Thought Reasoning for Language-driven Grasp Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robotic grasping is one of the most fundamental tasks in robotic manipulation, and grasp detection/generation has long been the subject of extensive research. Recently, language-driven grasp generation has emerged as a promising direction due to its practical interaction capabilities. However, most existing approaches either lack sufficient reasoning and generalization capabilities or depend on complex modular pipelines. Moreover, current grasp foundation models tend to overemphasize dialog and object semantics, resulting in inferior performance and restriction to single-object grasping. To maintain strong reasoning ability and generalization in cluttered environments, we propose VCoT-Grasp, an end-to-end grasp foundation model that incorporates visual chain-of-thought reasoning to enhance visual understanding for grasp generation. VCoT-Grasp adopts a multi-turn processing paradigm that dynamically focuses on visual inputs while providing interpretable reasoning traces. For training, we refine and introduce a large-scale dataset, VCoT-GraspSet, comprising 167K synthetic images with over 1.36M grasps, as well as 400+ real-world images with more than 1.2K grasps, annotated with intermediate bounding boxes. Extensive experiments on both VCoT-GraspSet and real robot demonstrate that our method significantly improves grasp success rates and generalizes effectively to unseen objects, backgrounds, and distractors. More details can be found at https://zhanghr2001.github.io/VCoT-Grasp.github.io.</description>

      <title>A Co-Design Framework for Energy-Aware Monoped Jumping with Detailed Actuator Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A monoped's jump height and energy consumption depend on both, its mechanical design and control strategy. Existing co-design frameworks typically optimize for either maximum height or minimum energy, neglecting their trade-off. They also often omit gearbox parameter optimization and use oversimplified actuator mass models, producing designs difficult to replicate in practice. In this work, we introduce a novel three-stage co-design optimization framework that jointly maximizes jump height while minimizing mechanical energy consumption of a monoped. The proposed method explicitly incorporates realistic actuator mass models and optimizes mechanical design (including gearbox) and control parameters within a unified framework. The resulting design outputs are then used to automatically generate a parameterized CAD model suitable for direct fabrication, significantly reducing manual design iterations. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate a 50 percent reduction in mechanical energy consumption compared to the baseline design, while achieving a jump height of 0.8m.

      <title>Learning to Crawl: Latent Model-Based Reinforcement Learning for Soft Robotic Adaptive Locomotion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soft robotic crawlers are mobile robots that utilize soft body deformability and compliance to achieve locomotion through surface contact. Designing control strategies for such systems is challenging due to model inaccuracies, sensor noise, and the need to discover locomotor gaits. In this work, we present a model-based reinforcement learning (MB-RL) framework in which latent dynamics inferred from onboard sensors serve as a predictive model that guides an actor-critic algorithm to optimize locomotor policies. We evaluate the framework on a minimal crawler model in simulation using inertial measurement units and time-of-flight sensors as observations. The learned latent dynamics enable short-horizon motion prediction while the actor-critic discovers effective locomotor policies. This approach highlights the potential of latent-dynamics MB-RL for enabling embodied soft robotic adaptive locomotion based solely on noisy sensor feedback.</description>

      <title>The DISTANT Design for Remote Transmission and Steering Systems for Planetary Robotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planetary exploration missions require robust locomotion systems capable of operating in extreme environments over extended periods. This paper presents the DISTANT (Distant Transmission and Steering Systems) design, a novel approach for relocating rover traction and steering actuators from wheel-mounted positions to a thermally protected warm box within the rover body. The design addresses critical challenges in long-distance traversal missions by protecting sensitive components from thermal cycling, dust contamination, and mechanical wear. A double wishbone suspension configuration with cardan joints and capstan drive steering has been selected as the optimal architecture following comprehensive trade-off analysis. The system enables independent wheel traction, steering control, and suspension management whilst maintaining all motorisation within the protected environment. The design meets a 50 km traverse requirement without performance degradation, with integrated dust protection mechanisms and thermal management solutions. Testing and validation activities are planned for Q1 2026 following breadboard manufacturing at 1:3 scale.</description>

      <title>AI-Enabled Capabilities to Facilitate Next-Generation Rover Surface Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current planetary rovers operate at traverse speeds of approximately 10 cm/s, fundamentally limiting exploration efficiency. This work presents integrated AI systems which significantly improve autonomy through three components: (i) the FASTNAV Far Obstacle Detector (FOD), capable of facilitating sustained 1.0 m/s speeds via computer vision-based obstacle detection; (ii) CISRU, a multi-robot coordination framework enabling human-robot collaboration for in-situ resource utilisation; and (iii) the ViBEKO and AIAXR deep learning-based terrain classification studies. Field validation in Mars analogue environments demonstrated these systems at Technology Readiness Level 4, providing measurable improvements in traverse speed, classification accuracy, and operational safety for next-generation planetary missions.</description>

      <title>Coordinate-Consistent Localization via Continuous-Time Calibration and Fusion of UWB and SLAM Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Onboard simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) methods are commonly used to provide accurate localization information for autonomous robots. However, the coordinate origin of SLAM estimate often resets for each run. On the other hand, UWB-based localization with fixed anchors can ensure a consistent coordinate reference across sessions; however, it requires an accurate assignment of the anchor nodes' coordinates. To this end, we propose a two-stage approach that calibrates and fuses UWB data and SLAM data to achieve coordinate-wise consistent and accurate localization in the same environment. In the first stage, we solve a continuous-time batch optimization problem by using the range and odometry data from one full run, incorporating height priors and anchor-to-anchor distance factors to recover the anchors' 3D positions. For the subsequent runs in the second stage, a sliding-window optimization scheme fuses the UWB and SLAM data, which facilitates accurate localization in the same coordinate system. Experiments are carried out on the NTU VIRAL dataset with six scenarios of UAV flight, and we show that calibration using data in one run is sufficient to enable accurate localization in the remaining runs. We release our source code to benefit the community at https://github.com/ntdathp/slam-uwb-calibration.</description>

      <title>Cross-Embodiment Dexterous Hand Articulation Generation via Morphology-Aware Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dexterous grasping with multi-fingered hands remains challenging due to high-dimensional articulations and the cost of optimization-based pipelines. Existing end-to-end methods require training on large-scale datasets for specific hands, limiting their ability to generalize across different embodiments. We propose an eigengrasp-based, end-to-end framework for cross-embodiment grasp generation. From a hand's morphology description, we derive a morphology embedding and an eigengrasp set. Conditioned on these, together with the object point cloud and wrist pose, an amplitude predictor regresses articulation coefficients in a low-dimensional space, which are decoded into full joint articulations. Articulation learning is supervised with a Kinematic-Aware Articulation Loss (KAL) that emphasizes fingertip-relevant motions and injects morphology-specific structure. In simulation on unseen objects across three dexterous hands, our model attains a 91.9% average grasp success rate with less than 0.4 seconds inference per grasp. With few-shot adaptation to an unseen hand, it achieves 85.6% success on unseen objects in simulation, and real-world experiments on this few-shot generalized hand achieve an 87% success rate. The code and additional materials will be made available upon publication on our project website https://connor-zh.github.io/cross_embodiment_dexterous_grasping.</description>

      <title>Multi-Robot Distributed Optimization for Exploration and Mapping of Unknown Environments using Bioinspired Tactile-Sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This project proposes a bioinspired multi-robot system using Distributed Optimization for efficient exploration and mapping of unknown environments. Each robot explores its environment and creates a map, which is afterwards put together to form a global 2D map of the environment. Inspired by wall-following behaviors, each robot autonomously explores its neighborhood based on a tactile sensor, similar to the antenna of a cockroach, mounted on the surface of the robot. Instead of avoiding obstacles, robots log collision points when they touch obstacles. This decentralized control strategy ensures effective task allocation and efficient exploration of unknown terrains, with applications in search and rescue, industrial inspection, and environmental monitoring. The approach was validated through experiments using e-puck robots in a simulated 1.5 x 1.5 m environment with three obstacles. The results demonstrated the system's effectiveness in achieving high coverage, minimizing collisions, and constructing accurate 2D maps.</description>

      <title>Towards Autonomous Tape Handling for Robotic Wound Redressing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chronic wounds, such as diabetic, pressure, and venous ulcers, affect over 6.5 million patients in the United States alone and generate an annual cost exceeding \$25 billion. Despite this burden, chronic wound care remains a routine yet manual process performed exclusively by trained clinicians due to its critical safety demands. We envision a future in which robotics and automation support wound care to lower costs and enhance patient outcomes. This paper introduces an autonomous framework for one of the most fundamental yet challenging subtasks in wound redressing: adhesive tape manipulation. Specifically, we address two critical capabilities: tape initial detachment (TID) and secure tape placement. To handle the complex adhesive dynamics of detachment, we propose a force-feedback imitation learning approach trained from human teleoperation demonstrations. For tape placement, we develop a numerical trajectory optimization method based to ensure smooth adhesion and wrinkle-free application across diverse anatomical surfaces. We validate these methods through extensive experiments, demonstrating reliable performance in both quantitative evaluations and integrated wound redressing pipelines. Our results establish tape manipulation as an essential step toward practical robotic wound care automation.</description>

      <title>Vision-Guided Targeted Grasping and Vibration for Robotic Pollination in Controlled Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robotic pollination offers a promising alternative to manual labor and bumblebee-assisted methods in controlled agriculture, where wind-driven pollination is absent and regulatory restrictions limit the use of commercial pollinators. In this work, we present and validate a vision-guided robotic framework that uses data from an end-effector mounted RGB-D sensor and combines 3D plant reconstruction, targeted grasp planning, and physics-based vibration modeling to enable precise pollination. First, the plant is reconstructed in 3D and registered to the robot coordinate frame to identify obstacle-free grasp poses along the main stem. Second, a discrete elastic rod model predicts the relationship between actuation parameters and flower dynamics, guiding the selection of optimal pollination strategies. Finally, a manipulator with soft grippers grasps the stem and applies controlled vibrations to induce pollen release. End-to-end experiments demonstrate a 92.5\% main-stem grasping success rate, and simulation-guided optimization of vibration parameters further validates the feasibility of our approach, ensuring that the robot can safely and effectively perform pollination without damaging the flower. To our knowledge, this is the first robotic system to jointly integrate vision-based grasping and vibration modeling for automated precision pollination.</description>

Abstract: Marine robotics simulators play a fundamental role in the development of marine robotic systems. With increased focus on the marine robotics field in recent years, there has been significant interest in developing higher fidelitysimulation of marine sensors, physics, and visual rendering capabilities to support autonomous marine robot development and validation. HoloOcean 2.0, the next major release of HoloOcean, brings state-of-the-art features under a general marine simulator capable of supporting a variety of tasks. New features in HoloOcean 2.0 include migration to Unreal Engine (UE) 5.3, advanced vehicle dynamics using models from Fossen, and support for ROS2 using a custom bridge. Additional features are currently in development, including significantly more efficient ray tracing-based sidescan, forward-looking, and bathymetric sonar implementations; semantic sensors; environment generation tools; volumetric environmental effects; and realistic waves.</description>

      <title>DYMO-Hair: Generalizable Volumetric Dynamics Modeling for Robot Hair Manipulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hair care is an essential daily activity, yet it remains inaccessible to individuals with limited mobility and challenging for autonomous robot systems due to the fine-grained physical structure and complex dynamics of hair. In this work, we present DYMO-Hair, a model-based robot hair care system. We introduce a novel dynamics learning paradigm that is suited for volumetric quantities such as hair, relying on an action-conditioned latent state editing mechanism, coupled with a compact 3D latent space of diverse hairstyles to improve generalizability. This latent space is pre-trained at scale using a novel hair physics simulator, enabling generalization across previously unseen hairstyles. Using the dynamics model with a Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) planner, DYMO-Hair is able to perform visual goal-conditioned hair styling. Experiments in simulation demonstrate that DYMO-Hair's dynamics model outperforms baselines on capturing local deformation for diverse, unseen hairstyles. DYMO-Hair further outperforms baselines in closed-loop hair styling tasks on unseen hairstyles, with an average of 22% lower final geometric error and 42% higher success rate than the state-of-the-art system. Real-world experiments exhibit zero-shot transferability of our system to wigs, achieving consistent success on challenging unseen hairstyles where the state-of-the-art system fails. Together, these results introduce a foundation for model-based robot hair care, advancing toward more generalizable, flexible, and accessible robot hair styling in unconstrained physical environments.

      <title>EmbodiedCoder: Parameterized Embodied Mobile Manipulation via Modern Coding Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in control robot methods, from end-to-end vision-language-action frameworks to modular systems with predefined primitives, have advanced robots' ability to follow natural language instructions. Nonetheless, many approaches still struggle to scale to diverse environments, as they often rely on large annotated datasets and offer limited interpretability.In this work, we introduce EmbodiedCoder, a training-free framework for open-world mobile robot manipulation that leverages coding models to directly generate executable robot trajectories. By grounding high-level instructions in code, EmbodiedCoder enables flexible object geometry parameterization and manipulation trajectory synthesis without additional data collection or fine-tuning.This coding-based paradigm provides a transparent and generalizable way to connect perception with manipulation. Experiments on real mobile robots show that EmbodiedCoder achieves robust performance across diverse long-term tasks and generalizes effectively to novel objects and environments.Our results demonstrate an interpretable approach for bridging high-level reasoning and low-level control, moving beyond fixed primitives toward versatile robot intelligence.

      <title>Safety-Critical Control with Bounded Inputs: A Closed-Form Solution for Backup Control Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Verifying the safety of controllers is critical for many applications, but is especially challenging for systems with bounded inputs. Backup control barrier functions (bCBFs) offer a structured approach to synthesizing safe controllers that are guaranteed to satisfy input bounds by leveraging the knowledge of a backup controller. While powerful, bCBFs require solving a high-dimensional quadratic program at run-time, which may be too costly for computationally-constrained systems such as aerospace vehicles. We propose an approach that optimally interpolates between a nominal controller and the backup controller, and we derive the solution to this optimization problem in closed form. We prove that this closed-form controller is guaranteed to be safe while obeying input bounds. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach on a double integrator and a nonlinear fixed-wing aircraft example.</description>

      <title>MetaVLA: Unified Meta Co-training For Efficient Embodied Adaption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models show promise in embodied reasoning, yet remain far from true generalists-they often require task-specific fine-tuning, and generalize poorly to unseen tasks. We propose MetaVLA, a unified, backbone-agnostic post-training framework for efficient and scalable alignment. MetaVLA introduces Context-Aware Meta Co-Training, which consolidates diverse target tasks into a single fine-tuning stage while leveraging structurally diverse auxiliary tasks to improve in-domain generalization. Unlike naive multi-task SFT, MetaVLA integrates a lightweight meta-learning mechanism-derived from Attentive Neural Processes-to enable rapid adaptation from diverse contexts with minimal architectural change or inference overhead. On the LIBERO benchmark, MetaVLA with six auxiliary tasks outperforms OpenVLA by up to 8.0% on long-horizon tasks, reduces training steps from 240K to 75K, and cuts GPU time by ~76%. These results show that scalable, low-resource post-training is achievable-paving the way toward general-purpose embodied agents. Code will be available.</description>

      <title>D2E: Scaling Vision-Action Pretraining on Desktop Data for Transfer to Embodied AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models leverage internet-scale text data, yet embodied AI remains constrained by the prohibitive costs of physical trajectory collection. Desktop environments -- particularly gaming -- offer a compelling alternative: they provide rich sensorimotor interactions at scale while maintaining the structured observation-action coupling essential for embodied learning. We present D2E (Desktop to Embodied AI), a framework that demonstrates desktop interactions can serve as an effective pretraining substrate for robotics embodied AI tasks. Unlike prior work that remained domain-specific (e.g., VPT for Minecraft) or kept data proprietary (e.g., SIMA), D2E establishes a complete pipeline from scalable desktop data collection to verified transfer in embodied domains. Our framework comprises three components: (1) the OWA Toolkit that unifies diverse desktop interactions into a standardized format with 152x compression, (2) the Generalist-IDM that achieves strong zero-shot generalization across unseen games through timestamp-based event prediction, enabling internet-scale pseudo-labeling, and (3) VAPT that transfers desktop-pretrained representations to physical manipulation and navigation. Using 1.3K+ hours of data (259 hours of human demonstrations, and 1K+ hours of pseudo-labeled gameplay), we achieve a total of 96.6% success rate on LIBERO manipulation and 83.3% on CANVAS navigation benchmarks. This validates that sensorimotor primitives in digital interactions exhibit sufficient invariance to transfer meaningfully to physical embodied tasks, establishing desktop pretraining as a practical paradigm for robotics. We will make all our work public, including the OWA toolkit, datasets of human-collected and pseudo-labeled, and VAPT-trained models available at https://worv-ai.github.io/d2e/</description>

      <title>The Safety Challenge of World Models for Embodied AI Agents: A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid progress in embodied artificial intelligence has highlighted the necessity for more advanced and integrated models that can perceive, interpret, and predict environmental dynamics. In this context, World Models (WMs) have been introduced to provide embodied agents with the abilities to anticipate future environmental states and fill in knowledge gaps, thereby enhancing agents' ability to plan and execute actions. However, when dealing with embodied agents it is fundamental to ensure that predictions are safe for both the agent and the environment. In this article, we conduct a comprehensive literature review of World Models in the domains of autonomous driving and robotics, with a specific focus on the safety implications of scene and control generation tasks. Our review is complemented by an empirical analysis, wherein we collect and examine predictions from state-of-the-art models, identify and categorize common faults (herein referred to as pathologies), and provide a quantitative evaluation of the results.</description>

      <title>Information-Theoretic Policy Pre-Training with Empowerment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Empowerment, an information-theoretic measure of an agent's potential influence on its environment, has emerged as a powerful intrinsic motivation and exploration framework for reinforcement learning (RL). Besides for unsupervised RL and skill learning algorithms, the specific use of empowerment as a pre-training signal has received limited attention in the literature. We show that empowerment can be used as a pre-training signal for data-efficient downstream task adaptation. For this we extend the traditional notion of empowerment by introducing discounted empowerment, which balances the agent's control over the environment across short- and long-term horizons. Leveraging this formulation, we propose a novel pre-training paradigm that initializes policies to maximize discounted empowerment, enabling agents to acquire a robust understanding of environmental dynamics. We analyze empowerment-based pre-training for various existing RL algorithms and empirically demonstrate its potential as a general-purpose initialization strategy: empowerment-maximizing policies with long horizons are data-efficient and effective, leading to improved adaptability in downstream tasks. Our findings pave the way for future research to scale this framework to high-dimensional and complex tasks, further advancing the field of RL.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Quantum-Classical Policy Gradient for Adaptive Control of Cyber-Physical Systems: A Comparative Study of VQC vs. MLP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The comparative evaluation between classical and quantum reinforcement learning (QRL) paradigms was conducted to investigate their convergence behavior, robustness under observational noise, and computational efficiency in a benchmark control environment. The study employed a multilayer perceptron (MLP) agent as a classical baseline and a parameterized variational quantum circuit (VQC) as a quantum counterpart, both trained on the CartPole-v1 environment over 500 episodes. Empirical results demonstrated that the classical MLP achieved near-optimal policy convergence with a mean return of 498.7 +/- 3.2, maintaining stable equilibrium throughout training. In contrast, the VQC exhibited limited learning capability, with an average return of 14.6 +/- 4.8, primarily constrained by circuit depth and qubit connectivity. Noise robustness analysis further revealed that the MLP policy deteriorated gracefully under Gaussian perturbations, while the VQC displayed higher sensitivity at equivalent noise levels. Despite the lower asymptotic performance, the VQC exhibited significantly lower parameter count and marginally increased training time, highlighting its potential scalability for low-resource quantum processors. The results suggest that while classical neural policies remain dominant in current control benchmarks, quantum-enhanced architectures could offer promising efficiency advantages once hardware noise and expressivity limitations are mitigated.</description>

      <title>Dropping the D: RGB-D SLAM Without the Depth Sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present DropD-SLAM, a real-time monocular SLAM system that achieves RGB-D-level accuracy without relying on depth sensors. The system replaces active depth input with three pretrained vision modules: a monocular metric depth estimator, a learned keypoint detector, and an instance segmentation network. Dynamic objects are suppressed using dilated instance masks, while static keypoints are assigned predicted depth values and backprojected into 3D to form metrically scaled features. These are processed by an unmodified RGB-D SLAM back end for tracking and mapping. On the TUM RGB-D benchmark, DropD-SLAM attains 7.4 cm mean ATE on static sequences and 1.8 cm on dynamic sequences, matching or surpassing state-of-the-art RGB-D methods while operating at 22 FPS on a single GPU. These results suggest that modern pretrained vision models can replace active depth sensors as reliable, real-time sources of metric scale, marking a step toward simpler and more cost-effective SLAM systems.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of using knowledge graphs to interpret actions and behaviors for robot manipulation control. Equipped with an uncalibrated visual servoing controller, we propose to use robot knowledge graphs to unify behavior trees and geometric constraints, conceptualizing robot manipulation control as semantic events. The robot knowledge graphs not only preserve the advantages of behavior trees in scripting actions and behaviors, but also offer additional benefits of mapping natural interactions between concepts and events, which enable knowledgeable explanations of the manipulation contexts. Through real-world evaluations, we demonstrate the flexibility of the robot knowledge graphs to support explainable robot manipulation control.</description>

      <title>Ego-to-Exo: Interfacing Third Person Visuals from Egocentric Views in Real-time for Improved ROV Teleoperation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00848v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Underwater ROVs (Remotely Operated Vehicles) are unmanned submersible vehicles designed for exploring and operating in the depths of the ocean. Despite using high-end cameras, typical teleoperation engines based on first-person (egocentric) views limit a surface operator's ability to maneuver the ROV in complex deep-water missions. In this paper, we present an interactive teleoperation interface that enhances the operational capabilities via increased situational awareness. This is accomplished by (i) offering on-demand "third"-person (exocentric) visuals from past egocentric views, and (ii) facilitating enhanced peripheral information with augmented ROV pose information in real-time. We achieve this by integrating a 3D geometry-based Ego-to-Exo view synthesis algorithm into a monocular SLAM system for accurate trajectory estimation. The proposed closed-form solution only uses past egocentric views from the ROV and a SLAM backbone for pose estimation, which makes it portable to existing ROV platforms. Unlike data-driven solutions, it is invariant to applications and waterbody-specific scenes. We validate the geometric accuracy of the proposed framework through extensive experiments of 2-DOF indoor navigation and 6-DOF underwater cave exploration in challenging low-light conditions. A subjective evaluation on 15 human teleoperators further confirms the effectiveness of the integrated features for improved teleoperation. We demonstrate the benefits of dynamic Ego-to-Exo view generation and real-time pose rendering for remote ROV teleoperation by following navigation guides such as cavelines inside underwater caves. This new way of interactive ROV teleoperation opens up promising opportunities for future research in subsea telerobotics.</description>

      <title>Image-Based Visual Servoing for Enhanced Cooperation of Dual-Arm Manipulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19432v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The cooperation of a pair of robot manipulators is required to manipulate a target object without any fixtures. The conventional control methods coordinate the end-effector pose of each manipulator with that of the other using their kinematics and joint coordinate measurements. Yet, the manipulators' inaccurate kinematics and joint coordinate measurements can cause significant pose synchronization errors in practice. This paper thus proposes an image-based visual servoing approach for enhancing the cooperation of a dual-arm manipulation system. On top of the classical control, the visual servoing controller lets each manipulator use its carried camera to measure the image features of the other's marker and adapt its end-effector pose with the counterpart on the move. Because visual measurements are robust to kinematic errors, the proposed control can reduce the end-effector pose synchronization errors and the fluctuations of the interaction forces of the pair of manipulators on the move. Theoretical analyses have rigorously proven the stability of the closed-loop system. Comparative experiments on real robots have substantiated the effectiveness of the proposed control.</description>

      <title>Self-Supervised Representation Learning with Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture for Automotive LiDAR Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04969v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, self-supervised representation learning relying on vast amounts of unlabeled data has been explored as a pre-training method for autonomous driving. However, directly applying popular contrastive or generative methods to this problem is insufficient and may even lead to negative transfer. In this paper, we present AD-L-JEPA, a novel self-supervised pre-training framework with a joint embedding predictive architecture (JEPA) for automotive LiDAR object detection. Unlike existing methods, AD-L-JEPA is neither generative nor contrastive. Instead of explicitly generating masked regions, our method predicts Bird's-Eye-View embeddings to capture the diverse nature of driving scenes. Furthermore, our approach eliminates the need to manually form contrastive pairs by employing explicit variance regularization to avoid representation collapse. Experimental results demonstrate consistent improvements on the LiDAR 3D object detection downstream task across the KITTI3D, Waymo, and ONCE datasets, while reducing GPU hours by 1.9x-2.7x and GPU memory by 2.8x-4x compared with the state-of-the-art method Occupancy-MAE. Notably, on the largest ONCE dataset, pre-training on 100K frames yields a 1.61 mAP gain, better than all other methods pre-trained on either 100K or 500K frames, and pre-training on 500K frames yields a 2.98 mAP gain, better than all other methods pre-trained on either 500K or 1M frames. AD-L-JEPA constitutes the first JEPA-based pre-training method for autonomous driving. It offers better quality, faster, and more GPU-memory-efficient self-supervised representation learning. The source code of AD-L-JEPA is ready to be released.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06757v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sampling-based motion planning algorithms, like the Rapidly-Exploring Random Tree (RRT) and its widely used variant, RRT-Connect, provide efficient solutions for high-dimensional planning problems faced by real-world robots. However, these methods remain computationally intensive, particularly in complex environments that require many collision checks. To improve performance, recent efforts have explored parallelizing specific components of RRT such as collision checking, or running multiple planners independently. However, little has been done to develop an integrated parallelism approach, co-designed for large-scale parallelism. In this work we present pRRTC, a RRT-Connect based planner co-designed for GPU acceleration across the entire algorithm through parallel expansion and SIMT-optimized collision checking. We evaluate the effectiveness of pRRTC on the MotionBenchMaker dataset using robots with 7, 8, and 14 degrees of freedom (DoF). Compared to the state-of-the-art, pRRTC achieves as much as a 10x speedup on constrained reaching tasks with a 5.4x reduction in standard deviation. pRRTC also achieves a 1.4x reduction in average initial path cost. Finally, we deploy pRRTC on a 14-DoF dual Franka Panda arm setup and demonstrate real-time, collision-free motion planning with dynamic obstacles. We open-source our planner to support the wider community.</description>

      <title>IMPACT: Intelligent Motion Planning with Acceptable Contact Trajectories via Vision-Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10110v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motion planning involves determining a sequence of robot configurations to reach a desired pose, subject to movement and safety constraints. Traditional motion planning finds collision-free paths, but this is overly restrictive in clutter, where it may not be possible for a robot to accomplish a task without contact. In addition, contacts range from relatively benign (e.g. brushing a soft pillow) to more dangerous (e.g. toppling a glass vase), making it difficult to characterize which may be acceptable. In this paper, we propose IMPACT, a novel motion planning framework that uses Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to infer environment semantics, identifying which parts of the environment can best tolerate contact based on object properties and locations. Our approach generates an anisotropic cost map that encodes directional push safety. We pair this map with a contact-aware A* planner to find stable contact-rich paths. We perform experiments using 20 simulation and 10 real-world scenes and assess using task success rate, object displacements, and feedback from human evaluators. Our results over 3200 simulation and 200 real-world trials suggest that IMPACT enables efficient contact-rich motion planning in cluttered settings while outperforming alternative methods and ablations.

      <title>Capturing a Moving Target by Two Robots in the F2F Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15688v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a search problem on capturing a moving target on an infinite real line. Two autonomous mobile robots (which can move with a maximum speed of 1) are initially placed at the origin, while an oblivious moving target is initially placed at a distance $d$ away from the origin. The robots can move along the line in any direction, but the target is oblivious, cannot change direction, and moves either away from or toward the origin at a constant speed $v$. Our aim is to design efficient algorithms for the two robots to capture the target. The target is captured only when both robots are co-located with it. The robots communicate with each other only face-to-face (F2F), meaning they can exchange information only when co-located, while the target remains oblivious and has no communication capabilities.
  We design algorithms under various knowledge scenarios, which take into account the prior knowledge the robots have about the starting distance $d$, the direction of movement (either toward or away from the origin), and the speed $v$ of the target. As a measure of the efficiency of the algorithms, we use the competitive ratio, which is the ratio of the capture time of an algorithm with limited knowledge to the capture time in the full-knowledge model. In our analysis, we are mindful of the cost of changing direction of movement, and show how to accomplish the capture of the target with at most three direction changes (turns).</description>

      <title>Decremental Dynamics Planning for Robot Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20521v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most, if not all, robot navigation systems employ a decomposed planning framework that includes global and local planning. To trade-off onboard computation and plan quality, current systems have to limit all robot dynamics considerations only within the local planner, while leveraging an extremely simplified robot representation (e.g., a point-mass holonomic model without dynamics) in the global level. However, such an artificial decomposition based on either full or zero consideration of robot dynamics can lead to gaps between the two levels, e.g., a global path based on a holonomic point-mass model may not be realizable by a non-holonomic robot, especially in highly constrained obstacle environments. Motivated by such a limitation, we propose a novel paradigm, Decremental Dynamics Planning that integrates dynamic constraints into the entire planning process, with a focus on high-fidelity dynamics modeling at the beginning and a gradual fidelity reduction as the planning progresses. To validate the effectiveness of this paradigm, we augment three different planners with DDP and show overall improved planning performance. We also develop a new DDP-based navigation system, which achieves first place in the simulation phase of the 2025 BARN Challenge. Both simulated and physical experiments validate DDP's hypothesized benefits.</description>

      <title>Toward Dynamic Control of Tendon-driven Continuum Robots using Clarke Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20693v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a dynamic model and control framework for tendon-driven continuum robots (TDCRs) with multiple segments and an arbitrary number of tendons per segment. Our approach leverages the Clarke transform, the Euler-Lagrange formalism, and the piecewise constant curvature assumption to formulate a dynamic model on a two-dimensional manifold embedded in the joint space that inherently satisfies tendon constraints. We present linear and constraint-informed controllers that operate directly on this manifold, along with practical methods for preventing negative tendon forces without compromising control fidelity. This opens up new design possibilities for overactuated TDCRs with improved force distribution and stiffness without increasing controller complexity. We validate these approaches in simulation and on a physical prototype with one segment and five tendons, demonstrating accurate dynamic behavior and robust trajectory tracking under real-time conditions.</description>

      <title>Identifying Uncertainty in Self-Adaptive Robotics with Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20684v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Future self-adaptive robots are expected to operate in highly dynamic environments while effectively managing uncertainties. However, identifying the sources and impacts of uncertainties in such robotic systems and defining appropriate mitigation strategies is challenging due to the inherent complexity of self-adaptive robots and the lack of comprehensive knowledge about the various factors influencing uncertainty. Hence, practitioners often rely on intuition and past experiences from similar systems to address uncertainties. In this article, we evaluate the potential of large language models (LLMs) in enabling a systematic and automated approach to identify uncertainties in self-adaptive robotics throughout the software engineering lifecycle. For this evaluation, we analyzed 10 advanced LLMs with varying capabilities across four industrial-sized robotics case studies, gathering the practitioners' perspectives on the LLM-generated responses related to uncertainties. Results showed that practitioners agreed with 63-88% of the LLM responses and expressed strong interest in the practicality of LLMs for this purpose.</description>

      <title>CottonSim: A vision-guided autonomous robotic system for cotton harvesting in Gazebo simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05317v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cotton is a major cash crop in the United States, with the country being a leading global producer and exporter. Nearly all U.S. cotton is grown in the Cotton Belt, spanning 17 states in the southern region. Harvesting remains a critical yet challenging stage, impacted by the use of costly, environmentally harmful defoliants and heavy, expensive cotton pickers. These factors contribute to yield loss, reduced fiber quality, and soil compaction, which collectively threaten long-term sustainability. To address these issues, this study proposes a lightweight, small-scale, vision-guided autonomous robotic cotton picker as an alternative. An autonomous system, built on Clearpath's Husky platform and integrated with the CottonEye perception system, was developed and tested in the Gazebo simulation environment. A virtual cotton field was designed to facilitate autonomous navigation testing. The navigation system used Global Positioning System (GPS) and map-based guidance, assisted by an RGBdepth camera and a YOLOv8nseg instance segmentation model. The model achieved a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 85.2%, a recall of 88.9%, and a precision of 93.0%. The GPS-based approach reached a 100% completion rate (CR) within a $(5e-6)^{\circ}$ threshold, while the map-based method achieved a 96.7% CR within a 0.25 m threshold. The developed Robot Operating System (ROS) packages enable robust simulation of autonomous cotton picking, offering a scalable baseline for future agricultural robotics. CottonSim code and datasets are publicly available on GitHub: https://github.com/imtheva/CottonSim</description>

      <title>Distilling On-device Language Models for Robot Planning with Minimal Human Intervention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17486v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) provide robots with powerful contextual reasoning abilities and a natural human interface. Yet, current LLM-enabled robots typically depend on cloud-hosted models, limiting their usability in environments with unreliable communication infrastructure, such as outdoor or industrial settings. We present PRISM, a framework for distilling small language model (SLM)-enabled robot planners that run on-device with minimal human supervision. Starting from an existing LLM-enabled planner, PRISM automatically synthesizes diverse tasks and environments, elicits plans from the LLM, and uses this synthetic dataset to distill a compact SLM as a drop-in replacement of the source model. We apply PRISM to three LLM-enabled planners for mapping and exploration, manipulation, and household assistance, and we demonstrate that PRISM improves the performance of Llama-3.2-3B from 10-20% of GPT-4o's performance to over 93% - using only synthetic data. We further demonstrate that the distilled planners generalize across heterogeneous robotic platforms (ground and aerial) and diverse environments (indoor and outdoor). We release all software, trained models, and datasets at https://zacravichandran.github.io/PRISM.</description>

      <title>RoboMemory: A Brain-inspired Multi-memory Agentic Framework for Interactive Environmental Learning in Physical Embodied Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01415v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Embodied agents face persistent challenges in real-world environments, including partial observability, limited spatial reasoning, and high-latency multi-memory integration. We present RoboMemory, a brain-inspired framework that unifies Spatial, Temporal, Episodic, and Semantic memory under a parallelized architecture for efficient long-horizon planning and interactive environmental learning. A dynamic spatial knowledge graph (KG) ensures scalable and consistent memory updates, while a closed-loop planner with a critic module supports adaptive decision-making in dynamic settings. Experiments on EmbodiedBench show that RoboMemory, built on Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Ins, improves average success rates by 25% over its baseline and exceeds the closed-source state-of-the-art (SOTA) Gemini-1.5-Pro by 3%. Real-world trials further confirm its capacity for cumulative learning, with performance improving across repeated tasks. These results highlight RoboMemory as a scalable foundation for memory-augmented embodied intelligence, bridging the gap between cognitive neuroscience and robotic autonomy.</description>

      <title>FlowVLA: Visual Chain of Thought-based Motion Reasoning for Vision-Language-Action Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18269v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are built upon an internal world model trained via next-frame prediction ``$v_t \rightarrow v_{t+1}$''. However, this paradigm attempts to predict the future frame's appearance directly, without explicitly reasoning about the underlying dynamics. \textbf{This lack of an explicit motion reasoning step} often leads to physically implausible visual forecasts and inefficient policy learning. To address this limitation, we introduce the \textbf{Visual Chain of Thought (Visual CoT)}, a paradigm that compels the model to first reason about \textbf{motion dynamics} before generating the future frame. We instantiate this paradigm by proposing \textbf{FlowVLA}, an autoregressive Transformer that explicitly materializes this reasoning process as ``$v_t \rightarrow f_t \rightarrow v_{t+1}$'', where $f_t$ is an intermediate optical flow prediction that inherently encodes motion. By forcing the model to first follow the motion plan encoded by $f_t$, this process inherently \textbf{aligns the pre-training objective of dynamics prediction with the downstream task of action generation.} We conduct experiments on challenging robotics manipulation benchmarks, as well as real-robot evaluations. Our FlowVLA not only generates \textbf{more coherent and physically plausible visual predictions}, but also achieves state-of-the-art policy performance with \textbf{substantially improved sample efficiency}, pointing toward a more principled foundation for world modeling in VLAs.

      <title>TreeIRL: Safe Urban Driving with Tree Search and Inverse Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13579v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present TreeIRL, a novel planner for autonomous driving that combines Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) and inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) to achieve state-of-the-art performance in simulation and in real-world driving. The core idea is to use MCTS to find a promising set of safe candidate trajectories and a deep IRL scoring function to select the most human-like among them. We evaluate TreeIRL against both classical and state-of-the-art planners in large-scale simulations and on 500+ miles of real-world autonomous driving in the Las Vegas metropolitan area. Test scenarios include dense urban traffic, adaptive cruise control, cut-ins, and traffic lights. TreeIRL achieves the best overall performance, striking a balance between safety, progress, comfort, and human-likeness. To our knowledge, our work is the first demonstration of MCTS-based planning on public roads and underscores the importance of evaluating planners across a diverse set of metrics and in real-world environments. TreeIRL is highly extensible and could be further improved with reinforcement learning and imitation learning, providing a framework for exploring different combinations of classical and learning-based approaches to solve the planning bottleneck in autonomous driving.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20297v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: End-to-end learning of robot control policies, structured as neural networks, has emerged as a promising approach to robotic manipulation. To complete many common tasks, relevant objects are required to pass in and out of a robot's field of view. In these settings, spatial memory - the ability to remember the spatial composition of the scene - is an important competency. However, building such mechanisms into robot learning systems remains an open research problem. We introduce mindmap (Spatial Memory in Deep Feature Maps for 3D Action Policies), a 3D diffusion policy that generates robot trajectories based on a semantic 3D reconstruction of the environment. We show in simulation experiments that our approach is effective at solving tasks where state-of-the-art approaches without memory mechanisms struggle. We release our reconstruction system, training code, and evaluation tasks to spur research in this direction.</description>

      <title>CoTaP: Compliant Task Pipeline and Reinforcement Learning of Its Controller with Compliance Modulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25443v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Humanoid whole-body locomotion control is a critical approach for humanoid robots to leverage their inherent advantages. Learning-based control methods derived from retargeted human motion data provide an effective means of addressing this issue. However, because most current human datasets lack measured force data, and learning-based robot control is largely position-based, achieving appropriate compliance during interaction with real environments remains challenging. This paper presents Compliant Task Pipeline (CoTaP): a pipeline that leverages compliance information in the learning-based structure of humanoid robots. A two-stage dual-agent reinforcement learning framework combined with model-based compliance control for humanoid robots is proposed. In the training process, first a base policy with a position-based controller is trained; then in the distillation, the upper-body policy is combined with model-based compliance control, and the lower-body agent is guided by the base policy. In the upper-body control, adjustable task-space compliance can be specified and integrated with other controllers through compliance modulation on the symmetric positive definite (SPD) manifold, ensuring system stability. We validated the feasibility of the proposed strategy in simulation, primarily comparing the responses to external disturbances under different compliance settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05465v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-convex constrained optimizations are ubiquitous in robotic applications such as multi-agent navigation, UAV trajectory optimization, and soft robot simulation. For this problem class, conventional optimizers suffer from small step sizes and slow convergence. We propose BC-ADMM, a variant of Alternating Direction Method of Multiplier (ADMM), that can solve a class of non-convex constrained optimizations with biconvex constraint relaxation. Our algorithm allows larger step sizes by breaking the problem into small-scale sub-problems that can be easily solved in parallel. We show that our method has both theoretical convergence speed guarantees and practical convergence guarantees in the asymptotic sense. Through numerical experiments in a row of four robotic applications, we show that BC-ADMM has faster convergence than conventional gradient descent and Newton's method in terms of wall clock time.</description>

      <title>Equivariant Filter for Relative Attitude and Target's Angular Velocity Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06016v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate estimation of the relative attitude and angular velocity between two rigid bodies is fundamental in aerospace applications such as spacecraft rendezvous and docking. In these scenarios, a chaser vehicle must determine the orientation and angular velocity of a target object using onboard sensors. This work addresses the challenge of designing an Equivariant Filter (EqF) that can reliably estimate both the relative attitude and the target angular velocity using noisy observations of two known, non-collinear vectors fixed in the target frame. To derive the EqF, a symmetry for the system is proposed and an equivariant lift onto the symmetry group is calculated. Observability and convergence properties are analyzed. Simulations demonstrate the filter's performance, with Monte Carlo runs yielding statistically significant results. The impact of low-rate measurements is also examined and a strategy to mitigate this effect is proposed. Experimental results, using fiducial markers and both conventional and event cameras for measurement acquisition, further validate the approach, confirming its effectiveness in a realistic setting.</description>

      <title>Emergent interactions lead to collective frustration in robotic matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22148v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current artificial intelligence systems show near-human-level capabilities when deployed in isolation. Systems of a few collaborating intelligent agents are being engineered to perform tasks collectively. This raises the question of whether robotic matter, where many learning and intelligent agents interact, shows emergence of collective behaviour. And if so, which kind of phenomena would such systems exhibit? Here, we study a paradigmatic model for robotic matter: a stochastic many-particle system in which each particle is endowed with a deep neural network that predicts its transitions based on the particles' environments. For a one-dimensional model, we show that robotic matter exhibits complex emergent phenomena, including transitions between long-lived learning regimes, the emergence of particle species, and frustration. We also find a density-dependent phase transition with signatures of criticality. Using active matter theory, we show that this phase transition is a consequence of self-organisation mediated by emergent inter-particle interactions. Our simple model captures key features of more complex forms of robotic systems.</description>
