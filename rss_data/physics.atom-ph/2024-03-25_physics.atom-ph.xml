      <title>Broad Instantaneous Bandwidth Microwave Spectrum Analyzer with a Microfabricated Atomic Vapor Cell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on broad instantaneous bandwidth microwave spectrum analysis with hot $^{87}\mathrm{Rb}$ atoms in a microfabricated vapor cell in a large magnetic field gradient. The sensor is a MEMS atomic vapor cell filled with isotopically pure $^{87}\mathrm{Rb}$ and $\mathrm{N}_2$ buffer gas to localize the motion of the atoms. The microwave signals of interest are coupled through a coplanar waveguide to the cell, inducing spin flip transitions between optically pumped ground states of the atoms. A static magnetic field with large gradient maps the $\textit{frequency spectrum}$ of the input microwave signals to a position-dependent $\textit{spin-flip pattern}$ on absorption images of the cell recorded with a laser beam onto a camera. In our proof-of-principle experiment, we demonstrate a microwave spectrum analyzer that has $\approx$ 1 GHz instantaneous bandwidth centered at 13.165 GHz, 3 MHz frequency resolution, 2 kHz refresh rate, and a -23 dBm single-tone microwave power detection limit in 1 s measurement time. A theoretical model is constructed to simulate the image signals by considering the processes of optical pumping, microwave interaction, diffusion of $^{87}\mathrm{Rb}$ atoms, and laser absorption. We expect to reach more than 25 GHz instantaneous bandwidth in an optimized setup, limited by the applied magnetic field gradient. Our demonstration offers a practical alternative to conventional microwave spectrum analyzers based on electronic heterodyne detection.</description>

      <title>Open system dynamics from fundamental Lagrangian</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lagrangians can differ by a total derivative without altering the equations of motion, thus encoding the same physics. This is in general true both classically and quantum mechanically. We show, however, that in the context of open quantum systems, two Lagrangians that differ by a total derivative can lead to different physical predictions. We then discuss the criterion that allows one to choose between such Lagrangians. Further, starting from the appropriate QED Lagrangian, we derive the master equation for the non-relativistic electron interacting with thermal photons upto second order in the interactions. This case study lends further phenomenological support to our proposed criterion.</description>

      <title>Atom Number Fluctuations in Bose Gases -- Statistical analysis of parameter estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The investigation of the fluctuations in interacting quantum systems at finite temperatures showcases the ongoing challenges in understanding complex quantum systems. Recently, atom number fluctuations in weakly interacting Bose-Einstein condensates were observed, motivating an investigation of the thermal component of partially condensed Bose gases. Here, we present a combined analysis of both components, revealing the presence of fluctuations in the thermal component. This analysis includes a comprehensive statistical evaluation of uncertainties in the preparation and parameter estimation of partially condensed Bose gases. Using Monte Carlo simulations of optical density profiles, we estimate the noise contributions to the atom number and temperature estimation of the condensed and thermal cloud, which is generally applicable in the field of ultracold atoms. Furthermore, we investigate the specific noise contributions in the analysis of atom number fluctuations and show that preparation noise in the total atom number leads to an important technical noise contribution. Subtracting all known noise contributions from the variance of the atom number in the BEC and thermal component allows us to improve the estimate of the fundamental peak fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Collisional shift and broadening of Rydberg states in nitric oxide at room temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18256v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on the collisional shift and line broadening of Rydberg states in nitric oxide (NO) with increasing density of a background gas at room temperature. As a background gas we either use NO itself or nitrogen (N$_{2}$). The precision spectroscopy is performed by a sub-Doppler three-photon excitation scheme with a subsequent readout of the Rydberg states realized by the amplification of a current generated by free charges due to collisions. The shift shows a dependence on the rotational quantum state of the ionic core and no dependence on the principle quantum number of the orbiting Rydberg electron. The experiment was performed in the context of developing a trace-gas sensor for breath-gas analysis in a medical application.</description>

      <title>Time-dependent theory of reconstruction of attosecond harmonic beating by interference of multi-photon transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04299v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phase and time delays of atomic above-threshold ionization are usually experimentally explored by the reconstruction of attosecond harmonic beating by interference of two-photon transitions (RABBIT) technique. Theoretical studies of RABBIT rely on the perturbative treatment of the probe (NIR or visible) laser pulse with respect to the atomic electric field and the pump composed of a train of attosecond pulses made of several harmonics with frequencies multiple of the probe fundamental frequency. In this work we present a semiclassical non-perturbative description of the phase delays for the emission of electrons from hydrogen atoms based on the strong-field approximation as the relative phase between pump and probe pulses is varied, where more than two photons are involved. Ionization times are calculated within the saddle-point approximations and serve to individualize the different electron wave packets that produce the RABBIT interferometric scheme. We observe different behaviors of the phase delays at different intensities of the probe. For example, for moderate and intense probe fields, the harmonics and sidebands happen to be in phase ($ \gtrsim 4 \times 10^{11}$ W/cm$^2$). In turn, when the probe field is sufficiently weak, we recover the well-known rule of thumb for the phase delays developed within the perturbative RABBIT theory [see D. Guenot et al. Phys. Rev. A 85, 053424 (2012)]. We show that the intracycle interference of the different paths contributing to the final energy (sideband or high harmonic) is responsible for the different behaviors of the interference pattern. Comparisons with the numerical solution of the strong-field approximation and time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation confirm the reliability of our semiclassical non-perturbative theory.</description>

      <title>Additively manufactured ceramics for compact quantum technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10274v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum technologies are advancing from fundamental research in specialized laboratories to practical applications in the field, driving the demand for robust, scalable, and reproducible system integration techniques. Ceramic components can be pivotal thanks to high stiffness, low thermal expansion, and excellent dimensional stability under thermal stress. We explore lithography-based additive manufacturing of technical ceramics especially for miniaturized physics packages and electro-optical systems. This approach enables functional systems with precisely manufactured, intricate structures and high mechanical stability while minimizing size and weight. It facilitates rapid prototyping, simplifies fabrication and leads to highly integrated, reliable devices. As an electrical insulator with low outgassing and high temperature stability, printed technical ceramics such as Al2O3 and AlN bridge a technology gap in quantum technology and offer advantages over other printable materials. We demonstrate this potential with CerAMRef, a micro-integrated rubidium D2 line optical frequency reference on a printed Al2O3 micro-optical bench and housing. The frequency instability of the reference is comparable to laboratory setups while the volume of the integrated spectroscopy setup is only 6 ml. We identify potential for future applications in compact atomic magnetometers, miniaturized optical atom traps, and vacuum system integration.</description>

      <title>Formation of ultracold deeply-bound molecules via multi-state chainwise coincident pulses technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14288v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, a theoretical method for the efficient creation and detection of deeply bound molecules in three-state $\Lambda$-type and five-state M-type molecular systems is proposed. The method is based on the three-state coincident pulses technique and the generalized five-state coincident pulses technique. For the three-state system, the technique can efficiently transfer the populations from the Feshbach state to the deeply-bound state via a train of $N$ pairs of resonant and coincident pump and Stokes pulses, with negligible transient populations of excited states. For the five-state system, it is found that this M-type system can be generalized into a $\Lambda$-type structure with the simplest resonant coupling under the assumption of large one-photon detuning together with a requirement of the relation among the four incident pulses. Thereafter, this generalized model permits us to employ the reduced three-state propagator to design four coincident pulses to achieve the desired population transfer. For the numerical study, $^{87}$Rb$_2$ is considered and, it is shown that the weakly-bound Feshbach molecules can be efficiently transferred to their deeply-bound states without strong laser pulses, and the populations of all intermediate states can be well suppressed.</description>
