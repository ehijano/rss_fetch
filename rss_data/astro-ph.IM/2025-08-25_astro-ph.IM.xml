      <title>New method for subtraction of common background fluctuation for radio camera: Chunked Principal Component Analysis method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new algorithm, ChunkedPCA, to remove common background fluctuations from datasets acquired with a radio camera. ChunkedPCA is an improvement on using PCA to achieve fewer artifacts and better RMS on the cleaned dataset. The proposed algorithm determines the background fluctuation by grouping the detector pixels not used in the direct observation of the source. This group is then used to get the background fluctuation for that time and used to subtract the background from the data of all pixels. We apply ChunkedPCA for the numerical simulation data and a real observation data obtained with the MKID camera on the Nobeyama 45-m telescope to verify the effectiveness of the ChunkedPCA. We confirm that using the ChunkedPCA method preserves the flux of the astronomical sources and produces a cleaner baseline than the conventional PCA method.</description>

      <title>The Einstein Telescope Pathfinder and its Vacuum System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Einstein Telescope (ET) will be the next generation gravitational wave observatory in Europe with a sensitivity reaching beyond the CMB into the dark era of the Universe. Each corner of the triangular baseline design is the center of two interferometers with 10 km long arms, one operated at room temperature, the other one with mirrors at cryogenic temperatures of 10-15 K that reduce the noise contribution at frequencies as low as 3 Hz. The ETpathfinder (ET-PF) project at Maastricht University is a R\&amp;D facility for the challenging cryogenic interferometer technology of ET. It is a 20m x 20m interferometer with six towers that will house the seismically decoupled cryogenic Si-mirrors, laser systems, and detectors. The KIT group developed the control system of the ultra-high vacuum system for ET-PF, based on the expertise from the KATRIN neutrino mass experiment. In addition, a test facility is currently being set up at KIT to investigate adsorption and desorption processes of residual gas on the cryogenic mirror surfaces, as well as monitoring techniques and in-situ cleaning procedures. This paper presents the objectives and status of these activities and their contribution towards the next generation gravitational wave observatory.</description>

      <title>CIGaRS I: Combined simulation-based inference from SNae Ia and host photometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using type Ia supernovae (SNae Ia) as cosmological probes requires empirical corrections, which correlate with their host environment. We present a unified Bayesian hierarchical model designed to infer, from purely photometric observations, the intrinsic dependence of SN Ia brightness on progenitor properties (metallicity &amp; age), the delay-time distribution (DTD) that governs their rate as a function of age, and cosmology, as well as the redshifts of all hosts. The model incorporates physics-based prescriptions for star formation and chemical evolution from Prospector-beta, dust extinction of both galaxy and SN light, and observational selection effects.
  We show with simulations that intrinsic dependences on metallicity and age have distinct observational signatures, with metallicity mimicking the well-known step of SN Ia magnitudes across a host stellar mass of $\approx 10^{10} M_{\odot}$. We then demonstrate neural simulation-based inference of all model parameters from mock observations of ~16 000 SNae Ia and their hosts up to redshift 0.9. Our joint physics-based approach delivers robust and precise photometric redshifts (&lt;0.01 median scatter) and improved cosmological constraints, unlocking the full power of photometric data and paving the way for an end-to-end simulation-based analysis pipeline in the LSST era.</description>

      <title>Simulation-Based Inference for Direction Reconstruction of Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic Rays with Radio Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultra-high-energy cosmic-ray (UHECR) observatories require unbiased direction reconstruction to enable multi-messenger astronomy with sparse, nanosecond-scale radio pulses. Explicit likelihood methods often rely on simplified models, which may bias results and understate uncertainties. We introduce a simulation-based inference pipeline that couples a physics-informed graph neural network (GNN) to a normalizing-flow posterior within the \textit{Learning the Universe Implicit Likelihood Inference} framework. Each event is seeded by an analytic plane-wavefront fit; the GNN refines this estimate by learning spatiotemporal correlations among antenna signals, and its frozen embedding conditions an eight-block autoregressive flow that returns the full Bayesian posterior. Trained on about $8,000$ realistic UHECR air-shower simulations generated with the ZHAireS code, the posteriors are temperature-calibrated to meet empirical coverage targets. We demonstrate a sub-degree median angular resolution on test UHECR events, and find that the nominal 68\% highest-posterior-density contours capture $71\% \pm 2\%$ of true arrival directions, indicating a mildly conservative uncertainty calibration. This approach provides physically interpretable reconstructions, well-calibrated uncertainties, and rapid inference, making it ideally suited for upcoming experiments targeting highly inclined events, such as GRAND, AugerPrime Radio, IceCube-Gen2, RNO-G, and BEACON.</description>

      <title>Neural-Network Chemical Emulator for First-Star Formation: Robust Iterative Predictions over a Wide Density Range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a neural-network emulator for the thermal and chemical evolution in Population~III star formation. The emulator accurately reproduces the thermochemical evolution over a wide density range spanning 21 orders of magnitude (10$^{-3}$-10$^{18}$ cm$^{-3}$), tracking six primordial species: H, H$_2$, e$^{-}$, H$^{+}$, H$^{-}$, and H$_2^{+}$. To handle the broad dynamic range, we partition the density range into five subregions and train separate deep operator networks (DeepONets) in each region. When applied to randomly sampled thermochemical states, the emulator achieves relative errors below 10% in over 90% of cases for both temperature and chemical abundances (except for the rare species H$_2^{+}$). The emulator is roughly ten times faster on a CPU and more than 1000 times faster for batched predictions on a GPU, compared with conventional numerical integration. Furthermore, to ensure robust predictions under many iterations, we introduce a novel timescale-based update method, where a short-timestep update of each variable is computed by rescaling the predicted change over a longer timestep equal to its characteristic variation timescale. In one-zone collapse calculations, the results from the timescale-based method agree well with traditional numerical integration even with many iterations at a timestep as short as 10$^{-4}$ of the free-fall time. This proof-of-concept study suggests the potential for neural network-based chemical emulators to accelerate hydrodynamic simulations of star formation.</description>

      <title>Attenuation Models for Extensive Air Showers Derived from Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: At ultra-high energies, the flux of cosmic rays is too low for direct measurements to be meaningful. When a cosmic ray enters the atmosphere, it initiates an extensive air shower, producing a cascade of secondary particles that propagate toward the ground. Large arrays of surface detectors are used to measure these secondary particles upon arrival.
  The signal detected at a specific reference distance from the shower core serves as a proxy for the shower size and, consequently, as a reliable estimator of the energy of primary cosmic ray. However, shower development is influenced by attenuation effects: measured signals at the ground depend on the amount of traversed atmospheric density (column density) through which the shower evolves. Since the column density varies with the inclination of the shower, it is important to account for these attenuation effects to ensure accurate energy estimation.
  In this study, we derive physics-and-geometry-based functional forms to describe attenuation and propose appropriate expansion terms using simple one-dimensional shower-development models, incorporating one or two main particle-cascade components. We then evaluate the applicability and effectiveness of these functional forms using a Monte-Carlo dataset that includes various primary cosmic-ray particles. By directly calibrating the the shower size derived from ground signals to the Monte-Carlo energy, we characterize attenuation behavior across different primary particles, assess the energy dependence of attenuation, and quantify systematic uncertainties introduced by different functional forms.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Multi-wavelength Imaging of the LMC SN1987A with SRG/eROSITA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14599v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The eROSITA Early Data Release (EDR) and eROSITA All-Sky Survey (eRASS1) data have already revealed a remarkable number of undiscovered X-ray sources. Using Bayesian inference and generative modeling techniques for X-ray imaging, we aim to increase the sensitivity and scientific value of these observations by denoising, deconvolving, and decomposing the X-ray sky. Leveraging information field theory, we can exploit the spatial and spectral correlation structures of the different physical components of the sky with non-parametric priors to enhance the image reconstruction. By incorporating instrumental effects into the forward model, we develop a comprehensive Bayesian imaging algorithm for eROSITA pointing observations. Finally, we apply the developed algorithm to EDR data of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) SN1987A, fusing data sets from observations made by five different telescope modules. The final result is a denoised, deconvolved, and decomposed view of the LMC, which enables the analysis of its fine-scale structures, the identification of point sources in this region, and enhanced calibration for future work.</description>

      <title>Primary Beam Chromaticity in HIRAX: I. Characterization from Simulations and Power Spectrum Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09527v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Hydrogen Intensity and Real-time Analysis eXperiment (HIRAX) is an upcoming radio interferometric telescope designed to constrain dark energy through the 21cm intensity mapping of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO). Instrumental systematics must be controlled and carefully characterized to measure the 21cm power spectrum with fidelity and achieve high-precision constraints on the cosmological parameters. The chromaticity of the primary beam is one such complicated systematic, which can leak the power of spectrally smooth foregrounds beyond the ideal horizon limits due to the complex spatial and spectral structures of the sidelobes and the mainlobe. This paper studies the chromaticity of the HIRAX Stokes I primary beam and its effects on accurate measurements of the 21cm power spectrum. To investigate the effect of chromaticity in the 21cm power spectrum, we present a physically motivated beam modeling technique, which uses a flexible basis derived from traditional optics that can account for higher-order radial and azimuthal structures in the primary beam. We investigate the impact of imperfect knowledge of the mainlobe and sidelobes chromaticity in the power spectrum space by subtracting a simple foreground model in simulated snapshot visibilities to recover the H$\textsc{i}$ power spectrum. Additionally, we find that modeling up to the octupolar azimuthal order feature (fourth-order angular variation) in the primary beam is sufficient to reduce the leakage outside the wedge with minimal bias.</description>

      <title>PINCH: Pipeline-Informed Noise Characterization in LIGO's Third Observing Run</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14949v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a method to identify and categorize gravitational wave candidate triggers identified by matched filtering gravitational wave searches (pipelines) caused by transient noise (glitches) in gravitational wave detectors using Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers. Our approach involves training SVM models on pipeline triggers which occur outside periods of excess noise to distinguish between triggers caused by random noise and those induced by glitches. This method is applied independently to the triggers produced by the GstLAL search pipeline on data from the LIGO Hanford and Livingston observatories during the second half of the O3 observing run. The trained SVM models assign scores to ambiguous triggers, quantifying their similarity to triggers caused by random fluctuations, with triggers with scores above a defined threshold being classified as glitch-induced. Analysis of these triggers reveals the distinct impact of different glitch classes on the search pipeline, including their distribution in relevant parameter spaces. We use metrics such as the Bhattacharyya coefficient and an over-representation ratio to quantify the consistency and prevalence of glitch impacts over time and across parameter spaces. Our findings indicate that some glitch types consistently produce triggers in specific regions of the parameter space, while others generate triggers that are more widely distributed. We observe that Scattered Light glitches appear differently in the search pipeline before and after a commissioning change, demonstrating how such detector changes appear in the pipeline's response to certain glitch classes. This method provides a framework for understanding and mitigating the influence of non-Gaussian transients on gravitational wave search pipelines, with implications for improving detection sensitivity and better understanding noise populations.</description>

      <title>MaxWave: Rapid Maximum Likelihood Wavelet Reconstruction of Non-Gaussian features in Gravitational Wave Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13377v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Advancements in the sensitivity of gravitational wave detectors have increased the detection rate of transient astrophysical signals. We improve the existing BayesWave initialization algorithm and present a rapid, low-latency approximate maximum likelihood solution for reconstructing non-Gaussian features. We include three enhancements: (1) using a modified wavelet basis to eliminate redundant inner product calculations; (2) shifting from traditional time-frequency-quality factor (TFQ) wavelet transforms to time-frequency-time extent (TF$\tau$) transforms to optimize wavelet subtractions; and (3) implementing a downsampled heterodyned wavelet transform to accelerate initial calculations. Our model can be used to denoise long-duration signals, which include the stochastic gravitational-wave background from numerous unresolved sources and continuous wave signals from isolated sources such as rotating neutron stars. Through our model, we can also aid machine learning applications that aim to classify and understand glitches by providing non-whitened, time and frequency domain, Gaussian-noise-free reconstructions of any glitch.</description>
