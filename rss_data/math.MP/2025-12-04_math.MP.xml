      <title>Three-dimensional third medium contact model for hyperelastic contact and pneumatically actuated systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a comprehensive three-dimensional third-medium contact framework for modeling complex contact interactions in hyperelastic solids and pneumatically actuated systems. The proposed third-medium formulation embeds a fictitious medium (or third medium) between potentially interacting bodies, enabling a unified and robust treatment of hyperelastic contact and self-contact without the need for discretization of the contact interface. Unlike the widely studied two-dimensional problem, this paper extends the new regularization term given in Reference \cite{TMCWriggers2} to three-dimensional problems and ensures element quality in a third medium. Due to the need for higher-order elements for the regularization term, this paper details the linearization process of this problem within the finite element framework. In addition, pneumatically actuated systems are considered by introducing a pneumatic term to represent pneumatic loading (pressure or suction) and inducing contact caused by internal inflation. This approach is suitable for complex hyperelastic contact and self-contact, and has potential applications in the fields of soft robotics and flexible mechanisms. The framework is developed in a fully three-dimensional setting, making it also suitable for isogeometric methods and meshless methods. Several benchmark and application-level simulations demonstrate the accuracy, robustness, and versatility of the proposed approach. The results highlight the capability of the three-dimensional third-medium model to handle challenging nonlinear contact scenarios relevant to soft materials, soft actuators, and emerging multifunctional structures.</description>

      <title>A discontinuous Galerkin approach for simulating graphene-based electron devices via the Boltzmann transport equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron devices based on graphene have lately received a considerable interest; in fact, they could represent the ultimate miniaturization, since the active area is only one atom tick. However, the gapless dispersion relation of graphene at the Dirac points limits the possibility of using pristine graphene instead of traditional semiconductors in Field Effect Transistors (FET). For such a reason very accurate simulations are needed.
  In Nastasi &amp; Romano, IEEE TED (2021) a graphene field effect transistor (GFET) has been proposed and simulated adopting a drift-diffusion model. Here, electron devices whose active area is made of monolayer graphene are simulated adopting as mathematical model the semiclassical Boltzmann transport equations (BTEs) in the bipolar case, coupled with the Poisson equation for the electric field. The system is solved by means of a discontinuous Galerkin (DG) approach (see Cockburn &amp; Shu, J. Comp. Phys. (1998); Hesthaven &amp; Warburton, 2008) with linear elements in the spatial coordinate and constant approximation for the wave-vector space, discretized with a polar mesh. The correct physical range for the distribution function is preserved with the maximum-principle-satisfying scheme introduced in Zhang &amp; Shu, J. Comp. Phys. (2010).
  The adopted method reveals very robust and possesses a good degree of accuracy, making it particularly well suited for capturing the complex charge transport dynamics inherent to graphene-based devices. The results for suspended monolayer graphene and GFET constitute benchmark solutions for a rigorous assessment of the validity of macroscopic models, such as drift-diffusion and hydrodynamic ones.</description>

      <title>Solutions to Open WDVV Equations for the Universal Whitham Hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct a pair of solutions to the open WDVV equations associated with the infinite-dimensional Frobenius manifolds that underlie the genus-zero universal Whitham hierarchy, and for the resulting flat F-manifolds, we explicitly construct their principal hierarchies. We further demonstrate that this construction is compatible with finite-dimensional reductions, yielding solutions for Frobenius manifolds associated with general rational superpotentials and those subject to a $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$-symmetry reduction. In particular, the polynomial solutions derived by Basalaev and Buryak via open Saito theory for A- and D-type singularities are recovered as special cases.</description>

      <title>The magnetic inverse problem for two stacked layers of sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present calculations that reconstruct electronic current densities in two stacked layers at known depths, using magnetic field data. Solving this inverse problem requires knowledge of the magnetic field in two planes -- one above both current layers, one below -- corresponding to non-invasive measurements of the field. We corroborate the accuracy of current density reconstruction from the resulting system of equations using a numerical simulation. This method is anticipated to be applicable to non-destructive current imaging for quality assurance in a range of applications featuring two-layer geometries, including printed circuit boards, capacitors, fuel cells, and battery cells; we focus particularly here on battery cells, due to their rapidly increasing relevance for automotive applications. This method also offers a framework for generalising the model to more than two layers in future work.</description>

      <title>Optical Caustics as Lagrangian Singularities: Classification and Geometric Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a rigorous mathematical framework for light propagation by constructing the optical phase space with its symplectic structure and the extended phase space with its contact structure. We prove that light rays in three-dimensional Euclidean space correspond to Reeb orbits in a five-dimensional contact manifold, which are then projected onto a four-dimensional symplectic manifold via symplectic reduction. Leveraging the advantages of phase space, we provide a rigorous definition of caustic surfaces as singularities of the Lagrangian submanifold projection and derive explicit expressions for caustic surfaces in convex lens systems. Furthermore, based on singularity theory, we present a complete classification of stable caustic surfaces and establish a correspondence with classical Seidel aberration theory. Building upon this theory, we propose a method of \emph{topological optical correction} that overcomes the limitations of traditional optimization algorithms in dealing with complex caustic structures. This work provides a new mathematical paradigm for the design and correction of high-precision optical systems.</description>

      <title>Instantaneous Sobolev Regularization for Dissipative Bosonic Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate quantum Markov semigroups on bosonic Fock space and identify a broad class of infinite-dimensional dissipative evolutions that exhibit instantaneous Sobolev-regularization. Motivated by stability problems in quantum computation, we show that for certain Lindblad operators that are polynomials of creation and annihilation operators, the resulting dynamics immediately transform any initial state into one with finite expectation in all powers of the number operator. A key application is in the bosonic cat code, where we obtain explicit estimates in the trace norm for the speed of convergence. These estimates sharpen existing perturbative bounds at both short and long times, offering new analytic tools for assessing stability and error suppression in bosonic quantum information processing. For example, we improve the strong exponential convergence of the (shifted) $2$-photon dissipation to its fixed point to the uniform topology.</description>

      <title>Topological Einstein gravity as Kodaira-Spencer gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As a contribution towards quantizing three-dimensional gravity, we show at the classical level that Euclidean three-dimensional Einstein gravity with a negative cosmological constant is uplifted to the $SU(2)$-invariant sector of Kodaira-Spencer gravity on a Calabi-Yau three-fold. Kodaira-Spencer gravity appears in the target space description of the B-model topological string theory and describes deformations of a complex structure. We prove that given a reference solution of Einstein gravity in the first-order formulation, a second off-shell configuration uplifts to a unique complex structure deformation in six dimensions. If the configuration satisfies Einstein's equations, the complex structure deformation is integrable, i.e. a solution of Kodaira-Spencer gravity. We demonstrate the uplift explicitly for Ba\~nados solutions. Our construction embeds three-dimensional gravity into topological string theory and AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$ duality into twisted holography.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove formally that the momentum-mixing Hatsugai-Kohmoto model (MMHK) is the Hubbard model with a twist. With this result in tow, we rely on the proof of Watanabe's that two models which differ by a twist must have the same bulk physics. Consequently, we have proven that MMHK=Hubbard in the charge sector.</description>

      <title>On the Virasoro Crossing Kernels at Rational Central Charge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report novel analytic results for the Virasoro modular and fusion kernels relevant to 2d conformal field theories (CFTs), 3d topological field theories (TQFTs), and the representation theory of certain quantum groups. For all rational values of the parameter $b^2\in\mathbb{Q}^{\times}$ -- corresponding in 2d CFT to all rational central charge values in the domain $(-\infty,1]\cup[25,\infty)$ -- we establish two main results. First, in the domain $c\in\mathbb{Q}_{[25,\infty)}$ we show that the modular and fusion kernels derived by Teschner and Teschner-Vartanov respectively can be expressed as a linear combination of two functions, which (i) are themselves admissible crossing kernels, (ii) have square-root branch point singularities in the Liouville momenta, (iii) are not reflection-symmetric in the Liouville momenta. These features illustrate that the space of solutions to the basic shift relations determining these kernels is broader than previously assumed. Second, in the domain $c\in\mathbb{Q}_{(-\infty,1]}$ we derive for the first time the physical modular and fusion kernels for generic values of the Liouville momenta. These can again be written as a linear combination of two other admissible kernels but overall, and unlike the Teschner and Teschner-Vartanov solutions for $c\geq 25$, they possess square-root branch point singularities. As a corollary, we demonstrate that timelike Liouville theory at $c\in\mathbb{Q}_{(-\infty,1]}$ is crossing symmetric and modular covariant. Surprisingly, the crossing kernels at any $b^2\in\mathbb{Q}^{\times}$ behave as if they were semiclassical and one-loop exact, and we discuss the interpretation of this fact in the context of the 2d conformal bootstrap and the 3d TQFT that captures pure 3d gravity with negative cosmological constant.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear diffusion limit of non-local interactions on a sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study an aggregation PDE with competing attractive and repulsive forces on a sphere of arbitrary dimension. In particular, we consider the limit of strongly localized repulsion with a constant attraction term. We prove convergence of solutions of such a system to solutions of the aggregation-diffusion equation with a porous-medium-type diffusion term. The proof combines variational techniques with elements of harmonic analysis on a sphere. In particular, we characterize the square root of the convolution operator in terms of the spherical harmonics, which allows us to overcome difficulties arising due to the convolution on a sphere being non-commutative. The study is motivated by the toy model of transformers introduced by Geshkovski et al. (2025); and we discuss the applicability of the results to this model.</description>

Abstract: Equations governing the flow of a polar fluid, with pressure-dependent Newtonian viscosity, through a variable-porosity medium are developed. Averaged equations are obtained using intrinsic volume averaging. A drag function is introduced to account for the interactions of the fluid with the porous matrix. Darcy and Forchheimer generalized terms are included in the model equations for both granular and consolidated media to account for the effects of the porous microstructure.</description>

      <title>Computing Equilibrium Points of Electrostatic Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the computation of equilibrium points of electrostatic potentials: locations in space where the electrostatic force arising from a collection of charged particles vanishes. This is a novel scenario of optimization in which solutions are guaranteed to exist due to a nonconstructive argument, but gradient descent is unreliable due to the presence of singularities.
  We present an algorithm based on piecewise approximation of the potential function by Taylor series. The main insight is to divide the domain into a grid with variable coarseness, where grid cells are exponentially smaller in regions where the function changes rapidly compared to regions where it changes slowly. Our algorithm finds approximate equilibrium points in time poly-logarithmic in the approximation parameter, but these points are not guaranteed to be close to exact solutions. Nevertheless, we show that such points can be computed efficiently under a mild assumption that we call "strong non-degeneracy". We complement these algorithmic results by studying a generalization of this problem and showing that it is CLS-hard and in PPAD, leaving its precise classification as an intriguing open problem.</description>

      <title>Curvature Potential Formulation for Thin Elastic Sheets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thin elastic sheets appear in systems ranging from graphene to biological membranes, where phenomena such as wrinkling, folding, and thermal fluctuations originate from geometric nonlinearities. These effects are treated within weakly nonlinear theories, such as the Foppl-von Karman equations, which require small slopes and fail when deflections become large even if strains remain small. We introduce a methodological progress via a geometric reformulation of thin-sheet elasticity based on a stress potential and a curvature potential. This formulation preserves the structure of the classical equations while extending their validity to nonlinear, multivalued configurations, and geometrically frustrated states. The framework provides a unified description of thin-sheet mechanics in regimes inaccessible to existing theories and opens new possibilities for the study of elastic membranes and two-dimensional materials.</description>

      <title>Retrofitting Earth System Models with Cadence-Limited Neural Operator Updates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coarse resolution, imperfect parameterizations, and uncertain initial states and forcings limit Earth-system model (ESM) predictions. Traditional bias correction via data assimilation improves constrained simulations but offers limited benefit once models run freely. We introduce an operator-learning framework that maps instantaneous model states to bias-correction tendencies and applies them online during integration. Building on a U-Net backbone, we develop two operator architectures Inception U-Net (IUNet) and a multi-scale network (M\&amp;M) that combine diverse upsampling and receptive fields to capture multiscale nonlinear features under Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) runtime constraints. Trained on two years E3SM simulations nudged toward ERA5 reanalysis, the operators generalize across height levels and seasons. Both architectures outperform standard U-Net baselines in offline tests, indicating that functional richness rather than parameter count drives performance. In online hybrid E3SM runs, M\&amp;M delivers the most consistent bias reductions across variables and vertical levels. The ML-augmented configurations remain stable and computationally feasible in multi-year simulations, providing a practical pathway for scalable hybrid modeling. Our framework emphasizes long-term stability, portability, and cadence-limited updates, demonstrating the utility of expressive ML operators for learning structured, cross-scale relationships and retrofitting legacy ESMs.</description>

      <title>On Bridging Analyticity and Sparseness in Hyperdissipative Navier-Stokes Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the three-dimensional hyper-dissipative Navier-Stokes system in the near-critical regime below the Lions threshold. Leveraging a quantified analyticity-sparseness gap, we introduce a time-weighted bridge inequality across derivative levels and a focused-extremizer hypothesis capturing peak concentration at a fixed point. Together with a harmonic-measure contraction on one-dimensional sparse sets, these mechanisms enforce quantitative decay of high-derivative $L^{\infty}-$norms and rule out blow-up. Under scale-refined, slowly varying time weights, solutions extend analytically past the prospective singular time, thereby refining the analyticity-sparseness framework, complementing recent exclusions of rapid-rate blow-up scenarios, and remaining consistent with recent non-uniqueness results.</description>

      <title>A Linear Structure from Magnetic-Dipole Systems and Its Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a class of algebras on $\mathbb{R}^3$ arising and generalized from the algebraic structure of magnetic gradient fields induced by systems of synchronous magnets with identical dipole moments (i.e., $\mathbf{M}_i=\mathbf{M},\,\forall i$). We show that when there is a $2$ dimensional sub-algebra, the linear structure associated to such an algebra admits a certain type of decompositions, which allows the locating of the dipole moment $\bar{\mathbf{M}}$ that yields the strongest translational force(s) on a test magnet $\mathfrak{m}$. Upper bounds to the strength of this magnetic force are then established.</description>

      <title>The Dirichlet-to-Neumann map on asymptotically anti-de Sitter spaces and holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the Klein-Gordon equation on asymptotically anti-de Sitter spacetimes, and show that the forward Dirichlet-to-Neumann map (or scattering matrix) is a fractional power of the boundary wave operator modulo lower order terms in the sense of paired Lagrangian distributions. We use it to show that, outside of a countable set of mass parameters, the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map determines the Taylor series of the bulk metric at the boundary, and hence allows the recovery of a real analytic metric or Einstein metric modulo isometries. Furthermore, we prove a Lorentzian version of the Graham-Zworski theorem relating poles of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map to conformally invariant powers of the boundary wave operator.</description>

Abstract: We present an approximation theorem for continuous non-decreasing functions on compact preordered spaces, leading to an algebraic characterization of their corresponding function spaces. As an application, we prove that the family of positive non-decreasing rational functions with non-negative coefficients can uniformly approximate all continuous non-decreasing functions on compact intervals.

      <description>arXiv:2512.03645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The reduction of dynamical systems which are invariant under changes of global scale is well-understood, for classical theories of particles, and fields. The excision of the superfluous degree of freedom describing such a scale leads to a dynamically-equivalent theory, which is frictional in nature. In this article, we extend the formalism to physical models, of both particles and fields, described by singular Lagrangians. Our treatment of classical field theory is based on the manifestly covariant Hamilton De-Donder Weyl formalism, in which the Lagrangian density is introduced as a bundle morphism on the pre-multisymplectic velocity phase space $J^1E$. The results obtained are subsequently applied to a number of physically-motivated examples, as well as a discussion presented on the implications of our work for classical General Relativity.</description>

      <title>Linking Aneurysmal Geometry and Hemodynamics Using Computational Fluid Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development and progression of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) are related to complex flow patterns and wall-shear-driven mechanobiological stimuli, yet the quantitative relationship between aneurysmal geometry and hemodynamics remains poorly defined. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive hemodynamic analysis of 74 patient-specific abdominal aortas, representing one of the largest Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) cohorts reported to date. A multiscale framework coupling 0D-1D systemic circulation models with 3D stabilized finite-element simulations is used to generate physiologically consistent boundary conditions and high-fidelity flow fields. From each model, we extract Time Averaged Wall Shear Stress (TAWSS), Oscillatory Shear Index (OSI), Relative Residence Time (RRT) and Local Normalized Helicity (LNH) indicators alongside an extended set of geometric descriptors characterizing diameter, curvature and torsion. This study provides a clear and comprehensive view of how aneurysm shape influences blood-flow behavior, supported by one of the largest systematically analyzed CFD datasets of AAAs to date. Our results show that specific geometric features reliably shape shear-stress patterns, suggesting that these geometry-driven flow signatures could serve as valuable biomarkers for patient-specific risk assessment. Together, these insights highlight the potential of incorporating detailed geometric descriptors into future models that aim to predict AAA growth and rupture.</description>

Abstract: Under general assumptions, the numbers of semiclassical resonances is known to be bounded from above by a negative power of $h$ which is given by the fractal dimension of the trapped set.

      <title>Solution of the Electric Field Integral Equation Using a Hybrid Quantum-Classical Scheme: Investigation of Accuracy and Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conventional classical solvers are commonly used for solving matrix equation systems resulting from the discretization of SIEs in computational electromagnetics (CEM). However, the memory requirement would become a bottleneck for classical computing as the electromagentic problems become much larger. As an alternative, quantum computing has a natural "parallelization" advantage with much lower storage complexity due to the superposition and entanglement in quantum mechanics. Even though several quantum algorithms have been applied for the SIEs-based methods in the literature, the size of the matrix equation systems solvable using them is still limited. In this work, we use a hybrid quantum-classical scheme to solve the EFIE for analyzing electromagentic scattering from three-dimensional (3D) perfect electrically conducting objects with arbitrary shapes in CEM for the first time. Instead of directly solving the original EFIE matrix equation system using the quantum algorithms, the hybrid scheme first designs the preconditioned linear system and then uses a double-layer iterative strategy for its solution, where the external iteration layer builds subspace matrix equation systems with smaller dimension and the internal iteration layer solves the smaller systems using the quantum algorithms. Two representative quantum algorithms, HHL and VQLS, are considered in this work, which are executed on the quantum simulator and quantum computer platforms. We present the theoretical time complexity analysis of the hybrid quantum-classical scheme and perform numerical experiments to investigate the accuracy and efficiency of the hybrid scheme. The results show that the computational complexity of the hybrid VQLS-classical scheme is lower than the conventional fast solvers in classical computing, which indicates the hybrid scheme is more promising for analyzing large-scale electromagnetic problems.</description>

Abstract: We consider stratified steady water waves in a two dimensional channel. Our main subject is spectral properties of the Frechet derivatives of steady water Stokes waves. One of main results is the absence of subharmonic water waves in a neighborhood of a Stokes wave. The main assumption is formulated in terms of the eigenvalues of the Frechet derivative evaluated at this wave and considered in the class of periodic solutions of the same period. The first eigenvalue is always negative. We show that if the second eigenvalue is positive then there are no waves with multiple periods in a neighborhood of the Stokes wave.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study infinitesimal deformations of Lie algebroid pairs in the category of smooth manifolds enriched with a local Artinian algebra. Given a Lie algebroid pair $(L,A)$, i.e. a Lie algebroid $L$ together with a Lie subalgebroid $A$, we investigate isomorphism classes of infinitesimal deformations of $(L,A)$ modulo automorphisms from exponentials of derivations of $L$ and those from the exponentials of inner derivations of $L$, respectively. For the associated two deformation functors, we find the associated governing $L_\infty$-algebras in the sense of extended deformation theory. Furthermore, when $(L,A)$ is a matched Lie pair, i.e. the quotient $L/A$ is also a Lie subalgebroid of $L$, we investigate isomorphism classes of infinitesimal deformations modulo automorphisms from exponentials of derivations along the normal direction $L/A$. The extended deformation theory of the associated deformation functor recovers the formal deformation theory of complex structures and that of transversely holomorphic foliations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trail interactions occur when past particle trajectories bias future motion, rendering the system out of thermodynamic equilibrium. While such systems are abundant in nature, their understanding is limited to the single-particle level or phenomenological mean-field theories. Here, we introduce a minimal model of many trail-interacting particles that extends this paradigm to the fluctuating collective level. Particles diffuse while depositing long-lasting repelling/attracting trails that act as a shared memory field, coupling their dynamics across time and space. Using stochastic density functional theory, we derive fluctuating hydrodynamic equations and analyze analytically and numerically the resulting behaviors. We show that memory, coupled with fluctuations, fundamentally reshapes collective dynamics; In the repulsive case, the particle density displays superdiffusive spreading characterized by transient clustering and ballistic motion; In the attractive case, the system condensates in finite time into frozen, localized states. Our results establish general principles for trail-interacting systems and reveal how persistent fields generate novel instabilities and self-organization.</description>

      <title>Distances between pure quantum states induced by a distance matrix</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14727v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the help of a given distance matrix of size $n$, we construct an infinite family of distances $d_p$ (where $p \geq 2$) on the complex projective space $\mathbb{P}(\mathbb{C}^n)$ modelling the space of pure states of an $n$-level quantum system. The construction can be seen as providing a natural way to isometrically embed any given finite metric space into the space of pure quantum states 'spanned' upon it. In order to show that the maps $d_p$ are indeed distance functions -- in particular, that they satisfy the triangle inequality -- we employ methods of analysis, multilinear algebra and convex geometry, obtaining a nontrivial auxiliary convexity result in the process. The paper significantly extends earlier work, resolving an important question about the geometry of quantum state space imposed by the quantum Wasserstein distances and solidifying the foundation for applications of distances $d_p$ in quantum information science.</description>

      <title>Moderate deviations in first-passage percolation for bounded weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12797v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the moderate and large deviations in first-passage percolation (FPP) with bounded weights on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ for $d \geq 2$. Write $T(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y})$ for the first-passage time and denote by $\mu(\mathbf{u})$ the time constant in direction $\mathbf{u}$. In this paper, we establish that, if one assumes that the sublinear error term $T(\mathbf{0}, N\mathbf{u}) - N\mu(\mathbf{u})$ is of order $N^\chi$, then under some unverified (but widely believed) assumptions, for $\chi &lt; a &lt; 1$, \begin{align*}
  &amp;\mathbb{P}\bigl(T(\mathbf{0}, N\mathbf{u}) &gt; N\mu(\mathbf{u}) + N^a\bigr) = \exp{\Big(-\,N^{\frac{d(1+o(1))}{1-\chi}(a-\chi)}\Big)},\end{align*} \begin{align*}
  &amp;\mathbb{P}\bigl(T(\mathbf{0}, N\mathbf{u}) &lt; N\mu(\mathbf{u}) - N^a\bigr) = \exp{\Big(-\,N^{\frac{1+o(1)}{1-\chi}(a-\chi)}\Big)}, \end{align*} with accompanying estimates in the borderline case $a=1$. Moreover, the exponents $\frac{d}{1-\chi}$ and $\frac{1}{1-\chi}$ also appear in the asymptotic behavior near $0$ of the rate functions for upper and lower tail large deviations. Notably, some of our estimates are established rigorously without relying on any unverified assumptions. Our main results highlight the interplay between fluctuations and the decay rates of large deviations, and bridge the gap between these two regimes.
  A key ingredient of our proof is an improved concentration via multi-scale analysis for several moderate deviation estimates, a phenomenon that has previously appeared in the contexts of two-dimensional last-passage percolation and two-dimensional rotationally invariant FPP.</description>

      <title>Ballistic particle transport and Drude weight in gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00686</link>

Abstract: Owing to the fact that the particle current operator in non-relativistic gases is proportional to the total momentum operator, the particle transport in such systems is always ballistic and fully characterized by a Drude weight $\Delta$. The Drude weight can be calculated within linear response theory. It is given by the formula $\Delta = 2 \pi D$, where $D$ is the density of the gas. This holds in any dimension and for every equilibrium ensemble, in particular for generalized Gibbs ensembles that describe possible equilibrium states of isolated integrable quantum systems. In the canonical ensemble case, the Drude weight can be equivalently obtained from a generalized susceptibility related to the fluctuations of the conserved particle current. Such susceptibility can be rigorously calculated for the integrable Lieb-Liniger Bose gas in any generalized Gibbs ensemble using a generalized Yang-Yang thermodynamic formalism. The resulting expression agrees with a prediction made within the context of generalized hydrodynamics. It also allows us to see explicitly that, within truly generalized Gibbs ensembles, the conductivity related with the particle current is not determined by the corresponding current-current auto-correlation function.</description>

      <title>Homomorphism, substructure and ideal: Elementary but rigorous aspects of renormalization group or hierarchical structure of topological orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23155v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a general quantum Hamiltonian formalism of a renormalization group (RG) flow with an emphasis on generalized symmetry by interpreting the elementary relationship between homomorphism, quotient ring, and projection. In our formalism, the noninvertible nature of the ideal of a fusion ring realizing the generalized symmetry of an ultraviolet (UV) theory plays a fundamental role in determining condensation rules between anyons, resulting in the infrared (IR) theories. Our algebraic method applies to the domain wall problem in $2+1$ dimensional topologically ordered systems and the corresponding classification of $1+1$ dimensional gapped phase, for example. An ideal decomposition of a fusion ring provides a straightforward but strong constraint on the gapped phase with noninvertible symmetry and its symmetry-breaking (or emergent symmetry) patterns. Moreover, even in several specific homomorphisms connected under massless RG flows, less familiar homomorphisms appear, and we conjecture that they correspond to partially solvable models in recent literature. Our work demonstrates the fundamental significance of the abstract algebraic structure, ideal, for the RG in physics.</description>

      <title>On dissipation operators of Quantum Optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00856v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider dissipation operators used in Quantum Optics for the description of quantum spontaneous emission in the context of damped driven Jaynes-Cummings equations. The equations describe quantised one-mode Maxwell field coupled to a two-level molecule. Our main result is the symmetry and nonpositivity of basic dissipation operator of Quantum Optics.</description>

      <title>Do quantum linear solvers offer advantage for networks-based system of linear equations?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00913v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this exploratory numerical study, we assess the suitability of Quantum Linear Solvers (QLSs) toward providing a quantum advantage for Networks-based Linear System Problems (NLSPs). NLSPs naturally arise from graphs, and are of importance as they are connected to real-world applications. The achievable advantage with a QLS for an NLSP depends on the interplay between the scaling of condition number and sparsity of matrices associated with the graph family considered, as well as system size growth. We analyze 50 graph families and identify that within the scope of our study, only 4% of them exhibit prospects for an exponential advantage with the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) algorithm relative to an efficient classical solver (best graphs), while about 20% of them show a polynomial advantage (better graphs). Furthermore, we report that some graph families graduate from offering no advantage with HHL to promising a polynomial advantage with improved algorithms such as the Childs-Kothari-Somma algorithm, while some other graph families exhibit futile exponential advantage. We introduce a unified graph superfamily and show the existence of infinite best and better graphs in it. We also conjecture the conditions under which one may visually examine a graph family and guess the prospects for an advantage. Finally, we very briefly touch upon some practical issues that may arise even if the aforementioned graph theoretic requirements are satisfied, including quantum hardware challenges.</description>

      <title>Non-local Dirichlet forms, Gibbs measures, and a Hodge theorem for Cantor sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22742v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper I study properties of the generators $\triangle_\gamma$ of non-local Dirichlet forms $\mathcal{E}^\mu_\gamma$ on ultrametric spaces which are the path space of simple stationary Bratteli diagrams. The measures used to define the Dirichlet forms are taken to be the Gibbs measures $\mu_\psi$ associated to H\"older continuous potentials $\psi$ for one-sided shifts. I also define a cohomology $H_{lc}(X_B)$ for $X_B$ which can be seen as dual to the homology of Bowen and Franks. Besides studying spectral properties of $\triangle_\gamma$, I show that for $\gamma$ large enough (with sharp bounds depending on the diagram and the measure theoretic entropy $h_{\mu_\psi}$ of $\mu_\psi$) there is a unique harmonic representative of any class $c\in H_{lc}(X_B)$.</description>
