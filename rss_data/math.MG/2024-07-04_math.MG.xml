      <title>A generalization of a Theorem of A. Rogers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalizing a Theorem due to A. Rogers \cite{ro1}, we are going to prove that if for a pair of convex bodies $K_{1},K_{2}\subset \Rn$, $n\geq 3$, there exists a hyperplane $H$ and a pair of different points $p_1$ and $p_2$ in $\Rn \backslash H$ such that for each $(n-2)$-plane $M\subset H$, there exists a \textit{mirror} which maps the hypersection of $K_1$ defined by $\aff\{ p_1,M\}$ onto the hypersection of $K_2$ defined by $\aff\{ p_2,M\}$, then there exists a \textit{mirror} which maps $K_1$ onto $K_2$.</description>

      <title>The Convex Peano Curve Does Exist</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We refer here to the surprising construction made by Giuseppe Peano in 1890. He gave an example of a continuous function (called now the Peano curve) from the unit interval to the whole unit square. We show here the existence of a more general space-filling curve with additional convexity properties. More precisely: by T ? R2 we denote a convex closed and bounded set and we show that there exists a continuous surjection f : [0; 1] 7! T for which the image of any interval is a convex set.</description>

      <title>An isometric extensor of metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, for metrizable space $Z$, we consider the space of metrics that generate the same topology on $Z$, and that space of metrics is equipped with the supremum metrics. For a metrizable space $X$ and a closed subset $A$ of it, we construct a map $E$ from the space of metrics on $A$ into the space of metrics on $X$ such that $E$ is an extension of metrics and preserves the supremum metrics between metrics.</description>

      <title>Embedding-Projection Correspondences for the estimation of the Gromov-Hausdorff distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This writeup describes ongoing work on designing and testing a certain family of correspondences between compact metric spaces that we call \emph{embedding-projection correspondences} (EPCs). Of particular interest are EPCs between spheres of different dimension.</description>

      <title>Youden's Demon is Sylvester's Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: If four people with Gaussian-distributed heights stand at Gaussian positions on the plane, the probability that there are exactly two people whose height is above the average of the four is exactly the same as the probability that they stand in convex position; both probabilities are $\frac 6 \pi \arcsin\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)\approx .649$. We show that this is a special case of a more general phenomenon: The problem of determining the position of the mean among the order statistics of Gaussian random points on the real line ("Youden's demon problem") is the same as a natural generalization of Sylvester's Four Point problem to Gaussian points in $\mathbb{R}^d$. Our main tool is the observation that the Gale dual of independent samples in $\mathbb{R}^d$ itself can be taken to be a set of independent points (conditioned on barycenter at the origin) when the distribution of the points is Gaussian.</description>

      <title>Product Geometries on Cholesky Manifolds with Applications to SPD Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents two new metrics on the Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) manifold via the Cholesky manifold, i.e., the space of lower triangular matrices with positive diagonal elements. We first unveil that the existing popular Riemannian metric on the Cholesky manifold can be generally characterized as the product metric of a Euclidean metric and a Riemannian metric on the space of n-dimensional positive vectors. Based on this analysis, we propose two novel metrics on the Cholesky manifolds, i.e., Diagonal Power Euclidean Metric and Diagonal Generalized Bures-Wasserstein Metric, which are numerically stabler than the existing Cholesky metric. We also discuss the gyro structures and deformed metrics associated with our metrics. The gyro structures connect the linear and geometric properties, while the deformed metrics interpolate between our proposed metrics and the existing metric. Further, by Cholesky decomposition, the proposed deformed metrics and gyro structures are pulled back to SPD manifolds. Compared with existing Riemannian metrics on SPD manifolds, our metrics are easy to use, computationally efficient, and numerically stable.</description>

      <title>The Lamplighter groups and Thompson's group $F$ have infinite weak-cop number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11996v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The weak-cop number of a graph, introduced by Lee et al (2023), is a quasi-isometric invariant of graphs and hence of finitely generated groups via their Cayley graphs. While for any $m\in\mathbb{Z}_+\cup\{\infty\}$ there exist graphs with weak-cop number $m$, it is an open question whether there exists finitely generated groups whose weak-cop number is different than $1$ and $\infty$. We prove that wreath products of nontrivial groups by infinite groups have infinite weak-cop number. We also prove that Thompson's group $F$ has infinite weak-cop number. The results are proved by defining two new pursuit and evasion games and proving the existence of strategies for the evader. In the case of Thompson's group $F$, we also present an alternative and more algebraic argument proving that it has infinite weak-cop number.</description>
