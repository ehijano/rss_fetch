      <title>On the logical structure of physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the main claims of the paper is that Dirac's calculus and broader theories of physics can be treated as theories written in the language of Continuous Logic. Establishing its true interpretation (model) is a model theory problem. The paper introduces such a model for the fragment which covers ``free theories'', that is physical theories with Gaussian (quadratic) potential. The model is pseudo-finite (equivalently, a limit of finite models), based on a pseudo-finite field in place of the field of complex numbers. The advantage of this unusual setting is that it treats the quantum and the statistical mechanics as just domains in the same model and explains Wick rotation as a natural transformation of the model corresponding to a shift in scales of physical units.</description>

      <title>Completeness and Well-Definability of a Provability Degree Measure in Sufficiently Powerful Formal Systems, and Finite-Time Effective Knowers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that including degrees of a particular kind of provability in the search target for any theorem-prover in sufficiently powerful formal systems over finite-sized statements preserves well-definition and a sufficient consistency while establishing completeness. Moreover, the union of such degrees is isomorphic to such a system's {\aleph_0} statements and permits the construction of a best-possible (up to a quadratic term) finite-time theorem knower, {\phi}', while still subject to limitations in these formal systems. These results, owing to the fact that {\phi}' may arise through the behavior of any unbounded inductive computation, establish results on the eventual behavior of a class of computational processes.</description>

      <title>Two classes of oligomorphic groups with smooth topological isomorphism relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is an open question whether topological isomorphism of oligomorphic groups is smooth in the sense of Borel reducibility. We show smoothness for two Borel classes of oligomorphic groups: groups with no algebraicity, and groups with finitely many {\em essential} subgroups up to conjugacy. This second class, which is new, contains the class of automorphism groups of $\aleph_0$-categorical structures that have weak elimination of imaginaries, studied in (G.\ Paolini, the isomorphism problem for oligomorphic groups with weak elimination of imaginaries, Bull.\ London Math.\ Soc., 2024). Towards showing this, we obtain results on general oligomorphic groups $G$ that are of independent interest. $\Inn(G)$ is closed in $\Aut(G)$, where $\Aut(G)$ carries the topology of pointwise convergence on open cosets. $N_G/G$ is profinite, where $N_G$ denotes the normaliser of $G$ in $\Sym(\omega)$. The topological group $\Out(G)= \Aut(G)/\Inn(G)$ is totally disconnected, locally compact. Finally, we show that if $G$ is in one of our two classes, then $\Aut(G)$ is topologically isomorphic \mbox{to an oligomorphic group, and that $\Out(G)$ is profinite.}</description>

      <title>How to take cats together</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to give mathematical account of an argument of David Lewis in Parts of Classes in defense of universalism in mereology. Specifically we study how to extend models of Core Mereology (following Achille Varzi's terminology) to models in which every collection of parts can be composed into another part. We focus on the two main definitions for mereological compositions and show that any model can be extended to satisfy universalism. We explore which are the "most economical" ways of extending models under various conditions. Remarkably, we show that if the principle of Strong Supplementation is assumed, there is a unique mereological completion, up to isomorphism.</description>

      <title>$\aleph_1$-free abelian non-Archimedean Polish groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An uncountable $\aleph_1$-free group can not admit a Polish group topology but an uncountable $\aleph_1$-free abelian group can, as witnessed e.g. by the Baer-Specker group $\mathbb{Z}^\omega$. In this paper we study $\aleph_1$-free abelian non-Archimedean Polish groups. We prove two results. The first is that being $\aleph_1$-free abelian is a complete co-analytic problem in the space of closed subgroups of $S_\infty$. The second is that there are continuum many $\aleph_1$-free abelian non-Archimedean Polish groups which are not topologically isomorphic to product groups and are pairwise not continuous homomorphic images of each other.</description>

      <title>The weakness of finding descending sequences in ill-founded linear orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11807v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the Weihrauch degree of the problems ``find a bad sequence in a non-well quasi order'' ($\mathsf{BS}$) and ``find a descending sequence in an ill-founded linear order'' ($\mathsf{DS}$). We prove that $\mathsf{DS}$ is strictly Weihrauch reducible to $\mathsf{BS}$, correcting our mistaken claim in [arXiv:2010.03840]. This is done by separating their respective first-order parts. On the other hand, we show that $\mathsf{BS}$ and $\mathsf{DS}$ have the same finitary and deterministic parts, confirming that $\mathsf{BS}$ and $\mathsf{DS}$ have very similar uniform computational strength. We prove that K\"onig's lemma $\mathsf{KL}$ and the problem $\mathsf{wList}_{2^{\mathbb{N}},\leq\omega}$ of enumerating a given non-empty countable closed subset of $2^{\mathbb{N}}$ are not Weihrauch reducible to $\mathsf{DS}$ or $\mathsf{BS}$, resolving two main open questions raised in [arXiv:2010.03840]. We also answer the question, raised in [arXiv:1804.10968], on the existence of a ``parallel quotient'' operator, and study the behavior of $\mathsf{BS}$ and $\mathsf{DS}$ under the quotient with some known problems.</description>

      <title>Preservation of Topological Properties by Strongly Proper Forcings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02495v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we show that forcings which are strongly proper for stationarily many countable elementary submodels preserve each of the following properties of topological spaces: countably tight; Lindel\"of; Rothberger; Menger; and a strategic version of Rothberger. This extends results from Dow, as well as from Iwasa and from Kada.</description>

      <title>AC and the Independence of WO in Second-Order Henkin Logic, Part I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10276v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article is concerned with the Axiom of Choice (AC) and the well-ordering theorem (WO) in second-order predicate logic with Henkin interpretation (HPL). We consider a principle of choice introduced by Wilhelm Ackermann (1935) and discussed also by David Hilbert and Ackermann (1938), by G\"unter Asser (1981), and by Benjamin Siskind, Paolo Mancosu, and Stewart Shapiro (2020). The discussion is restricted to so-called Henkin-Asser structures of second order. The language used is a many-sorted first-order language with identity. In particular, we give some of the technical details for a proof of the independence of WO from the so-called Ackermann axioms in HPL presented at the Colloquium Logicum in 2022.</description>
