      <title>Building imaginary-time thermal filed theory with artificial neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we introduce a novel approach in quantum field theories to estimate the action using the artificial neural networks (ANNs). The estimation is achieved by learning on system configurations governed by the Boltzmann factor, $e^{-S}$ at different temperatures within the imaginary time formalism of thermal field theory. We focus on 0+1 dimensional quantum field with kink/anti-kink configurations to demonstrate the feasibility of the method. The continuous-mixture autoregressive networks (CANs) enable the construction of accurate effective actions with tractable probability density estimation. Our numerical results demonstrate that this methodology not only facilitates the construction of effective actions at specified temperatures but also adeptly estimates the action at intermediate temperatures using data from both lower and higher temperature ensembles. This capability is especially valuable for the detailed exploration of phase diagrams.</description>

      <title>Centre vortex geometry at finite temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The geometry of centre vortices is studied in $\mathrm{SU(3)}$ gauge theory at finite temperature to capture the key structural changes that occur through the deconfinement phase transition. Visualisations of the vortex structure in temporal and spatial slices of the lattice reveal a preference for the vortex sheet to align with the temporal dimension above the critical temperature. This is quantified through a correlation measure. A collection of vortex statistics, including vortex and branching point densities, and vortex path lengths between branching points, are analysed to highlight internal shifts in vortex behaviour arising from the loss of confinement. We find the zero-temperature inclination of branching points to cluster at short distances vanishes at high temperatures, embodying a rearrangement of branching points within the vortex structure. These findings establish the many aspects of centre vortex geometry that characterise the deconfinement phase transition in pure gauge theory.</description>

      <title>Exponential improvements in the simulation of lattice gauge theories using near-optimal techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulation of quantum systems of a large number of strongly interacting particles persists as one of the most challenging, and computationally demanding, tasks in classical simulation, involving both non-relativistic applications like condensed matter physics and quantum chemistry, as well as relativistic applications like lattice gauge theory simulation. One of the major motivations for building a fault-tolerant quantum computer is the efficient simulation of many-body systems on such a device. While significant developments have been made in the quantum simulation of non-relativistic systems, the simulation of lattice gauge theories has lagged behind, with state-of-the-art Trotterized simulations requiring many orders of magnitude more resources than non-relativistic simulation, in stark contrast to the similar difficulty of these tasks in classical simulation. In this work, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the cost of simulating Abelian and non-Abelian lattice gauge theories in the Kogut-Susskind formulation using simulation methods with near-optimal scaling in system size, evolution time, and error. We provide explicit circuit constructions, as well as T-gate counts and qubit counts for the entire simulation algorithm. This investigation, the first of its kind, leads to up to 25 orders of magnitude improvement over Trotterization in spacetime volume for non-Abelian simulations. Such a dramatic improvement results largely from our algorithm having polynomial scaling with the number of colors, as opposed to exponential scaling in existing approaches. Our work demonstrates that the use of advanced algorithmic techniques leads to dramatic reductions in the cost of ab initio simulations of fundamental interactions, bringing it in step with resources required for first principles quantum simulation of chemistry and condensed matter physics.</description>

      <title>A comparative lattice analysis of $SU(2)$ dark gluebal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03959v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the mass and scattering cross section of $SU(2)$ glueballs as dark matter candidates using lattice simulations. We employ both naive and improved $SU(2)$ gauge actions in $3+1$ dimensions with several $\beta$ values, and adopt both the traditional Monte Carlo method and the flow-based model based on machine learning techniques to generate lattice configurations. The mass of dark scalar glueball with $J^{PC}=0^{++}$ and the NBS wave function are calculated. Using a coupling constant of $\beta=2.2$ as an illustration, we compare the dark glueball mass calculated from the configurations generated from the two methods. While consistent results can be achieved, the two methods demonstrate distinct advantages. Using the Runge-Kutta method, we extract the glueball interaction potential and two-body scattering cross section. From the observational constraints, we obtain the lower bound of the mass of scalar glueball as candidates of dark matter.</description>
