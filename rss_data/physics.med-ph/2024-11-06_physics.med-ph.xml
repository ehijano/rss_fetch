      <title>Investigation of Inward-Outward Ring Permanent Magnet Array for Portable Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03249v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Permanent magnet array (PMA) is a popular option to provide the main magnetic field in a dedicated portable magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) system because it does not need power or a cooling system and has a much stronger field strength compared to a resistive magnet. Aside from the popular Halbach array that has a transversal field direction, the Inward-Outward ring (IO ring) array is a promising candidate that offers a longitudinal field direction with various design and engineering possibilities. In this article, a thorough study of IO ring arrays is conducted by examining the relation between the design parameters and its field patterns, its variants that lead to different applications and their properties. A detailed comparison between an IO ring array and Halbach array was conducted and reported. Moreover, the feasibility of building an IO ring array in a lab is demonstrated. The investigations strongly indicate that IO ring is a promising candidate that can offer high and homogeneous fields or a desired field pattern to portable MRI systems. With a longitudinal field direction, an IO ring array opens up opportunities to adopt MRI advanced technology and techniques in a portable system to improve image quality and shorten scan time.</description>

      <title>Constitutive Models for Active Skeletal Muscle: Review, Comparison, and Application in a Novel Continuum Shoulder Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The shoulder joint is one of the functionally and anatomically most sophisticated articular systems in the human body. Both complex movement patterns and the stabilization of the highly mobile joint rely on intricate three-dimensional interactions among various components. Continuum-based finite element models can capture such complexity, and are thus particularly relevant in shoulder biomechanics. Considering their role as active joint stabilizers and force generators, skeletal muscles require special attention regarding their constitutive description. In this contribution, we propose a constitutive description to model active skeletal muscle within complex musculoskeletal systems, focusing on a novel continuum shoulder model. We thoroughly review existing material models before analyzing three selected ones in detail: an active-stress, an active-strain, and a generalized active-strain approach. To establish a basis for comparison, we identify the material parameters based on experimental stress-strain data obtained under various active and passive loading conditions. We discuss the concepts to incorporate active contractile behavior from a mathematical and physiological perspective, address analytical and numerical challenges arising from the mathematical formulations, and analyze the included biophysical principles of force generation in terms of physiological correctness and relevance for human shoulder modeling. Based on these insights, we present an improved constitutive model combining the studied models' most promising and relevant features. Using the example of a fusiform muscle, we investigate force generation, deformation, and kinematics during active isometric and free contractions. Eventually, we demonstrate the applicability of the suggested material model in a novel continuum mechanical model of the human shoulder.</description>
