      <title>Glaucoma Detection and Structured OCT Report Generation via a Fine-tuned Multimodal Large Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective: To develop an explainable multimodal large language model (MM-LLM) that (1) screens optic nerve head (ONH) OCT circle scans for quality and (2) generates structured clinical reports that include glaucoma diagnosis and sector-wise retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thinning assessments. Design: Retrospective cohort study of 1,310 subjects contributing 43,849 Spectralis ONH OCT circle scans (1,331 glaucomatous and 867 healthy eyes) from the DIGS and ADAGES cohorts. Methods: A MM-LLM (Llama 3.2 Vision-Instruct model) was fine-tuned to generate clinical descriptions of OCT imaging data. Training data included paired OCT images and automatically generated, structured clinical reports that described global and sectoral RNFL thinning. Poor-quality scans were labeled as unusable and paired with a fixed refusal statement. The model was evaluated on a held-out test set for three tasks: quality assessment, glaucoma detection, and RNFL thinning classification across seven anatomical sectors. Evaluation metrics included accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, and F1-score. Model description quality was also evaluated using standard text evaluation metrics. Results: The model achieved 0.90 accuracy and 0.98 specificity for quality triage. For glaucoma detection, accuracy was 0.86 (sensitivity 0.91, specificity 0.73, F1-score 0.91). RNFL thinning prediction accuracy ranged from 0.83 to 0.94, with highest performance in global and temporal sectors. Text generation scores showed strong alignment with reference reports (BLEU: 0.82; ROUGE-1: 0.94; ROUGE-2: 0.87; ROUGE-L: 0.92; BERTScore-F1: 0.99). Conclusions: The fine-tuned MM-LLM generated accurate clinical descriptions based on OCT imaging. The model achieved high accuracy in identifying image quality issues and detecting glaucoma. The model also provided sectoral descriptions of RNFL thinning to help support clinical OCT evaluation.</description>

      <title>Head and Eye Control in Persons with Low Vision during Urban Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low vision involves a range of visual impairments that significantly impact daily activities, particularly navigation in urban environments. Individuals with low vision often develop adaptive strategies to compensate for visual deficits, relying on head movements to bring objects into their remaining functional field of vision. Research suggests that they focus on road surface markings and building edges to aid in wayfinding and collision avoidance. However, urban navigation presents additional challenges, as obstacles, moving hazards, and tripping dangers may enter their visual loss field, increasing the risk of injury. Traditional eye movement studies are typically conducted in controlled laboratory settings with fixed head positions, limiting the understanding of head-eye coordination in real-world environments. To bridge this gap, we designed a naturalistic, "free-head" experiment using eye-tracking technology to examine head and eye movement patterns during urban navigation. Participants with low vision were compared to a control cohort without visual impairment to test the hypothesis that eye and head movements become decoupled in visually impaired individuals. Findings indicate that individuals with peripheral field loss exhibit significant eye-head decoupling, while those with acuity loss demonstrate more synchronized movements. Results for individuals with central field loss were inconclusive but revealed distinct movement patterns. These insights provide valuable direction for rehabilitation strategies, assistive- mobility technologies, and urban design improvements. By expanding research on eye-head coordination, this study contributes to the development of interventions that enhance safety, mobility, and independence for individuals with low vision in complex urban environments.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-Guided Model Selection for Tabular Foundation Models in Biomolecule Efficacy Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In-context learners like TabPFN are promising for biomolecule efficacy prediction, where established molecular feature sets and relevant experimental results can serve as powerful contextual examples. However, their performance is highly sensitive to the provided context, making strategies like post-hoc ensembling of models trained on different data subsets a viable approach. An open question is how to select the best models for the ensemble without access to ground truth labels. In this study, we investigate an uncertainty-guided strategy for model selection. We demonstrate on an siRNA knockdown efficacy task that a TabPFN model using simple sequence-based features can surpass specialized state-of-the-art predictors. We also show that the model's predicted inter-quantile range (IQR), a measure of its uncertainty, has a negative correlation with true prediction error. By selecting and averaging an ensemble of models with the lowest mean IQR, we achieve superior performance compared to naive ensembling or using a single model trained on all available data. This finding highlights model uncertainty as a powerful, label-free heuristic for optimizing biomolecule efficacy predictions.</description>

      <title>Surface Acoustic Wave Hemolysis Assay for Evaluating Stored Red Blood Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Blood transfusion remains a cornerstone of modern medicine, saving countless lives daily. Yet the quality of transfused blood varies dramatically among donors-a critical factor often overlooked in clinical practice. Rapid, benchtop, and cost-effective methods for evaluating stored red blood cells (RBCs) at the site of transfusion are lacking, with concerns persisting about the association between metabolic signatures of stored RBC quality and transfusion outcomes. Recent studies utilizing metabolomics approaches to evaluate stored erythrocytes find that donor biology (e.g., genetics, age, lifestyle factors) underlies the heterogeneity associated with blood storage and transfusion. The appreciation of donor-intrinsic factors provides opportunities for precision transfusion medicine approaches for the evaluation of storage quality and prediction of transfusion efficacy. Here we propose a new platform, the Surface Acoustic Wave Hemolysis Assay (SAW-HA), for on-site evaluation of stored RBCs utilizing SAW Hemolysis Temperature (SAWHT) as a marker for RBC quality. We report SAWHT as a mechanism-dependent reproducible methodology for evaluating stored human RBCs up to 42 days. Our results define unique signatures for SAW hemolysis and metabolic profiles in RBCs from two of the six donors in which high body mass index (BMI) and RBC triglycerides associated with increased susceptibility to hemolysis. Metabolic age of the stored RBCs - a recently appreciated predictor of post-transfusion efficacy-reveal that RBCs from the two low SAWHT units were characterized by disrupted redox control, deficient tryptophan metabolism, and high BMI. Together, these findings indicate the potential of the SAW-HA as a point-of-care analysis for transfusion medicine.</description>

      <title>Towards Electrophysiological and Histological Mapping of Upper Limb Nerves in Pigs Using Epineural Stimulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the relationship between nerve anatomy and the functional outcomes of electrical stimulation is critical for optimizing neural interface design. In this study, we conducted acute experiments on four pigs in which epineural cuff electrodes with multiple contacts were placed around upper limb nerves. A subset of electrical stimulation configurations -- previously identified via computational study -- was applied, and the resulting evoked electromyographic (EMG) responses were recorded from target muscles. Muscle recruitment curves were extracted and analysed offline to quantify activation patterns. Following the electrophysiological experiments, the stimulated nerves were harvested and processed for histological analysis to visualize fascicular organization and distribution. This work presents preliminary results from the combined analysis of muscle activation profiles and fascicle anatomy in one animal. Our findings aim to inform the design of stimulation strategies by linking electrode configuration to selective muscle recruitment, ultimately contributing to more effective neuromodulation and neuroprosthetic applications.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Mutation as a Mechanism for the Emergence of SARS-CoV-2 New Variants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10471v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predicting the future evolutionary trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 remains a critical challenge, particularly due to the pivotal role of spike protein mutations. It is therefore essential to develop evolutionary models capable of continuously integrating new experimental data. In this study, we employ a cladogram algorithm that incorporates established assumptions for mutant representation -- using both four-letter and two-letter formats -- along with an n-mer distance algorithm to construct a cladogenetic tree of SARS-CoV-2 mutations. This tree accurately captures the observed changes across macro-lineages. We introduce a stochastic method for generating new strains on this tree based on spike protein mutations. For a given set A of existing mutation sites, we define a set X comprising x randomly generated mutation sites on the spike protein. The intersection of A and X, denoted as set Y, contains y sites. Our analysis indicates that the position of a generated strain on the tree is primarily determined by x. Through large-scale stochastic sampling, we predict the emergence of new macro-lineages. As x increases, the dominance among macro-lineages shifts: lineage O surpasses N, P surpasses O, and eventually Q surpasses P. We identify threshold values of x that delineate transitions between these macro-lineages. Furthermore, we propose an algorithm for predicting the timeline of macro-lineage emergence. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 evolution adheres to statistical principles: the emergence of new strains can be driven by randomly generated spike protein sites, and large-scale stochastic sampling reveals evolutionary patterns underlying the rise of distinct macro-lineages.</description>

      <title>DeepGDel: Deep Learning-based Gene Deletion Prediction Framework for Growth-Coupled Production in Genome-Scale Metabolic Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06316v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In genome-scale constraint-based metabolic models, gene deletion strategies are crucial for achieving growth-coupled production, where cell growth and target metabolite production are simultaneously achieved. While computational methods for calculating gene deletions have been widely explored and contribute to developing gene deletion strategy databases, current approaches are limited in leveraging new data-driven paradigms, such as machine learning, for more efficient strain design. Therefore, it is necessary to propose a fundamental framework for this objective. In this study, we first formulate the problem of gene deletion strategy prediction and then propose a framework for predicting gene deletion strategies for growth-coupled production in genome-scale metabolic models. The proposed framework leverages deep learning algorithms to learn and integrate sequential gene and metabolite data representation, enabling the automatic gene deletion strategy prediction. Computational experiment results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed framework, showing substantial improvements over baseline methods. Specifically, the proposed framework achieves a 14.69%, 22.52%, and 13.03% increase in overall accuracy across three metabolic models of different scales under study, while maintaining balanced precision and recall in predicting gene deletion statuses. The source code and examples for the framework are publicly available at https://github.com/MetNetComp/DeepGDel.</description>

      <title>Impact of SMILES Notational Inconsistencies on Chemical Language Models Trained via Molecular Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07139v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chemical language models (CLMs) are increasingly used for molecular modeling, yet their reliability is undermined by inconsistencies in the SMILES notation. Even canonical SMILES differ across toolkits, and stereochemical annotations are frequently incomplete, but the consequences for model behavior remain unclear. Here we systematically assess these effects through a literature survey, dataset analyses, and controlled modeling experiments. Nearly half of recent CLM studies omit canonicalization details, while public benchmarks contain redundant encodings and missing stereochemistry. We show that such inconsistencies destabilize latent representations and impair structural reconstruction, whereas property prediction tasks appear deceptively robust because feature selection filters unstable features. Most critically, we uncover confounding artifacts in benchmark datasets, where notational variants spuriously correlate with class labels and inflate predictive performance. These findings expose a reproducibility gap in the field and highlight the need for rigorous preprocessing standards and transparent reporting to ensure that CLMs capture genuine chemical principles.</description>
