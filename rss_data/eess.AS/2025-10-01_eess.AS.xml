      <title>An Analysis of Joint Nonlinear Spatial Filtering for Spatial Aliasing Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The performance of traditional linear spatial filters for speech enhancement is constrained by the physical size and number of channels of microphone arrays. For instance, for large microphone distances and high frequencies, spatial aliasing may occur, leading to unwanted enhancement of signals from non-target directions. Recently, it has been proposed to replace linear beamformers by nonlinear deep neural networks for joint spatial-spectral processing. While it has been shown that such approaches result in higher performance in terms of instrumental quality metrics, in this work we highlight their ability to efficiently handle spatial aliasing. In particular, we show that joint spatial and tempo-spectral processing is more robust to spatial aliasing than traditional approaches that perform spatial processing alone or separately with tempo-spectral filtering. The results provide another strong motivation for using deep nonlinear networks in multichannel speech enhancement, beyond their known benefits in managing non-Gaussian noise and multiple speakers, especially when microphone arrays with rather large microphone distances are used.</description>

      <title>Zimtohrli: An Efficient Psychoacoustic Audio Similarity Metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces Zimtohrli, a novel, full-reference audio similarity metric designed for efficient and perceptually accurate quality assessment. In an era dominated by computationally intensive deep learning models and proprietary legacy standards, there is a pressing need for an interpretable, psychoacoustically-grounded metric that balances performance with practicality. Zimtohrli addresses this gap by combining a 128-bin gammatone filterbank front-end, which models the frequency resolution of the cochlea, with a unique non-linear resonator model that mimics the human eardrum's response to acoustic stimuli. Similarity is computed by comparing perceptually-mapped spectrograms using modified Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and Neurogram Similarity Index Measure (NSIM) algorithms, which incorporate novel non-linearities to better align with human judgment. Zimtohrli achieves superior performance to the baseline open-source ViSQOL metric, and significantly narrows the performance gap with the latest commercial POLQA metric. It offers a compelling balance of perceptual relevance and computational efficiency, positioning it as a strong alternative for modern audio engineering applications, from codec development to the evaluation of generative audio systems.</description>

      <title>TAU: A Benchmark for Cultural Sound Understanding Beyond Semantics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large audio-language models are advancing rapidly, yet most evaluations emphasize speech or globally sourced sounds, overlooking culturally distinctive cues. This gap raises a critical question: can current models generalize to localized, non-semantic audio that communities instantly recognize but outsiders do not? To address this, we present TAU (Taiwan Audio Understanding), a benchmark of everyday Taiwanese "soundmarks." TAU is built through a pipeline combining curated sources, human editing, and LLM-assisted question generation, producing 702 clips and 1,794 multiple-choice items that cannot be solved by transcripts alone. Experiments show that state-of-the-art LALMs, including Gemini 2.5 and Qwen2-Audio, perform far below local humans. TAU demonstrates the need for localized benchmarks to reveal cultural blind spots, guide more equitable multimodal evaluation, and ensure models serve communities beyond the global mainstream.</description>

      <title>Game-Time: Evaluating Temporal Dynamics in Spoken Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conversational Spoken Language Models (SLMs) are emerging as a promising paradigm for real-time speech interaction. However, their capacity of temporal dynamics, including the ability to manage timing, tempo and simultaneous speaking, remains a critical and unevaluated challenge for conversational fluency. To address this gap, we introduce the Game-Time Benchmark, a framework to systematically assess these temporal capabilities. Inspired by how humans learn a language through language activities, Game-Time consists of basic instruction-following tasks and advanced tasks with temporal constraints, such as tempo adherence and synchronized responses. Our evaluation of diverse SLM architectures reveals a clear performance disparity: while state-of-the-art models handle basic tasks well, many contemporary systems still struggle with fundamental instruction-following. More critically, nearly all models degrade substantially under temporal constraints, exposing persistent weaknesses in time awareness and full-duplex interaction. The Game-Time Benchmark provides a foundation for guiding future research toward more temporally-aware conversational AI. Demos and datasets are available on our project website https://ga642381.github.io/Game-Time.</description>

      <title>IR-UWB Radar-Based Contactless Silent Speech Recognition with Attention-Enhanced Temporal Convolutional Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silent speech recognition (SSR) is a technology that recognizes speech content from non-acoustic speech-related biosignals. This paper utilizes an attention-enhanced temporal convolutional network architecture for contactless IR-UWB radar-based SSR, leveraging deep learning to learn discriminative representations directly from minimally processed radar signals. The architecture integrates temporal convolutions with self-attention and squeeze-and-excitation mechanisms to capture articulatory patterns. Evaluated on a 50-word recognition task using leave-one-session-out cross-validation, our approach achieves an average test accuracy of 91.1\% compared to 74.0\% for the conventional hand-crafted feature method, demonstrating significant improvement through end-to-end learning.</description>

      <title>On Deepfake Voice Detection - It's All in the Presentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the technologies empowering malicious audio deepfakes have dramatically evolved in recent years due to generative AI advances, the same cannot be said of global research into spoofing (deepfake) countermeasures. This paper highlights how current deepfake datasets and research methodologies led to systems that failed to generalize to real world application. The main reason is due to the difference between raw deepfake audio, and deepfake audio that has been presented through a communication channel, e.g. by phone. We propose a new framework for data creation and research methodology, allowing for the development of spoofing countermeasures that would be more effective in real-world scenarios. By following the guidelines outlined here we improved deepfake detection accuracy by 39% in more robust and realistic lab setups, and by 57% on a real-world benchmark. We also demonstrate how improvement in datasets would have a bigger impact on deepfake detection accuracy than the choice of larger SOTA models would over smaller models; that is, it would be more important for the scientific community to make greater investment on comprehensive data collection programs than to simply train larger models with higher computational demands.</description>

      <title>Voice Evaluation of Reasoning Ability: Diagnosing the Modality-Induced Performance Gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Voice Evaluation of Reasoning Ability (VERA), a benchmark for evaluating reasoning ability in voice-interactive systems under real-time conversational constraints. VERA comprises 2,931 voice-native episodes derived from established text benchmarks and organized into five tracks (Math, Web, Science, Long-Context, Factual). Each item is adapted for speech interaction while preserving reasoning difficulty. VERA enables direct text-voice comparison within model families and supports analysis of how architectural choices affect reliability. We assess 12 contemporary voice systems alongside strong text baselines and observe large, consistent modality gaps: on competition mathematics a leading text model attains 74.8% accuracy while its voice counterpart reaches 6.1%; macro-averaged across tracks the best text models achieve 54.0% versus 11.3% for voice. Latency-accuracy analyses reveal a low-latency plateau, where fast voice systems cluster around ~10% accuracy, while approaching text performance requires sacrificing real-time interaction. Diagnostic experiments indicate that common mitigations are insufficient. Increasing "thinking time" yields negligible gains; a decoupled cascade that separates reasoning from narration improves accuracy but still falls well short of text and introduces characteristic grounding/consistency errors. Failure analyses further show distinct error signatures across native streaming, end-to-end, and cascade designs. VERA provides a reproducible testbed and targeted diagnostics for architectures that decouple thinking from speaking, offering a principled way to measure progress toward real-time voice assistants that are both fluent and reliably reasoned.</description>

      <title>VoiceBridge: Designing Latent Bridge Models for General Speech Restoration at Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bridge models have recently been explored for speech enhancement tasks such as denoising, dereverberation, and super-resolution, while these efforts are typically confined to a single task or small-scale datasets, with constrained general speech restoration (GSR) capability at scale. In this work, we introduce VoiceBridge, a GSR system rooted in latent bridge models (LBMs), capable of reconstructing high-fidelity speech at full-band (\textit{i.e.,} 48~kHz) from various distortions. By compressing speech waveform into continuous latent representations, VoiceBridge models the~\textit{diverse LQ-to-HQ tasks} (namely, low-quality to high-quality) in GSR with~\textit{a single latent-to-latent generative process} backed by a scalable transformer architecture. To better inherit the advantages of bridge models from the data domain to the latent space, we present an energy-preserving variational autoencoder, enhancing the alignment between the waveform and latent space over varying energy levels. Furthermore, to address the difficulty of HQ reconstruction from distinctively different LQ priors, we propose a joint neural prior, uniformly alleviating the reconstruction burden of LBM. At last, considering the key requirement of GSR systems, human perceptual quality, a perceptually aware fine-tuning stage is designed to mitigate the cascading mismatch in generation while improving perceptual alignment. Extensive validation across in-domain and out-of-domain tasks and datasets (\textit{e.g.}, refining recent zero-shot speech and podcast generation results) demonstrates the superior performance of VoiceBridge.

      <title>Learning Relationships Between Separate Audio Tracks for Creative Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the first step in a research project situated within the field of musical agents. The objective is to achieve, through training, the tuning of the desired musical relationship between a live musical input and a real-time generated musical output, through the curation of a database of separated tracks. We propose an architecture integrating a symbolic decision module capable of learning and exploiting musical relationships from such musical corpus. We detail an offline implementation of this architecture employing Transformers as the decision module, associated with a perception module based on Wav2Vec 2.0, and concatenative synthesis as audio renderer. We present a quantitative evaluation of the decision module's ability to reproduce learned relationships extracted during training. We demonstrate that our decision module can predict a coherent track B when conditioned by its corresponding ''guide'' track A, based on a corpus of paired tracks (A, B).</description>

      <title>Scaling Spoken Language Models with Syllabic Speech Tokenization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spoken language models (SLMs) typically discretize speech into high-frame-rate tokens extracted from SSL speech models. As the most successful LMs are based on the Transformer architecture, processing these long token streams with self-attention is expensive, as attention scales quadratically with sequence length. A recent SSL work introduces acoustic tokenization of speech at the syllable level, which is more interpretable and potentially more scalable with significant compression in token lengths (4-5 Hz). Yet, their value for spoken language modeling is not yet fully explored. We present the first systematic study of syllabic tokenization for spoken language modeling, evaluating models on a suite of SLU benchmarks while varying training data scale. Syllabic tokens can match or surpass the previous high-frame rate tokens while significantly cutting training and inference costs, achieving more than a 2x reduction in training time and a 5x reduction in FLOPs. Our findings highlight syllable-level language modeling as a promising path to efficient long-context spoken language models.</description>

      <title>From Voice to Safety: Language AI Powered Pilot-ATC Communication Understanding for Airport Surface Movement Collision Risk Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04974v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work provides a feasible solution to the existing airport surface safety monitoring capabilities (i.e., Airport Surface Surveillance Capability (ASSC)), namely language AI-based voice communication understanding for collision risk assessment. The proposed framework consists of two major parts, (a) rule-enhanced Named Entity Recognition (NER); (b) surface collision risk modeling. NER module generates information tables by processing voice communication transcripts, which serve as references for producing potential taxi plans and calculating the surface movement collision risk. We first collect and annotate our dataset based on open-sourced video recordings and safety investigation reports. Additionally, we refer to FAA Order JO 7110.65W and FAA Order JO 7340.2N to get the list of heuristic rules and phase contractions of communication between the pilot and the Air Traffic Controller (ATCo). Then, we propose the novel ATC Rule-Enhanced NER method, which integrates the heuristic rules into the model training and inference stages, resulting in a hybrid rule-based NER model. We show the effectiveness of this hybrid approach by comparing different setups with different token-level embedding models. For the risk modeling, we adopt the node-link airport layout graph from NASA FACET and model the aircraft taxi speed at each link as a log-normal distribution and derive the total taxi time distribution. Then, we propose a spatiotemporal formulation of the risk probability of two aircraft moving across potential collision nodes during ground movement. Furthermore, we propose the real-time implementation of such a method to obtain the lead time, with a comparison with a Petri-Net based method.</description>

      <title>Regularizing Learnable Feature Extraction for Automatic Speech Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09804v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural front-ends are an appealing alternative to traditional, fixed feature extraction pipelines for automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems since they can be directly trained to fit the acoustic model. However, their performance often falls short compared to classical methods, which we show is largely due to their increased susceptibility to overfitting. This work therefore investigates regularization methods for training ASR models with learnable feature extraction front-ends. First, we examine audio perturbation methods and show that larger relative improvements can be obtained for learnable features. Additionally, we identify two limitations in the standard use of SpecAugment for these front-ends and propose masking in the short time Fourier transform (STFT)-domain as a simple but effective modification to address these challenges. Finally, integrating both regularization approaches effectively closes the performance gap between traditional and learnable features.</description>

      <title>Musical Source Separation Bake-Off: Comparing Objective Metrics with Human Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06917v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Music source separation aims to extract individual sound sources (e.g., vocals, drums, guitar) from a mixed music recording. However, evaluating the quality of separated audio remains challenging, as commonly used metrics like the source-to-distortion ratio (SDR) do not always align with human perception. In this study, we conducted a large-scale listener evaluation on the MUSDB18 test set, collecting approximately 30 ratings per track from seven distinct listener groups. We compared several objective energy-ratio metrics, including legacy measures (BSSEval v4, SI-SDR variants), and embedding-based alternatives (Frechet Audio Distance using CLAP-LAION-music, EnCodec, VGGish, Wave2Vec2, and HuBERT). While SDR remains the best-performing metric for vocal estimates, our results show that the scale-invariant signal-to-artifacts ratio (SI-SAR) better predicts listener ratings for drums and bass stems. Frechet Audio Distance (FAD) computed with the CLAP-LAION-music embedding also performs competitively--achieving Kendall's tau values of 0.25 for drums and 0.19 for bass--matching or surpassing energy-based metrics for those stems. However, none of the embedding-based metrics, including CLAP, correlate positively with human perception for vocal estimates. These findings highlight the need for stem-specific evaluation strategies and suggest that no single metric reliably reflects perceptual quality across all source types. We release our raw listener ratings to support reproducibility and further research.</description>

      <title>VSSFlow: Unifying Video-conditioned Sound and Speech Generation via Joint Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24773v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Video-conditioned sound and speech generation, encompassing video-to-sound (V2S) and visual text-to-speech (VisualTTS) tasks, are conventionally addressed as separate tasks, with limited exploration to unify them within a signle framework. Recent attempts to unify V2S and VisualTTS face challenges in handling distinct condition types (e.g., heterogeneous video and transcript conditions) and require complex training stages. Unifying these two tasks remains an open problem. To bridge this gap, we present VSSFlow, which seamlessly integrates both V2S and VisualTTS tasks into a unified flow-matching framework. VSSFlow uses a novel condition aggregation mechanism to handle distinct input signals. We find that cross-attention and self-attention layer exhibit different inductive biases in the process of introducing condition. Therefore, VSSFlow leverages these inductive biases to effectively handle different representations: cross-attention for ambiguous video conditions and self-attention for more deterministic speech transcripts. Furthermore, contrary to the prevailing belief that joint training on the two tasks requires complex training strategies and may degrade performance, we find that VSSFlow benefits from the end-to-end joint learning process for sound and speech generation without extra designs on training stages. Detailed analysis attributes it to the learned general audio prior shared between tasks, which accelerates convergence, enhances conditional generation, and stabilizes the classifier-free guidance process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VSSFlow surpasses the state-of-the-art domain-specific baselines on both V2S and VisualTTS benchmarks, underscoring the critical potential of unified generative models.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Impact of Data Quantity on ASR in Extremely Low-resource Languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08872v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the efficacy of data augmentation techniques for low-resource automatic speech recognition (ASR), focusing on two endangered Austronesian languages, Amis and Seediq. Recognizing the potential of self-supervised learning (SSL) in low-resource settings, we explore the impact of data volume on the continued pre-training of SSL models. We propose a novel data-selection scheme leveraging a multilingual corpus to augment the limited target language data. This scheme utilizes a language classifier to extract utterance embeddings and employs one-class classifiers to identify utterances phonetically and phonologically proximate to the target languages. Utterances are ranked and selected based on their decision scores, ensuring the inclusion of highly relevant data in the SSL-ASR pipeline. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, yielding substantial improvements in ASR performance for both Amis and Seediq. These findings underscore the feasibility and promise of data augmentation through cross-lingual transfer learning for low-resource language ASR.</description>

      <title>The Inverse Drum Machine: Source Separation Through Joint Transcription and Analysis-by-Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03337v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the Inverse Drum Machine, a novel approach to Drum Source Separation that leverages an analysis-by-synthesis framework combined with deep learning. Unlike recent supervised methods that require isolated stem recordings for training, our approach is trained on drum mixtures with only transcription annotations. IDM integrates Automatic Drum Transcription and One-shot Drum Sample Synthesis, jointly optimizing these tasks in an end-to-end manner. By convolving synthesized one-shot samples with estimated onsets, akin to a drum machine, we reconstruct the individual drum stems and train a Deep Neural Network on the reconstruction of the mixture. Experiments on the StemGMD dataset demonstrate that IDM achieves separation quality comparable to state-of-the-art supervised methods that require isolated stems data.</description>

      <title>AudSemThinker: Enhancing Audio-Language Models through Reasoning over Semantics of Sound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14142v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Audio-language models have shown promising results in various sound understanding tasks, yet they remain limited in their ability to reason over the fine-grained semantics of sound. In this paper, we present AudSemThinker, a model whose reasoning is structured around a framework of auditory semantics inspired by human cognition. To support this, we introduce AudSem, a novel dataset specifically curated for semantic descriptor reasoning in audio-language models. AudSem addresses the persistent challenge of data contamination in zero-shot evaluations by providing a carefully filtered collection of audio samples paired with captions generated through a robust multi-stage pipeline. Our experiments demonstrate that AudSemThinker outperforms state-of-the-art models across multiple training settings, highlighting its strength in semantic audio reasoning. Both AudSemThinker and the AudSem dataset are released publicly.</description>

      <title>AudioTrust: Benchmarking the Multifaceted Trustworthiness of Audio Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16211v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Audio Large Language Models (ALLMs) have gained widespread adoption, yet their trustworthiness remains underexplored. Existing evaluation frameworks, designed primarily for text, fail to address unique vulnerabilities introduced by audio's acoustic properties. We identify significant trustworthiness risks in ALLMs arising from non-semantic acoustic cues, including timbre, accent, and background noise, which can manipulate model behavior. We propose AudioTrust, a comprehensive framework for systematic evaluation of ALLM trustworthiness across audio-specific risks. AudioTrust encompasses six key dimensions: fairness, hallucination, safety, privacy, robustness, and authentication. The framework implements 26 distinct sub-tasks using a curated dataset of over 4,420 audio samples from real-world scenarios, including daily conversations, emergency calls, and voice assistant interactions. We conduct comprehensive evaluations across 18 experimental configurations using human-validated automated pipelines. Our evaluation of 14 state-of-the-art open-source and closed-source ALLMs reveals significant limitations when confronted with diverse high-risk audio scenarios, providing insights for secure deployment of audio models. Code and data are available at https://github.com/JusperLee/AudioTrust.</description>

      <title>Discovering and Steering Interpretable Concepts in Large Generative Music Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18186v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The fidelity with which neural networks can now generate content such as music presents a scientific opportunity: these systems appear to have learned implicit theories of such content's structure through statistical learning alone. This offers a potentially new lens on theories of human-generated media. When internal representations align with traditional constructs (e.g. chord progressions in music), they show how such categories can emerge from statistical regularities; when they diverge, they expose limits of existing frameworks and patterns we may have overlooked but that nonetheless carry explanatory power. In this paper, focusing on music generators, we introduce a method for discovering interpretable concepts using sparse autoencoders (SAEs), extracting interpretable features from the residual stream of a transformer model. We make this approach scalable and evaluable using automated labeling and validation pipelines. Our results reveal both familiar musical concepts and coherent but uncodified patterns lacking clear counterparts in theory or language. As an extension, we show such concepts can be used to steer model generations. Beyond improving model transparency, our work provides an empirical tool for uncovering organizing principles that have eluded traditional methods of analysis and synthesis.</description>

      <title>Universal Speech Enhancement with Regression and Generative Mamba</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21198v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Interspeech 2025 URGENT Challenge aimed to advance universal, robust, and generalizable speech enhancement by unifying speech enhancement tasks across a wide variety of conditions, including seven different distortion types and five languages. We present Universal Speech Enhancement Mamba (USEMamba), a state-space speech enhancement model designed to handle long-range sequence modeling, time-frequency structured processing, and sampling frequency-independent feature extraction. Our approach primarily relies on regression-based modeling, which performs well across most distortions. However, for packet loss and bandwidth extension, where missing content must be inferred, a generative variant of the proposed USEMamba proves more effective. Despite being trained on only a subset of the full training data, USEMamba achieved 2nd place in Track 1 during the blind test phase, demonstrating strong generalization across diverse conditions.</description>

      <title>Filling MIDI Velocity using U-Net Image Colorizer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07751v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern music producers commonly use MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) to store their musical compositions. However, MIDI files created with digital software may lack the expressive characteristics of human performances, essentially leaving the velocity parameter - a control for note loudness - undefined, which defaults to a flat value. The task of filling MIDI velocity is termed MIDI velocity prediction, which uses regression models to enhance music expressiveness by adjusting only this parameter. In this paper, we introduce the U-Net, a widely adopted architecture in image colorization, to this task. By conceptualizing MIDI data as images, we adopt window attention and develop a custom loss function to address the sparsity of MIDI-converted images. Current dataset availability restricts our experiments to piano data. Evaluated on the MAESTRO v3 and SMD datasets, our proposed method for filling MIDI velocity outperforms previous approaches in both quantitative metrics and qualitative listening tests.</description>

      <title>A dataset and model for recognition of audiologically relevant environments for hearing aids: AHEAD-DS and YAMNet+</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10360v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scene recognition of audiologically relevant environments is important for hearing aids; however, it is challenging, in part because of the limitations of existing datasets. Datasets often lack public accessibility, completeness, or audiologically relevant labels, hindering systematic comparison of machine learning models. Deploying these models on resource-constrained edge devices presents another challenge. Our solution is two-fold: we leverage several open source datasets to create AHEAD-DS, a dataset designed for scene recognition of audiologically relevant environments, and introduce YAMNet+, a sound recognition model. AHEAD-DS aims to provide a standardised, publicly available dataset with consistent labels relevant to hearing aids, facilitating model comparison. YAMNet+ is designed for deployment on edge devices like smartphones connected to hearing devices, such as hearing aids and wireless earphones with hearing aid functionality; serving as a baseline model for sound-based scene recognition. YAMNet+ achieved a mean average precision of 0.83 and accuracy of 0.93 on the testing set of AHEAD-DS across fourteen categories of audiologically relevant environments. We found that applying transfer learning from the pretrained YAMNet model was essential. We demonstrated real-time sound-based scene recognition capabilities on edge devices by deploying YAMNet+ to an Android smartphone. Even with a Google Pixel 3 (a phone with modest specifications, released in 2018), the model processes audio with approximately 50ms of latency to load the model, and an approximate linear increase of 30ms per 1 second of audio.

      <title>Leveraging Mamba with Full-Face Vision for Audio-Visual Speech Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13624v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent Mamba-based models have shown promise in speech enhancement by efficiently modeling long-range temporal dependencies. However, models like Speech Enhancement Mamba (SEMamba) remain limited to single-speaker scenarios and struggle in complex multi-speaker environments such as the cocktail party problem. To overcome this, we introduce AVSEMamba, an audio-visual speech enhancement model that integrates full-face visual cues with a Mamba-based temporal backbone. By leveraging spatiotemporal visual information, AVSEMamba enables more accurate extraction of target speech in challenging conditions. Evaluated on the AVSEC-4 Challenge development and blind test sets, AVSEMamba outperforms other monaural baselines in speech intelligibility (STOI), perceptual quality (PESQ), and non-intrusive quality (UTMOS), and achieves \textbf{1st place} on the monaural leaderboard.</description>

      <title>StereoFoley: Object-Aware Stereo Audio Generation from Video</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18272v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present StereoFoley, a video-to-audio generation framework that produces semantically aligned, temporally synchronized, and spatially accurate stereo sound at 48 kHz. While recent generative video-to-audio models achieve strong semantic and temporal fidelity, they largely remain limited to mono or fail to deliver object-aware stereo imaging, constrained by the lack of professionally mixed, spatially accurate video-to-audio datasets. First, we develop and train a base model that generates stereo audio from video, achieving state-of-the-art in both semantic accuracy and synchronization. Next, to overcome dataset limitations, we introduce a synthetic data generation pipeline that combines video analysis, object tracking, and audio synthesis with dynamic panning and distance-based loudness controls, enabling spatially accurate object-aware sound. Finally, we fine-tune the base model on this synthetic dataset, yielding clear object-audio correspondence. Since no established metrics exist, we introduce stereo object-awareness measures and validate it through a human listening study, showing strong correlation with perception. This work establishes the first end-to-end framework for stereo object-aware video-to-audio generation, addressing a critical gap and setting a new benchmark in the field.</description>

      <title>MeanFlowSE: One-Step Generative Speech Enhancement via MeanFlow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23299v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Speech enhancement (SE) recovers clean speech from noisy signals and is vital for applications such as telecommunications and automatic speech recognition (ASR). While generative approaches achieve strong perceptual quality, they often rely on multi-step sampling (diffusion/flow-matching) or large language models, limiting real-time deployment. To mitigate these constraints, we present MeanFlowSE, a one-step generative SE framework. It adopts MeanFlow to predict an average-velocity field for one-step latent refinement and conditions the model on self-supervised learning (SSL) representations rather than VAE latents. This design accelerates inference and provides robust acoustic-semantic guidance during training. In the Interspeech 2020 DNS Challenge blind test set and simulated test set, MeanFlowSE attains state-of-the-art (SOTA) level perceptual quality and competitive intelligibility while significantly lowering both real-time factor (RTF) and model size compared with recent generative competitors, making it suitable for practical use. The code will be released upon publication at https://github.com/Hello3orld/MeanFlowSE.</description>
