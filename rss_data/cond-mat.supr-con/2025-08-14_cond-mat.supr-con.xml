      <title>Structural transition and possible pressure-induced superconductivity in a suboxide La$_5$Pb$_3$O</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we report a structural phase transition and its possible competition with superconductivity in the suboxide La$_5$Pb$_3$O. Upon cooling through $T_t$ = 225 K, La$_5$Pb$_3$O transforms from a high-temperature I4/mcm to a low-temperature P4/ncc structure in which La - Pb dimerization along the c-axis occurs. This transition is accompanied by anomalies in the temperature dependence of electrical resistivity and specific heat. High-pressure electrical transport measurements reveal that hydrostatic pressure suppresses the structural transition and possibly induces superconductivity with a maximum superconducting temperature of 10 K. Density functional theory calculations show minimal changes in the electronic density of states and no gap opening at $E_F$ across $T_t$, suggesting that the transition is driven by bonding effects rather than Fermi surface instability. These findings establish La$_5$Pb$_3$O as a promising platform for exploring the interplay between weak structural transitions and superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in imbalanced bilayer Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the bilayer model with two layers of imbalanced densities coupled by the interlayer hybridization. Using the large-scale dynamical cluster quantum Monte Carlo simulation, we discovered that increased hybridization induces a transition in the superconducting pairing from $d$-wave to $s^{\pm}$-wave and the superconducting $T_c$ of $d$-wave pairing exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on the density imbalance. Remarkably, the optimal SC occurs at a moderate imbalance, whose SC is solely hosted by the layer with higher density (lower hole doping). Our results support the possibility of $T_c$ enhancement in composite picture where the underdoped layer provides the pairing strength while the overdoped layer promotes the phase coherence. The uncovered SC hosted by a single layer is reminiscent of our recent exploration on the trilayer Hubbard model. Our present study thus provides new insight that the SC can be enhanced via the layer differentiation.</description>

      <title>Unified Theory of Dark Count Rate and System Detection Efficiency for NbN, WSi Based Superconducting Single Photon Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting the behavior of superconducting nanowire single photon detectors (SNSPDs) is important as their use becomes more widespread in fields ranging from quantum computing to quantum remote sensing. Here, we present a vortex crossing theory of photon detection which provides a unified definition of system detection efficiency and dark count rates. Our approach quantitatively captures the plateau region of system detection efficiency for NbN and WSi based SNSPDs. We concurrently predict the temperature dependence of dark count rates and the intrinsic timing jitter of SNSPDs. We extensively benchmark our model against various experiments to aid in the design of the next generation of SNSPDs.</description>

      <title>Field-free superconducting diode effect in two-dimensional Shiba lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The superconducting diode effect (SDE) refers to non-reciprocal transport, where current flows without resistance in one direction but becomes resistive in the opposite direction, but its typical reliance on magnetic field hinders scalability and device integration. In this article, we present a theoretical framework for realizing a field-free SDE based on a two-dimensional (2D) Shiba lattice featuring a conical spin texture. Using the real-space Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) calculations, we illustrate that the conical spin configuration alone is sufficient to break the necessary inversion and time reversal symmetries, enabling nonreciprocal supercurrent flow without any external magnetic field, yielding diode efficiency exceeding 40%. Furthermore, we find that the efficiency of such a diode effect becomes strongly dependent on the direction of current flow, revealing a pronounced angular dependence that can be tuned by varying the pitches of the spin texture along the two spatial lattice directions. Our findings offer a pathway toward scalable, field-free superconducting components for non-dissipative electronics and quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Discovery of Niobium Hydride Precipitates in Superconducting Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the evidence of the formation of niobium hydride phase within niobium films on silicon substrates in superconducting qubits fabricated at Rigetti Computing. For this study, we combined complementary techniques, including room-temperature and cryogenic atomic force microscopy (AFM), synchrotron Xray diffraction, and time of flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy (ToF-SIMS), to directly reveal the existence of niobium hydride precipitates in the Rigetti chip area. Upon cryogenic cooling, we observed variation in the size and morphology of the hydrides, ranging from small (5 nm) irregular shapes to large (~10-100 nm) domain within the Nb grains, fully converted to niobium hydrides. Since niobium hydrides are non-superconducting and can easily change in size and location upon different cooldowns to cryogenic temperature, our finding highlights a new and previously unknown source of decoherence in superconducting qubits. This contributes to both quasiparticle and two level system (TLS) losses, offering a potential explanation for changes in qubit performance upon cooldowns. Finally, by leveraging the RF performance of a 3D bulk Nb resonator, we can quantify RF dissipation on a superconducting qubit, caused by hydrogen concentration variation, and are able to propose a practical engineering pathway to mitigate the formation of the Nb hydrides for superconducting qubit applications.</description>

      <title>New Materials, New Functionalities: Molecular Beam Epitaxy of Ultra-High Conductivity Oxides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding fundamental properties of materials is necessary for all modern electronic technologies. Toward this end, the fabrication of new ultrapure thin film materials is critical to discover and understand novel properties that can allow further development of technology. Oxide materials are a vast material class abound with diverse properties, and, therefore, harnessing such phases is critical for realizing emerging technologies. Pushing forward, however, requires understanding basic properties of insulating, semiconducting and metallic oxides, as well as the more complex phases that arise out of strong electronic correlations unique to this class of materials. In this review, we will focus on one of the unique aspects of oxides: the ultra-high conductivity metallic state, which can be a critical component for future all-oxide microelectronics such as low-loss interconnects and gate-metals, spintronics, as well as future quantum technologies that employ emergent magnetic or superconducting ground states. Like most oxides, a critical challenge to understanding and ultimately integrating high-conductivity metals into new technologies is the ability to synthesize high-quality materials. Therefore, we will frame the discussions in the context of epitaxial film growth via molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), which has provided insights into the electronic behavior of specific materials while providing samples with unprecedented quality. We will highlight and underscore how MBE has enabled developments and deeper understanding of their properties and how it plays a critical role in the future of this unique class of materials.</description>

      <title>Superconducting and spin-density wave phases probed by scanning tunneling spectroscopy in the organic conductor $\mathrm{(TMTSF)_{2}ClO_{4}}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11709v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) we have probed the local quasi-particle density of states (DOS) of the Bechgaard salt organic superconductor $\mathrm{(TMTSF)_{2}ClO_{4}}$ in slowly cooled single crystals cleaved under ultrahigh vacuum conditions. In well STM imaged crystallographic surface planes, the local DOS has been probed for different surface areas at temperatures above and below the critical temperature of superconducting or insulating spin-density wave states. While a rather homogeneous superconducting state is expected in the bulk from previous studies, depending on the degree of disorder introduced by cleavage in the anion lattice, an inhomogeneous granular state is predominantly observed at the surface. A pronounced linear V-shape profile of the local DOS is observed from intermediate to the lowest energy scale in the less disordered superconducting surface areas. This supports the existence of an unconventional d-wave like order parameter with nodes at low energy, which is preceded by more energetic fluctuations attributed to quantum criticality of the material. At higher energy disorder combined to correlations deplete further the DOS. By contrast a non-linear U-shape characterizes the local low energy DOS profile for the more disordered and insulating surface areas of the spin-density wave state. The experimental results are compared quantitatively with those predicted by the renormalization group theory of the quasi-one dimensional electron gas model and its description of the superconducting and spin-density wave states that are interlinked by quantum criticality in the Bechgaard salts.</description>

      <title>Hybrid magnon -- Nambu-Goldstone excitations in topological superconductor/ferromagnetic insulator thin-film heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00460v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address a previously unexplored type of dynamical proximity effect that occurs in s-wave topological superconductor/ferromagnetic insulator (TS/FI) heterostructures. It is predicted that magnons in the FI and the Nambu-Goldstone (NG) collective superconducting phase mode in the TS are coupled, forming composite magnon-NG excitations. The mechanism of this coupling is associated with the complete spin-momentum locking of electrons in the helical surface state of the TS. The strength of the magnon-NG coupling is strongly anisotropic with respect to the mutual orientation of the magnon wave vector and the equilibrium magnetization of the FI. This effect provides a mechanism for the interconversion of spin signals and the spinless signals carried by collective superconducting excitations, thereby giving new impetus to the development of superconducting spintronics.</description>

      <title>Hybrid collective excitations in topological superconductor/ferromagnetic insulator heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00499v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a linear response theory for the dynamical proximity effect in topological superconductor/ferromagnetic insulator (TS/FI) hybrid structures. Our approach combines the nonequilibrium quasiclassical Keldysh-Usadel equations for the electronic Green's functions in the TS with the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation governing the magnetization dynamics in the FI. Within this framework, we study the proximity-induced coupling between magnons and superconducting collective excitations. We find that the spin-momentum locking intrinsic to the surface state of the TS leads to a hybridization between the superconducting Nambu-Goldstone (phase) collective mode and magnons, resulting in the emergence of composite magnon-Nambu-Goldstone excitations. The dependence of the coupling strength on relevant physical parameters is analyzed both analytically and numerically. In contrast, we show that the Higgs (amplitude) mode does not couple to magnons at linear order and therefore does not participate in the formation of hybrid collective excitations.</description>

      <title>Nodal pair density waves from a quarter-metal in crystalline graphene multilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.15660v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Crystalline graphene heterostructures, namely, Bernal bilayer graphene (BBLG) and rhombohedral trilayer graphene (RTLG), for example, subject to perpendicular electric displacement fields, display a rich confluence of competing orders, resulting in a valley-degenerate, spin-polarized half-metal at moderate doping, and a spin- and valley-polarized (non-degenerate) quarter-metal at lower doping. Here we show that such a quarter-metal can be susceptible toward the nucleation of a unique spin- and valley-polarized superconducting ground state, accommodating \emph{odd-parity} (dominantly $p$ wave in BBLG and $f$ wave in RTLG) inter-layer Cooper pairs that break the translational symmetry, giving rise to a Kekul\'e (in BBLG) or columnar (in RTLG) pair density wave. Due to the trigonal warping in the normal state, the superconducting ground state produces three-fold rotationally symmetric isolated Fermi rings of normal fermions, which can manifest via linear in temperature scaling of the specific heat. We present scaling of the zero-temperature pairing amplitude and the transition temperature of such pair density wave in the presence of trigonally warped disconnected, annular, and simply connected Fermi rings in the normal state, subject to an effective attractive interaction within a mean-field approximation.</description>
