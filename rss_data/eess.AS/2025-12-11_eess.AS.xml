      <title>LG Uplus System with Multi-Speaker IDs and Discriminator-based Sub-Judges for the WildSpoof Challenge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper describes our submission to the WildSpoof Challenge Track 2, which focuses on spoof-aware speaker verification (SASV) in the presence of high-quality text-to-speech (TTS) attacks. We adopt a ResNet-221 back-bone and study two speaker-labeling strategies, namelyDual-Speaker IDs and Multi-Speaker IDs, to explicitly enlarge the margin between bona fide and generated speech in the embedding space. In addition, we propose discriminator-based sub-judge systems that reuse internal features from HiFi-GAN and BigVGAN discriminators, aggregated via multi-query multi-head attentive statistics pooling(MQMHA). Experimental results on the SpoofCeleb corpus show that our system design is effective in improving agnostic detection cost function (a-DCF).</description>

      <title>Human perception of audio deepfakes: the role of language and speaking style</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Audio deepfakes have reached a level of realism that makes it increasingly difficult to distinguish between human and artificial voices, which poses risks such as identity theft or spread of disinformation. Despite these concerns, research on humans' ability to identify deepfakes is limited, with most studies focusing on English and very few exploring the reasons behind listeners' perceptual decisions. This study addresses this gap through a perceptual experiment in which 54 listeners (28 native Spanish speakers and 26 native Japanese speakers) classified voices as natural or synthetic, and justified their choices. The experiment included 80 stimuli (50% artificial), organized according to three variables: language (Spanish/Japanese), speech style (audiobooks/interviews), and familiarity with the voice (familiar/unfamiliar). The goal was to examine how these variables influence detection and to analyze qualitatively the reasoning behind listeners' perceptual decisions. Results indicate an average accuracy of 59.11%, with higher performance on authentic samples. Judgments of vocal naturalness rely on a combination of linguistic and non-linguistic cues. Comparing Japanese and Spanish listeners, our qualitative analysis further reveals both shared cues and notable cross-linguistic differences in how listeners conceptualize the "humanness" of speech. Overall, participants relied primarily on suprasegmental and higher-level or extralinguistic characteristics - such as intonation, rhythm, fluency, pauses, speed, breathing, and laughter - over segmental features. These findings underscore the complexity of human perceptual strategies in distinguishing natural from artificial speech and align partly with prior research emphasizing the importance of prosody and phenomena typical of spontaneous speech, such as disfluencies.</description>

      <title>Robust Speech Activity Detection in the Presence of Singing Voice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speech Activity Detection (SAD) systems often misclassify singing as speech, leading to degraded performance in applications such as dialogue enhancement and automatic speech recognition. We introduce Singing-Robust Speech Activity Detection ( SR-SAD ), a neural network designed to robustly detect speech in the presence of singing. Our key contributions are: i) a training strategy using controlled ratios of speech and singing samples to improve discrimination, ii) a computationally efficient model that maintains robust performance while reducing inference runtime, and iii) a new evaluation metric tailored to assess SAD robustness in mixed speech-singing scenarios. Experiments on a challenging dataset spanning multiple musical genres show that SR-SAD maintains high speech detection accuracy (AUC = 0.919) while rejecting singing. By explicitly learning to distinguish between speech and singing, SR-SAD enables more reliable SAD in mixed speech-singing scenarios.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Automatic Speech Recognition Through Integrated Noise Detection Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This research presents a novel approach to enhancing automatic speech recognition systems by integrating noise detection capabilities directly into the recognition architecture. Building upon the wav2vec2 framework, the proposed method incorporates a dedicated noise identification module that operates concurrently with speech transcription. Experimental validation using publicly available speech and environmental audio datasets demonstrates substantial improvements in transcription quality and noise discrimination. The enhanced system achieves superior performance in word error rate, character error rate, and noise detection accuracy compared to conventional architectures. Results indicate that joint optimization of transcription and noise classification objectives yields more reliable speech recognition in challenging acoustic conditions.</description>

      <title>TinyD\'ej\`aVu: Smaller Memory Footprint &amp; Faster Inference on Sensor Data Streams with Always-On Microcontrollers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Always-on sensors are increasingly expected to embark a variety of tiny neural networks and to continuously perform inference on time-series of the data they sense. In order to fit lifetime and energy consumption requirements when operating on battery, such hardware uses microcontrollers (MCUs) with tiny memory budget e.g., 128kB of RAM. In this context, optimizing data flows across neural network layers becomes crucial. In this paper, we introduce TinyD\'ej\`aVu, a new framework and novel algorithms we designed to drastically reduce the RAM footprint required by inference using various tiny ML models for sensor data time-series on typical microcontroller hardware. We publish the implementation of TinyD\'ej\`aVu as open source, and we perform reproducible benchmarks on hardware. We show that TinyD\'ej\`aVu can save more than 60% of RAM usage and eliminate up to 90% of redundant compute on overlapping sliding window inputs.</description>

      <title>SEAL: Speech Embedding Alignment Learning for Speech Large Language Model with Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02603v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Embedding-based retrieval models have made significant strides in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques for text and multimodal large language models (LLMs) applications. However, when it comes to speech larage language models (SLLMs), these methods are limited to a two-stage process, where automatic speech recognition (ASR) is combined with text-based retrieval. This sequential architecture suffers from high latency and error propagation. To address these limitations, we propose a unified embedding framework that eliminates the need for intermediate text representations. Specifically, the framework includes separate speech and text encoders, followed by a shared scaling layer that maps both modalities into a common embedding space. Our model reduces pipeline latency by 50\% while achieving higher retrieval accuracy compared to traditional two-stage methods. We also provide a theoretical analysis of the challenges inherent in end-to-end speech retrieval and introduce architectural principles for effective speech-to-document matching. Extensive experiments demonstrate the robustness of our approach across diverse acoustic conditions and speaker variations, paving the way for a new paradigm in multimodal SLLMs retrieval systems.</description>

      <title>A Low-Complexity Speech Codec Using Parametric Dithering for ASR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00511v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dithering is a technique commonly used to improve the perceptual quality of lossy data compression. In this work, we analytically and experimentally justify the use of dithering for ASR input compression. We formalize an understanding of optimal ASR performance under lossy input compression and leverage this to propose a parametric dithering technique for a low-complexity speech compression pipeline. The method performs well at 1-bit resolution, showing a 25\% relative CER improvement, while also demonstrating improvements of 32.4\% and 33.5\% at 2- and 3-bit resolution, respectively, with our second dither choice yielding a reduced data rate. The proposed codec is adaptable to meet performance targets or stay within entropy constraints.</description>

      <title>Point Neuron Learning: A New Physics-Informed Neural Network Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16969v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning and neural networks have advanced numerous research domains, but challenges such as large training data requirements and inconsistent model performance hinder their application in certain scientific problems. To overcome these challenges, researchers have investigated integrating physics principles into machine learning models, mainly through: (i) physics-guided loss functions, generally termed as physics-informed neural networks, and (ii) physics-guided architectural design. While both approaches have demonstrated success across multiple scientific disciplines, they have limitations including being trapped to a local minimum, poor interpretability, and restricted generalizability. This paper proposes a new physics-informed neural network (PINN) architecture that combines the strengths of both approaches by embedding the fundamental solution of the wave equation into the network architecture, enabling the learned model to strictly satisfy the wave equation. The proposed point neuron learning method can model an arbitrary sound field based on microphone observations without any dataset. Compared to other PINN methods, our approach directly processes complex numbers and offers better interpretability and generalizability. We evaluate the versatility of the proposed architecture by a sound field reconstruction problem in a reverberant environment. Results indicate that the point neuron method outperforms two competing methods and can efficiently handle noisy environments with sparse microphone observations.</description>

      <title>CardioLive: Empowering Video Streaming with Online Cardiac Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00702v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Online Cardiac Monitoring (OCM) emerges as a compelling enhancement for the next-generation video streaming platforms. It enables various applications including remote health, online affective computing, and deepfake detection. Yet the physiological information encapsulated in the video streams has been long neglected. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of CardioLive, the first online cardiac monitoring system in video streaming platforms. We leverage the naturally co-existed video and audio streams and devise CardioNet, the first audio-visual network to learn the cardiac series. It incorporates multiple unique designs to extract temporal and spectral features, ensuring robust performance under realistic video streaming conditions. To enable the Service-On-Demand online cardiac monitoring, we implement CardioLive as a plug-and-play middleware service and develop systematic solutions to practical issues including changing FPS and unsynchronized streams. Extensive experiments have been done to demonstrate the effectiveness of our system. We achieve a Mean Square Error (MAE) of 1.79 BPM error, outperforming the video-only and audio-only solutions by 69.2% and 81.2%, respectively. Our CardioLive service achieves average throughputs of 115.97 and 98.16 FPS when implemented in Zoom and YouTube. We believe our work opens up new applications for video stream systems. We will release the code soon.</description>

      <title>MACS: Multi-source Audio-to-image Generation with Contextual Significance and Semantic Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10287v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Propelled by the breakthrough in deep generative models, audio-to-image generation has emerged as a pivotal cross-modal task that converts complex auditory signals into rich visual representations. However, previous works only focus on single-source audio inputs for image generation, ignoring the multi-source characteristic in natural auditory scenes, thus limiting the performance in generating comprehensive visual content. To bridge this gap, we propose a method called MACS to conduct multi-source audio-to-image generation. To our best knowledge, this is the first work that explicitly separates multi-source audio to capture the rich audio components before image generation. MACS is a two-stage method. In the first stage, multi-source audio inputs are separated by a weakly supervised method, where the audio and text labels are semantically aligned by casting into a common space using the large pre-trained CLAP model. We introduce a ranking loss to consider the contextual significance of the separated audio signals. In the second stage, effective image generation is achieved by mapping the separated audio signals to the generation condition using only a trainable adapter and a MLP layer. We preprocess the LLP dataset as the first full multi-source audio-to-image generation benchmark. The experiments are conducted on multi-source, mixed-source, and single-source audio-to-image generation tasks. The proposed MACS outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods in 17 out of the 21 evaluation indexes on all tasks and delivers superior visual quality.</description>

      <title>MambAttention: Mamba with Multi-Head Attention for Generalizable Single-Channel Speech Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00966v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With new sequence models like Mamba and xLSTM, several studies have shown that these models match or outperform the state-of-the-art in single-channel speech enhancement and audio representation learning. However, prior research has demonstrated that sequence models like LSTM and Mamba tend to overfit to the training set. To address this, previous works have shown that adding self-attention to LSTMs substantially improves generalization performance for single-channel speech enhancement. Nevertheless, neither the concept of hybrid Mamba and time-frequency attention models nor their generalization performance have been explored for speech enhancement. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid architecture, MambAttention, which combines Mamba and shared time- and frequency-multi-head attention modules for generalizable single-channel speech enhancement. To train our model, we introduce VB-DemandEx, a dataset inspired by VoiceBank+Demand but with more challenging noise types and lower signal-to-noise ratios. Trained on VB-DemandEx, MambAttention significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art discriminative LSTM-, xLSTM-, Mamba-, and Conformer-based systems of similar complexity across all reported metrics on two out-of-domain datasets: DNS 2020 without reverberation and EARS-WHAM_v2. MambAttention also matches or outperforms generative diffusion models in generalization performance while being competitive with language model baselines. Ablation studies highlight the importance of weight sharing between time- and frequency-multi-head attention modules for generalization performance. Finally, we explore integrating the shared time- and frequency-multi-head attention modules with LSTM and xLSTM, which yields a notable performance improvement on the out-of-domain datasets. Yet, MambAttention remains superior for cross-corpus generalization across all reported evaluation metrics.</description>

      <title>Open ASR Leaderboard: Towards Reproducible and Transparent Multilingual Speech Recognition Evaluation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06961v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite rapid progress, ASR evaluation remains saturated with short-form English, and efficiency is rarely reported. We present the Open ASR Leaderboard, a fully reproducible benchmark and interactive leaderboard comparing 60+ open-source and proprietary systems across 11 datasets, including a dedicated multilingual track. We standardize text normalization and report both word error rate (WER) and inverse real-time factor (RTFx), enabling fair accuracy-efficiency comparisons. For English transcription, Conformer encoders paired with LLM decoders achieve the best average WER but are slower, while CTC and TDT decoders deliver much better RTFx, making them attractive for long-form and offline use. Whisper-derived encoders fine-tuned for English improve accuracy but often trade off multilingual coverage. All code and dataset loaders are open-sourced to support transparent, extensible evaluation.</description>
