      <title>Online Graph Coloring for $k$-Colorable Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of online graph coloring for $k$-colorable graphs. The best previously known deterministic algorithm uses $\tilde{O}(n^{1-1/k!})$ colors for general $k$ and $\tilde{O}(n^{5/6})$ colors for $k = 4$, both given by Kierstead in 1998. In this paper, nearly thirty years later, we have finally made progress. Our results are summarized as follows:
  (1) $k \geq 5$ case. We provide a deterministic online algorithm to color $k$-colorable graphs with $\tilde{O}(n^{1-2/(k(k-1))})$ colors, significantly improving the current upper bound of $\tilde{O}(n^{1-1/k!})$
  (2) $k = 4$ case. We provide a deterministic online algorithm to color $4$-colorable graphs with $\tilde{O}(n^{14/17})$ colors, improving the current upper bound of $\tilde{O}(n^{5/6})$ colors.
  (3) $k = 2$ case. We show that for randomized algorithms, the upper bound is $1.034 \log_2 n + O(1)$ colors and the lower bound is $\frac{91}{96} \log_2 n - O(1)$ colors. This means that we close the gap to $1.09\mathrm{x}$.
  With our algorithm for the $k \geq 5$ case, we also obtain a deterministic online algorithm for graph coloring that achieves a competitive ratio of $O(n / \log \log n)$, which improves the best known result of $O(n \log \log \log n / \log \log n)$ by Kierstead.
  For the bipartite graph case ($k = 2$), the limit of online deterministic algorithms is known: any deterministic algorithm requires $2 \log_2 n - O(1)$ colors. Our results imply that randomized algorithms can perform slightly better but still have a limit.</description>

      <title>Block-Separated Overpartitions and Their Fibonacci-Type Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study a new restricted family of overpartitions, called block-separated overpartitions, in which no two consecutive distinct part-size blocks may both be overlined. Using a two-state transfer-matrix automaton, we derive a closed matrix-product expression for the ordinary generating function, establish an Euler-type factorization, and obtain an explicit normalized recurrence suitable for computation of arbitrary coefficients. We further prove that the possible overlining patterns on the distinct blocks are counted by Fibonacci numbers, giving natural bijections with independent sets on paths, pattern-avoiding binary words, and Fibonacci tilings.</description>

      <title>Finding happiness by evolutionary algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20934v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A recent line of research concerns the problem of soft happy colouring (SHC), which requires that a partially coloured graph be extended to a complete colouring to maximise local agreements, so that as many vertices as possible end up surrounded by enough same-coloured neighbours. It is already known that SHC is NP-hard, and its solutions have a direct relationship with the community structure of networks; thus, it has immense applications in security and resilience. Past studies have shown that local search approaches can be fast and effective to an extent on the SHC; however, they often get stuck in local optima. Regarding the related problem of maximising happy vertices, evolutionary approaches have been proven effective; hence, this study develops a customised memetic algorithm that is a hybrid of genetic algorithms and local search. The experimental evaluation on a range of graphs in the stochastic block model shows that the memetic algorithm can achieve excellent results in search for an optimised solution to SHC compared to the local search approaches and standard genetic algorithms. Moreover, learning and evolution in the memetic algorithm allow diversification of solutions generated by fast, effective local search approaches, which prove superior for the challenging problem of community detection.</description>

      <title>Random Abstract Cell Complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01999v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define a model for random (abstract) cell complexes (CCs), similiar to the well-known Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi model for graphs and its extensions for simplicial complexes. To build a random cell complex, we first draw from an Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graph, and consecutively augment the graph with cells for each dimension with a specified probability. As the number of possible cells increases combinatorially -- e.g., 2-cells can be represented as cycles, or permutations -- we derive an approximate sampling algorithm for this model limited to two-dimensional abstract cell complexes. As a basis for this algorithm, we first introduce a spanning-tree-based method that samples simple cycles and allows the efficient approximation of various properties, most notably the probability of occurence of a given cycle. This approximation is of independent interest as it enables the approximation of a wide variety of cycle-related graph statistics using importance sampling. We use this to approximate the number of cycles of a given length on a graph, allowing us to calculate the sampling probability to arrive at a desired expected number of sampled 2-cells. The probability approximation also trivially leads to a sampling algorithm for $2$-cells with a desired sampling probability. We provide some initial analysis into the properties of random CCs drawn from this model. We further showcase practical applications for our random CCs as null models, and in the context of (random) liftings of graphs to cell complexes. The cycle sampling, cycle count estimation, and combined cell sampling algorithms are available in the package `py-raccoon` on the Python Packaging Index.</description>

      <title>Renaming in distributed certification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15404v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Local certification is the area of distributed network computing asking the following question: How to certify to the nodes of a network that a global property holds, if they are limited to a local verification?
  In this area, it is often essential to have identifiers, that is, unique integers assigned to the nodes. In this short paper, we show how to reduce the range of the identifiers, in three different settings. More precisely, we show how to rename identifiers in the classical local certification setting, when we can (resp.\ cannot) choose the new identifiers, and we show how a global certificate can help to encode very compactly a new identifier assignment that is not injective in general, but still useful in applications.
  We conclude with a number of applications of these results: For every $\ell$, there are local certification schemes for the properties of having clique number at most $\ell$, having diameter at most $\ell$, and having independence number at most~2, with certificates of size $O(n)$. We also show that there is a global certification scheme for bipartiteness with a certificate of size $O(n)$. All these results are optimal.</description>

      <title>Zoo of Centralities: Encyclopedia of Node Metrics in Complex Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05122v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Centrality is a fundamental concept in network science, providing critical insights into the structure and dynamics of complex systems such as social, transportation, biological and financial networks. Despite its extensive use, there is no universally accepted definition of centrality, leading to the development of a large variety of distinct centrality measures. These measures have grown so numerous that they resemble a 'zoo', each representing a unique approach to capturing node importance within a network. However, the increasing number of metrics being developed has led to several challenges, including issues of discoverability, redundancy, naming conflicts, validation and accessibility. This work aims to address these challenges by providing a comprehensive catalog of over 400 centrality measures, along with clear descriptions and references to original sources. While not exhaustive, this compilation represents the most extensive and systematic effort to date in organizing and presenting centrality measures. We also encourage readers to explore and contribute to the Centrality Zoo website at https://centralityzoo.github.io/, which provides an interactive platform for discovering and comparing centrality measures.</description>
