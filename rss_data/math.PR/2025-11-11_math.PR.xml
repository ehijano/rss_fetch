      <title>Coupling Invasion and First Passage Percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that a continuous first order phase transition in Bernoulli bond percolation on the integer lattice is equivalent to a vanishing probability a vertex is invaded in invasion percolation. We provide a coupling between invasion percolation and first passage percolation with log-uniform passage times, giving a new equivalent condition.</description>

      <title>Product-Form Distribution and Reversibility of Inhomogeneous Symmetric Simple Exclusion Process with Open Boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an inhomogeneous symmetric simple exclusion process on a one-dimensional lattice with open boundary conditions. The time scale is continuous. Particles of different types arrive to the utmost left and the utmost right site. If a particle is in a site that is neither the utmost left site nor the utmost right site, then the particle moves onto one site to the left or to the right. If a particle is either in the utmost left site or the utmost right site, then the particle leaves the system or moves onto one cell to the right or to the left, respectively. An arrival or a transfer of particle is possible only to a vacant site. The rate of arrival, exit or movement of a particle depends on its type and does not depend on the site from that the particle arrives or exits and on the direction the movement. The stationary distribution of the system states probabilities has been found. This distribution turns out to be multiplicative in the sense that the probability of the site state does not depend on the states of the other sites in the stationary mode, and the steady probability of any state of the system is equal to the product of the site states steady probabilities, and the probability of site ocupancy is the same as the server occupancy probability for M/G/1/0 loss system. We have found the arrival rate and the average sojourn time have been found. We have proved the reversibility of the process in time under the additional condition that the rate of arrival of a particle of prescribed type is equal to the rate of this type particle departure.</description>

      <title>Brownian motion and stochastic areas on complex partial flag manifolds with blocks of equal size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a Brownian motion on complex partial flag manifolds with blocks of equal size as a matrix-valued diffusion from a Brownian motion on the unitary group. This construction leads to an explicit expression for the characteristic function of the joint distribution of the stochastic areas on these manifolds. The limit law of these stochastic areas is shown to be a multivariate Cauchy distribution with independent and identically distributed entries. By relating the area functionals on flag manifolds to the winding functional on the complex Stiefel manifold, we establish new results about simultaneous Brownian windings on the complex Stiefel manifold. To establish these results, this work introduces a new family of diffusions, which generalise both the Jacobi processes on the simplex and the Hermitian Jacobi processes.</description>

      <title>The Schr\"odinger Bridge Problem for Jump Diffusions with Regime Switching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Schr\"odinger bridge problem (SBP) aims at finding the measure $\hat{\mathbf{P}}$ on a certain path space which possesses the desired state-space distributions $\rho_0$ at time $0$ and $\rho_T$ at time $T$ while minimizing the KL divergence from a reference path measure $\mathbf{R}$. This work focuses on the SBP in the case when $\mathbf{R}$ is the path measure of a jump diffusion with regime switching, which is a Markov process that combines the dynamics of a jump diffusion with interspersed discrete events representing changing environmental states. To the best of our knowledge, the SBP in such a setting has not been previously studied.
  In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the dynamics of the SBP solution $\hat{\mathbf{P}}$ in the regime-switching jump-diffusion setting. In particular, we show that $\hat{\mathbf{P}}$ is again a path measure of a regime-switching jump diffusion; under proper assumptions, we establish various properties of $\hat{\mathbf{P}}$ from both a stochastic calculus perspective and an analytic viewpoint. In addition, as an demonstration of the general theory developed in this work, we examine a concrete unbalanced SBP (uSBP) from the angle of a regime-switching SBP, where we also obtain novel results in the realm of uSBP.</description>

      <title>Lower bounds on non-random fluctuations in planar first passage percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fluctuations of the passage time in first passage percolation are of great interest. We show that the non-random fluctuations in planar FPP are at least of order $\log(n)^\alpha$ for any $\alpha&lt;1/2$ under some conditions that are known to be met for a large class of absolutely continuous edge weight distributions. This improves the ${\log(\log(n))}$ bound proven by Nakajima and is the first result showing divergence of the fluctuations for arbitrary directions.
  Our proof is an application of recent work by Dembin, Elboim and Peled on the BKS midpoint problem and the development of Mermin-Wagner type estimates.</description>

      <title>Central limit theorem for high temperature Ising models via martingale embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use martingale embeddings to prove a central limit theorem (CLT) for projections of high-dimensional random vectors satisfying a Poincar\'e inequality. We obtain a non-asymptotic error bound for the CLT in 2-Wasserstein distance involving two-point and three-point covariances. We present two illustrative applications to Ising models: one with finite-range interactions and the other in the ferromagnetic case under the Dobrushin condition.</description>

      <title>Torus scaling limits and the plateau of the critical weakly coupled $|\varphi|^4$ model in $d \ge 4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $n$-component weakly coupled $|\varphi|^4$ model on the $\Z^d$ lattice ($d\ge 4$) exhibits a critical two-point correlation function with an exact polynomial decay in infinite volume, regardless of whether the interaction is short- or long-range. This paper presents a rigorous analysis of the system in both $\Z^d$ and a finite-volume torus. In a torus, we prove the existence of a plateau effect, where the correlation function undergoes a crossover from the polynomial decay to a uniform constant state.
  We then establish the precise scaling limit picture that provides a complementary description of this crossover. As immediate consequences, we verify the finite-size scaling limit predicted by Zinn-Justin, the finite-size scaling exponents (qoppas) suggested by Kenna and Berche and the role of the Fourier modes in finite-size scaling suggested by Flores-Sola, Berche, Kenna and Weigel. The proofs use the renormalisation group map constructed in the author's previous work.</description>

      <title>Upper bounds for the L^q empirical process via generic chaining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the generic chaining method, we derive upper bounds for the \(L^q\) process of sub-Gaussian classes when \(1 \le q \le 2\), thereby resolving an open problem posed by Al-Ghattas, Chen, and Sanz-Alonso in arXiv:2502.16916. Combined with the results of arXiv:2502.16916, this yields upper bounds for the \(L^q\) process for all \(1 \le q &lt; \infty\). We also present corollaries of this result in the geometry of Banach spaces, including high-probability bounds on the \(\ell_q\) norm diameter of random hyperplane sections of convex bodies where the subspaces are not necessarily uniformly distributed on the Grassmannian manifold and the restricted isomorphic property for \(\ell_q\) norm.</description>

      <title>Non-uniform Edgeworth expansions for weakly dependent random variables and their applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain non-uniform Edgeworth expansions for several classes of weakly dependent (non-stationary) sequences of random variables, including uniformly elliptic inhomogeneous Markov chains, random and time-varying (partially) hyperbolic or expanding dynamical systems, products of random matrices and some classes of local statistics. To the best of our knowledge this is the first time such results are obtained beyond the case of independent summands, even for stationary sequences. As an application of the non uniform expansions we obtain average versions of Edgeworth exapnsions, which provide estimates of the underlying distribution function in $L^p(dx)$ by the standard normal distribution function and its higher order corrections. An additional application is to expansions of expectations $\bbE[h(S_n)]$ of functions $h$ of the underlying sequence $S_n$, whose derivatives grow at most polynomially fast. In particular we provide expansions of the moments of $S_n$ by means the variance of $S_n$. A third application is to Edgeworth expansions in the Wasserstein distance (transport distance). In particular we prove Berry-Esseen theorems in the Wasserstein metrics. This paper compliments \cite{NonU BE} where non-uniform Berry-Esseen theorems were obtained.</description>

      <title>On the well-posedness of space-time fractional SPDEs with locally Lipschitz coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study the space-time SPDE
  $$ \partial_t^\beta u=-(-\Delta)^{\alpha/2} u+I_t^{1-\beta}[b(u)+\sigma(u)\dot{W}],$$
  where $u=u(t,x)$ is defined for $(t,x)\in\mathbb{R}_+\times \mathbb{R},$ $\beta\in(0,1), \alpha\in(0,2)$ and $\dot{W}$ denotes a space-time white noise.
  It has long been conjectured that this equation has a unique solution with finite moments under the minimal assumptions of locally Lipschitz coefficients $b$ and $\sigma$ with linear growth.
  We prove that this SPDE is well-posed under the assumptions that the initial condition $u_0$ is bounded and measurable, and the functions $b$ and $\sigma$ are locally Lipschitz and have at-most linear growth and some conditions on the Lipschitz constants on the truncated versions of $b$ and $\sigma$. Our results generalize the work of Foondun et al.(2025) to a space-time fractional setting.</description>

      <title>Lecture notes on flow equation approach to singular stochastic PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The flow equation approach is a robust framework applicable to a broad class of singular SPDEs, including those with fractional Laplacians, throughout the entire subcritical regime. Inspired by Wilson's renormalization group, this method studies the coarse-grained process, which captures the behaviour of solutions across spatial scales. The corresponding flow equation describes how the nonlinear terms in the effective dynamics evolve with the coarse-graining scale, playing a role analogous to the Polchinski equation in quantum field theory. The renormalization problem is then solved inductively by imposing appropriate boundary conditions on the flow equation.</description>

      <title>Mean-field backward stochastic Volterra integral equations: well-posedness and related particle system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the mean-field backward stochastic Volterra integral equations (mean-field BSVIEs) and associated particle systems. We establish the existence and uniqueness of solutions to mean-field BSVIEs when the generator $g$ is of linear growth or quadratic growth with respect to $Z$, respectively. Moreover, the propagation of chaos is analyzed for the corresponding particle systems under two conditions. When $g$ is of linear growth in $Z$, the convergence rate is proven to be of order $\mathscr{Q}(N)$. When $g$ is of quadratic growth in $Z$ and is independent of the law of $Z$, we not only establish the convergence of the particle systems but also derive a convergence rate of order $\mathscr{O}(N^{-\frac{1}{2\lambda}})$, where $\lambda&gt;1$.</description>

      <title>A Double Secretary Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a double secretary problem which contains $2n$ applicants of $n$ different qualities, two of each quality. As in the classical secretary problem (CSP), the applicants are interviewed sequentially in a random order by a manager and the manager wants to find an optimal stopping rule that maximizes the probability of selecting one of the two best applicants. We prove that the problem leads to a monotone structure and so the corresponding one-stage look-ahead rule (which is of threshold type) is optimal. The limiting behavior of the rule and of the maximum probability are studied and compared with that of the CSP.</description>

      <title>Decoupling of clusters in independent sets in a percolated hypercube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Independent sets in graphs are sets of vertices containing no neighbors, and they represent a canonical spin system with hardcore constraints. Of particular interest is the setting of the boolean hypercube, where counting independent sets was the original motivator for Sapozhenko's famous graph container method. A modern perspective on such problems is to consider the effect of disorder, and the study of independent sets in random subgraphs of the hypercube obtained via bond percolation with parameter $p$ was initiated by Kronenberg and Spinka. They employed tools from statistical mechanics to obtain detailed information about the moments of the number of independent sets (now a random variable), and posed many interesting questions. Previous work by the authors addressed many of these questions in the regime $p \geq \frac{2}{3}$, where the behavior is relatively simple and can be modeled well by a related family of independent particles.
  As $p$ decreases, though, typical independent sets become larger and feature more intricate clustering behavior. In the present article we overcome many of the challenges presented by this phenomenon and analyze the model for all $p&gt; 0.465$. We obtain a sharp in-probability approximation for the number of independent sets in the percolated hypercube in terms of explicit random variables, as well as provide a sampling algorithm. Note that this shows, curiously, that $p = \frac{1}{2}$ is not a natural barrier for this problem unlike in many other problems where it appears as a point of a phase transition. A key contribution of this work is the introduction of a new probabilistic framework to handle the clustering behavior for these low values of $p$. Although our analysis is restricted to $p &gt; 0.465$, our arguments are expected to be helpful for studying this model at even lower values of $p$, and possibly for other related problems.</description>

Abstract: We study the problem of worst case regret in piecewise stationary multi armed bandits. While the minimax theory for stationary bandits is well established, understanding analogous limits in time-varying settings is challenging. Existing lower bounds rely on what we refer to as infrequent sampling arguments, where long intervals without exploration allow adversarial reward changes that induce large regret.
  In this paper, we introduce a fundamentally different approach based on a belief inertia argument. Our analysis captures how an algorithm's empirical beliefs, encoded through historical reward averages, create momentum that resists new evidence after a change. We show how this inertia can be exploited to construct adversarial instances that mislead classical algorithms such as Explore Then Commit, epsilon greedy, and UCB, causing them to suffer regret that grows linearly with T and with a substantial constant factor, regardless of how their parameters are tuned, even with a single change point.
  We extend the analysis to algorithms that periodically restart to handle non stationarity and prove that, even then, the worst case regret remains linear in T. Our results indicate that utilizing belief inertia can be a powerful method for deriving sharp lower bounds in non stationary bandits.</description>

      <title>The Algorithmic Phase Transition in Symmetric Correlated Spiked Wigner Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the computational task of detecting and estimating correlated signals in a pair of spiked Wigner matrices. Our model consists of observations
  $$
  X = \tfrac{\lambda}{\sqrt{n}} xx^{\top} + W \,, \quad Y = \tfrac{\mu}{\sqrt{n}} yy^{\top} + Z \,.
  $$
  where $x,y \in \mathbb R^n$ are signal vectors with norm $\|x\|,\|y\| \approx\sqrt{n}$ and correlation $\langle x,y \rangle \approx \rho\|x\|\|y\|$, while $W,Z$ are independent Gaussian noise matrices. We propose an efficient algorithm that succeeds whenever $F(\lambda,\mu,\rho)&gt;1$, where
  $$
  F(\lambda,\mu,\rho)=\max\Big\{ \lambda,\mu, \frac{ \lambda^2 \rho^2 }{ 1-\lambda^2+\lambda^2 \rho^2 } + \frac{ \mu^2 \rho^2 }{ 1-\mu^2+\mu^2 \rho^2 } \Big\} \,.
  $$
  Our result shows that an algorithm can leverage the correlation between the spikes to detect and estimate the signals even in regimes where efficiently recovering either $x$ from $X$ alone or $y$ from $Y$ alone is believed to be computationally infeasible.
  We complement our algorithmic result with evidence for a matching computational lower bound. In particular, we prove that when $F(\lambda,\mu,\rho)&lt;1$, all algorithms based on {\em low-degree polynomials} fails to distinguish $(X,Y)$ with two independent Wigner matrices. This low-degree analysis strongly suggests that $F(\lambda,\mu,\rho)=1$ is the precise computation threshold for this problem.</description>

      <title>Fair Allocation of Indivisible Goods with Variable Groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the fair allocation of indivisible goods with variable groups. In this model, the goal is to partition the agents into groups of given sizes and allocate the goods to the groups in a fair manner. We show that for any number of groups and corresponding sizes, there always exists an envy-free up to one good (EF1) outcome, thereby generalizing an important result from the individual setting. Our result holds for arbitrary monotonic utilities and comes with an efficient algorithm. We also prove that an EF1 outcome is guaranteed to exist even when the goods lie on a path and each group must receive a connected bundle. In addition, we consider a probabilistic model where the utilities are additive and drawn randomly from a distribution. We show that if there are $n$ agents, the number of goods $m$ is divisible by the number of groups $k$, and all groups have the same size, then an envy-free outcome exists with high probability if $m = \omega(\log n)$, and this bound is tight. On the other hand, if $m$ is not divisible by $k$, then an envy-free outcome is unlikely to exist as long as $m = o(\sqrt{n})$.</description>

      <title>Harmonic functions on Tutte's embeddings and linearized Monge-Amp\`ere equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove convergence of solutions of Dirichlet problems and Green's functions on Tutte's harmonic embeddings to those of the linearized Monge-Amp\`ere equation $\mathcal{L}_\varphi h=0$. The potential $\varphi$ appears as the limit of piecewise linear potentials associated with the embeddings and the only assumption that we use is the uniform convexity of $\varphi$. Even if $\varphi$ is quadratic, this setup significantly generalizes known results for discrete harmonic functions on orthodiagonal tilings. Motivated by potential applications to the analysis of 2d lattice models on irregular graphs, we also study the situation in which the limits are harmonic in a different complex structure.</description>

      <title>Average Winding Number for Determinantal Curves associated to 2-Matrix Models in the Class AIII</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To classify one-dimensional disordered quantum systems with chiral symmetry, we analyse the winding number of the determinant of a parametrized non-Hermitian random matrix field over the unit circle modelling the off-diagonal block of a disordered chiral Hamiltonian. The associated partition function is computed explicitly for a broad class of additive two-matrix models extending beyond the Ginibre Unitary Ensemble. In the large-dimension limit, we derive an asymptotic expansion of the average winding number whose leading term exhibits universal features, up to the tail behaviour of the underlying random matrix ensemble, and identify a new correction term absent in the previously studied Ginibre case.</description>

      <title>Convergence of Actor-Critic Learning for Mean Field Games and Mean Field Control in Continuous Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish the convergence of the deep actor-critic reinforcement learning algorithm presented in [Angiuli et al., 2023a] in the setting of continuous state and action spaces with an infinite discrete-time horizon. This algorithm provides solutions to Mean Field Game (MFG) or Mean Field Control (MFC) problems depending on the ratio between two learning rates: one for the value function and the other for the mean field term. In the MFC case, to rigorously identify the limit, we introduce a discretization of the state and action spaces, following the approach used in the finite-space case in [Angiuli et al., 2023b]. The convergence proofs rely on a generalization of the two-timescale framework introduced in [Borkar, 1997]. We further extend our convergence results to Mean Field Control Games, which involve locally cooperative and globally competitive populations. Finally, we present numerical experiments for linear-quadratic problems in one and two dimensions, for which explicit solutions are available.</description>

      <title>Transformed Fr\'echet Means for Robust Estimation in Hadamard Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish finite-sample error bounds in expectation for transformed Fr\'echet means in Hadamard spaces under minimal assumptions. Transformed Fr\'echet means provide a unifying framework encompassing classical and robust notions of central tendency in metric spaces. Instead of minimizing squared distances as for the classical 2-Fr\'echet mean, we consider transformations of the distance that are nondecreasing, convex, and have a concave derivative. This class spans a continuum between median and classical mean. It includes the Fr\'echet median, power Fr\'echet means, and the (pseudo-)Huber mean, among others. We obtain the parametric rate of convergence under fewer than two moments and a subclass of estimators exhibits a breakdown point of 1/2. Our results apply in general Hadamard spaces-including infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces and nonpositively curved geometries-and yield new insights even in Euclidean settings.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Thermodynamic Formalism: Mean-field Phase Transitions, Large Deviations and Bogoliubov's Variational Principle</title>

Abstract: Let $\Omega =\{1,2,\ldots ,d\}^{\mathbb{N}}$, $T$ be the shift acting on $\Omega $, $\mathcal{P}(T)$ the set of $T$-invariant probabilities. Given a H\"{o}lder potential $A$ and a continuous function $F$, we investigate the probabilities $\rho _{F,A}$ that are maximizers of the nonlinear pressure
  $\mathfrak{P}_{F,A}:=\sup_{\rho \in \mathcal{P}(T)}\{ F(\int A(x)\rho (\mathrm{d}x))+h(\rho )\} .$
  $\rho _{F,A}$} is called a nonlinear equilibrium; a nonlinear phase transition occurs when there is more than one. In the case $F$\ is convex or concave, we combine Varadhan's lemma and Bogoliubov's variational principle to characterize them via the linear pressure problem and self-consistency conditions. Let $\mu \in \mathcal{P}(T)$ be the maximal entropy measure, $\varphi _{n}(x)=n^{-1}(\varphi (x)+\varphi (T(x))+\cdots +\varphi (T^{n-1}(x)))$ and $\beta &gt;0$.}\newline
  (I) We also consider the limit measure $\mathfrak{m}$ on $ \Omega $, so that $\forall \psi \in C(\Omega )$,
  $\int \psi (x)\,\mathfrak{m}\,( \mathrm{d}x)\,\,=\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty }\frac{\,\int \,\psi (x)\,\,\,e^{ \frac{\beta n}{2}\,\,A_{n}((x)^{2}}\,\,\mu \,(\mathrm{d}x)\,}{\int e^{\frac{ \beta n}{2}\,\,A_{n}((x)^{2}}\mu \,(\mathrm{d}x)\,\,}.$
  We call $\mathfrak{m}$ a \textit{quadratic mean-field Gibbs probability
  (II) Via subsequences $n_{k}$, $k\in \mathbb{N}$, we study the limit measure $\mathfrak{M}$ on $\Omega $, so that $\forall \psi \in C(\Omega )$,
  $\int \psi (x)\mathfrak{M}(\mathrm{d} x)=\lim_{k\rightarrow \infty }\frac{\,\int \psi _{n_{k}}(x)e^{\frac{\beta n_{k}}{2}A_{n_{k}}(x)^{2}}\mu (\mathrm{d}x)}{\int e^{\frac{\beta n_{k}}{2} A_{n_{k}}(x)^{2}}\mu (\mathrm{d}x)}.$
  We call $\mathfrak{M}$ a quadratic mean-field equilibrium probability; it is shift-invariant.

Abstract: We study the focusing $L^2$-critical and supercritical stochastic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation subject to additive or multiplicative noise. We investigate global or long time behavior of solutions in $H^1$, which would correspond to global well-posedness in the deterministic case, with either deterministic or random initial data, and establish quantitative information about the well-posedness time, its probability and bounds on the solution in both cases. We then give criteria for finite time blow-up with positive probability for an $H^1$-valued initial data with positive energy in both cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.07270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In differential privacy, statistics of a sensitive dataset are privatized by introducing random noise. Most privacy analyses provide privacy bounds specifying a noise level sufficient to achieve a target privacy guarantee. Sometimes, these bounds are pessimistic and suggest adding excessive noise, which overwhelms the meaningful signal. It remains unclear if such high noise levels are truly necessary or a limitation of the proof techniques. This paper explores whether we can obtain sharp privacy characterizations that identify the smallest noise level required to achieve a target privacy level for a given mechanism. We study this problem in the context of differentially private principal component analysis, where the goal is to privatize the leading principal components (PCs) of a dataset with n samples and p features. We analyze the exponential mechanism for this problem in a model-free setting and provide sharp utility and privacy characterizations in the high-dimensional limit ($p\rightarrow\infty$). Our privacy result shows that, in high dimensions, detecting the presence of a target individual in the dataset using the privatized PCs is exactly as hard as distinguishing two Gaussians with slightly different means, where the mean difference depends on certain spectral properties of the dataset. Our privacy analysis combines the hypothesis-testing formulation of privacy guarantees proposed by Dong, Roth, and Su (2022) with classical contiguity arguments due to Le Cam to obtain sharp high-dimensional privacy characterizations.</description>

Abstract: In \cite{Cha1}, the leading order term of the free energy of $\text{U(N)}$ lattice Yang-Mills theory in $\Lambda_n=\{0,\ldots,n\}^d\subset \mathbb{Z}^d$ was determined, for every $N\geq 1$ and $d\geq 2$. The formula is explicit apart from a contribution $K_d$ which corresponds to the limiting free energy of lattice Maxwell theory with boundary conditions induced by the axial gauge. By suitably adjusting the boundary conditions, we provide an equivalent characterization of $K_d$ that admits its explicit computation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.12145v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper derives normal approximation results for subgraph counts written as multiparameter stochastic integrals in a random-connection model based on a Poisson point process. By combinatorial arguments we express the cumulants of general subgraph counts using sums over connected partition diagrams, after cancellation of terms obtained by M\"obius inversion. Using the Statulevi\v{c}ius condition, we deduce convergence rates in the Kolmogorov distance by studying the growth of subgraph count cumulants as the intensity of the underlying Poisson point process tends to infinity. Our analysis covers general subgraphs in the dilute and full random graph regimes, and tree-like subgraphs in the sparse random graph regime.</description>

Abstract: We discuss the equivalence of definitions for conditional Poisson processes, Cox processes, and stochastic intensities of point processes on the real line. We show that Watanabe's characterisation of conditional Poisson processes in terms of local martingales is necessary and sufficient. Additionally, we consider conditions enabling the measure change method a la Girsanov to alter the intensity of Cox processes to a desired new target intensity, e.g. for the probability reference approach in filtering. Such a measure change exists if a corresponding stochastic exponential is a proper martingale. We show that this holds if the new locally integrable target intensity is the product of the original intensity and another non-negative process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02562v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that if the normalized partition function $W^{\beta}_n$ of the directed polymer model on $\mathbb Z^d$ converges to zero, then it does so exponentially fast. This implies that there exists a critical value $\beta_c$ for the inverse temperature such that the normalized partition function has a non-degenerate limit for all $\beta\in [0,\beta_c]$ -- weak disorder holds -- while for $\beta\in (\beta_c,\infty)$ it converges exponentially fast to zero -- very strong disorder holds. This solves a twenty-years-old conjecture formulated by Comets, Yoshida, Carmona and Hu. Our proof requires a technical assumption on the environment, namely, that it is bounded from above.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the well-posedness of McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations (SDE) whose drift depends pointwisely on marginal density and satisfies a condition about local integrability in time-space variables. The drift is assumed to be Lipschitz continuous in distribution variable with respect to Wasserstein metric $W_p$. Our approach is by approximation with mollified SDEs. We establish a new estimate about H{\"o}lder continuity in time of marginal density. Then we deduce that the marginal distributions (resp. marginal densities) of the mollified SDEs converge in $W_p$ (resp. topology of compact convergence) to the solution of the Fokker-Planck equation associated with the density-dependent SDE. We prove strong existence of a solution. Weak and strong uniqueness are obtained when $p=1$, the drift coefficient is bounded, and the diffusion coefficient is distribution free.</description>

      <title>Duality for some models of epidemic spreading</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15613v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the role of boundaries and the structure of nontrivial duality functions for three non conservative interacting particle systems in one dimension that model epidemic spreading: (i) the diffusive contact process (DCP), (ii) a model that we introduce and call generalized diffusive contact process (GDCP), both in finite volume in contact with boundary reservoirs, i.e., with open boundaries, and (iii) the susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) model on $\Z$. We establish duality relations for each system through an analytical approach. It turns out that with open boundaries self-duality breaks down and qualitatively different properties compared to closed boundaries (i.e., finite volume without reservoirs) arise: both the DCP and GDCP are ergodic but no longer absorbing, while the respective dual processes are absorbing but not ergodic. We provide expressions for the stationary correlation functions in terms of the dual absorption probabilities. We perform explicit computations for a small sized DCP, and for arbitrary size in a particular setting of the GDCP. The duality function is factorized for the DCP and GDCP, contrary to the SIR model for which the duality relation is nonlocal and yields an explicit expression of the time evolution of some specific correlation functions, describing the time decay of the sizes of clusters of susceptible individuals.</description>

      <title>Normal to Poisson phase transition for subgraph counting in the random-connection model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16222v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the limiting behavior of the count of subgraphs isomorphic to a graph $G$ with $m\geq 0$ fixed endpoints (or roots) in the random-connection model, as the intensity $\lambda$ of the underlying Poisson point process tends to infinity. When connection probabilities are of order $\lambda^{-\alpha}$ we identify a phase transition phenomenon depending on a critical decay rate $\alpha^\ast_m (G)&gt;0$ such that normal approximation for subgraph counts holds when $\alpha \in (0,\alpha^\ast_m (G) )$, and a Poisson limit result holds if $\alpha = \alpha^\ast_m (G)$. Our approach relies on cumulant growth rates derived by the convex analysis of planar diagrams that enumerate the partitions involved in cumulant identities. As a result, by the cumulant method we obtain normal approximation results with convergence rates in the Kolmogorov distance, and a Poisson limit theorem, for subgraph counts.</description>

      <title>The stochastic evolution of an infinite population with logistic-type interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16647v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An infinite population of point entities dwelling in the habitat $X=\mathds{R}^d$ is studied. Its members arrive at and depart from $X$ at random. The departure rate has a term corresponding to a logistic-type interaction between the entities. Thereby, the corresponding Kolmogorov operator $L$ has an additive quadratic part, which usually produces essential difficulties in its study. The population's pure states are locally finite counting measures defined on $X$. The set of such states $\Gamma$ is equipped with the vague topology and thus with the corresponding Borel $\sigma$-field. The population evolution is described at two levels. At the first level, we deal with the Fokker-Planck equation for $(L,\mathcal{F},\mu_0)$ where $\mathcal{F}$ is an appropriate set of bounded test functions $F:\Gamma\to \mathds{R}$ (domain of $L$) and $\mu_0$ is an initial state, which is supposed to belong to the set $\mathcal{P}_{\rm exp}$ of sub-Poissonian probability measures on $\Gamma$. We prove that the Fokker-Planck equation has a unique solution $t\mapsto\mu_t$ which also belongs to $\mathcal{P}_{\rm exp}$. Some of the properties of this solution are also obtained. The second level description yields a Markov process such that its one dimensional marginals coincide with the mentioned states $\mu_t$. The process is obtained as the unique solution of the corresponding martingale problem.</description>

      <title>A Probabilistic Parking Process and Labeled IDLA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11718v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1966, Konheim and Weiss [33] introduced a now classical parking protocol. The deterministic process and its resultant objects, known as parking functions, have since become a favorite object of study in enumerative combinatorics. In our work, we introduce and study a probabilistic variant of the classical parking protocol, which is closely related to Internal Diffusion Limited Aggregation, or IDLA, introduced in 1991 by Diaconis and Fulton [19]. In particular, we compute the stationary distribution of this process when initiated with a particular class of initial preferences, of which weakly increasing parking functions are a subset. Furthermore, we compute the expected time it takes for the protocol to complete assuming all of the cars park, and prove that, in some cases, the parking process is negatively correlated. In addition, we study statistics of uniformly random weakly increasing parking functions such as the distribution of the last entry, the probability that a specific set of cars is lucky, and the expected number of lucky cars.</description>

      <title>Coincidence of critical points for directed polymers for general environments and random walks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04113v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the directed polymer in a random environment (DPRE), two critical inverse-temperatures can be defined. The first one, $\beta_c$, separates the strong disorder regime (in which the normalized partition function $W^{\beta}_n$ tends to zero) from the weak disorder regime (in which $W^{\beta}_n$ converges to a nontrivial limit). The other, $\bar \beta_c$, delimits the very strong disorder regime (in which $W^{\beta}_n$ converges to zero exponentially fast). It was proved previously that $\beta_c=\bar \beta_c$ when the random environment is upper-bounded for the DPRE based on the simple random walk. We extend this result to general environment and arbitrary reference walk. We also prove that $\beta_c=0$ if and only the $L^2$-critical point is trivial.</description>

Abstract: This paper considers the probabilistic representation of the solutions of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) by the generation of marked random trees in which marks can be interpreted as mutant types in population genetics models. We present sufficient conditions on equation coefficients that ensure the integrability and uniform integrability of the functionals of random trees used in this representation. Those conditions rely on the analysis of a marked branching process that controls the growth of random trees and provide implicit lower bounds on the explosion time of the underlying ODE, thus providing a connection between branching process explosion and the existence and uniqueness of ODE solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11363v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is known from Bramson (1983) that the maximum of branching Brownian motion at time $t$ is asymptotically around an explicit function $m_t$, which involves a first ballistic order and a logarithmic correction. In this paper, we give an asymptotic equivalent for its upper moderate deviation probability, that is, the probability that the maximum achieves $m_t + x_t$ at time $t$, where $1 \ll x_t \ll t$. We adopt a probabilistic approach that employs a modified version of the second moment method. As a byproduct, we obtain information about the typical behavior of particles contributing to such deviations.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we establish the It\^o-Wentzell-Lions formulae for flows of both full and conditional measures on general semimartingales. This generalizes the existing works on flows of measures on It\^o processes. The key technical components involve an appropriate approximation of random fields by cylindrical functions and localization techniques. Moreover, we present the specific formulae in two special cases, including It\^o-Wentzell-Lions formulae for time-space-measure-dependent functions and for functions driven by Poisson random measures.</description>

      <title>Capacity of the range of random walk: Moderate deviations in dimensions 4 and 5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05585v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a moderate deviation principle for the capacity of the range of random walk in $\mathbb{Z}^5$. Depending on the scale of deviation, we get two different regimes. We observe Gaussian tails when the deviation scale is smaller than $n^{1/2} (\log n)^{3/4}$. Otherwise, we get non-Gaussian tails with a constant arising from a generalized Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequality. This is analogous to the behavior of the volume of the random walk range in $\mathbb{Z}^3$. Our methods can also be applied to the $d = 4$ case to prove the moderate deviation principle in almost the full range of interest. This extends the work of Okada and the first author \cite{AdhikariOkada2023}, where they showed moderate deviations up to a deviation scale of $\log \log n$ times the standard deviation.</description>

Abstract: We derive the asymptotic behaviour of the genealogy of a logistic branching process in the setting where the equilibrium population size is large. In three regimes on the tail of the offspring distribution we recover the Kingman, $\text{Beta}(2-\alpha, \alpha)$ and Bolthausen-Sznitman coalescents as a scaling parameter governing the population size is taken to infinity, the deduction going via the convergence in distribution of a modified lookdown construction. This resolves a question asked in arxiv:2501.16837 who studied the same population process forwards in time and showed convergence of the type frequency process to the corresponding $\Lambda$-Fleming-Viot process in each regime.</description>

      <title>A geometric model of synthetic filtrations via context-dependent time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12919v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classical filtrations in probability theory formalize the accumulation of information along a linear time axis: the past is unique and the present evolves into an uncertain future. In reality, however, this linearity may itself be an illusion - an artifact of human perception that collapses multiple possible histories into a single apparent path.
  In this paper, we propose a geometric and homological model of synthetic filtrations, where the present arises as a synthesis of many potential pasts. To achieve this, we introduce a new category $\Sigma$, extending the simplex category $\Delta$ so that each moment of time carries contextual structure. Synthetic filtrations are realized as contravariant functors $\Sigma^{op} \to Prob$, where $Prob$ is the category of probability spaces with null-preserving maps.
  We then develop a homological analysis of $\Sigma$-filtrations, constructing chain complexes whose boundaries are given by conditional expectations. Their homology groups measure informational "holes" - probabilistic obstructions arising from the incompatibility of contextual expectations.
  As a concrete realization, we define Dirichlet filtrations, in which measures on simplices arise from Dirichlet distributions, reflecting both parameter and contextual uncertainty. Bayesian updating is then interpreted as a categorical transformation of a Dirichlet functor, revealing learning as a reconstruction of coherence across contexts.
  This framework suggests that what appears as a linear temporal order is merely a projection of a higher contextual geometry. It unifies categorical probability, homological algebra, and Bayesian reasoning, offering a new language for uncertainty in mathematics, finance, and cognition.</description>

We provide asymptotics for the second order correlations of all the corresponding number statistics on small observation disks, showing various rates of local repulsion.

      <description>arXiv:2510.13348v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider bond percolation on the $d$-dimensional binary hypercube with $p=c/d$ for fixed $c&gt;1$. We prove that the typical diameter of the giant component $L_1$ is of order $\Theta(d)$, and the typical mixing time of the lazy random walk on $L_1$ is of order $\Theta(d^2)$. This resolves long-standing open problems of Bollob\'as, Kohayakawa and {\L}uczak from 1994, and of Benjamini and Mossel from 2003.
  A key component in our approach is a new tight large deviation estimate on the number of vertices in $L_1$ whose proof includes several novel ingredients: a structural description of the residue outside the giant component after sprinkling, a tight quantitative estimate on the spread of the giant in the hypercube, and a stability principle which rules out the disintegration of large connected sets under thinning. This toolkit further allows us to obtain optimal bounds on the expansion in $L_1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24091v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the mirrors model in $d$ dimensions on an infinite slab and with unit density. This is a deterministic dynamics in a random environment. We argue that the crossing probability of the slab goes like $\kappa/(\kappa+N)$ where $N$ is the width of the slab. We are able to compute $\kappa$ perturbatively by using a multiscale approach. The only small parameter involved in the expansion is the inverse of the size of the system. This approach rests on an inductive process and a closure assumption adapted to the mirrors model. For $d=3$, we propose the recursive relation for the conductivity $\kappa_n$ at scale $n$ : $\kappa_{n+1}=\kappa_n(1+\frac{\kappa_n}{2^{n}}\alpha)$, up to $o(1/2^n)$ terms and with $\alpha\simeq 0.0374$. This sequence has a finite limit.</description>

      <title>Last Hitting Time Distributions for Solvable Diffusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03037v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By considering any one-dimensional time-homogeneous solvable diffusion process,this paper develops a complete analytical framework for computing the distribution of the last hitting time, to any level, and its joint distribution with the process value on any finite time horizon. Our formalism allows for regular diffusions with any type of endpoint boundaries. We exploit the inherent link between last and first hitting times. The simpler known formula for the marginal distribution of the last hitting time on an infinite time horizon is easily recovered as a special limit. Furthermore, we derive general formulae for each component of the joint distribution, i.e., the jointly continuous, the partly continuous (defective) and the jointly defective portions. By employing spectral expansions of the transition densities and the first hitting time distributions, our derivations culminate in novel general spectral expansions for both marginal and joint distributions of the last hitting time and the process value on any finite time horizon.
  An additional main contribution of this paper lies in the application of our general formulae, giving rise to newly closed-form analytical formulae for several solvable diffusions. In particular, we systematically derive analytical expressions for each portion of the marginal and joint distributions of the last hitting time and the process value on any finite time horizon, without and with imposed killing at one or two interior points, for Brownian motion, Brownian motion with drift (geometric Brownian motion), the squared Bessel , squared radial Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (CIR) and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes. Most of our formulae are given in terms of spectral series that are rapidly convergent and efficiently implemented. We demonstrate this by presenting some numerical calculations of marginal and joint distributions using accurately truncated series.</description>

Our approach relies on a tree-based probabilistic representation based on a (2s)-stable branching processes for all $s\in (0,1)$, and our existence results hold for sufficiently small exterior conditions and nonlinearity coefficients. In comparison with existing approaches, we consider a wide class of polynomial nonlinearities without imposing upper bounds on their maximal degree or number of terms. Numerical illustrations are provided in large dimensions.</description>

      <title>Characterization of flip process rules with the same trajectories</title>

Abstract: Garbe, Hladk\'y, \v{S}ileikis and Skerman [Ann. Inst. Henri Poincar\'e Probab. Stat., 60 (2024), pp. 2878-2922] recently introduced a general class of random graph processes called flip processes and proved that the typical evolution of these discrete-time random graph processes corresponds to certain continuous-time deterministic graphon trajectories. We obtain a complete characterization of the equivalence classes of flip process rules with the same graphon trajectories. As an application, we characterize the flip process rules which are unique in their equivalence classes. These include several natural families of rules such as the complementing rules, the component completion rules, the extremist rules, and the clique removal rules.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18703v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider an open quantum system with (discrete-time) Markovian dynamics. Our task is to store information in the system in such a way that it can be retrieved perfectly, even after the system is left to evolve for an arbitrarily long time. We show that this is impossible for classical (resp. quantum) information precisely when the dynamics is mixing (resp. asymptotically entanglement breaking). Furthermore, we provide tight universal upper bounds on the minimum time after which any such dynamics 'scrambles' the encoded information beyond the point of perfect retrieval. On the other hand, for dynamics that are not of this kind, we show that information must be encoded inside the peripheral space associated with the dynamics in order for it to be perfectly recoverable at any time in the future. This allows us to derive explicit formulas for the maximum amount of information that can be protected from noise in terms of the structure of the peripheral space of the dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05969v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The main goal of this paper is to provide an algorithm for the random sampling of Butcher trees and the probabilistic numerical solution of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). This approach complements and simplifies a recent approach to the probabilistic representation of ODE solutions, by removing the need to generate random branching times. The random sampling of trees is compared to the finite order truncation of Butcher series in numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Comparison results for positive supermodular dependent Markov tree distributions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17441v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Positive dependencies have been compared in the literature under rather strong assumptions such as equality of conditional distributions, exchangeability, or stationarity. We establish supermodular ordering results for distributions that are Markov with respect to a tree structure. Our comparison results rely on simple stochastic monotonicity conditions and a pointwise ordering of bivariate copulas associated with the edges of the underlying tree. We also study flexibility of the marginal distributions in stochastic and convex order. As a consequence, we obtain first- and second-order stochastic dominance esults for extreme order statistics and sums of positively dependent random variables. As an application, we investigate distributional robustness of the maximum of a perturbed random walk under model uncertainty. Several examples and a detailed discussion of the assumptions demonstrate the generality of our results and reveal deeper insights into non-intuitive positive dependence properties of multidimensional distributions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05429v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Following the approach of Bj$\ddot{\text{o}}$rklund and Gorodnik, we have considered the discrepancy function for lattice point counting on domains that can be nicely tessellated by the action of a diagonal semigroup. We have shown that suitably normalized discrepancy functions for lattice point counting on certain tessellated domains satisfy a non-degenerate central limit theorem. Furthermore, we have also addressed the same problem for affine and congruence lattice point counting, proving analogous non-degenerate central limit theorems for them. The main ingredients of the proofs are the method of cumulants and quantitative multiple mixing estimates.</description>

      <title>Ginzburg--Landau Functionals in the Large-Graph Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00422v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ginzburg--Landau (GL) functionals on graphs, which are relaxations of graph-cut functionals on graphs, have yielded a variety of insights in image segmentation and graph clustering. In this paper, we study large-graph limits of GL functionals by taking a functional-analytic view of graphs as nonlocal kernels. For a graph $W_n$ with $n$ nodes, the corresponding graph GL functional $\GL^{W_n}_\ep$ is an energy for functions on $W_n$. We minimize GL functionals on sequences of growing graphs that converge to functions called graphons. For such sequences of graphs, we show that the graph GL functional $\Gamma$-converges to a continuous and nonlocal functional that we call the \emph{graphon GL functional}. We also investigate the sharp-interface limits of the graph GL and graphon GL functionals, and we relate these limits to a nonlocal total-variation (TV) functional. We express the limiting GL functional in terms of Young measures and thereby obtain a probabilistic interpretation of the variational problem in the large-graph limit. Finally, to develop intuition about the graphon GL functional, we determine the GL minimizer for several example families of graphons.</description>

      <title>Sparsifying Suprema of Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14664v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a dimension-independent sparsification result for suprema of centered Gaussian processes: Let $T$ be any (possibly infinite) bounded set of vectors in $\mathbb{R}^n$, and let $\{\boldsymbol{X}_t := t \cdot \boldsymbol{g} \}_{t\in T}$ be the canonical Gaussian process on $T$, where $\boldsymbol{g}\sim N(0, I_n)$. We show that there is an $O_\varepsilon(1)$-size subset $S \subseteq T$ and a set of real values $\{c_s\}_{s \in S}$ such that the random variable $\sup_{s \in S} \{{\boldsymbol{X}}_s + c_s\}$ is an $\varepsilon$-approximator\,(in $L^1$) of the random variable $\sup_{t \in T} {\boldsymbol{X}}_t$. Notably, the size of the sparsifier $S$ is completely independent of both $|T|$ and the ambient dimension $n$.
  We give two applications of this sparsification theorem:
  - A "Junta Theorem" for Norms: We show that given any norm $\nu(x)$ on $\mathbb{R}^n$, there is another norm $\psi(x)$ depending only on the projection of $x$ onto $O_\varepsilon(1)$ directions, for which $\psi({\boldsymbol{g}})$ is a multiplicative $(1 \pm \varepsilon)$-approximation of $\nu({\boldsymbol{g}})$ with probability $1-\varepsilon$ for ${\boldsymbol{g}} \sim N(0,I_n)$.
  - Sparsification of Convex Sets: We show that any intersection of (possibly infinitely many) halfspaces in $\mathbb{R}^n$ that are at distance $r$ from the origin is $\varepsilon$-close (under $N(0,I_n)$) to an intersection of only $O_{r,\varepsilon}(1)$ halfspaces. This yields new polynomial-time \emph{agnostic learning} and \emph{tolerant property testing} algorithms for intersections of halfspaces.</description>

      <title>When Should Selfish Miners Double-Spend?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03227v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conventional double-spending attack models ignore the revenue losses stemming from the orphan blocks. On the other hand, selfish mining literature usually ignores the chance of the attacker to double-spend at no-cost in each attack cycle. In this paper, we give a rigorous stochastic analysis of an attack where the goal of the adversary is to double-spend while mining selfishly. To do so, we first combine stubborn and selfish mining attacks, i.e., construct a strategy where the attacker acts stubborn until its private branch reaches a certain length and then switches to act selfish. We provide the optimal stubbornness for each parameter regime. Next, we provide the maximum stubbornness that is still more profitable than honest mining and argue a connection between the level of stubbornness and the $k$-confirmation rule. We show that, at each attack cycle, if the level of stubbornness is higher than $k$, the adversary gets a free shot at double-spending. At each cycle, for a given stubbornness level, we rigorously formulate how great the probability of double-spending is. We further modify the attack in the stubborn regime in order to conceal the attack and increase the double-spending probability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10785v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an approach for simulating wall-bounded incompressible turbulent flows by integrating the technology of random vortex method with the core principles of large-eddy simulations (LES). In particular, we employ the filtering function, interpreted as a spatial averaging operator, together with the integral representation theorem for parabolic equations, to construct a closed numerical scheme suitable for computing solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations. This framework numerically overcomes the difficulties associated with the non-locally integrable three-dimensional kernel inherent in the random vortex method, enabling efficient computation of flow fields via the Monte Carlo method. Several numerical experiments are presented for both laminar and turbulent flows in wall-bounded domains, to thereby reveal the underlying flow mechanisms near the wall boundary. The experimental results and systematic comparisons with alternative numerical approaches consistently demonstrate that the proposed method is numerically stable, possesses low theoretical complexity, and achieves acceptable computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>On the Relation between Rectified Flows and Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19712v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the connections between rectified flows, flow matching, and optimal transport. Flow matching is a recent approach to learning generative models by estimating velocity fields that guide transformations from a source to a target distribution. Rectified flow matching aims to straighten the learned transport paths, yielding more direct flows between distributions. Our first contribution is a set of invariance properties of rectified flows and explicit velocity fields. In addition, we also provide explicit constructions and analysis in the Gaussian (not necessarily independent) and Gaussian mixture settings and study the relation to optimal transport. Our second contribution addresses recent claims suggesting that rectified flows, when constrained such that the learned velocity field is a gradient, can yield (asymptotically) solutions to optimal transport problems. We study the existence of solutions for this problem and demonstrate that they only relate to optimal transport under assumptions that are significantly stronger than those previously acknowledged. In particular, we present several counterexamples that invalidate earlier equivalence results in the literature, and we argue that enforcing a gradient constraint on rectified flows is, in general, not a reliable method for computing optimal transport maps.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09852v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by random walks on subsets of the hypercube, we prove two discrete functional inequalities on the hypercube. First, we give a short, elementary proof of the Poincar\'e inequality on increasing subsets of the cube recently established by Fei and Ferreira Pinto Jr, which yields an $O(n^2)$ upper bound on the mixing time of censored random walks, improving upon previous bounds. Second, adapting Samorodnitsky's induction method to the $p$-biased setting, we establish a sharp $p$-biased edge-isoperimetric inequality for real-valued increasing functions, which recovers the classic biased edge-isoperimetric inequality for increasing sets and identifies increasing subcubes as the extremizers. This result also admits a probabilistic interpretation in terms of maximizing the mean first exit time of biased random walks.</description>

      <title>Analytic and Stochastic Approach to Quantum Advantages in Ground State and Quantum State Preparation Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01563v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problems of state preparation, ground state preparation and quantum state preparation. We propose an analytic approach to a stochastic quantum algorithm which prepares the ground state for $n$-qubit Hamiltonian that is represented by $\text{poly}(n)$ Pauli operators and has an inverse-polynomial gap, requiring only $\text{poly}(n)$ Pauli rotations, measurements, and classical time complexity when $n$ exceeds a threshold, to inverse-polynomial precision given the initial overlap being lower bounded by $\frac{1}{2^n}$. Extending this result, we prove that any $n$-qubit quantum state can be prepared in two regimes: (1) with a constant number of Pauli rotations to constant precision, or (2) with a polynomial number of rotations to inverse-polynomial precision. Our results improve over previous approaches to quantum state preparation in terms of gate complexity, thereby yielding quantum space advantage. As an application, we identify a practical condition under which quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problems can be solved with exponential quantum speedups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10370v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For the type A, BC, and D root systems, we determine equivalent conditions between the coefficients of an exponential holomorphic function and the asymptotic values taken by the Dunkl bilinear form when one of its entries is the function. We establish these conditions over the $|\theta N| \rightarrow\infty$ regime for the type A and D root systems and over the $|\theta_0 N|\rightarrow \infty, \frac{\theta_1}{\theta_0 N}\rightarrow c\in\mathbb{C}$ regime for the type BC root system. We also generalize existing equivalent conditions over the $\theta N \rightarrow c\in\mathbb{C}$ regime for the type A root system and over the $\theta_0 N\rightarrow c_0\in\mathbb{C}, \frac{\theta_1}{\theta_0 N}\rightarrow c_1\in\mathbb{C}$ regime for the type BC root system and prove new equivalent conditions over the $\theta N \rightarrow c\in\mathbb{C}$ regime for the type D root system. Furthermore, we determine the asymptotics of the coefficients of the Bessel functions over the regimes that we have mentioned.</description>

Abstract: We quantitatively study the mixing rate of randomly shifted alternating shears on the torus. This flow was introduced by Pierrehumbert '94, and was recently shown to be exponentially mixing. In this work, we quantify the dependence of the exponential mixing rate on the flow amplitude. Our approach is based on constructing an explicit Lyapunov function and a coupling trajectory for the associated two-point Markov chain, together with an application of the quantitative Harris theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00971v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We continue the study of the two-dimensional dispersive Anderson model (DAM), i.e. the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with multiplicative spatial white noise. For this model, global well-posedness on the periodic domain was established by Visciglia and the second author (2023), and global well-posedness on the full space was established by Debussche, Visciglia, and the authors (2024). We show that, under suitable initial conditions and suitable periodization procedure of the noise, the periodic global dynamics of the DAM converges in spaces of local domains to that of the DAM on the full space as the period goes to infinity. In Appendix, we also discuss the same problem for the parabolic Anderson model.</description>

      <title>Helson's conjecture for smooth numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03430v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\Psi(x,y)$ denote the count of $y$-smooth numbers below $x$ and $P(n)$ denote the largest prime factor of $n$. We prove that for $f$ a Steinhaus random multiplicative function, the partial sums over $y$-smooth numbers enjoy better than squareroot cancellation, in the sense that $$ \mathbb E \Big|\sum_{\substack{1\leq n \leq x\\ P(n) \leq y}} f(n) \Big| = o\left( \Psi(x,y)^{1/2} \right),$$ uniformly for $(\log x)^{30} \leq y \leq x$. Our bounds are quantitative and give a large saving when $y$ isn't too close to $x$.</description>

      <title>Hidden Convexity in Queueing Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03955v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the joint control of arrival and service rates in queueing systems with the objective of minimizing long-run expected cost minus revenue. Although the objective function is non-convex, first-order methods have been empirically observed to converge to globally optimal solutions. This paper provides a theoretical foundation for this empirical phenomenon by characterizing the optimization landscape and identifying a hidden convexity: the problem admits a convex reformulation after an appropriate change of variables. Leveraging this hidden convexity, we establish the Polyak-Lojasiewicz-Kurdyka (PLK) condition for the original control problem, which excludes spurious local minima and ensures global convergence for first-order methods. Our analysis applies to a broad class of $GI/GI/1$ queueing models, including those with Gamma-distributed interarrival and service times. As a key ingredient in the proof, we establish a new convexity property of the expected queue length under a square-root transformation of the traffic intensity.</description>
