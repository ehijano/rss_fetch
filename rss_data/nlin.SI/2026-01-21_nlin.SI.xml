      <title>Complete Weierstrass elliptic function solutions and canonical coordinates for four-wave mixing in nonlinear optical fibres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complete analytic solutions to quasi-continuous-wave four-wave mixing in nonlinear optical fibres are presented in terms of Weierstrass elliptic $\wp$, $\zeta$, and $\sigma$ functions, providing the full complex envelopes for all four waves under arbitrary initial conditions. A sequence of coordinate transformations reveals a canonical form with universal parameter-free structure. Remarkably, these transformations depend explicitly on the propagation variable yet preserve the structural form of the differential equations, an invariance property not previously reported for four-wave mixing. In the canonical coordinates, solutions become single-valued meromorphic Kronecker theta functions, establishing connections with other integrable nonlinear optical systems. The Hamiltonian conservation is shown to arise from the Frobenius-Stickelberger determinant. Numerical validation confirms the solutions using open-source Python libraries.</description>

      <title>Bihamiltonian tests for integrable systems associated to rank-$1$ F-CohFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Double ramification (DR) hierarchies associated to rank-$1$ F-CohFTs are important integrable perturbations of the Riemann--Hopf hierarchy. In this paper, we perform bihamiltonian tests for these DR hierarchies, and conjecture that the ones that are bihamiltonian form a $2$-parameter family. Remarkably, our computations suggest that there is a $1$-parameter subfamily of the rank-$1$ F-CohFTs, where the corresponding DR hierarchy is conjecturally Miura equivalent to the Camassa--Holm hierarchy. We also prove a conjecture regarding bihamiltonian Hodge hierarchies. Finally, we systematically study Miura invariants, and for another $1$-parameter subfamily propose a conjectural relation to the Degasperis--Procesi hierarchy.</description>

      <title>Kaleidoscope Yang-Baxter Equation for Gaudin's Kaleidoscope models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, researchers have proposed the Asymmetric Bethe ansatz method - a theoretical tool that extends the scope of Bethe ansatz-solvable models by "breaking" partial mirror symmetry via the introduction of a fully reflecting boundary. Within this framework, the integrability conditions which were originally put forward by Gaudin have been further generalized. In this work, building on Gaudin's generalized kaleidoscope model, we present a detailed investigation of the relationship between DN symmetry and its integrability. We demonstrate that the mathematical essence of integrability in this class of models is characterized by a newly proposed Kaleidoscope Yang-Baxter Equation. Furthermore, we show that the solvability of a model via the coordinate Bethe ansatz depends not only on the consistency relations satisfied by scattering matrices, but also on the model's boundary conditions and the symmetry of the subspace where solutions are sought. Through finite element method based numerical studies, we further confirm that Bethe ansatz integrability arises in a specific symmetry sector. Finally, by analyzing the algebraic structure of the Kaleidoscope Yang-Baxter Equation, we derive a series of novel quantum algebraic identities within the framework of quantum torus algebra.</description>

      <title>Heun-function analysis of the Dirac spinor spectrum in a sine-Gordon soliton background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Dirac spectrum in a sine-Gordon soliton background, where the induced position-dependent mass reduces the spectral problem to a Heun-type differential equation. Bound and scattering sectors are treated within a unified framework, with spectral data encoded in Wronskians matching local Heun solutions and exhibiting explicit dependence on the soliton parameters and the bare fermion mass. This formulation enables a systematic analysis of spinor bound and scattering states, supported by analytic and numerical verification of wave function matching across the soliton domain. The present work is related to arXiv:2512.07658 and emphasizes a pedagogical treatment of scattering states within the Heun-equation formalism.</description>

      <title>The Hamilton-Jacobi Equation and its Application to Nonlinear Beam Dynamics: Comparison of Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rarely used Hamilton-Jacobi equation has been utilized as an elegant way to find the trajectories of mechanical systems and to derive symplectic maps. Further, the exact solution in kick approximation of Hamilton's equations of motion in interaction representation is written as a generalized one-turn twist map.
  One can imagine that the nonlinear kick comes first, followed by the one-period rotation along the machine circumference, or a second alternative in which the one-period rotation occurs before the kick. There is a difference in the result of solving Hamilton's equations between the two cases, which is expressed in obtaining a standard forward twist map in the first case, or alternatively a backward map in the second one. This nontrivial and intuitively unclear peculiarity is usually ignored/overlooked in practically all specialized references on the topic.
  Finally, the statistical properties and the behavior of the density distribution of a particle beam in configuration space under the influence of an isolated sextupole have been studied.</description>

      <title>Commuting integrable maps from a deformed D$_4$ cluster algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05270v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we revisit an integrable map of the plane which we obtained recently as a two-parameter family of deformed mutations in the cluster algebra of type D$_4$. The rational first integral for this map defines an invariant foliation of the plane by level curves, and we explain how this corresponds to a rational elliptic surface of rank 2. This leads us to construct another (independent) integrable map, commuting with the first, such that both maps lift to compositions of mutations in an enlarged cluster algebra, whose underlying quiver is equivalent to the one found by Okubo for the $q$-Painlev\'e VI equation. The degree growth of the two commuting maps is calculated in two different ways: firstly, from the tropical (max-plus) equations for the d-vectors of the cluster variables; and secondly, by constructing the minimal space of initial conditions for the two maps, via blowing up $\mathbb{P}^1 \times \mathbb{P}^1$.</description>

      <title>Calogero-Sutherland hyperbolic system and Heckman-Opdam $\mathfrak{gl}_n$ hypergeometric function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18864v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove equivalence of two integral representations for the wave functions of hyperbolic Calogero-Sutherland system. For this we study two families of Baxter operators related to hyperbolic Calogero-Sutherland and rational Ruijsenaars models; the first one as a limit from hyperbolic Ruijsenaars system, while the second one independently. Besides, computing asymptotics of integral representations and also the value at zero point, we identify them with renormalized Heckman-Opdam $\mathfrak{gl}_n$ hypergeometric function.</description>
