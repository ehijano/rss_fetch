      <title>Pangraphs as models of higher-order interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graphs depict pairwise relationships between objects within a system. Higher-order interactions (HOIs), which involve more than two objects simultaneously, are common in nature. Such interactions can change the stability of a complex system. Hypergraphs can represent an HOI as an arbitrary subset of vertices. However, they fail to capture the specific roles of the vertices involved, which can be highly asymmetric, particularly in the case of interaction modifications.
  We introduce pangraphs, a robust and quantitative generalisation of graphs that accurately captures arbitrarily complex higher-order interactions. We demonstrate that several higher-order representations proposed in the literature are specific instances of pangraphs. Additionally, we introduce an incidence multilayer digraph representation of a pangraph, referred to as Levi digraph. We adapt degree and Katz centrality measures to the pangraph framework and show that a consistent generalisation of recursive graph measures cannot be simplified to a Levi digraph of a pangraph.
  We construct a pangraph for a real-world coffee agroecosystem and compare Katz centrality between its dihypergraph and pangraph representations, both analytically and numerically. The choice of representation significantly affects centrality values and alters vertex ranks. Additionally, we emphasise the use of real-valued incidence matrices to quantify interaction strengths and the roles of vertices within the system.</description>

      <title>Coevolutionary game dynamics with localized environmental resource feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18494v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamic environments shape diverse dynamics in evolutionary game systems. We introduce spatial heterogeneity of resources into the prisoner's dilemma game model to explore coevolutionary game dynamics with environmental feedback. The availability of resources significantly affects the survival competitiveness of surrounding individuals. Feedback between individuals' strategies and the resources they can use leads to the oscillating dynamic known as the "oscillatory tragedy of the commons". Our findings indicate that when the influence of individuals' strategies on the update rate of resources is significantly high in systems characterized by environmental heterogeneity, they can attain an equilibrium state that avoids the oscillatory tragedy. In contrast to the numerical results obtained in well-mixed structures, self-organized clustered patterns emerge in simulations utilizing square lattices, further enhancing the stability of the system. We discuss critical phenomena in detail, demonstrating that the aforementioned transition is robust across various system parameters, including the strength of cooperators in restoring the environment, initial distributions of cooperators, system size and structures, and noise.</description>

      <title>Eco-evolutionary dynamics of a trait-structured predator-prey model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07379v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The coupling between evolutionary and ecological changes (eco-evolutionary dynamics) has been shown to be relevant among diverse species, and is also of interest outside of ecology, i.e. in cancer evolution. These dynamics play an important role in determining survival in response to climate change, motivating the need for mathematical models to capture this often complex interplay. Models incorporating eco-evolutionary dynamics often sacrifice analytical tractability to capture the complexity of real systems, do not explicitly consider the effect of population heterogeneity, or focus on long-term behaviour. In order to capture population heterogeneity, both transient, and long-term dynamics, while retaining tractability, we generalise a moment-based method applicable in the regime of small segregational variance to the case of time-dependent mortality and birth. These results are applied to a predator-prey model, where ecological parameters such as the contact rate between species are trait-structured. The trait-distribution of the prey species is shown to be approximately Gaussian with constant variance centered on the mean trait, which is asymptotically governed by an autonomous ODE. In this way, we make explicit the impact of eco-evolutionary dynamics on the transient behaviour and long-term fate of the prey species.</description>
