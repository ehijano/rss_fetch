      <title>Singular integrals on $C^{1,\alpha}$ intrinsic graphs in step 2 Carnot groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study singular integral operators induced by Calder\'on-Zygmund kernels in any step-$2$ Carnot group $\mathbb{G}$. We show that if such an operator satisfies some natural cancellation conditions then it is $L^2$ bounded on all intrinsic graphs of $C^{1,\alpha}$ functions over vertical hyperplanes that do not have rapid growth at $\infty$.
  In particular, the result applies to the Riesz operator $\mathcal{R}$ induced by the kernel $$ \mathsf{R}(z)= \nabla_{\mathbb{G}} \Gamma(z), \quad z\in \mathbb{G}\backslash \{0\}, $$ the horizontal gradient of the fundamental solution of the sub-Laplacian. The $L^2$ boundedness of $\mathcal{R}$ is connected with the question of removability for Lipschitz harmonic functions. As a corollary of our result, we infer that closed subsets of the intrinsic graphs mentioned above are non-removable.</description>

      <title>Maximal $L_p$-regularity for fractional problem driven by non-autonomous forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the maximal $L_p$-regularity in J.L. Lions' problem involving a time-fractional derivative and a non-autonomous form $a(t;\cdot,\cdot)$ on a Hilbert space $H$. This problem says whether the maximal $L_p$-regularity in $H$ hold when $t \mapsto a(t ; u, v)$ is merely continuous or even merely measurable. We prove the maximal $L_p$-regularity results when the coefficients satisfy general Dini-type continuity conditions. In particular, we construct a counterexample to negatively answer this problem, indicating the minimal H\"{o}lder-scale regularity required for positive results.</description>

      <title>Spivey's type recurrence relation for Lah-Bell polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to derive Spivey's type recurrence relations for the Lah-Bell polynomials and the r-Lah-Bell polynomials by utilizing operators X and D satisfying the commutation relation DX-XD=1.
  Here X is the `multiplication by x' operator and D is the differentiation operator D=d/dx. In addition, we obtain Spivey's type recurrence relation for the lambda analogue of r-Lah-Bell polynomials by some other method without using the operators X and D.</description>

      <title>The multifractal nature of a parametrized family of von Koch functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a famous paper published in 1904, Helge von Koch introduced the curve that still serves nowadays as an iconic representation of fractal shapes. In fact, von Koch's main goal was the construction of a continuous but nowhere differentiable function, very similar to the snowflake, using elementary geometric procedures, and not analytical formulae. We prove that a parametrized family of functions (including and) generalizing von Koch's example enjoys a rich multifractal behavior, thus enriching the class of historical mathematical objects having surprising regularity properties. The analysis relies on the study of the orbits of an underlying dynamical system and on the introduction of self-similar measures and non-trivial iterated functions systems adapted to the problem.</description>

      <title>Composition structure of polyconvolution associated with index Kontorovich-Lebedev transform and Fourier integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using Kakichev's classical concept and extending Yakubovich-Britvina's approach (\textit{Results. Math.} 55(1-2):175-197, 2009) and (\textit{Integral Transforms Spec. Funct.} 21(4):259--276, 2010) for setting up Kontorovich-Lebedev convolution operators, this paper proposes a new polyconvolution structure associated with the KL-transform and Fourier integrals. Our main contributions include demonstrating a one-dimensional Watson-type transform, providing necessary and sufficient conditions for this transform to serve as unitary on $L_2(\mathbb{R}_+)$, and inferring its inverse operator in symmetric form. The existence of this structure over specific function spaces and its connection with previously known convolutions are pointed out. Establish the Plancherel-type theorem, prove the convergence in the mean-square sense in $L_2(\mathbb{R}_+)$, and prove the boundedness of dual spaces via Riesz-Thorin's theorem. Derives new weighted $L_p$-norm inequalities and boundedness in a three-parametric family of Lebesgue spaces. These theoretical findings are applied to solve specific classes of the Toeplitz-Hankel equation, providing a priori estimations based on the established conditions for $L_1$ solvability.</description>

      <title>On zeros of polynomials associated with Heun class equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sch\"afke and Schmidt established that the asymptotics of the coefficients of the local solution to some linear differential equation is related to global structures of solutions. The Heun class equations have the accessory parameters, and we investigate the polynomials whose variable is the accessory parameter which appears as the coefficients of the local solution. By calculating the zeros of the polynomials numerically, we obtain the data of the spectral related to the Heun class equations numerically.</description>

      <title>Constructive Approaches to QP-Time-Dependent KAM Theory for Lagrangian Tori in Hamiltonian Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove a KAM theorem in a-posteriori format, using the parameterization method to look invariant tori in non-autonomous Hamiltonian systems with $n$ degrees of freedom that depend periodically or quasi-periodically (QP) on time, with $\ell$ external frequencies. Such a system is described by a Hamiltonian function in the $2n$-dimensional phase space, $\mathscr{M}$, that depends also on $\ell$ angles, $\varphi\in \mathbb{T}^\ell$. We take advantage of the fibbered structure of the extended phase space $\mathscr{M} \times \mathbb{T}^\ell$. As a result of our approach, the parameterization of tori requires the last $\ell$ variables, to be precise $\varphi$, while the first $2n$ components are determined by an invariance equation. This reduction decreases the dimension of the problem where the unknown is a parameterization from $2(n+\ell)$ to $2n$. We employ a quasi-Newton method, in order to prove the KAM theorem. This iterative method begins with an initial parameterization of an approximately invariant torus, meaning it approximately satisfies the invariance equation. The approximation is refined by applying corrections that reduce quadratically the invariance equation error. This process converges to a torus in a complex strip of size $\rho_\infty$, provided suitable Diophantine $(\gamma,\tau)$ conditions and a non-degeneracy condition on the torsion are met. Given the nature of the proof, this provides a numerical method that can be effectively implemented on a computer, the details are given in the companion paper [CHP25]. This approach leverages precision and efficiency to compute invariant tori.</description>

      <title>Extended convexity and uniqueness of minimizers for interaction energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Linear interpolation convexity (LIC) has served as the crucial condition for the uniqueness of interaction energy minimizers. We introduce the concept of the LIC radius which extends the LIC condition. Uniqueness of minimizer up to translation can still be guaranteed if the LIC radius is larger than the possible support size of any minimizer. Using this approach, we obtain uniqueness of minimizer for power-law potentials $W_{a,b}({\bf x}) = \frac{|{\bf x}|^a}{a} - \frac{|{\bf x}|^b}{b},\,-d&lt;b&lt;2$ with $a$ slightly smaller than 2 or slightly larger than 4. The estimate of LIC radius for $a$ slightly smaller than 2 is done via a Poincar\'{e}-type inequality for signed measures. To handle the case where $a$ slightly larger than 4, we truncate the attractive part of the potential at large radius and prove that the resulting potential has positive Fourier transform. We also propose to study the logarithmic power-law potential $W_{b,\ln}({\bf x}) = \frac{|{\bf x}|^b}{b}\ln|{\bf x}|$. We prove its LIC property for $b=2$ and give the explicit formula for minimizer. We also prove the uniqueness of minimizer for $b$ slightly less than 2 by estimating its LIC radius.</description>

      <title>Bilinear singular integral operators with kernels in weighted spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07014v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish the full quasi-Banach range of $L^{p_1}(\mathbb R) \times L^{p_2}(\mathbb R) \rightarrow L^p(\mathbb R)$ bounds for one-dimensional bilinear singular integral operators with homogeneous kernels whose restriction $\Omega$ to the unit sphere $\mathbb S^1$ is supported away from the degenerate line $\theta_1=\theta_2$, belongs to $L^q(\mathbb S^1)$ for some $q&gt;1$ and has vanishing integral. In fact, a more general result is obtained by dropping the support condition on $\Omega$ and requiring that $\Omega\in L^q(\mathbb S^1,u^q)$, where $u(\theta_1,\theta_2)=|\theta_1-\theta_2|^{-1}$ for $(\theta_1,\theta_2)\in \mathbb S^1$. In addition, we provide counterexamples that show the failure of the $n$-dimensional version of the previous result when $n\geq 2$, as well as the failure of its $m$-linear variant in dimension one when $m\geq 3$. The relationship of these results to (un)boundedness properties of higher-dimensional multilinear Hilbert transforms is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Spread Furstenberg Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18193v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain new bounds for (a variant of) the Furstenberg set problem for high dimensional flats over $\mathbb{R}^n$. In particular, let $F\subset \mathbb{R}^n$, $1\leq k \leq n-1$, $s\in (0,k]$, and $t\in (0,k(n-k)]$. We say that $F$ is a $(s,t;k)$-spread Furstenberg set if there exists a $t$-dimensional set of subspaces $\mathcal P \subset \mathcal G(n,k)$ such that for all $P\in \mathcal P$, there exists a translation vector $a_P \in \mathbb{R}^n$ such that $\dim(F\cap (P + a_P)) \geq s$. We show that given $k \geq k_0 +1$ (where $k_0:= k_0(n)$ is sufficiently large) and $s&gt;k_0$, every $(s,t;k)$-spread Furstenberg set $F$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ satisfies \[ \dim F \geq n-k + s - \frac{k(n-k) - t}{\lceil s\rceil - k_0 +1 }. \] Our methodology is motivated by the work of the second author, Dvir, and Lund over finite fields.</description>

      <title>Quadratic variation and local times of the horizontal component of the Peano curve (square filling curve)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07966v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the horizontal component of the Peano curve has quadratic variation equal the limit of quadratic variations along the Lebesgue partitions for grids of the form $3^{-n}p\mathbb{Z}+3^{-n}r$, $n=1,2,\ldots$, where $p$ is a rational number, while $r$ is irrational number, but the value of such quadratic variation depends on $p$.
  This also yields that the horizontal component of the Peano curve is an example of a deterministic function possessing local time (density of the occupation measure) with respect to the Lebesgue measure, whose local time can be expressed as the limit of normalized numbers of interval crossings by this function but the normalization is not a smooth function of the width of the intervals.
  These two features distinct the horizontal component of the Peano curve from the trajectories of the Wiener process, which is widely used in financial models.</description>

Abstract: We present the case-(1) multi-indexed orthogonal polynomials of a discrete variable for 8 types ((dual)($q$-)Hahn, three kinds of $q$-Krawtchouk and $q$-Meixner). Based on them and the case-(1) multi-indexed orthogonal polynomials of Racah, $q$-Racah, Meixner, little $q$-Jacobi and little $q$-Laguerre types, exactly solvable continuous time birth and death processes are obtained. Their discrete time versions (Markov chains) are also obtained for finite types.</description>
