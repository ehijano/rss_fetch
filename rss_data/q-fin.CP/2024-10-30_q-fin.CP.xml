      <title>Evaluating utility in synthetic banking microdata applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Financial regulators such as central banks collect vast amounts of data, but access to the resulting fine-grained banking microdata is severely restricted by banking secrecy laws. Recent developments have resulted in mechanisms that generate faithful synthetic data, but current evaluation frameworks lack a focus on the specific challenges of banking institutions and microdata. We develop a framework that considers the utility and privacy requirements of regulators, and apply this to financial usage indices, term deposit yield curves, and credit card transition matrices. Using the Central Bank of Paraguay's data, we provide the first implementation of synthetic banking microdata using a central bank's collected information, with the resulting synthetic datasets for all three domain applications being publicly available and featuring information not yet released in statistical disclosure. We find that applications less susceptible to post-processing information loss, which are based on frequency tables, are particularly suited for this approach, and that marginal-based inference mechanisms to outperform generative adversarial network models for these applications. Our results demonstrate that synthetic data generation is a promising privacy-enhancing technology for financial regulators seeking to complement their statistical disclosure, while highlighting the crucial role of evaluating such endeavors in terms of utility and privacy requirements.</description>

      <title>Emerging countries' counter-currency cycles in the face of crises and dominant currencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article examines how emerging economies use countercyclical monetary policies to manage economic crises and fluctuations in dominant currencies, such as the US dollar and the euro. Global economic cycles are marked by phases of expansion and recession, often exacerbated by major financial crises. These crises, such as those of 1997, 2008 and the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, have a particular impact on emerging economies due to their heightened vulnerability to foreign capital flows and exports.Counter-cyclical monetary policies, including interest rate adjustments, foreign exchange interventions and capital controls, are essential to stabilize these economies. These measures aim to mitigate the effects of economic shocks, maintain price stability and promote sustainable growth. This article presents a theoretical analysis of economic cycles and financial crises, highlighting the role of dominant currencies in global economic stability. Currencies such as the dollar and the euro strongly influence emerging economies, notably through exchange rate variations and international capital movements. Analysis of the monetary strategies of emerging economies, through case studies of Brazil, India and Nigeria, reveals how these countries use tools such as interest rates, foreign exchange interventions and capital controls to manage the impacts of crises and fluctuations in dominant currencies. The article also highlights the challenges and limitations faced by these countries, including structural and institutional constraints and the reactions of international financial markets.Finally, an econometric analysis using a Vector AutoRegression (VAR) model illustrates the impact of monetary policies on key economic variables, such as GDP, interest rates, inflation and exchange rates. The results show that emerging economies, although sensitive to external shocks, can adjust their policies to stabilize economic growth in the medium and long term.</description>

      <title>Fast Deep Hedging with Second-Order Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hedging exotic options in presence of market frictions is an important risk management task. Deep hedging can solve such hedging problems by training neural network policies in realistic simulated markets. Training these neural networks may be delicate and suffer from slow convergence, particularly for options with long maturities and complex sensitivities to market parameters. To address this, we propose a second-order optimization scheme for deep hedging. We leverage pathwise differentiability to construct a curvature matrix, which we approximate as block-diagonal and Kronecker-factored to efficiently precondition gradients. We evaluate our method on a challenging and practically important problem: hedging a cliquet option on a stock with stochastic volatility by trading in the spot and vanilla options. We find that our second-order scheme can optimize the policy in 1/4 of the number of steps that standard adaptive moment-based optimization takes.</description>
