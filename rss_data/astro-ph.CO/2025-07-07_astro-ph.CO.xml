      <title>Differentiable Halo Mass Prediction and the Cosmology-Dependence of Halo Mass Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern cosmological inference increasingly relies on differentiable models to enable efficient, gradient-based parameter estimation and uncertainty quantification. Here, we present a novel approach for predicting the abundance of dark matter haloes and their cosmology dependence using a differentiable, field-level neural network (NN) model, and study how well the cosmology dependence is captured by common parametrisations of the halo mass function (HMF), and by our NN-based approach. By training a 3D U-Net on initial density fields from fast N-body simulations with varying cosmological parameters, we enable direct, differentiable mapping from the linear density field to protohalo patches and their mass bins. Our method achieves competitive accuracy in identifying protohalo regions and in capturing the dependence of the HMF on cosmological parameters. Our NN derivatives agree well with finite differences of both analytical and emulated HMFs, at the level of the disagreement among the different models. We further demonstrate how the NN model can additionally be used to investigate the response of the HMF to changes in the initial Gaussian random field. Finally, we also demonstrate that a differentiable model can be used to extrapolate existing models at very high precision.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Model Misspecification in Simulation-Based Inference for Galaxy Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulation-based inference (SBI) has become an important tool in cosmology for extracting additional information from observational data using simulations. However, all cosmological simulations are approximations of the actual universe, and SBI methods can be sensitive to model misspecification - particularly when the observational data lie outside the support of the training distribution. We present a method to improve the robustness of cosmological analyses under such conditions. Our approach first identifies and discards components of the summary statistics that exhibit inconsistency across related simulators, then learns a transformation that brings the observation back within the support of the training distribution. We apply our method in the context of a recent SimBIG SBI galaxy clustering analysis using the wavelet scattering transform (WST) summary statistic. The original analysis struggled to produce robust constraints for certain subsets of WST coefficients, where the observational data appeared out-of-distribution (OOD) relative to the training data. We show that our method enables robust cosmological inference and resolves OOD issues, while preserving most of the constraining power. In particular, the improved SimBIG WST analysis yields $\Lambda$CDM constraints of $\Omega_m = 0.32^{+0.02}_{-0.02}$ and $\sigma_8 = 0.80^{+0.02}_{-0.02}$, which are respectively $1.4\times$ and $3.1\times$ tighter than those from a standard perturbation-theory-based power spectrum analysis, confirming the significant information gain of WST summary statistics. The proposed method is easily applicable to other cosmological SBI contexts and represents a step toward more robust SBI pipelines.</description>

      <title>Evolving Dark Sector and the Dark Dimension Scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: String theory naturally leads to the expectation that dark energy is not stable, and may be evolving as captured by the Swampland de Sitter conjectures. Moreover, motivated by the distance conjecture a unification of dark sector has been proposed, where the smallness of dark energy leads to one extra dimension of micron size with dark matter being the KK graviton excitations in this extra dimension. We consider the natural possibility that the radius of the dark dimension varies as the dark energy decreases, leading to the variation of the dark matter mass. This correlates the decrease of the dark energy with the variation of the dark matter mass as they depend on the variations of a scalar field $\phi$ controlling the radius of the extra dimension. A simple realization of this idea for small range of $\phi$ is captured by choosing a potential which is locally of the form $V=V_0\ {\rm exp}(-c\phi)$ and dark matter mass $m_{\rm DM}=m_0\ {\rm exp}(-c' \phi)$ where the sign of $\phi$ is chosen such that $c'\geq 0$ while we have two choices for the sign of $c$ depending on whether the dark dimension expands or shrinks when the dark energy dominates. We find excellent agreement with recent experimental data from DESI DR2 combined with SN measurements and reproduces the same significance as CPL parametrization with the added benefit of providing a natural explanation for the apparent phantom behavior ($w&lt;-1$) reported by DESI and DES based on a physical model. Regardless of the SN dataset, there is a preference for non-zero values of $c'$ and $c$ that are in the expected $O(1)$ range in Planck units as suggested by the Swampland criteria. In particular, there is a remarkable consistency with $c'\simeq 0.05 \pm 0.01$ for all dataset combinations including SN, and close to the experimental upper bound of $c'\lesssim 0.2$ demanded by the lack of detection of fifth force in the dark sector.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Cosmologically Coupled Black Holes from Planck 2018 and Other Cosmological Probes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmologically coupled black holes (CCBHs) are alternative black hole models whose masses evolve as $M \propto a^3$ on cosmological scales. This characteristic suggests that CCBHs could contribute to the accelerated expansion of the Universe. In this paper, I consider a CCBH model in which the cosmological constant is effectively induced, while the baryonic mass is conserved within conventional black holes. This model is motivated by the theoretical framework of Schwarzschild - de Sitter black holes. Assuming that the accelerated cosmic expansion is caused by CCBHs, I perform a cosmological parameter estimation using datasets including Planck 2018 CMB, CMB lensing, BAO, and supernovae. The analysis reveals notable shifts in cosmological parameters, such as $H_0 = 72.24^{+0.34}_{-0.35} \mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$, compared to the standard $\Lambda \mathrm{CDM}$. My $H_0$ constraint is consistent with the value $H_0 = 73.04 \pm 1.04 \mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$ reported by SH0ES within $1 \sigma$. However, the overall fit to the data worsens, with a total $\chi^2 = 2884.12$ for the CCBH model, compared to $\chi^2 = 2836.12$ for the $\Lambda$CDM model. I show that the effect of cosmological coupling is suppressed by a factor of $10^{-16}$ at $\sim$pc scales, rendering it negligible compared to the standard black hole mass in local astrophysical phenomena, although the CCBH model can explain the accelerated expansion.</description>

      <title>SKYSURF IX -- The Cosmic Optical and Infrared Background from Integrated Galaxy Light Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As part of the SKYSURF Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Legacy Archival program we present galaxy number counts which yield measurements of the extragalactic background light (EBL) at 15 different wavelengths. We have processed 82,752 HST images across 23 filters into 16,686 mosaics using the same software and processing pipeline throughout. Using 17/23 filters that give reliable galaxy counts, we constrain the integrated galaxy light (IGL) with a 1.5-9\% error between 0.3 and 1.6 $\mu$m in combination with 8 bands from WAVES (Wide Area VISTA Extragalactic Survey) and DEVILS (Deep Extragalactic Visible Legacy Survey). While HST was never intended to undertake large area surveys, through extensive quality control and filtering, we were able to extract a reliable and representative sample of fields distributed across the sky. Our final catalogs cover a combined $\approx 19.6 \deg^2$, with individual filters covering areas ranging from $\approx 0.16-7.0 \deg^2$. The combination of numerous independent sight-lines and area coverage allows us to reduce cosmic variance uncertainties in deep number counts to 0.06\%-1.8\%. For the first time we are able to establish a measurement of the IGL, $\mathrm{9.07 \pm 0.35 nW m^{-2} sr^{-1}}$, at 0.59 $\mu$m using HST data. We obtain a cosmic optical background value of $ 24.45 \pm 0.50 \mathrm{nW m^{-2} sr^{-1}}$. Different techniques used to measure the COB, both directly and indirectly, have recently converged indicating that the COB arises almost exclusively from processes within galaxies. This in combination with the recent values reported from New Horizons and very high energy (VHE) constraints leaves very little room for any diffuse emission coming from outside the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>Post-inflationary enhancement of adiabatic perturbations in modular cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that multi-field inflationary models with negligible turning in field space during inflation can lead to an effective sourcing of adiabatic from entropic perturbations {\it after} the end of inflation. We illustrate this general phenomenon with a detailed analysis of an inflationary model whose scalar potential is determined by modular invariance. Its entropic perturbations are frozen during inflation, but instead, they are converted into adiabatic perturbations in the first post-inflationary $e$-folds. The curvature power spectrum, giving rise to CMB fluctuations, reaches a novel and enhanced plateau in this process; we address the implications for the inflationary observables $A_{s}$, $n_{s}$ and $r$.</description>

      <title>J-PAS: Forecasting constraints on Neutrino Masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The large-scale structure survey J-PAS is taking data since October 2023. In this work, we present a forecast based on the Fisher matrix method to establish its sensitivity to the sum of the neutrino masses. We adapt the Fisher Galaxy Survey Code (FARO) to account for the neutrino mass under various configurations applied to galaxy clustering measurements. This approach allows us to test the sensitivity of J-PAS to the neutrino mass across different tracers, with and without non-linear corrections, and under varying sky coverage. We perform our forecast for two cosmological models: $\Lambda CDM + \sum m_\nu$ and $w_0w_a CDM + \sum m_\nu$. We combine our J-PAS forecast with Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data from the Planck Collaboration and Type Ia supernova (SN) data from Pantheon Plus. Our analysis shows that, for a sky coverage of 8,500 square degrees, J-PAS galaxy clustering data alone will constrain the sum of the neutrino masses to an upper limit of $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.32$\;eV for the $\Lambda CDM + \sum m_\nu$ model, and $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.36$\;eV for the $w_0w_a CDM + \sum m_\nu$ model. When combined with Planck data, the upper limit improves significantly. For J-PAS+Planck, we find $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.061$\;eV for the $\Lambda CDM + \sum m_\nu$ model, and for J-PAS+Planck+Pantheon Plus, we obtain $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.12$\;eV for the $w_0w_a CDM + \sum m_\nu$ model. These results demonstrate that J-PAS clustering measurements can play a crucial role in addressing challenges in the neutrino sector, including potential tensions between cosmological and terrestrial measurements of the neutrino mass, as well as in determining the mass ordering.</description>

      <title>Bimetric gravity improves the fit to DESI BAO and eases the Hubble tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate whether the latest combination of DESI DR2 baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements, cosmic microwave background (CMB) data (Planck 2018 + ACT), and Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) compilations (Pantheon+, Union3, and DES Y5) favor a dynamical dark energy component, and explore if such a scenario can simultaneously help resolve the Hubble tension. We contrast two frameworks: the widely used phenomenological $w_0 w_a$CDM model, and bimetric gravity, a fundamental modification of general relativity that naturally gives rise to phantom dark energy. The $w_0 w_a$CDM model is moderately preferred over $\Lambda$CDM, at the $2$-$4 \, \sigma$ level, when fitting DESI DR2 + CMB + SNe Ia, but it exacerbates the Hubble tension. By comparison, bimetric gravity provides a modest improvement in fit quality, at the $1 \, \sigma$ level, but, by inferring $H_0 = 69.0 \pm 0.4 \, \mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$, it partially eases the Hubble tension, from a $5 \,\sigma$ discrepancy to a $3.7 \, \sigma$ tension. Including locally calibrated SNe Ia brings the overall preference for the bimetric model over $\Lambda$CDM to the $2 \, \sigma$ level, comparable to that of the $w_0 w_a$CDM model when including the local SN Ia calibration.</description>

      <title>Shot noise in clustering power spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the `shot noise' bias in angular clustering power spectra observed from discrete samples of points is not noise, but rather a known additive contribution that naturally arises due to degenerate pairs of points. In particular, we show that the true shot noise contribution cannot have a `non-Poissonian' value, even though all point processes with non-trivial two-point statistics are non-Poissonian. Apparent deviations from the `Poissonian' value can arise when significant correlations or anti-correlations are localised on small spatial scales. However, such deviations always correspond to a physical difference in two-point statistics, not a difference in noise. In the context of simulations, if clustering is treated as the tracer of a discretised underlying density field, any sub- or super-Poissonian sampling of the tracer induces such small-scale modifications and vice versa; we show this explicitly using recent innovations in angular power spectrum estimation from discrete catalogues. Finally, we show that the full covariance of clustering power spectra can also be computed explicitly: it depends only on the two-, three- and four-point statistics of the point process. The usual Gaussian covariance approximation appears as one term in the shot noise contribution, which is non-diagonal even for Gaussian random fields and Poisson sampling.</description>

      <title>A halo model of extragalactic contamination to CMB lensing, delensing, and cross-correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CMB lensing reconstructions are a sensitive probe of the growth of structure across cosmic time and a key tool to sharpen investigations of the very early Universe via delensing. At present, a large fraction of this information is drawn from the temperature anisotropies, which are ultimately also the most informative when reconstructing lenses on arcminute scales and smaller. But extragalactic foreground emission from galaxies and clusters can contaminate these reconstructions, limiting our ability to use information from small-scale temperature anisotropies. We develop analytic predictions of the biases from the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich and cosmic infrared background to CMB lensing auto- and cross-correlations with low-redshift matter tracers, as well as B-mode delensing, based on a halo model for the dominant one- and two-halo contributions to the relevant foreground bi- and tri-spectra. The method is flexible enough to allow variations in cosmology, astrophysical modeling, experimental configurations and analysis choices, thus enabling an improved understanding of the uncertainties involved in current mitigation strategies. We find that the shape of the bias relative to the CMB lensing auto-spectrum signal is remarkably insensitive to changes in cosmological and astrophysical parameter values. On the other hand, the shape appears to depend on $\Omega_m$ for cross-correlations with low-redshift galaxies. We also clarify the ranges of redshifts and masses that simulations need to resolve in order to capture these effects accurately. Our code, CosmoBLENDER, is made publicly available.</description>

      <title>Torsion cosmology in the light of DESI, supernovae and CMB observational constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a torsion-based cosmological model within the Einstein-Cartan framework, analyze it using combined DESI, PantheonPlus/DESY5, and CMB datasets, a reveals several interesting features. The torsion parameter $\alpha$ shows a trend of change from $\alpha=0.042^{+0.035}_{-0.031}$ (CMB alone) to $\alpha=-0.0075\pm0.0058$ (full dataset), while remaining consistent with zero within $1.7\sigma$. The model demonstrates potential in addressing cosmological tensions, yielding $H_0 = 68.80\pm0.48~\mathrm{km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}$ and reducing the $S_8$ tension from $0.73\sigma$ to $0.1\sigma$ through its torsion-modified growth equation. Bayesian evidence analysis shows a clear preference for torsion cosmology in most dataset combinations, with the notable exception of CMB+DESI+DESY5 which slightly favors $\Lambda$CDM. Remarkably, substituting DESY5 with PantheonPlus data reverses this preference, yielding $\Delta\log\mathcal{Z} = -3.59$ - a strong indication of the model's viability. While not conclusive, these findings suggest torsion cosmology merits further investigation as a potential extension to $\Lambda$CDM.</description>

      <title>Deciphering Baryonic Feedback from ACT tSZ Galaxy Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The next generation of cosmology surveys will probe the matter distribution of the universe to unparalleled precision. To match this level of precision in cosmological parameter estimation, we need to use information at small scales of $\sim$ 1 Mpc, which requires an accurate model of baryonic feedback. In this paper, we employ the Dark Matter + Baryon (DMB) model, a flexible halo model that is well-fit to various hydrodynamical simulations, to extract information on baryonic feedback from galaxy cluster observables. Using a sample of thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich (tSZ) selected galaxy clusters from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) - with masses calibrated via weak lensing from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) - we develop a robust end-to-end pipeline that directly models the calibrated observables. Our analysis demonstrates that the tSZ Y-M relation can constrain several DMB model parameters, providing key insights into baryonic feedback effects on cosmic shear at the several percent level. We find a preference for intermediate to strong levels of feedback, which is both consistent with several hydrodynamic simulations and competitive with similar analyses performed on complementary probes. Finally, we discuss the implications of our results in the context of current and upcoming cosmic shear surveys.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Simulations with Massive Neutrinos: Efficiency and Accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constraining neutrino mass through cosmological observations relies on precise simulations to calibrate their effects on large scale structure, while these simulations must overcome computational challenges like dealing with large velocity dispersions and small intrinsic neutrino perturbations. We present an efficient N-body implementation with semi-linear neutrino mass response which gives accurate power spectra and halo statistics. We explore the necessity of correcting the expansion history caused by massive neutrinos and the transition between relativistic and non-relativistic components. The above method of including neutrino masses is built into the memory-, scalability-, and precision-optimized parallel N-body simulation code CUBE 2.0. Through a suite of neutrino simulations, we precisely quantify the neutrino mass effects on the nonlinear matter power spectra and halo statistics.</description>

      <title>Delensing CMB B-modes using galaxy surveys: the effect of galaxy bias and matter clustering non-linearities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The B-mode of polarization of the CMB is a uniquely powerful probe of gravitational waves produced in the very early Universe. But searches for primordial B-mode anisotropies must contend with gravitational lensing, which induces late-time B-modes not associated with gravitational waves. These lensing B-modes can be removed -- i.e., delensed -- using observations of the E-modes and a proxy of the matter fluctuations along the line of sight that caused the deflections. The number density and redshift reach of galaxy surveys such as the upcoming Rubin observatory offer attractive prospects for using them to delens B-mode data from CMB experiments such as the Simons Observatory, LiteBIRD or CMB-S4. However, stochasticity and non-linear galaxy bias may in principle decorrelate the galaxy field from the matter distribution responsible for the lensing effect, thus hindering efforts to delens B-modes. In addition, non-linear gravitational evolution and bias introduce non-Gaussianities in the large-scale structure which further complicate the modelling. We quantify these effects by populating an N-body simulation with a magnitude-limited, photometric sample of galaxies similar to Rubin's gold selection, and using them to delens CMB maps lensed by the same matter distribution. We find that pipelines that treat the galaxy overdensity as a Gaussian field will incur negligible bias on the inferred tensor-to-scalar ratio, r. Moreover, we show that even in a highly conservative scenario where only the linear bias of the galaxies can be determined, the bias on r arising from this simplification is well within statistical uncertainties for a cosmic-variance limited scenario where Rubin-like galaxies are used for delensing.</description>

      <title>On the interpretation of XRISM X-ray measurements of turbulence in the intracluster medium: a comparison with cosmological simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate whether the properties of turbulent gas motions recently measured via X-ray spectroscopy in the Coma cluster of galaxies by XRISM are in tension with the "classical" fluid picture of the intracluster medium on large scales, as produced by a typical high-resolution cosmological simulation. We use a high-resolution simulation of Coma-like cluster of galaxies and show that the Kolmogorov-like turbulence measured in the simulation yields to velocity structure functions and line-width that fully compatible with those measured by the XRISM observation of Coma. These results highlight the combined biases driven by the inhomogeneity of turbulence in the intracluster medium and by the X-ray weighting in observations, and appear to release the tension between the XRISM data and current numerical simulations, showing that a turbulent spectrum much steeper than Kolmogorov is not required by current observational data.</description>

      <title>The EoR 21-cm Bispectrum at $z=8.2$ from MWA data I: Foregrounds and preliminary upper limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We attempt to measure the $z = 8.2$ Epoch of Reionization (EoR) 21-cm bispectrum (BS) using Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) $154.2~\mathrm{MHz}$ data. We find that $B(k_{1\perp}, k_{2\perp}, k_{3\perp}, k_{1\parallel}, k_{2\parallel})$ the 3D cylindrical BS exhibits a foreground wedge, similar to $P(k_{1\perp},k_{1\parallel})$ the 21-cm cylindrical power spectrum. However, the BS foreground wedge, which depends on $(k_{1\perp},k_{1\parallel})$, $(k_{2\perp},k_{2\parallel})$ and $(k_{3\perp},k_{3\parallel})$ the three sides of a triangle, is more complicated. Considering various foreground avoidance scenarios, we identify the region where all three sides are outside the foreground wedge as the EoR window for the 21-cm BS. However, the EoR window is contaminated by a periodic pattern of spikes that arises from the periodic pattern of missing frequency channels in the data. We evaluate the binned 3D spherical BS for triangles of all possible sizes and shapes, and present results for $\Delta^3$ the mean cube brightness temperature fluctuations. The best $2\sigma$ upper limits we obtain for the EoR 21-cm signal are $\Delta^3_{\rm UL} = (1.81\times 10^3)^3~\mathrm{mK}^3$ at $k_1 = 0.008~\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ and $\Delta^3_{\rm UL} = (2.04\times 10^3)^3~\mathrm{mK}^3$ at $k_1 = 0.012~\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ for equilateral and squeezed triangles, respectively. These are foreground-dominated, and are many orders of magnitude larger than the predicted EoR 21-cm signal $(\sim 10^3 ~\mathrm{mK}^3)$.</description>

      <title>Are gravitational waves consistent with other probes of gravity and dark energy?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20182v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) astronomy has opened a new window on the Universe, allowing to obtain constraints on dark energy and gravity independent from other electromagnetic waves observations, such as large scale structure (LSS). For the purpose of investigating the consistency between different observations the effective field theory (EFT) of dark energy is a useful tool, allowing to derive model and parametrization independent consistency relations (CR) between the effective gravitational constant, the slip parameter, the gravitational and electromagnetic luminosity (EM) distance, and the speed of GWs. We test the constant brading CR, which is also satisfied by general relativity, by comparing for the first time the constraints obtained from LSS observations with those from GW events with and without electromagnetic counterparts, confirming the validity of the CR at the current level of experimental uncertainty. The event GW170817 and its electromagnetic counterpart provides a constraint of the effective gravitational constant with an accuracy comparable with LSS constraints, while the analysis of GW events without electromagnetic counterpart are consistent, but do not have a constraining power comparable to LSS observations. Beside allowing to test the consistency between independent observations, the CRs can be used to estimate the effective gravitational coupling with GWs at high redshift, where other observations are not available.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes as Coma Cluster Dark Matter and the Unresolved {\gamma}-Ray Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: If 0.1% of the dark matter in the Coma cluster is constituted by primordial black holes (PBHs) with masses ranging from 10^-19 to 10^-17 solar masses, then the observed GeV {\gamma}-ray emission from the cluster could potentially be attributed to Hawking radiation. The emitted spectrum is inversely proportional to the black hole's mass, meaning lighter PBHs radiate at higher energies, potentially falling within the GeV range. If 0.1% of the Coma cluster's dark matter is PBH in this mass range, a fit to the cluster's GeV emission is obtained. We then investigate the potential for constraining evaporating PBHs through cross-correlations between the Unresolved Gamma-Ray Background and weak gravitational lensing. Utilizing 12 years of Fermi-LAT observations and weak lensing measurements from the Dark Energy Survey Year 3, we assess whether such correlations can reveal a PBH {\gamma}-ray component. While a statistically significant correlation between the UGRB and large-scale structure has been observed, this signal is consistent with emission from clustered astrophysical sources such as blazars. Attributing a measurable fraction of the UGRB to PBH evaporation would require unrealistically large PBH abundances. We also draw attention to a cluster of Coma-like X-ray clusters, designated Draco X, observed at a redshift of z = 0.12. These systems, characterized by their significant X-ray emission from hot, diffuse intracluster gas, represent massive gravitationally bound structures. The existence and properties of such clusters at these redshifts provide crucial cosmological probes, offering insights into the formation and evolution of large-scale structure and the underlying cosmological parameters. Further investigation of Draco X and similar high-redshift clusters would yield additional constraints on large scale structure.</description>

      <title>On the ages of the stellar populations of galaxies at $z=0.1$-7</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have reported a non evolution of galaxy ages at redshifts higher than $z\sim$ 2.5, as well as galaxies older than the Universe. In this work, a sample of galaxies from JWST and HST was analysed via photometry to further understand this astronomical phenomenon. No prior cosmological parameters were assumed in the analysis, but the spectroscopic redshift. When compared to stellar population synthesis models, the results for mass-weighted galaxy ages indicate that the analysed objects seem to be divided into two subsets. The results for the subset with the majority of objects (60\% assuming a flat-$\Lambda$CDM cosmology) indicate an evolution of galaxy ages within the redshift range $z$=0.1-7.0, in the sense that higher redshift galaxies are younger than the Universe. Sources of systematic errors were discussed drawing into conclusion that degeneracies between reddening-age-metallicity, and/or AGN emission may explain the rest 40\% of the galaxies with ages older than expected from a flat-$\Lambda$CDM cosmology.</description>

      <title>Towards a unified scheme of blazar evolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques are increasingly used across astrophysics, enabled by the growing availability of data and improved acquisition methods. These approaches now support tasks from redshift estimation to source classification. In this work, we aim to (i) classify blazars from the Fermi 4LAC-DR3 catalogue, in particular to identify the likely origin of blazars of uncertain type (BCUs), and (ii) investigate the full blazar sample to study their structure and redshift-luminosity evolution. We focus especially on the transition region between Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars (FSRQs) and BL Lacertae objects (BL Lacs), which may yield insights into accretion disk evolution. We examine Changing-Look Blazars (CLBs) as potential intermediates in this transition. We implement a classification pipeline using both a strong benchmark model (XGBoost) and a foundation model pre-trained on millions of tabular datasets (TabPFN). By extracting and reducing the high-dimensional latent space of the best model, we provide a 2D representation of the blazar population. This reveals a continuum between FSRQs and BL Lacs, including CLBs as transitional sources. These results support a scenario of gradual evolution from radiatively efficient (FSRQ-like) to inefficient (BL Lac-like) accretion. Ultimately, we show that a single probability score, combined with the latent space, offers a new framework for interpreting blazar diversity beyond discrete classes.</description>

      <title>An Open System Approach to Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several major open problems in cosmology, including the nature of inflation, dark matter, and dark energy, share a common structure: they involve spacetime-filling media with unknown microphysics, and can be probed so far only through their gravitational effects. This observation motivates a systematic open-system approach to cosmology, in which gravity evolves in the presence of a generic, unobservable environment. In this work, we develop a general framework for open gravitational dynamics based on general relativity and the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism, carefully addressing the nontrivial constraints imposed by diffeomorphism invariance. At the quantum level, our path integral formulation computes the gravitational density matrix in perturbation theory around a semi-classical spacetime.
  As illustrative applications, we study inflation and the propagation of gravitational waves in classical regimes where environmental interactions are non-negligible. In the inflationary context, our framework reproduces the known Open Effective Field Theory of Inflation in the decoupling limit and extends it to include gravitational interactions. For gravitational waves, we derive the most general conservative and dissipative corrections to propagation. Remarkably, we find that the leading-order gravitational birefringence is dissipative in nature, whereas conservative birefringence appears only at higher derivative order, opposite to the electromagnetic case. Our results pave the way to modeling dissipative effects in the late universe.</description>

      <title>Ring formation from black hole superradiance through repeated particle production on bound orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultralight bosonic fields around a rotating black hole can extract energy and angular momentum through the superradiant instability and form a dense cloud. We investigate the scenario involving two scalar fields, $\phi$ and $\chi$, with a coupling term $\frac{1}{2}\lambda\phi\chi^2$, which is motivated by the multiple-axion framework. The ultralight scalar $\phi$ forms a cloud that efficiently produces $\chi$ particles non-perturbatively via parametric resonance, with a large mass hierarchy, $\mu_\chi \gg \mu_\phi$. Rather than escaping the system as investigated by previous studies, these $\chi$ particles remain bound, orbiting the black hole. Moreover, the particle production occurs primarily at the peak of the cloud's profile, allowing $\chi$ particles in quasi-circular orbits to pass repeatedly through resonant regions, leading to sustained amplification. This selective process naturally forms a dense ring of $\chi$ particles, with a mass ratio to the cloud fixed by $(\mu_\phi/\mu_\chi)^2$. Our findings reveal a novel mechanism for generating bound-state particles via parametric resonance, which also impacts the evolution of the cloud. This process can be probed through its imprint on binary dynamics and its gravitational-wave signatures.</description>

      <title>Constraining the axiverse with reionization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Axions that couple to electromagnetism are produced in the early Universe by, among other channels, freeze-in via the Primakoff process. For sufficiently large axion masses, the same coupling causes the axions to decay into two photons, which subsequently ionize the intergalactic medium. If this decay occurs in the redshift range $20 \lesssim z \lesssim 1100$, then the contribution to the cosmic microwave background optical depth $\tau_{\rm reio}$ can lead to a conflict with observations, excluding models with sufficiently strongly coupled, heavy axions and high reheating temperatures, $T_{\rm reh}$. Using large ensembles of explicit type IIB string theory models with up to $h^{1,1} = 100$ axions, we compute the full cosmic reionization history caused by the decays of multiple axions. We compare this to the posterior on the high-$z$ component of $\tau_{\rm reio}$ derived from model-independent constraints on the ionization state of the Universe, obtained in a full \textit{Planck} analysis presented in a companion paper. For $h^{1,1} = 20, 50, 100$, we find that approximately 15\%, 15\%, and 10\% of the models in the ensemble prefer $T_{\rm reh} \lesssim 10^{10}\,\text{GeV}$ at 95\% CL. We provide a publicly available code at:~\href{https://github.com/ZiwenYin/Reionization-with-multi-axions-decay}{github.com/ZiwenYin/Reionization-with-multi-axions-decay}, which computes the reionization history for arbitrary ensembles of decaying axions. Our analysis opens the door for future large-scale work studying the preference for low-temperature reheating in models with multiple axions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmological simulations provide a wealth of data in the form of point clouds and directed trees. A crucial goal is to extract insights from this data that shed light on the nature and composition of the Universe. In this paper we introduce CosmoBench, a benchmark dataset curated from state-of-the-art cosmological simulations whose runs required more than 41 million core-hours and generated over two petabytes of data. CosmoBench is the largest dataset of its kind: it contains 34 thousand point clouds from simulations of dark matter halos and galaxies at three different length scales, as well as 25 thousand directed trees that record the formation history of halos on two different time scales. The data in CosmoBench can be used for multiple tasks -- to predict cosmological parameters from point clouds and merger trees, to predict the velocities of individual halos and galaxies from their collective positions, and to reconstruct merger trees on finer time scales from those on coarser time scales. We provide several baselines on these tasks, some based on established approaches from cosmological modeling and others rooted in machine learning. For the latter, we study different approaches -- from simple linear models that are minimally constrained by symmetries to much larger and more computationally-demanding models in deep learning, such as graph neural networks. We find that least-squares fits with a handful of invariant features sometimes outperform deep architectures with many more parameters and far longer training times. Still there remains tremendous potential to improve these baselines by combining machine learning and cosmology to fully exploit the data. CosmoBench sets the stage for bridging cosmology and geometric deep learning at scale. We invite the community to push the frontier of scientific discovery by engaging with this dataset, available at https://cosmobench.streamlit.app</description>

Abstract: A supercooled phase transition in a nearly conformal dark sector can provide a natural setting for darkogenesis via its out-of-equilibrium dynamics, where a particle-antiparticle number asymmetry in the dark sector can be reprocessed into the visible sector, yielding the observed baryon asymmetry and an asymmetric dark matter. We consider a scenario where the number asymmetry is generated from the decay of a mother particle produced via parametric resonance during the phase transition induced due to its coupling to the dilaton associated with spontaneous breaking of scale invariance. It is shown that the correct baryon asymmetry and dark matter abundance can be realized for a dark phase transition at $\mathcal{O}(1) \, \rm GeV$, which can also explain the nano-Hz gravitational wave signal reported by pulsar timing array experiments. The scenario will be tested further in neutron-antineutron oscillation experiments.</description>

      <title>Impact of flavor condensate dark matter on accretion disk luminosity in spherical spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of dark matter condensates on the emission and thermodynamic properties of accretion disks, in a spherically-symmetric and static background. We focus on a class of models where dark matter originates from a genuine mass mixing among neutrino fields and compute the corrections to the dark matter's potential within galactic halo. We find a corresponding Yukawa correction induced by the dark matter energy-momentum tensor over the Newtonian potential. In so doing, employing Schwarzschild coordinates, and adopting the Novikov-Thorne formalism, we compute the geodesic structure and the corresponding disk-integrated luminosity profiles. Assuming a constant mass accretion rate, constituted solely by baryonic matter, we find non-negligible deviations in both the disk structure and radiative output, as compared to the standard Schwarzschild case. Afterwards, we discuss physical consequences of our Yukawa correction, comparing it with recent literature, predicting similar potentials, albeit derived from extended theories of gravity. Accordingly, we thus speculate to use our results to distinguish among candidates of dark matter. Indeed, our findings suggest that incoming high-precision observations of accretion disk spectra may provide a tool to probe dark matter's nature under the form of particles, extended theories of gravity or condensates.</description>

      <title>Stability and Thermodynamics of a Generalized Power-Law Dark Energy Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a generalized power-law dark energy equation of state of the form \( p = w\rho - \beta\rho^m \) in a flat FLRW universe, analyzing its dynamical stability and thermodynamic consistency. The model exhibits a rich phase space structure, with an effective cosmological constant \(\rho^* = [(1+w)/\beta]^{1/(m-1)}\) emerging as a stable attractor for \((w &lt; -1,~ m &gt; 1)\). Notably, the universe evolves from an early de Sitter phase (\(w \to -1\)) to a late-time de Sitter-like one with phantom crossing (\(w(z) &lt; -1\)), aligning with DESI observations. Dynamical analysis reveals that the \(m &gt; 1\) regime avoids ghost instabilities while accommodating phantom behavior, with \(m = 2\) providing particular theoretical advantages. Thermodynamically, the Generalized Second Law holds when the null energy condition \(\rho + p \geq 0\) is satisfied, which naturally occurs for \(\rho \geq \rho^*\). The model's compatibility with both observational data and fundamental thermodynamic principles suggests it as a viable framework for describing late-time cosmic acceleration, resolving tensions associated with phantom crossing while maintaining entropy dominance of the cosmological horizon.</description>

      <title>Search for spatial coincidences between galaxy mergers and Fermi-LAT 4FGL-DR4 sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic search for spatial association between a high-confidence sample of 3,166 morphologically selected galaxy mergers detected through SDSS imaging and the 4FGL-DR4 catalog of gamma-ray sources detected by the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT). Using a conservative 4$\sigma$ positional uncertainty threshold and a Poisson-based statistical framework, we identify 21 statistically significant associations with match probabilities $p &lt; 0.05$. Among these are known classes of gamma-ray emitters such as flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs), BL Lacertae objects (BLL), and radio galaxies bolstering the hypothesis that merger-driven processes can fuel high-energy activity. Intriguingly, five of the associated sources remain unclassified in 4FGL-DR4, hinting at a possible link between galaxy mergers and a hitherto unrecognized population of gamma-ray sources. The dominance of AGN-like matches supports the scenario in which mergers trigger accretion onto central supermassive black holes, initiating AGN activity observable at gamma-ray energies. Moreover, the recurrent presence of unassociated sources among secure matches underscores the potential of merger catalogs as physically motivated priors in gamma-ray source identification efforts. This work constitutes the first dedicated effort to explore associations between gamma-ray sources and a large, morphologically selected sample of galaxy mergers, opening new avenues for understanding the role of interactions in high-energy astrophysics. We additionally examined the sample of 70 galaxy pairs from the Canadian Network for Observational Cosmology Field Galaxy Redshift Survey and found no statistically significant matches, with $p &lt; 0.05$ within the 4$\sigma$ positional uncertainty threshold.</description>

      <title>The Study on Modified Theories of General Relativity: A Differential Geometric Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The introduction of General Relativity (GR) in 1915 revolutionized our understanding of gravity, but over time, its limitations in explaining phenomena like dark energy, dark matter, and quantum gravity have motivated alternative theories. Early modifications, such as Weyl's 1919 proposal, focused on adding higher-order terms to the Einstein-Hilbert action. GR's non-renormalizability further strengthened the case for extending it. A central theme of modern gravity research is modifying the geometric structure, often by changing the gravitational Lagrangian. This leads to theories such as teleparallel and symmetric teleparallel gravity, utilizing torsion or non-Levi-Civita connections, with differential geometry providing the essential framework.
  This thesis explores several modified gravity models. Chapter 1 introduces necessary mathematical tools. Chapter 2 develops a novel parametrization of the deceleration parameter, constrained using MCMC and observational data, and applies it to f(Q) gravity. Chapter 3 embeds the LambdaCDM model into f(Q, L\_m) gravity with non-minimal coupling, producing analytic solutions and matching observations through cosmographic analysis. Chapter 4 considers Bianchi-I spacetime in f(R, L\_m) gravity with observational constraints to measure anisotropy. Chapter 5 presents wormhole solutions in f(Q, T) gravity with conformal symmetries. Chapter 6 explores wormholes in f(R, L\_m) with non-commutative geometry, analyzing shape functions, energy conditions, and stability. Chapter 7 studies Big Bang Nucleosynthesis in f(T) gravity, constraining hybrid models using early- and late-time data, and validating intermediate epochs via cosmography.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Hole Ringdown: the Irreducible Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Independently from the formation mechanism of primordial black holes in the early universe, their generation is accompanied by a ringdown phase during which they relax to a stationary configuration and gravitational waves under the form of quasinormal modes are emitted. Such gravitational waves generate an irreducible and unavoidable stochastic background which is testable by current and future experiments. In particular, the presence of a primordial black hole ringdown allows to significantly constrain the idea of extremely supermassive black holes to comprise the entire dark matter of the universe.</description>

      <title>Inflaton perturbations through an Ultra-Slow Roll transition and Hamilton-Jacobi attractors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the behaviour of the gauge invariant scalar field perturbations in an analytic inflationary model that transitions from slow roll to an ultra-slow roll (USR) phase. We find that the numerical solution of the Mukhanov-Sasaki equation is well described by Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) theory, as long as the appropriate branches of the Hamilton-Jacobi solutions are invoked: Modes that exit the horizon during the slow roll phase evolve into the USR as described by the first HJ branch, up to a subdominant $\mathcal{O}(k^2/H^2)$ correction to the Hamilton-Jacobi prediction for their final amplitude that we compute, indicating the influence of neglected gradient terms. Modes that exit during the USR phase are described by a separate HJ branch (very close to de Sitter) once they become sufficiently superhorizon, obtained by the shift $\epsilon_2 \rightarrow \tilde{\epsilon}_2\simeq \epsilon_2+6$. This transition is similar to the conveyor belt concept put forward in our previous work [1] and the intuition deriving from it. We further discuss implications for the validity of the stochastic equations arising from the Hamilton-Jacobi formulation. We conclude that if appropriately used, the Hamilton-Jacobi attractors can describe the dynamics of long wavelength inflationary inhomogeneities beyond slow roll.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the dynamics of pure scalar fields rolling on an exponential potential in the absence of any additional background fluid and demonstrate the existence of self-tracking solutions in which the self-perturbations of the scalar field act as an effective radiation background. The validity of these solutions is demonstrated through both analytic techniques and numerical simulations using CosmoLattice. We discuss applications to string cosmologies with significant trans-Planckian field excursions between inflation and BBN, including the required initial level of scalar perturbations to avoid overshoot.</description>

      <title>From $U(1) \times U(1)$ Symmetry Breaking to Majoron Cosmology: Insights from NANOGrav 15-year Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the cosmology of a modified majoron model motivated by the need to protect a global $U(1)$ symmetry from gravity-induced hard explicit breaking (by $d \leq 4$ operators) at the Planck scale. The model extends the Standard Model by introducing a gauged $U(1)_{B-L}$ and an approximate global $U(1)$ symmetry, each spontaneously broken by a corresponding complex scalar singlet. This setup gives rise to a network of effectively global and local cosmic strings, whose stochastic gravitational wave signals can jointly account for the spectrum observed by the NANOGrav collaboration, particularly for majoron masses $m_{\chi} &lt; 10^{-23}$ eV. Although the fit is not as strong as that from supermassive black hole mergers, the model still provides an alternative explanation rooted in high-energy physics. The model also generates light neutrino masses via the seesaw mechanism and avoids cosmological constraints from $\Delta N_{\text{eff}}$, CMB anisotropies, and isocurvature fluctuations. Although the majoron can contribute to dark matter through thermal, coherent oscillation, and string-induced production mechanisms, its relic abundance remains subdominant in the NANOGrav-compatible region. In contrast, the measured dark matter relic density is achievable at higher $m_\chi$, though at the cost of tension with cosmological bounds. If the NANOGrav fits are viewed as constraints, given their comparatively lower Bayes factors, they yield bounds that are significantly stronger than those imposed by the CMB and other cosmological data.</description>

      <title>Effective Equation of State Oscillations at Matter-Radiation Equality and Primordial Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The theory controlling the Universe's evolution in the classical regime has to be motivated by particle physics reasoning and should also generate inflation and dark energy eras in a unified way. One such framework is $F(R)$ gravity. In this work we examine a class of exponential deformations of $R^2$ gravity motivated by fundamental physics of scalaron evolution in a de Sitter background. As we show this class of models describe both inflation and the dark energy era in a viable way compatible with the Planck constraints on inflation and the cosmological parameters. Regarding the inflationary era, the exponentially deformed $R^2$ model also yields a rescaled Einstein-Hilbert term which remarkably does not affect the dynamics and the inflationary evolution is identical to that of an $R^2$ model. The dark energy era is also found to be viable and mimics the $\Lambda$-Cold-Dark-Matter model. More importantly, this class of $F(R)$ gravity exponential $R^2$ deformations also has an important characteristic, and specifically it yields total equation of state oscillations deeply in the matter domination era, for redshifts $z\sim 3400$, so near the matter-radiation equality. These total equation of state deformations at such a large redshift may directly affect the energy spectrum of the primordial gravitational waves. Indeed as we show, the effect is measurable and it leads to an enhancement of the tensor perturbations energy spectrum for low frequencies probed by the future LiteBIRD mission. This enhancement might have a measurable effect on the $B$-modes of the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation and thus may be detectable by the LiteBIRD mission. Only a handful of theoretical frameworks can generate the gravitational wave pattern generated by the class of exponentially deformed $R^2$ models we presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The China Space Station Telescope (CSST) is a next-generation Stage-IV sky survey telescope, distinguished by its large field of view (FoV), high image quality, and multi-band observation capabilities. It can simultaneously conduct precise measurements of the Universe by performing multi-color photometric imaging and slitless spectroscopic surveys. The CSST is equipped with five scientific instruments, i.e. Multi-band Imaging and Slitless Spectroscopy Survey Camera (SC), Multi-Channel Imager (MCI), Integral Field Spectrograph (IFS), Cool Planet Imaging Coronagraph (CPI-C), and THz Spectrometer (TS). Using these instruments, the CSST is expected to make significant contributions and discoveries across various astronomical fields, including cosmology, galaxy and active galactic nuclei (AGN), the Milky Way and nearby galaxies, stars, exoplanets, Solar System objects, astrometry, and transients and variable sources. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the CSST instruments, observational capabilities, data products, and scientific potential.</description>

      <title>Introducing the Phoebos simulation: galaxy properties at the dawn of galaxy formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) now allows us to observe galaxies at the end of cosmic dawn ($z \sim 10-15$) with unprecedented detail, revealing their morphologies, sizes, and internal structures. These observations offer crucial insights into the physical processes driving early galaxy formation. In this work, we introduce the Phoebos hydrodynamical cosmological simulation, a state-of-the-art 100 Mpc volume designed to study the formation and evolution of galaxies at the end of cosmic dawn and into the epoch of reionization. Phoebos includes a stellar feedback model that is intentionally weak, in order to address the high abundance of massive galaxies seen by JWST at early epochs. At variance with most large cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, we do not employ an effective equation of state model, instead our radiative cooling model allows us to capture the multi-phase nature of the gas inside and around galaxies. Phoebos reproduces key observables of early galaxy formation at $z \gtrsim 8$, including the stellar mass function and the stellar-to-halo mass relation. It also recovers the observed slope of the stellar size-to-mass relation and matches the specific star formation rate remarkably well. These results suggest that highly efficient star formation in the presence of only mild regulation from stellar feedback, drives early galaxy growth, supporting a scenario of rapid stellar mass assembly during cosmic dawn. There are indications in the cosmic star formation density that, at lower redshifts, Phoebos might overpredict the stellar mass within the systems, suggesting that a transition to a stronger stellar feedback may be necessary to reproduce later-time observations. These results highlight the potential of Phoebos to interpret JWST observations and to probe the evolving physical processes that shape galaxy formation.</description>

      <title>Science of the LISA mission: A Summary for the European Strategy for Particle Physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The LISA mission is an international collaboration between ESA, its member states, and NASA, for the detection of gravitational waves from space. It was adopted in January 2024 and is scheduled for launch in the mid-2030's. It will be a constellation of three identical spacecraft forming a near-equilateral triangle in an heliocentric orbit, transferring laser beams over $2.5 \cdot 10^6$ km long arms. Laser interferometry is used to track separations between test masses, thus measuring spacetime strain variations as a function of time. LISA Science Objectives tackle many open questions in astrophysics, fundamental physics and cosmology, including ESA's Cosmic Vision questions "What are the fundamental laws of the universe?" and "How did the universe originate and of what is it made?". In this contribution, based on the LISA Red Book, we present a summary of the LISA Science Objectives relevant for the European Strategy for Particle Physics.</description>

      <title>Recasting Experimental Constraints on Relativistic Magnetic Monopoles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic monopoles with masses up to $10^{14}$ GeV can be accelerated to relativistic velocities in Galactic and intergalactic magnetic fields. The cosmic flux of relativistic monopoles is constrained by various experiments, with the limits given as functions of the monopole velocity (Lorentz factor) at the detectors. The velocity, however, is usually treated as a free parameter due to the ambiguity in the computation of the acceleration before the monopoles arrive at Earth. We explicitly evaluate the velocity by exploiting recent studies on cosmic magnetic fields and the monopole acceleration therein, to recast experimental limits in terms of the mass of monopoles. By applying our method to various terrestrial experiments, including the Pierre Auger Observatory, IceCube, MACRO, and the upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory, as well as to astrophysical constraints, we report limits on the flux of monopoles for a wide range of monopole masses. We also highlight the role of monopoles as messengers of cosmic magnetic fields, and discuss the possibility of using monopole experiments to probe intergalactic magnetic fields.</description>

Abstract: We examine scale and redshift dependence of mass-property relations (MPRs) for five hot gas properties of two large group- and cluster-scale halo samples realized by the IllustrisTNG, TNG-Cluster and FLAMINGO cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. For intrinsic properties of i) hot gas mass ($M_{\rm gas}$), ii) spectroscopic-like temperature ($T_{\rm sl}$), iii) soft-band X-ray luminosity ($L_{\rm X}$), and iv) X-ray ($Y_{\rm X}$) and v) Sunyaev-Zel'dovich ($Y_{\rm SZ}$) thermal energies, we use MPR parameters to infer mass proxy quality (MPQ) -- the implied scatter in total halo mass conditioned on a property -- for halos with $M_{\rm 500c} \geq 10^{13}{\, {\rm M}_\odot}$ at redshifts, $z \in \{0, 0.5, 1, 2\}$. We find: (1) in general, scaling relation slopes and covariance display moderate to strong dependence on halo mass, with redshift dependence secondary, (2) for halos with $M_{\rm 500c} &gt; 10^{14}{\, {\rm M}_\odot}$, scalings of $M_{\rm gas}$ and $Y_{\rm SZ}$ simplify toward self-similar slope and constant intrinsic scatter (5 and 10%, respectively) nearly independent of scale, making both measures ideal for cluster finding and characterization to $z=2$, (3) halo mass-conditioned likelihoods of hot gas mass and thermal energy at fixed halo mass closely follow a log-normal form, (4) despite normalization differences ranging up to $0.4$ dex, there is good qualitative, and often quantitative, agreement between the scale-dependent slopes and property covariance of the two simulations. Slopes show appreciable redshift dependence at the group scale, while redshift dependence of the scatter is exhibited by low mass FLAMINGO halos only, (5) property correlations are largely consistent between the simulations, with values that mainly agree with existing empirical measurements. We close with a literature survey placing our MPR slopes and intrinsic scatter estimates into context.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Morphology of Galactic Cirrus in Deep Optical Imaging</title>

Abstract: Imaging of optical Galactic cirrus, the spatially resolved form of diffuse Galactic light, provides important insights into the properties of the diffuse interstellar medium (ISM) in the Milky Way. While previous investigations have focused mainly on the intensity characteristics of optical cirrus, their morphological properties remain largely unexplored. In this study, we employ several complementary statistical approaches -- local intensity statistics, angular power spectrum / $\Delta$-variance analysis, and Wavelet Scattering Transform analysis -- to characterize the morphology of cirrus in deep optical imaging data. We place our investigation of optical cirrus into a multi-wavelength context by comparing the morphology of cirrus seen with the Dragonfly Telephoto Array to that seen with space-based facilities working at longer wavelengths (Herschel 250~$\mu m$, WISE 12~$\mu m$, and Planck radiance), as well as with structures seen in the DHIGLS {\HI} column density map. Our statistical methods quantify the similarities and the differences of cirrus morphology in all these datasets. The morphology of cirrus at visible wavelengths resembles that of far-infrared cirrus more closely than that of mid-infrared cirrus; on small scales, anisotropies in the cosmic infrared background and systematics may lead to differences. Across all dust tracers, cirrus morphology can be well described by a power spectrum with a common power-law index $\gamma\sim-2.9$. We demonstrate quantitatively that optical cirrus exhibits filamentary, coherent structures across a broad range of angular scales. Our results offer promising avenues for linking the analysis of coherent structures in optical cirrus to the underlying physical processes in the ISM that shape them. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these morphological signatures can be leveraged to distinguish and disentangle cirrus from extragalactic light.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the galaxy formation histories predicted by a neural network in pure dark matter simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16079v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a series of galaxy properties computed using the merger trees and environmental histories from dark matter only cosmological simulations, using a semi-recurrent neural network producing self-consistent predictions of galaxy evolution, and using stochastic improvements to this model based on similarly predicted Fourier Transforms. We apply these methods to the dark matter only runs of the IllustrisTNG simulations to understand the effects of baryon removal, and to the gigaparsec-volume pure dark matter simulation Uchuu, to understand the effects of the lower resolution or alternative metrics for halo properties. We find that the machine learning model recovers accurate summary statistics derived from the predicted star formation and stellar metallicity histories, and correspondent spectroscopy and photometry. However, the inaccuracies of the model's application to dark simulations are substantial for low mass and slowly growing haloes. For these objects, the halo mass accretion rate is exaggerated due to the lack of stellar feedback, yet the formation of the halo can be severely limited by the absence of low mass progenitors in a low resolution simulation. Furthermore, differences in the structure and environment of higher mass haloes results in an overabundance of red, quenched galaxies. These results signify progress towards a machine learning model which builds high fidelity mocks based on a physical interpretation of the galaxy-halo connection, yet they illustrate the need to account for differences in halo properties and the resolution of the simulation.</description>

      <title>Simulation-Based Inference Benchmark for Weak Lensing Cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17975v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Standard cosmological analysis, which relies on two-point statistics, fails to extract the full information of the data. This limits our ability to constrain with precision cosmological parameters. Thus, recent years have seen a paradigm shift from analytical likelihood-based to simulation-based inference. However, such methods require a large number of costly simulations. We focus on full-field inference, considered the optimal form of inference. Our objective is to benchmark several ways of conducting full-field inference to gain insight into the number of simulations required for each method. We make a distinction between explicit and implicit full-field inference. Moreover, as it is crucial for explicit full-field inference to use a differentiable forward model, we aim to discuss the advantages of having this property for the implicit approach. We use the sbi_lens package which provides a fast and differentiable log-normal forward model. This forward model enables us to compare explicit and implicit full-field inference with and without gradient. The former is achieved by sampling the forward model through the No U-Turns sampler. The latter starts by compressing the data into sufficient statistics and uses the Neural Likelihood Estimation algorithm and the one augmented with gradient. We perform a full-field analysis on LSST Y10 like weak lensing simulated mass maps. We show that explicit and implicit full-field inference yield consistent constraints. Explicit inference requires 630 000 simulations with our particular sampler corresponding to 400 independent samples. Implicit inference requires a maximum of 101 000 simulations split into 100 000 simulations to build sufficient statistics (this number is not fine tuned) and 1 000 simulations to perform inference. Additionally, we show that our way of exploiting the gradients does not significantly help implicit inference.</description>

      <title>Selection of high-redshift Lyman-Break Galaxies from broadband and wide photometric surveys</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08062v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the possibility of selecting high-redshift Lyman-Break Galaxies (LBG) using current and future broadband wide photometric surveys, such as UNIONS or the Vera C. Rubin LSST. This work is conducted in the context of DESI-II, the next phase of DESI, which will start around 2029. We use deep imaging data from HSC and CLAUDS on the COSMOS and XMM-LSS fields. To predict the selection performance of LBGs with image quality similar to UNIONS, we degrade the $u, g, r, i$ and $z$ bands to UNIONS depth. The Random Forest algorithm is trained with the $u,g,r,i$ and $z$ bands to classify LBGs in the $2.5 &lt; z &lt; 3.5$ range. We find that fixing a target density budget of $1,100$ deg$^{-2}$, the Random Forest approach gives a density of $z&gt;2$ targets of $873$ deg$^{-2}$, and a density of $493$ deg$^{-2}$ of confirmed LBGs after spectroscopic confirmation with DESI. This UNIONS-like selection was tested in a dedicated spectroscopic observation campaign of 1,000 targets with DESI on the COSMOS field, providing a safe spectroscopic sample with a mean redshift of 3. This sample is used to derive forecasts for DESI-II, assuming a sky coverage of 5,000 deg$^2$. We predict uncertainties on Alcock-Paczynski parameters $\alpha_\perp$ and $\alpha_{\parallel}$ to be 0.7$\%$ and 1$\%$ for $2.6&lt;z&lt;3.2$, resulting in a potential 2$\%$ measurement of the dark energy fraction at high redshift. Additionally, we estimate the uncertainty in local non-Gaussianity and predict $\sigma_{f_{\rm NL}}\approx 7$, which would be comparable to the current best precision achieved by \textit{Planck}. The latter forecast suggests that achieving the precision required to place stringent constraints on inflationary models ($\sigma_{f_{\rm NL}} \approx 1$) using spectroscopic galaxy surveys necessitates the development of a next-generation (Stage V) spectroscopic survey.</description>

Abstract: We derive the one-loop perturbation kernels for a minimal modified gravity model in which dark energy is coupled to dark matter via a constant coupling. We derive the time-dependent kernels via analytical and numerical solutions and provide accurate fitting functions.

      <title>Selecting samples of galaxies with fewer Fingers-of-God</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10587v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The radial positions of galaxies inferred from their measured redshift appear distorted due to their peculiar velocities. We argue that the contribution from stochastic velocities -- which gives rise to Fingers-of-God (FoG) anisotropy in the inferred maps -- does not lend itself to perturbative modelling already on scales targeted by current experiments. To get around this limitation, we propose to remove FoG using data-driven indicators of their abundance that are local in nature and thus avoid selection biases. In particular, we show that the scale where the measured power spectrum quadrupole changes sign is tightly anti-correlated with both the satellite fraction and the velocity dispersion, and can thus be used to select galaxy samples with fewer FoG. In addition, we show that excluding galaxies in haloes more massive than a given mass threshold can help to discard many of the most problematic galaxies. Such selection could be achieved in practice using maps of the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich distortion of the cosmic microwave background frequency spectrum. These techniques could potentially improve reconstructions of the large-scale velocity and displacement fields from the redshift-space positions of galaxies. They may also extend the reach of perturbative models for galaxy clustering, though in practice we find only marginal gains when fitting one-loop EFTofLSS models to simulations with mitigated FoG due to the relevance of other effects entering at two-loop order.</description>

      <title>ALP production from light primordial black holes: The role of superradiance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14589v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Light primordial black holes (LPBHs) with masses in the range $10$~g~$\leq M_{\rm BH} \leq 10^9$~g, although they evaporate before Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, can play a significant role in the production of both dark matter and dark radiation. In particular, LPBHs can evaporate into light axions or axion-like particles (ALPs) with masses $m_a \lesssim$~MeV, contributing to the effective number of neutrino species, $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$. Additionally, heavy scalar particles known as {\em moduli}, predicted by string theory, can be produced both via Hawking evaporation and through amplification by a mechanism called {\em superradiant instability} in the case of spinning primordial black holes (PBHs). These moduli can subsequently decay into ALPs, further amplifying their abundance. In this work, we calculate the number density of ALPs in the presence of moduli enhanced by superradiance for Kerr PBHs. Using current limits on $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ from Planck satellite observations, we derive updated constraints on this scenario.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15511v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Astrophysical foreground substraction is crucial to retrieve the cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization out of the observed data. Recent efforts have been carried out towards the development of a minimally informed component separation method to handle a priori unknown foreground spectral energy distributions (SEDs), while being able to estimate both cosmological, foreground, and potentially instrumental parameters, jointly. In this paper, we develop a semi-analytical performance forecasting framework for the minimally informed method and we validate it by comparing its results against direct sampling of the harmonic-based likelihood and the pixel domain implementation MICMAC. We then use the forecasting tool to demonstrate the robustness of the bias correction procedure introduced in the minimally informed approach. We find that a data-driven approach based on the currently available observational data is enough to efficiently regularize the bias of the method.</description>

      <title>Delensing for Precision Cosmology: Optimizing Future CMB B-mode Surveys to Constrain r</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18790v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The detection of primordial B-modes, a key probe of cosmic inflation, is increasingly challenged by contamination from weak gravitational lensing B-modes induced by large-scale structure (LSS). We present a delensing pipeline designed to enhance the sensitivity to the inflationary parameter r, minimizing reliance on foreground mitigation during lensing reconstruction. Using simulations of Simons Observatory-like CMB observations and Euclid-like LSS surveys in the Northern hemisphere, we demonstrate that excluding low-l modes (l&lt;200) effectively mitigates foreground biases, enabling robust lensing potential reconstruction using observed CMB polarization maps. We reconstruct the lensing potential with a minimum-variance (MV) quadratic estimator (QE) applied to CMB polarization data and combine this with external LSS tracers to improve delensing efficiency. Two complementary methods, the Gradient-order template and the Inverse-lensing approach, are used to generate lensing B-mode templates, which are cross-correlated with observed B-modes. This achieves a 40 percent reduction in the uncertainty of r with CMB-only reconstruction, improving to 60 percent when incorporating external LSS tracers. We validate our results using both the Hamimeche and Lewis likelihood and a Gaussian approximation, finding consistent constraints on r. Our work establishes a streamlined framework for ground-based CMB experiments, demonstrating that synergies with LSS surveys significantly enhance sensitivity to primordial gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>Thawing Dark Energy and Massive Neutrinos in Light of DESI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00126v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent analyses have shown that a dynamic dark energy modeled by the CPL parameterization of the dark energy equation of state (EoS) can ease constraints on the total neutrino mass compared to the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. This helps reconcile cosmological and particle physics measurements of $\sum m_\nu$. In this study, we investigate the robustness of this effect by assessing the extent to which the CPL assumption influences the results. We examine how alternative EoS parameterizations - such as Barboza-Alcaniz (BA), Jassal-Bagla-Padmanabhan (JBP), and a physically motivated thawing parameterization that reproduces the behavior of various scalar field models - affect estimates of $\sum m_\nu$. Although both the BA and JBP parameterizations relax the constraints similarly to the CPL model, the JBP parameterization still excludes the inverted neutrino mass hierarchy at $\sim 2.1\;\sigma$ with $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.096$\;eV. The thawing parameterization excludes the inverted hierarchy at $\sim 3.3\sigma$ and yields tighter constraints, comparable to those of the $\Lambda$CDM model, with $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.071$\;eV. Finally, we show that the thawing model can be mapped into the BA and JBP $w_0$-$w_a$ parameter space, with the apparent preference for the phantom regime actually supporting quintessence (non-phantom) models.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate that primordial black holes (PBHs) lighter than $10^9 \, \text{g}$, which evaporated before the Big Bang nucleosynthesis, can induce significant isocurvature perturbations due to their biased clustering amplitude and the branching ratio of the Hawking radiation differing from the abundance ratio. By leveraging the upper bound on the isocurvature perturbations from the cosmic microwave background anisotropies reported by the Planck collaboration, we derive a new upper bound on the abundance of these light PBHs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15943v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the null tests of spatial flatness and the flat $\Lambda$CDM model using the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data measured by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), the cosmic chronometers (CCH) $H(z)$ data, and the Union3 and Pantheon Plus type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) datasets. We propose a novel non-parametric reconstruction of $F_{AP}$, $D_M/r_d$ and $D'_M/r_d$ from the DESI BAO data to perform the $Ok$ diagnostic, and we also conduct the $Ok$ diagnostic using the combination of CCH and SNe Ia data. The novel method avoids the issue of the dependence on cosmological parameters such as the value of the Hubble constant. There is no evidence of deviation from the flat $\Lambda$CDM model, nor is there any indication of dynamical dark energy found in the observational data. Since we employ a non-parametric reconstruction method, all the conclusions drawn in this paper remain robust and agnostic to any cosmological model and gravitational theory.</description>

      <title>Evolution of clustering in cosmological models with time-varying dark energy</title>

Abstract: Observations favor cosmological models with a time-varying dark energy component. But how does dynamical dark energy (DDE) influence the growth of structure in an expanding Universe? We investigate this question using high-resolution $N$-body simulations based on a DDE cosmology constrained by first-year DESI data (DESIY1$+$DDE), characterized by a 4% lower Hubble constant ($H_0$) and 10% higher matter density ($\Omega_0$) than the Planck-2018 $\Lambda$CDM model. We examine the impact on the matter power spectrum, halo abundances, clustering, and Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations (BAO). We find that DESIY1$+$DDE exhibits a 10% excess in power at small scales and a 15% suppression at large scales, driven primarily by its higher $\Omega_0$. This trend is reflected in the halo mass function: DESIY1$+$DDE predicts up to 70% more massive halos at $z = 2$ and a 40% excess at $z = 0.3$. Clustering analysis reveals a 3.71% shift of the BAO peak towards smaller scales in DESIY1$+$DDE, consistent with its reduced sound horizon compared to Planck18 Measurements of the BAO dilation parameter $\alpha$, using halo samples with DESI-like tracer number densities across $0 &lt; z &lt; 1.5$, agree with the expected DESIY1$+$DDE-to-Planck18 sound horizon ratio. After accounting for cosmology-dependent distances, the simulation-based observational dilation parameter closely matches DESI Y1 data. We find that the impact of DDE is severely limited by current observational constraints, which strongly favor cosmological models -- whether including DDE or not -- with a tightly constrained parameter $\Omega_0h^2\approx 0.143$, within 1-2% uncertainty. Indeed, our results demonstrate that variations in cosmological parameters, particularly $\Omega_0$, have a greater influence on structure formation than the DDE component alone.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Evolution of Fast Radio Bursts and The Star Formation Rate</title>

Abstract: We investigate the cosmological evolution of the luminosity and redshift of FRBs. As is the case for all extragalactic sources, we are dealing with data that are truncated by observational selection effects, the most important being the flux limit, which introduces the so-called Eddington-Malmquist bias. In addition, for FRBs, there is a significant uncertainty in the redshifts obtained from the observed dispersion measures (DMs). To correct for the truncation we use the non-parametric, non-binning Efron-Petrosian and Lynden-Bell methods, which give unbiased distributions of luminosities and redshifts and their cosmological evolution. To quantify the redshift uncertainty, we use a data set which accounts for uncertainties of contribution to the DM of the host galaxy, and DM uncertainties due to fluctuation in the intergalactic medium. This data, in addition to a mean redshift, gives the one-sigma errors. We construct three samples with lower, mean, and upper redshifts and apply the above methods to each. For the three samples, we find similar (1) $\sim 3\sigma$ evidence for luminosity evolution, (2) a luminosity function that can be fit by a simple broken power law, and (3) a comoving density formation rate that decreases rapidly with redshift unlike the cosmic star formation rate (SFR). This rate is similar to that of short gamma-ray bursts, which are believed to result from compact star mergers with a formation rate delayed relative to the SFR. This may further support the hypothesis that magnetars are the progenitors of FRBs.</description>

      <title>The Jackknife method as a new approach to validate strong lens mass models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00553v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The accuracy of a mass model in the strong lensing analysis is crucial for unbiased predictions of physical quantities such as magnifications and time delays. While the mass model is optimized by changing parameters of the mass model to match predicted positions of multiple images with observations, positional uncertainties of multiple images often need to be boosted to take account of the complex structure of dark matter in lens objects, making the interpretation of the chi-square value difficult. We introduce the Jackknife method as a new method to validate strong lens mass models, specifically focusing on cluster-scale mass modeling. In this approach, we remove multiple images of a source from the fitting and optimize the mass model using multiple images of the remaining sources. We then calculate the multiple images of the removed source and quantitatively evaluate how well they match the observed positions. We find that the Jackknife method performs effectively in simulations using a simple model. We also demonstrate our method with mass modeling of the galaxy cluster MACS J0647.7+7015. We discuss the potential of using the Jackknife method to validate the error estimation of the physical quantities by the Markov Chain Monte Carlo.</description>

      <title>Entropy plateaus can emerge from gas replacement at a characteristic halo mass in simulated groups and clusters of galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05675v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The evolution of the intergalactic medium (IGM) is influenced by gravitational collapse, radiative cooling, and baryonic feedback. Using cosmological hydrodynamic zoom-in simulations of a $8.83 \times 10^{12}$ M$_\odot$ group and a $2.92 \times 10^{14}$ M$_\odot$ cluster at $z=0$, we investigate the emergence of entropy plateaus and their connection to feedback mechanisms. This set-up uses the SWIFT-EAGLE model with three resolutions, down to an initial particle gas mass of $2.29 \times 10^5$ M$_\odot$ and $1.23 \times 10^6$ M$_\odot$ for dark matter. We find that, when halos reach the characteristic mass of $\sim 10^{12}$ M$_{\odot}$, their entropy profiles flatten at the virial radius, marking a transition from supernova to AGN feedback-driven regulation. As halos grow into groups ($\sim 10^{13}$ M$_{\odot}$), the entropy plateau extends inward and isentropic cores form in massive systems ($\sim 10^{14}$ M$_{\odot}$). By tracking the Lagrangian history of gas particles, we demonstrate that this entropy buildup is primarily driven by AGN feedback, which efficiently removes low-entropy gas from progenitors of groups and clusters, redistributing it throughout the IGM before falling into the core. Recent observations of X-GAP groups reveal large entropy excesses and plateaus, in line with our findings and in contrast to the power-law-like profiles of most previous observations. While entropy plateaus and large entropy excesses may be observationally confirmed in unbiased samples, reproducing the full diversity of entropy profiles remains an outstanding challenge for next-generation feedback models. Our results suggest that current feedback models may be overly efficient in expelling low-entropy gas from the potential cool-core progenitors, disrupting the balance between heating and cooling required for long-lived cool cores.</description>

Abstract: We examine data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) collaboration which has implications for the nature of dark energy. We consider classes of models that manifestly obey the null energy condition, with a focus on quintessence models. We find that hilltop potentials and exponential potentials provide modest improvement compared to a cosmological constant, but the statistical evidence is only marginal at this stage. We correct some analyses in the existing literature which attempted to compare some quintessence models to the data, giving an overly positive result.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06171v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) constitute a compelling dark matter candidate whose gravitational effects could significantly influence early cosmic structure formation. We investigate the impact of PBHs on Population III star formation through detailed $N$-body and hydrodynamic simulations, extending beyond previous semi-analytical approaches. Our results reveal a mass-dependent dichotomy in PBH effects: massive PBHs ($M_{\rm PBH} \gtrsim 10^2 M_\odot$) with sufficient abundance can accelerate structure formation and shift Pop III formation to higher redshifts, potentially conflicting with observational constraints from high-redshift galaxy surveys. Conversely, lower-mass PBHs can induce tidal disruption of gas-rich minihalos, suppressing star formation and delaying the cosmic dawn depending on their abundance. We quantify these competing effects to derive new constraints on the PBH mass function and their contribution to the total dark matter density, with implications for forthcoming observations with the James Webb Space Telescope and 21-cm cosmology experiments.</description>

      <title>Accurately simulating core-collapse self-interacting dark matter halos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06269v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The properties of satellite halos provide a promising probe for dark matter (DM) physics. Observations motivate current efforts to explain surprisingly compact DM halos. If DM is not collisionless but has strong self-interactions, halos can undergo gravothermal collapse, leading to higher densities in the central region of the halo. However, it is challenging to model this collapse phase from first principles. To improve on this, we seek to better understand numerical challenges and convergence properties of self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) N-body simulations in the collapse phase. Especially we aim for a better understanding of the evolution of satellite halos. To do so, we run SIDM N-body simulations of a low mass halo in isolation and within an external gravitational potential. The simulation setup is motivated by the perturber of the stellar stream GD-1. We find that the halo evolution is very sensitive to energy conservation errors, and a too large SIDM kernel size can artificially speed up the collapse. Moreover, we demonstrate that the King model can describe the density profile at small radii for the late stages that we have simulated. Furthermore, for our highest-resolved simulation (N = 5x10^7) we make the data public. It can serve as a benchmark. Overall, we find that the current numerical methods do not suffer from convergence problems in the late collapse phase and provide guidance on how to choose numerical parameters, e.g. that the energy conservation error is better kept well below 1%. This allows to run simulations of halos becoming concentrated enough to explain observations of GD-1 like stellar streams or strong gravitational lensing systems.</description>

      <title>Holographic Dark Energy Models in $f(Q,T)$ Gravity and Cosmic Constraint</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17933v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a new model that combines holographic dark energy with modified gravity $f(Q,T)$ to explore a possible explanation for the accelerated expansion of the universe. Since there are several tensions of cosmological parameters, we need to investigate different theories. We incorporate the holographic principle into non-metric gravity with non-minimal matter coupling and introduce the Barrow holographic dark energy model to account for a tighter corrections, allowing for a more generalized discussion. Furthermore, we perform parameter estimation using the latest observational data, including Type Ia supernova, BAO and Hubble parameter direct measurements. Our results show that the model provides a theoretical framework to describe late-time cosmic evolution and the universe's accelerated expansion. Despite the additional complexity introduced, the model offers a alternative approach for investigating dark energy within modified gravity theories.</description>

      <title>Probing Generalized Emergent Dark Energy with DESI DR2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00835v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As an update on the initial findings of DESI, the new results provide the first hint of potential deviations from a cosmological constant ($w=-1$), which, if confirmed with significance $&gt;5\sigma$, will falsify the $\Lambda$CDM model. We explore a generalized formulation of an emergent dark energy (GEDE) model and test its viability using multiple observational datasets, including Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements from the DESI DR2 release, the Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) compilation, and Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) distance priors. Through this analysis, we place joint constraints on the dark energy equation of state $w$ and the redshift-dependent energy density function $f_{DE}(z)$, which exhibits behavior consistent with a quintessence. Specifically, $w(0) = -0.820$ with DESI DR2 + CMB, $-0.845$ with DESI DR2 + CMB + PP$^+$, $-0.828$ with DESI DR2 + CMB + Union3, and $-0.804$ with DESI DR2 + CMB + DESY5. Across multiple combinations of datasets, we observe a recurring trend toward negative values of the GEDE parameter $\Delta$. The negative value of $\Delta$ favors the injection of dark energy at earlier redshift with $z_t$ close to 0.5. We conduct a comparative analysis between the GEDE and $\Lambda$CDM models using different BAO scale. Within current observational uncertainties, our results position the GEDE framework as a viable and promising alternative, meriting further investigation. The effectiveness of the model is quantitatively assessed using the Bayes factor.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17246v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study thermal corrections to a model of real scalar dark matter (DM) interacting feebly with a SM fermion and a gauge-charged vector-like fermion mediator. We employ the Closed-Time-Path (CTP) formalism for our calculation and go beyond previous works by including the full dependence on the relevant mass scales as opposed to using (non)relativistic approximations. In particular, we calculate the DM production rate by employing 1PI-resummed propagators constructed from the leading order term in the loop expansion of the 2PI effective action, beyond the Hard-Thermal-Loop (HTL) approximation. We compare our findings to commonly used approximation schemes, including solving the Boltzmann equation using momentum-independent thermal masses in decay processes and as regulators for $t$-channel divergences. We also compare with the result when employing HTL propagators and their tree-level limit. We find that the DM relic abundance when using thermal masses in the Boltzmann approach deviates between $-10\%$ and $+30\%$ from our calculation, where the size and sign strongly depend on the mass splitting between the DM candidate and the gauge-charged mediator. The HTL-approximated result is more accurate at small gauge couplings, only deviating by a few percent at large mass splittings, whereas it overestimates the relic density up to $25\%$ for small mass splittings. Calculations using tree-level propagators in the CTP formalism or semiclassical Boltzmann equations without scatterings underestimate the dark matter abundance and can lead to deviations of up to $-100\%$ from the 1PI-resummed result.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a novel level crossing phenomenon in the mass mixing between the QCD axions, one canonical QCD axion and one $Z_{\mathcal N}$ axion. The level crossing can take place at or slightly before the QCD phase transition critical temperature, depending on the ratio of the axion decay constants $\sim1.69$. The cosmological evolution of the mass eigenvalues in these two scenarios is similar; however, the transition of axion energy density differs significantly. Finally, we estimate the relic density of the QCD axion dark matter in this context. Additionally, this level crossing may have some interesting cosmological implications.</description>

      <title>On the Temperature Effects in QCD Axion Mass Mixing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00377v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we extend the QCD axion mass mixing in the early Universe and investigate the temperature effects in the mixing. We explore the scenario where two $Z_{\mathcal N}$ QCD axions undergo mass mixing during the QCD phase transition, yielding three distinct mixing scenarios: the mixing I, II, and III. These scenarios are realized through fine-tuning of the axion decay constants, the temperature parameters, as well as the value of $\mathcal N$. We conduct a thorough analysis of the level crossing phenomena in these three mixing scenarios, detailing the conditions under which they occur. Notably, in the mixing I and II, the level crossing precedes the critical temperature of the QCD phase transition ($T_{\rm QCD}$), with minimal non-essential discrepancies in the cosmological evolution of the mass eigenvalues at $T_{\rm QCD}$. In contrast, the mixing III exhibits a unique double level crossings, occurring both before and at $T_{\rm QCD}$. Despite superficial similarities in axion evolution between the mixing II and III, we uncover fundamental differences between them. Additionally, we briefly address the transition in energy density between the two axions within our mixing scenarios. This work contributes to a deeper understanding of the role of the QCD axion in the early Universe and its potential implications for cold dark matter.</description>

      <title>Multimessenger signatures of a deformed magnetar in gamma-ray bursts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07883v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the evolution of a newly formed magnetized neutron-star (NS) as a power source of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) in the light of both gravitational-wave (GW) and electromagnetic (EM) radiations. The compressible and incompressible fluids are employed in order to model the secular evolution of stable Maclaurian spheroids. It is shown that the GW and EM emissions evolve as a function of eccentricity and rotational frequency with time. We find that the luminosity characteristics crucially depend on NS parameters such as magnitude and structure of magnetic field, ellipticity and the equation of state (EoS) of the fluid. The presence of X-ray flares, whose origins are not yet well understood, can be captured in our model regarding some specific nuclear EoSs. Our model allowing us to explain flares that occur within the wide range of $ 10$ to $10^4$ s and the peak EM luminosity in the order of $10^{46}$ - $10^{51}$ $\rm \text{erg} s^{-1}$ by using a reasonable set of parameters, such as magnetic field strength around $10^{14}-10^{16}$ G, the quadrupole-to-dipole ratio of magnetic field up to 500. By applying our model to a sample of GRB X-ray flares observed by the Swift/X-ray Telescope, we try to constraint the crucial parameters of a deformed magnetar via a Marcov Chain Monte Carlo fitting method. Our analysis shows that ongoing and upcoming joint multimessenger detections can be used to understand the nature of a GRB's central engine and its evolution at the early times of the burst formation.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the role of an axion-like particle (ALP) as a portal between the dark and visible sectors. Unlike conventional studies, which typically assume fermionic dark matter (DM), we explore the phenomenological implications of scalar DM within this ALP portal framework. A key challenge arises from the fact that the interaction between the ALP spacetime derivative and the spin-one current of the scalar DM can be a redundant operator, which may be removed via a field redefinition. However, this interaction reveals a profound connection to the underlying global symmetry that stabilizes the DM particle. We choose a non-Abelian discrete symmetry, ensuring the persistence of the DM-ALP interactions, and in doing so, unveil a rich phenomenology. Working within a general effective field theory approach, we identify the following hallmark features of our scenario: (i) a relic density determined by semi-annihilations, with an abundance independent of ALP couplings to the visible sector; (ii) direct detection rates naturally suppressed; (iii) indirect detection spectra enriched relative to pure annihilation scenarios, with rates also independent of ALP couplings to visible particles. Lastly, we discuss potential microscopic origins for this framework and highlight the broader implications of our results.</description>

      <title>HOLISMOKES XVI: Lens search in HSC-PDR3 with a neural network committee and post-processing for false-positive removal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07733v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have carried out a systematic search for galaxy-scale lenses exploiting multi-band imaging data from the third public data release of the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) survey with the focus on false-positive removal, after applying deep learning classifiers to all 110 million sources with i-Kron radius above 0.8". To improve the performance, we tested the combination of multiple networks from our previous lens search projects and found the best performance by averaging the scores from five of our networks. Although this ensemble network leads already to a false-positive rate (FPR) of 0.01% at a true-positive rate (TPR) of 75% on known real lenses, we have elaborated techniques to further clean the network candidate list before visual inspection. In detail, we tested the rejection using SExtractor and the modeling network from HOLISMOKES IX, which resulted together in a candidate rejection of 29% without lowering the TPR. We carried out a comprehensive multi-stage visual inspection involving eight individuals and identified 95 grade A (average grade G &gt;2.5) and 503 grade B (2.5 &gt;G &gt;1.5) lens candidates, including 92 discoveries reported for the first time. This inspection also incorporated a novel environmental characterization using histograms of photometric redshifts. We publicly release the average grades, mass model predictions, and environment characterization of all visually inspected candidates, while including references for previously discovered systems, which makes this catalog one of the largest compilation of known lenses. The results demonstrate that (1) the combination of multiple networks enhances the selection performance and (2) both automated masking tools as well as modeling networks, which can be easily applied to hundreds of thousands of network candidates, help reduce the number of false positives that is the main limitation in lens search to date.</description>

      <title>Solar System Constraints on Light Propagation from Higher Derivative Corrections to General Relativity and Implications for Fundamental Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19236v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While the two derivative action of gravitation is specified uniquely, higher derivative operators are also allowed with coefficients that are not specified uniquely by effective field theory. We focus on a four derivative operator in which the Riemann tensor couples directly to the electromagnetic field $a\,R_{\mu\nu\alpha\beta}F^{\mu\nu}F^{\alpha\beta}$. We compute the corresponding corrections to the Shapiro time delay in the solar system and compare this to data from the Cassini probe. We place an observational upper bound on the coefficient $a$ at 95\% confidence $|a|&lt;26\,(1000\,\mbox{km})^2$. By way of motivation, we also compare this to a weak gravity conjecture (WGC) prediction of a bound on the coefficients $a,\,b$ of four derivative operators involving the graviton and the photon; this includes the above term $a\,R_{\mu\nu\alpha\beta}F^{\mu\nu}F^{\alpha\beta}$ as well as $b\,F^4$. We show that by using the observed value of the $b$ coefficient from measurements of light by light scattering, which arises in the Standard Model from integrating out the electron, the WGC predicted bound for $a$ is $a\lesssim 7.8\,(1000\,\mbox{km})^2$. This is consistent with the above observational bound, but is intriguingly close and can be further probed in other observations.</description>

      <title>Describing the Nonuniversal Galaxy Merger Timescales in IllustrisTNG: Effects of Host Halo Mass, Baryons, and Sample Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02930v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Galaxy merger timescales are crucial for understanding and modeling galaxy formation in our hierarchically structured Universe. However, previous studies have reported widely varying dependencies of merger timescales on initial orbital parameters and mass ratio at the first crossing of $r_{\rm vir}$. Using IllustrisTNG simulations, we find that these dependencies vary with host halo mass, suggesting that discrepancies in prior studies may arise from differences in the systems analyzed. Specifically, in low-mass halos, merger timescales show a stronger dependence on initial orbital parameters, while in high-mass halos, this dependence weakens. To account for these variations, we present a fitting formula that incorporates host mass dependence, achieving a logarithmic scatter smaller than 0.15 dex. Comparing dark matter-only and baryonic simulations, we observe similar merger timescales for circular orbits but notable differences for radial orbits. In halos with $M_{\rm{host}} &lt; 10^{12.5} h^{-1} M_{\odot}$, mergers in dark matter-only runs take longer than in baryonic runs, whereas the trend reverses in more massive halos. We attribute these differences to the competing effects of tidal disruption by central galaxy disks and the resistance of baryonic satellites to tidal stripping. Finally, we extend our model to predict merger timescales from any starting radius within the halo. By fitting the extended model to the entire infall sample, we find that using only the merger sample can underestimate merger timescales, particularly for low mass ratios. Our model provides a valuable tool for improving semi-analytical and empirical models of galaxy formation.</description>

      <title>Cross-correlations between X-ray clusters and the general galaxy population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10241v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study presents highly precise measurements of the cross-correlation between volume-limited galaxy samples from the DESI legacy survey catalogue and X-ray selected galaxy clusters from eROSITA, allowing for detailed analysis across redshift and color. Two key findings emerge. First, the cluster-galaxy cross-correlation, when split into quiescent and star-forming galaxies, contains significant information about the infall, feedback, and quenching processes of blue cloud galaxies in massive environments. These results align well with existing galaxy evolution models for higher stellar masses ($\log_{10}(M^*[M_\odot]) &gt; 10.75$), though the red fraction may be slightly underestimated in the intermediate mass range ($10.25 &lt; \log_{10}(M^*[M_\odot])&lt; 10.75$). Second, the integral of the cross-correlation within 500 kpc enables a model-independent measurement of the red sequence and its scatter in clusters, providing a robust alternative to existing red-sequence calibration methods without requiring spectroscopic redshifts or classifications of galaxies. Similar analyses on upcoming photometric surveys like Euclid and LSST and spectroscopic samples like 4MOST and DESI should lead to a significant increase in the signal-to-noise ratio, particularly at small separations.</description>

      <title>MIGHTEE-HI: The radial acceleration relation with resolved stellar mass measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20857v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The radial acceleration relation (RAR) is a fundamental relation linking baryonic and dark matter in galaxies by relating the observed acceleration derived from dynamics to the one estimated from the baryonic mass. This relation exhibits small scatter, thus providing key constraints for models of galaxy formation and evolution -- allowing us to map the distribution of dark matter in galaxies -- as well as models of modified dynamics. However, it has only been extensively studied in the very local Universe with largely heterogeneous samples. We present a new measurement of the RAR, utilising a homogeneous sample of 19 HI-selected galaxies out to $z=0.08$. We introduce a novel approach of measuring resolved stellar masses using spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting across 10 photometric bands to determine the resolved mass-to-light ratio, which we show is essential for measuring the acceleration due to baryons in the low-acceleration regime. Our results reveal a tight RAR with a low-acceleration power-law slope of $\sim 0.5$, consistent with previous studies. Adopting a spatially varying mass-to-light ratio yields the tightest RAR with an intrinsic scatter of only $0.045 \pm 0.022$ dex, highlighting the importance of resolved stellar mass measurements in accurately characterising the gravitational contribution of the baryons in low-mass, gas-rich galaxies. We also find the first tentative evidence for redshift evolution in the acceleration scale, but more data will be required to confirm this. Adopting a more general MOND interpolating function, we find that our results ameliorate the tension between previous RAR analyses, the Solar System quadrupole and wide-binary test.</description>

      <title>Perturbative K\"ahler Moduli Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08083v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present two classes of inflationary models in the framework of type IIB string theory. The inflatons correspond to blow-up K\"ahler modulus arising from compactifying type IIB string theory on a Calabi-Yau. Using perturbative corrections, we first highlight a procedure for stabilising more than one K\"ahler modulus. For the case of two K\"ahler moduli, we explicitly construct two classes of inflationary potentials within the K\"ahler cone which satisfy both EFT and cosmological constraints. The first class of models, arising from moduli redefinition of the blow-up mode, garners a potential of the form $V(\phi)=V_{0}(1+C_{1} \phi^{2/3})$ align with CMB data with scalar-to-tensor ratio $r\lesssim 10^{-2}$. The second class of models, which have been recently proposed as loop blow-up inflation, have a form $V(\phi)=V_{0}(1+C_{2}\phi^{-2/3})$, also agrees with CMB data with scalar-to tensor-ratio $r\lesssim 10^{-8}$. Our work differs from the original loop blow-up inflation in terms of stabilization mechanism and subsequently the scalar-to tensor ratio.</description>

      <title>Microlensing of dark matter models in the Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00770v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate constraints on the abundance of primordial black holes (PBHs) as dark matter (DM) candidates using five years of microlensing data from the OGLE survey. While the majority of OGLE's $\sim 2000$ microlensing events are well-explained by stellar populations such as brown dwarfs, main-sequence stars, and compact remnants, a subset of six ultrashort-timescale events ($t_E \sim 0.1 - 0.3$ days) may signal the presence of PBHs. Building upon prior work that adopted the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) DM profile, we examine how alternative DM halo models -- specifically the Einasto and Burkert profiles -- affect microlensing predictions and the constraints on PBH abundance. We computed differential microlensing event rates for both profiles, using the main-sequence star rate as an observational benchmark. Our results show that neither the Einasto nor Burkert profiles reproduce the distribution of main-sequence star events, yet both allow for viable explanations of the ultrashort-timescale events with PBH masses $M_{\mathrm{PBH}} \sim 10^{-5} M_\odot$. Using a Poisson likelihood analysis under the null hypothesis that no PBH is observed in OGLE dataset, we derive 95\% C.L. upper bounds on $f_{\mathrm{PBH}}$, finding that the constraints are significantly relaxed under the Einasto and Burkert profiles compared to the NFW case. These results underscore the sensitivity of PBH constraints to the assumed DM halo structure and highlight the importance of accurately modeling the inner Galactic density profile to robustly assess PBH dark matter scenarios.</description>
