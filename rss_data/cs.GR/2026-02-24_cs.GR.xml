      <title>Compact Hadamard Latent Codes for Efficient Spectral Rendering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectral rendering accurately reproduces wavelength-dependent appearance but is computationally expensive, as shading must be evaluated at many wavelength samples and scales roughly linearly with the number of samples. It also requires spectral textures and lights throughout the rendering pipeline. We propose Hadamard spectral codes, a compact latent representation that enables spectral rendering using standard RGB rendering operations. Spectral images are approximated with a small number of RGB rendering passes, followed by a decoding step. Our key requirement is latent linearity: scaling and addition in spectral space correspond to scaling and addition of codes, and the element-wise product of spectra (for example reflectance times illumination) is approximated by the element-wise product of their latent codes. We show that an exact low-dimensional algebra-preserving representation cannot exist for arbitrary spectra when the latent dimension k is smaller than the number of spectral samples n. We therefore introduce a learned non-negative linear encoder and decoder architecture that preserves scaling and addition exactly while encouraging approximate multiplicativity under the Hadamard product. With k = 6, we render k/3 = 2 RGB images per frame using an unmodified RGB renderer, reconstruct the latent image, and decode to high-resolution spectra or XYZ or RGB. Experiments on 3D scenes demonstrate that k = 6 significantly reduces color error compared to RGB baselines while being substantially faster than naive n-sample spectral rendering. Using k = 9 provides higher-quality reference results. We further introduce a lightweight neural upsampling network that maps RGB assets directly to latent codes, enabling integration of legacy RGB content into the spectral pipeline while maintaining perceptually accurate colors in rendered images.</description>

      <title>HistCAD: Geometrically Constrained Parametric History-based CAD Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parametric computer-aided design (CAD) modeling is fundamental to industrial design, but existing datasets often lack explicit geometric constraints and fine-grained functional semantics, limiting editable, constraint-compliant generation. We present HistCAD, a large-scale dataset featuring constraint-aware modeling sequences that compactly represent procedural operations while ensuring compatibility with native CAD software, encompassing five aligned modalities: modeling sequences, multi-view renderings, STEP-format B-reps, native parametric files, and textual annotations. We develop AM\(_\text{HistCAD}\), an annotation module that extracts geometric and spatial features from modeling sequences and uses a large language model to generate complementary annotations of the modeling process, geometric structure, and functional type. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that HistCAD's explicit constraints, flattened sequence format, and multi-type annotations improve robustness, parametric editability, and accuracy in text-driven CAD generation, while industrial parts included in HistCAD further support complex real-world design scenarios. HistCAD thus provides a unified benchmark for advancing editable, constraint-aware, and semantically enriched generative CAD modeling.</description>

      <title>Thin Plate Spline Surface Reconstruction via the Method of Matched Sections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper further develops the Method of Matched Sections (MMS), a robust numerical framework for the solution of boundary value problems governed by partial differential equations, specifically for surface modeling. While originating in mechanics, the method addresses critical challenges in isogeometric analysis and computer graphics by bridging the gap between physical accuracy and geometric continuity. By decomposing the domain into an assembly of 1D directional components matched along their entire boundaries, the method inherently enforces the continuity of all variational parameters, including second-order (curvature) and third-order (shear) derivatives. We demonstrate the method's advanced capabilities in high-fidelity surface reconstruction and blending, showing that it consistently generates energetically optimal, fair surfaces even from complex boundary conditions or sparse internal points. By advancing the application of MMS, this research establishes it as a powerful, physics-informed geometric tool that satisfies the dual demands of rigorous numerical analysis and aesthetic computer-aided design.</description>

      <title>Spherical Hermite Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spherical functions appear throughout computer graphics, from spherical harmonic lighting and precomputed radiance transfer to neural radiance fields and procedural planet rendering. Efficient evaluation is critical for real-time applications, yet existing approaches face a quality-performance trade-off: bilinear LUT sampling is fast but produces faceting, while bicubic filtering requires 16 texture samples. Most implementations use finite differences for normals, requiring extra samples and introducing noise. This paper presents Spherical Hermite Maps, a derivative-augmented LUT representation that resolves this trade-off. By storing function values alongside scaled partial derivatives at each texel of a padded cubemap, bicubic-Hermite reconstruction is enabled from only four texture samples (a 2x2 footprint) while providing continuous gradients from the same samples. The key insight is that Hermite interpolation reconstructs smooth derivatives as a byproduct of value reconstruction, making surface normals effectively free. In controlled experiments, Spherical Hermite Maps improve PSNR by 8-41 dB over bilinear interpolation and match 16-tap bicubic quality at one-quarter the cost. Analytic normals reduce mean angular error by 9-13% on complex surfaces while yielding stable specular highlights. Three applications demonstrate versatility: spherical harmonic glyph visualization, radial depth-map impostors for mesh level-of-detail, and procedural planet/asteroid rendering with spherical heightfields.</description>

      <title>Optimizing ID Consistency in Multimodal Large Models: Facial Restoration via Alignment, Entanglement, and Disentanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal editing large models have demonstrated powerful editing capabilities across diverse tasks. However, a persistent and long-standing limitation is the decline in facial identity (ID) consistency during realistic portrait editing. Due to the human eye's high sensitivity to facial features, such inconsistency significantly hinders the practical deployment of these models. Current facial ID preservation methods struggle to achieve consistent restoration of both facial identity and edited element IP due to Cross-source Distribution Bias and Cross-source Feature Contamination. To address these issues, we propose EditedID, an Alignment-Disentanglement-Entanglement framework for robust identity-specific facial restoration. By systematically analyzing diffusion trajectories, sampler behaviors, and attention properties, we introduce three key components: 1) Adaptive mixing strategy that aligns cross-source latent representations throughout the diffusion process. 2) Hybrid solver that disentangles source-specific identity attributes and details. 3) Attentional gating mechanism that selectively entangles visual elements. Extensive experiments show that EditedID achieves state-of-the-art performance in preserving original facial ID and edited element IP consistency. As a training-free and plug-and-play solution, it establishes a new benchmark for practical and reliable single/multi-person facial identity restoration in open-world settings, paving the way for the deployment of multimodal editing large models in real-person editing scenarios. The code is available at https://github.com/NDYBSNDY/EditedID.</description>

      <title>PhysConvex: Physics-Informed 3D Dynamic Convex Radiance Fields for Reconstruction and Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconstructing and simulating dynamic 3D scenes with both visual realism and physical consistency remains a fundamental challenge. Existing neural representations, such as NeRFs and 3DGS, excel in appearance reconstruction but struggle to capture complex material deformation and dynamics. We propose PhysConvex, a Physics-informed 3D Dynamic Convex Radiance Field that unifies visual rendering and physical simulation. PhysConvex represents deformable radiance fields using physically grounded convex primitives governed by continuum mechanics. We introduce a boundary-driven dynamic convex representation that models deformation through vertex and surface dynamics, capturing spatially adaptive, non-uniform deformation, and evolving boundaries. To efficiently simulate complex geometries and heterogeneous materials, we further develop a reduced-order convex simulation that advects dynamic convex fields using neural skinning eigenmodes as shape- and material-aware deformation bases with time-varying reduced DOFs under Newtonian dynamics. Convex dynamics also offers compact, gap-free volumetric coverage, enhancing both geometric efficiency and simulation fidelity. Experiments demonstrate that PhysConvex achieves high-fidelity reconstruction of geometry, appearance, and physical properties from videos, outperforming existing methods.</description>

      <title>Ani3DHuman: Photorealistic 3D Human Animation with Self-guided Stochastic Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current 3D human animation methods struggle to achieve photorealism: kinematics-based approaches lack non-rigid dynamics (e.g., clothing dynamics), while methods that leverage video diffusion priors can synthesize non-rigid motion but suffer from quality artifacts and identity loss. To overcome these limitations, we present Ani3DHuman, a framework that marries kinematics-based animation with video diffusion priors. We first introduce a layered motion representation that disentangles rigid motion from residual non-rigid motion. Rigid motion is generated by a kinematic method, which then produces a coarse rendering to guide the video diffusion model in generating video sequences that restore the residual non-rigid motion. However, this restoration task, based on diffusion sampling, is highly challenging, as the initial renderings are out-of-distribution, causing standard deterministic ODE samplers to fail. Therefore, we propose a novel self-guided stochastic sampling method, which effectively addresses the out-of-distribution problem by combining stochastic sampling (for photorealistic quality) with self-guidance (for identity fidelity). These restored videos provide high-quality supervision, enabling the optimization of the residual non-rigid motion field. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \MethodName can generate photorealistic 3D human animation, outperforming existing methods.

      <title>Structured Bitmap-to-Mesh Triangulation for Geometry-Aware Discretization of Image-Derived Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a template-driven triangulation framework that embeds raster- or segmentation-derived boundaries into a regular triangular grid for stable PDE discretization on image-derived domains. Unlike constrained Delaunay triangulation (CDT), which may trigger global connectivity updates, our method retriangulates only triangles intersected by the boundary, preserves the base mesh, and supports synchronization-free parallel execution. To ensure determinism and scalability, we classify all local boundary-intersection configurations up to discrete equivalence and triangle symmetries, yielding a finite symbolic lookup table that maps each case to a conflict-free retriangulation template. We prove that the resulting mesh is closed, has bounded angles, and is compatible with cotangent-based discretizations and standard finite element methods. Experiments on elliptic and parabolic PDEs, signal interpolation, and structural metrics show fewer sliver elements, more regular triangles, and improved geometric fidelity near complex boundaries. The framework is well suited for real-time geometric analysis and physically based simulation over image-derived domains.</description>

      <title>BayesFusion-SDF: Probabilistic Signed Distance Fusion with View Planning on CPU</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Key part of robotics, augmented reality, and digital inspection is dense 3D reconstruction from depth observations. Traditional volumetric fusion techniques, including truncated signed distance functions (TSDF), enable efficient and deterministic geometry reconstruction; however, they depend on heuristic weighting and fail to transparently convey uncertainty in a systematic way. Recent neural implicit methods, on the other hand, get very high fidelity but usually need a lot of GPU power for optimization and aren't very easy to understand for making decisions later on. This work presents BayesFusion-SDF, a CPU-centric probabilistic signed distance fusion framework that conceptualizes geometry as a sparse Gaussian random field with a defined posterior distribution over voxel distances. First, a rough TSDF reconstruction is used to create an adaptive narrow-band domain. Then, depth observations are combined using a heteroscedastic Bayesian formulation that is solved using sparse linear algebra and preconditioned conjugate gradients. Randomized diagonal estimators are a quick way to get an idea of posterior uncertainty. This makes it possible to extract surfaces and plan the next best view while taking into account uncertainty. Tests on a controlled ablation scene and a CO3D object sequence show that the new method is more accurate geometrically than TSDF baselines and gives useful estimates of uncertainty for active sensing. The proposed formulation provides a clear and easy-to-use alternative to GPU-heavy neural reconstruction methods while still being able to be understood in a probabilistic way and acting in a predictable way.

      <title>RAP: Fast Feedforward Rendering-Free Attribute-Guided Primitive Importance Score Prediction for Efficient 3D Gaussian Splatting Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a leading technology for high-quality 3D scene reconstruction. However, the iterative refinement and densification process leads to the generation of a large number of primitives, each contributing to the reconstruction to a substantially different extent. Estimating primitive importance is thus crucial, both for removing redundancy during reconstruction and for enabling efficient compression and transmission. Existing methods typically rely on rendering-based analyses, where each primitive is evaluated through its contribution across multiple camera viewpoints. However, such methods are sensitive to the number and selection of views, rely on specialized differentiable rasterizers, and have long calculation times that grow linearly with view count, making them difficult to integrate as plug-and-play modules and limiting scalability and generalization. To address these issues, we propose RAP, a fast feedforward rendering-free attribute-guided method for efficient importance score prediction in 3DGS. RAP infers primitive significance directly from intrinsic Gaussian attributes and local neighborhood statistics, avoiding rendering-based or visibility-dependent computations. A compact MLP predicts per-primitive importance scores using rendering loss, pruning-aware loss, and significance distribution regularization. After training on a small set of scenes, RAP generalizes effectively to unseen data and can be seamlessly integrated into reconstruction, compression, and transmission pipelines. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/yyyykf/RAP.</description>

      <title>ExpPortrait: Expressive Portrait Generation via Personalized Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While diffusion models have shown great potential in portrait generation, generating expressive, coherent, and controllable cinematic portrait videos remains a significant challenge. Existing intermediate signals for portrait generation, such as 2D landmarks and parametric models, have limited disentanglement capabilities and cannot express personalized details due to their sparse or low-rank representation. Therefore, existing methods based on these models struggle to accurately preserve subject identity and expressions, hindering the generation of highly expressive portrait videos. To overcome these limitations, we propose a high-fidelity personalized head representation that more effectively disentangles expression and identity. This representation captures both static, subject-specific global geometry and dynamic, expression-related details. Furthermore, we introduce an expression transfer module to achieve personalized transfer of head pose and expression details between different identities. We use this sophisticated and highly expressive head model as a conditional signal to train a diffusion transformer (DiT)-based generator to synthesize richly detailed portrait videos. Extensive experiments on self- and cross-reenactment tasks demonstrate that our method outperforms previous models in terms of identity preservation, expression accuracy, and temporal stability, particularly in capturing fine-grained details of complex motion.</description>

      <title>Augmented Radiance Field: A General Framework for Enhanced Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to the real-time rendering performance, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as the leading method for radiance field reconstruction. However, its reliance on spherical harmonics for color encoding inherently limits its ability to separate diffuse and specular components, making it challenging to accurately represent complex reflections. To address this, we propose a novel enhanced Gaussian kernel that explicitly models specular effects through view-dependent opacity. Meanwhile, we introduce an error-driven compensation strategy to improve rendering quality in existing 3DGS scenes. Our method begins with 2D Gaussian initialization and then adaptively inserts and optimizes enhanced Gaussian kernels, ultimately producing an augmented radiance field. Experiments demonstrate that our method not only surpasses state-of-the-art NeRF methods in rendering performance but also achieves greater parameter efficiency.

      <title>DesignAsCode: Bridging Structural Editability and Visual Fidelity in Graphic Design Generation</title>

Abstract: Graphic design generation demands a delicate balance between high visual fidelity and fine-grained structural editability. However, existing approaches typically bifurcate into either non-editable raster image synthesis or abstract layout generation devoid of visual content. Recent combinations of these two approaches attempt to bridge this gap but often suffer from rigid composition schemas and unresolvable visual dissonances (e.g., text-background conflicts) due to their inexpressive representation and open-loop nature. To address these challenges, we propose DesignAsCode, a novel framework that reimagines graphic design as a programmatic synthesis task using HTML/CSS. Specifically, we introduce a Plan-Implement-Reflect pipeline, incorporating a Semantic Planner to construct dynamic, variable-depth element hierarchies and a Visual-Aware Reflection mechanism that iteratively optimizes the code to rectify rendering artifacts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DesignAsCode significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both structural validity and aesthetic quality. Furthermore, our code-native representation unlocks advanced capabilities, including automatic layout retargeting, complex document generation (e.g., resumes), and CSS-based animation.

Abstract: Neural representations of 3D data have been widely adopted across various applications, particularly in recent work leveraging coordinate-based networks to model scalar or vector fields. However, these approaches face inherent challenges, such as handling thin structures and non-watertight geometries, which limit their flexibility and accuracy. In contrast, we propose a novel geometric data representation that models geometry as distributions-a powerful representation that makes no assumptions about surface genus, connectivity, or boundary conditions. Our approach uses diffusion models with a novel network architecture to learn surface point distributions, capturing fine-grained geometric details. We evaluate our representation qualitatively and quantitatively across various object types, demonstrating its effectiveness in achieving high geometric fidelity. Additionally, we explore applications using our representation, such as textured mesh representation, neural surface compression, dynamic object modeling, and rendering, highlighting its potential to advance 3D geometric learning.</description>

      <title>MRD: Using Physically Based Differentiable Rendering to Probe Vision Models for 3D Scene Understanding</title>

Abstract: While deep learning methods have achieved impressive success in many vision benchmarks, it remains difficult to understand and explain the representations and decisions of these models. Though vision models are typically trained on 2D inputs, they are often assumed to develop an implicit representation of the underlying 3D scene (for example, showing tolerance to partial occlusion, or the ability to reason about relative depth). Here, we introduce MRD (metamers rendered differentiably), an approach that uses physically based differentiable rendering to probe vision models' implicit understanding of generative 3D scene properties, by finding 3D scene parameters that are physically different but produce the same model activation (i.e. are model metamers). Unlike previous pixel-based methods for evaluating model representations, these reconstruction results are always grounded in physical scene descriptions. This means we can, for example, probe a model's sensitivity to object shape while holding material and lighting constant. As a proof-of-principle, we assess multiple models in their ability to recover scene parameters of geometry (shape) and bidirectional reflectance distribution function (material). The results show high similarity in model activation between target and optimized scenes, with varying visual results. Qualitatively, these reconstructions help investigate the physical scene attributes to which models are sensitive or invariant. MRD holds promise for advancing our understanding of both computer and human vision by enabling analysis of how physical scene parameters drive changes in model responses.</description>

      <title>PocketGS: On-Device Training of 3D Gaussian Splatting for High Perceptual Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17354v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficient and high-fidelity 3D scene modeling is a long-standing pursuit in computer graphics. While recent 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) methods achieve impressive real-time modeling performance, they rely on resource-unconstrained training assumptions that fail on mobile devices, which are limited by minute-scale training budgets and hardware-available peak-memory. We present PocketGS, a mobile scene modeling paradigm that enables on-device 3DGS training under these tightly coupled constraints while preserving high perceptual fidelity. Our method resolves the fundamental contradictions of standard 3DGS through three co-designed operators: G builds geometry-faithful point-cloud priors; I injects local surface statistics to seed anisotropic Gaussians, thereby reducing early conditioning gaps; and T unrolls alpha compositing with cached intermediates and index-mapped gradient scattering for stable mobile backpropagation. Collectively, these operators satisfy the competing requirements of training efficiency, memory compactness, and modeling fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PocketGS is able to outperform the powerful mainstream workstation 3DGS baseline to deliver high-quality reconstructions, enabling a fully on-device, practical capture-to-rendering workflow.</description>

      <title>Refine Now, Query Fast: A Decoupled Refinement Paradigm for Implicit Neural Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15155v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have emerged as promising surrogates for large 3D scientific simulations due to their ability to continuously model spatial and conditional fields, yet they face a critical fidelity-speed dilemma: deep MLPs suffer from high inference cost, while efficient embedding-based models lack sufficient expressiveness. To resolve this, we propose the Decoupled Representation Refinement (DRR) architectural paradigm. DRR leverages a deep refiner network, alongside non-parametric transformations, in a one-time offline process to encode rich representations into a compact and efficient embedding structure. This approach decouples slow neural networks with high representational capacity from the fast inference path. We introduce DRR-Net, a simple network that validates this paradigm, and a novel data augmentation strategy, Variational Pairs (VP) for improving INRs under complex tasks like high-dimensional surrogate modeling. Experiments on several ensemble simulation datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art fidelity, while being up to 27$\times$ faster at inference than high-fidelity baselines and remaining competitive with the fastest models. The DRR paradigm offers an effective strategy for building powerful and practical neural field surrogates and \rev{INRs in broader applications}, with a minimal compromise between speed and quality.</description>
