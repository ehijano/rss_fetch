      <title>Frequency selection for the diagnostic characterization of human brain tumours</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The diagnosis of brain tumours is an extremely sensitive and complex clinical task that must rely upon information gathered through non-invasive techniques. One such technique is magnetic resonance, in the modalities of imaging or spectroscopy. The latter provides plenty of metabolic information about the tumour tissue, but its high dimensionality makes resorting to pattern recognition techniques advisable. In this brief paper, an international database of brain tumours is analyzed resorting to an ad hoc spectral frequency selection procedure combined with nonlinear classification.</description>

      <title>A Deep Bayesian Nonparametric Framework for Robust Mutual Information Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mutual Information (MI) is a crucial measure for capturing dependencies between variables, but exact computation is challenging in high dimensions with intractable likelihoods, impacting accuracy and robustness. One idea is to use an auxiliary neural network to train an MI estimator; however, methods based on the empirical distribution function (EDF) can introduce sharp fluctuations in the MI loss due to poor out-of-sample performance, destabilizing convergence. We present a Bayesian nonparametric (BNP) solution for training an MI estimator by constructing the MI loss with a finite representation of the Dirichlet process posterior to incorporate regularization in the training process. With this regularization, the MI loss integrates both prior knowledge and empirical data to reduce the loss sensitivity to fluctuations and outliers in the sample data, especially in small sample settings like mini-batches. This approach addresses the challenge of balancing accuracy and low variance by effectively reducing variance, leading to stabilized and robust MI loss gradients during training and enhancing the convergence of the MI approximation while offering stronger theoretical guarantees for convergence. We explore the application of our estimator in maximizing MI between the data space and the latent space of a variational autoencoder. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in convergence over EDF-based methods, with applications across synthetic and real datasets, notably in 3D CT image generation, yielding enhanced structure discovery and reduced overfitting in data synthesis. While this paper focuses on generative models in application, the proposed estimator is not restricted to this setting and can be applied more broadly in various BNP learning procedures.</description>

      <title>Neural Network-Based Change Point Detection for Large-Scale Time-Evolving Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper studies the problem of detecting and locating change points in multivariate time-evolving data. The problem has a long history in statistics and signal processing and various algorithms have been developed primarily for simple parametric models. In this work, we focus on modeling the data through feed-forward neural networks and develop a detection strategy based on the following two-step procedure. In the first step, the neural network is trained over a prespecified window of the data, and its test error function is calibrated over another prespecified window. Then, the test error function is used over a moving window to identify the change point. Once a change point is detected, the procedure involving these two steps is repeated until all change points are identified. The proposed strategy yields consistent estimates for both the number and the locations of the change points under temporal dependence of the data-generating process. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is illustrated on synthetic data sets that provide insights on how to select in practice tuning parameters of the algorithm and in real data sets. Finally, we note that although the detection strategy is general and can work with different neural network architectures, the theoretical guarantees provided are specific to feed-forward neural architectures.</description>

      <title>Characterization and Greedy Learning of Gaussian Structural Causal Models under Unknown Interventions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.14897v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of recovering the causal structure underlying observations from different experimental conditions when the targets of the interventions in each experiment are unknown. We assume a linear structural causal model with additive Gaussian noise and consider interventions that perturb their targets while maintaining the causal relationships in the system. Different models may entail the same distributions, offering competing causal explanations for the given observations. We fully characterize this equivalence class and offer identifiability results, which we use to derive a greedy algorithm called GnIES to recover the equivalence class of the data-generating model without knowledge of the intervention targets. In addition, we develop a novel procedure to generate semi-synthetic data sets with known causal ground truth but distributions closely resembling those of a real data set of choice. We leverage this procedure and evaluate the performance of GnIES on an array of synthetic and semi-synthetic data sets, and real data from a biological system and a tightly controlled physical system. We provide, in the Python packages gnies and sempler, implementations of GnIES and our semi-synthetic data generation procedure.</description>

      <title>A generalized Bayesian approach for high-dimensional robust regression with serially correlated errors and predictors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05673v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a loss-based generalized Bayesian methodology for high-dimensional robust regression with serially correlated errors and predictors. The proposed framework employs a novel scaled pseudo-Huber (SPH) loss function, which smooths the well-known Huber loss, effectively balancing quadratic ($\ell_2$) and absolute linear ($\ell_1$) loss behaviors. This flexibility enables the framework to accommodate both thin-tailed and heavy-tailed data efficiently. The generalized Bayesian approach constructs a working likelihood based on the SPH loss, facilitating efficient and stable estimation while providing rigorous uncertainty quantification for all model parameters. Notably, this approach allows formal statistical inference without requiring ad hoc tuning parameter selection while adaptively addressing a wide range of tail behavior in the errors. By specifying appropriate prior distributions for the regression coefficients--such as ridge priors for small or moderate-dimensional settings and spike-and-slab priors for high-dimensional settings--the framework ensures principled inference. We establish rigorous theoretical guarantees for accurate parameter estimation and correct predictor selection under sparsity assumptions for a wide range of data generating setups. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate the superior performance of our approach compared to traditional Bayesian regression methods based on $\ell_2$ and $\ell_1$-loss functions. The results highlight its flexibility and robustness, particularly in challenging high-dimensional settings characterized by data contamination.</description>
