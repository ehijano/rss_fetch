      <title>Master Stability Function for networks of coupled non-smooth oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper describes extension of the Master Stability Function for arrays of non-smooth oscillators. This extension is based on the previously introduced Jacobi matrix estimation method, which can be applied to networks of non-smooth coupled oscillators. Proposed method and its limitations were described. Then the new algorithm was applied to calculate MSF for an impact oscillator. The results were presented and validated using an alternative MSF estimation method.</description>

      <title>The problem of infinite information flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study conditional mutual information (cMI) between a pair of variables $X,Y$ given a third one $Z$ and derived quantities including transfer entropy (TE) and causation entropy (CE) in the dynamically relevant context where $X=T(Y,Z)$ is determined by $Y,Z$ via a deterministic transformation $T$. Under mild continuity assumptions on their distributions, we prove a zero-infinity dichotomy for cMI for a wide class of $T$, which gives a yes-or-no answer to the question of information flow as quantified by TE or CE. Such an answer fails to distinguish between the relative amounts of information flow. To resolve this problem, we propose a discretization strategy and a conjectured formula to discern the \textit{relative ambiguities} of the system, which can serve as a reliable proxy for the relative amounts of information flow. We illustrate and validate this approach with numerical evidence.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of 1D discontinuous maps with multiple partitions and linear functions having the same fixed point. An application to financial market modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Piecewise smooth systems are intensively studied today in many application areas, such as economics, finance, engineering, biology, and ecology. In this work, we consider a class of one-dimensional piecewise linear discontinuous maps with a finite number of partitions and functions sharing the same real fixed point. We show that the dynamics of this class of maps can be analyzed using the well-known piecewise linear circle map and prove that their bounded behavior, unrelated to the fixed point, may consist of either nonhyperbolic cycles or quasiperiodic orbits densely filling certain segments, with possible coexistence. A corresponding model describing the price dynamics of a financial market serves as an illustrative example. While simulated model dynamics may be mistaken for chaotic behavior, our results demonstrate that they are quasiperiodic.</description>

      <title>Topology of The Polar Vortex and Montana Weather</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the use of Topological Data Analysis (TDA) to investigate patterns in zonal-mean zonal winds of the Arctic, which make up the polar vortex, in order to better explain polar vortex dynamics. We demonstrate how TDA reveals significant topological features in this polar vortex data, and how they may relate these features to the collapse of the stratospheric vortex during the winter in the northern hemisphere. Using a time series representation of this data, we build a point cloud using the principles of Takens' Embedding theorem and apply persistent homology to uncover nontrivial topological structures that provide insight into the dynamical system's chaotic and periodic behaviors. These structures can offer new perspectives on the dynamics of the polar vortex, and perhaps other weather regimes, all of which have a global impact. Our results show clear transitions between seasons, with substantial increases in topological activity during periods of extreme cold. This is particularly evident in the historically strong polar vortex event of early 2016. Our analysis captures the persistence of topological features during such events and may even offer insights into vortex splitting, as indicated by the number of distinct persistent features. This work highlights the potential of TDA in climate science, offering a novel approach to studying complex dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>On the (Dis)connection Between Growth and Primitive Periodic Points</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1972, Cornalba and Shiffman showed that the number of zeros of an order zero holomorphic function in two or more variables can grow arbitrarily fast. We generalize this finding to the setting of complex dynamics, establishing that the number of isolated primitive periodic points of an order zero holomorphic function in two or more variables can grow arbitrarily fast as well. This answers a recent question posed by L. Buhovsky, I. Polterovich, L. Polterovich, E. Shelukhin and V. Stojisavljevi\'c.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Analysis of the Total Quasi-Steady State Approximation for the Michaelis--Menten Enzyme Kinetic Reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a stochastic model of the Michaelis-Menten (MM) enzyme kinetic reactions in terms of Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) driven by Poisson Random Measures (PRMs). It has been argued that among various Quasi-Steady State Approximations (QSSAs) for the deterministic model of such chemical reactions, the total QSSA (tQSSA) is the most accurate approximation, and it is valid for a wider range of parameter values than the standard QSSA (sQSSA). While the sQSSA for this model has been rigorously derived from a probabilistic perspective at least as early as 2006 in Ball et al. (2006), a rigorous study of the tQSSA for the stochastic model appears missing. We fill in this gap by deriving it as a Functional Law of Large Numbers (FLLN), and also studying the fluctuations around this approximation as a Functional Central Limit Theorem (FCLT).</description>

      <title>TempTest: Local Normalization Distortion and the Detection of Machine-generated Text</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing methods for the zero-shot detection of machine-generated text are dominated by three statistical quantities: log-likelihood, log-rank, and entropy. As language models mimic the distribution of human text ever closer, this will limit our ability to build effective detection algorithms. To combat this, we introduce a method for detecting machine-generated text that is entirely agnostic of the generating language model. This is achieved by targeting a defect in the way that decoding strategies, such as temperature or top-k sampling, normalize conditional probability measures. This method can be rigorously theoretically justified, is easily explainable, and is conceptually distinct from existing methods for detecting machine-generated text. We evaluate our detector in the white and black box settings across various language models, datasets, and passage lengths. We also study the effect of paraphrasing attacks on our detector and the extent to which it is biased against non-native speakers. In each of these settings, the performance of our test is at least comparable to that of other state-of-the-art text detectors, and in some cases, we strongly outperform these baselines.</description>

      <title>Symmetrization and the rate of convergence of semigroups of holomorphic functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $(\phi_t)$, $t\ge 0$, be a semigroup of holomorphic self-maps of the unit disk $\mathbb{D}$. Let $\Omega$ be its Koenigs domain and $\tau\in \partial \mathbb{D}$ be its Denjoy-Wolff point. Suppose that $0\in \Omega$ and let $\Omega^\sharp$ be the Steiner symmetrization of $\Omega$ with respect to the real axis. Consider the semigroup $(\phi_t^\sharp)$ with Koenigs domain $\Omega^\sharp$ and let $\tau^\sharp$ be its Denjoy-Wolff point. We show that, up to a multiplicative constant, the rate of convergence of $(\phi_t^\sharp)$ is slower than that of $(\phi_t)$; that is, for every $t&gt;0$, $|\phi_t(0)-\tau|\leq 4\pi\, |\phi_t^\sharp(0)-\tau^\sharp|$. The main tool for the proof is the harmonic measure.</description>

      <title>Development of New Methods for Detection and Control of Credit Card Fraud Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Credit card fraud causes significant financial losses and frequently occurs as fraud attack, defined as short-term sequence of fraudulent transactions associated with high transaction rates and amounts, business areas historically tied to fraud, unusual transaction times and locations and different types of errors. Confidence interval method in the moving window with exponential forgetting is proposed in this report which allows to capture recent changes in the shopping behaviour of the cardholder, detect fraudulent amounts and mitigate the attack. Fraud risk scoring method is used for estimation of the intensity of the fraudulent activity via monitoring of the transaction rates, merchant category codes, times and some other factors for detection of the start of the attack. The development and verification are based on detailed analysis of the transaction patterns from the dataset, which represents an extensive collection of around 24.4 million credit card transactions from IBM financial database. Recommendations for further development of the detection techniques are also presented.</description>

Abstract: For geometrically finite group actions on hyperbolic metric spaces and under certain assumptions on the growth of parabolic subgroups, we prove a global shadow lemma for Patterson-Sullivan measures, as well as a Dirichlet-type theorem and a logarithm law for excursion of geodesics into cusps. We then apply these results to geometrically finite quotients of strictly convex Hilbert geometries with C^1 boundary.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian control to desynchronize Kuramoto oscillators with higher-order interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13578v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Synchronization is a ubiquitous phenomenon in nature. Although it is necessary for the functioning of many systems, too much synchronization can also be detrimental, e.g., (partially) synchronized brain patterns support high-level cognitive processes and bodily control, but hypersynchronization can lead to epileptic seizures and tremors, as in neurodegenerative conditions such as Parkinson's disease.
  Consequently, a critical research question is how to develop effective pinning control methods capable to reduce or modulate synchronization as needed.
  Although such methods exist to control pairwise-coupled oscillators, there are none for higher-order interactions, despite the increasing evidence of their relevant role in brain dynamics.
  In this work, we fill this gap by proposing a generalized control method designed to desynchronize Kuramoto oscillators connected through higher-order interactions. Our method embeds a higher-order Kuramoto model into a suitable Hamiltonian flow, and builds up on previous work in Hamiltonian control theory to analytically construct a feedback control mechanism.
  We numerically show that the proposed method effectively prevents synchronization in synthetics and empirical higher-order networks. Although our findings indicate that pairwise contributions in the feedback loop are often sufficient, the higher-order generalization becomes crucial when pairwise coupling is weak. Finally, we explore the minimum number of controlled nodes required to fully desynchronize oscillators coupled via an all-to-all hypergraphs.</description>

Abstract: This work establishes a linear response formula for sequential intermittent dynamical systems, consisting of Liverani-Saussol-Vaienti maps with varying parameters. As a consequence, we establish quenched (trajectory-wise) linear response for random compositions of these maps, complementing recent annealed (averaged) results in this setting. As an intermediate step, we show existence, uniqueness and statistical stability of the sequential equivariant densities for such non-uniformly expanding systems. Our arguments rely on the cone technique introduced by Baladi and Todd and further developed by Lepp{\"a}nen.</description>

      <title>Validation of Neural Network Controllers for Uncertain Systems Through Keep-Close Approach: Robustness Analysis and Safety Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.06532v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Among the major challenges in neural control system technology is the validation and certification of the safety and robustness of neural network (NN) controllers against various uncertainties including unmodelled dynamics, nonlinearities, and time delays. One way in providing such validation guarantees is to maintain the closed-loop system output with a NN controller when its input changes within a bounded set, close to the output of a robustly performing closed-loop reference model. This paper presents a novel approach to analysing the performance and robustness of uncertain feedback systems with NN controllers. Due to the complexity of analysing such systems, the problem is reformulated as the problem of dynamical tracking errors between the closed-loop system with a neural controller and an ideal closed-loop reference model. Then, the approximation of the controller error is characterised by adopting the differential mean value theorem (DMV) and the Integral Quadratic Constraints (IQCs) technique. Moreover, the Relative Integral Square Error (RISE) and the Supreme Square Error (SSE) bounded set are derived for the output of the error dynamical system. The analysis is then performed by integrating Lyapunov theory with the IQCs-based technique. The resulting worst-case analysis provides the user a prior knowledge about the worst case of RISE and SSE between the reference closed-loop model and the uncertain system controlled by the neural controller.</description>

      <title>Non-linear correlations underlie linear response and causality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08708v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The inference of causal relationships among observed variables is a pivotal, longstanding problem in the scientific community. An intuitive method for quantifying these causal links involves examining the response of one variable to perturbations in another. The fluctuation-dissipation theorem elegantly connects this response to the correlation functions of the unperturbed system, thereby bridging the concepts of causality and correlation. However, this relationship becomes intricate in nonlinear systems, where knowledge of the invariant measure is required but elusive, especially in high-dimensional spaces. In this study, we establish a novel link between the Koopman operator of nonlinear stochastic systems and the response function. This connection provides an alternative method for computing the response function using generalized correlation functions, even when the invariant measure is unknown. We validate our theoretical framework by applying it to a nonlinear high-dimensional system amenable to exact solutions, demonstrating convergence and consistency with established results. Finally, we discuss a significant interplay between the resulting causal network and the relevant time scales of the system.</description>
