      <title>Dynamic and Static Energy Efficient Design of Pinching Antenna Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the energy efficiency of pinching-antenna systems (PASSs) by developing a consistent formulation for power distribution in these systems. The per-antenna power distribution in PASSs is not controlled explicitly by a power allocation policy, but rather implicitly through tuning of pinching couplings and locations. Both these factors are tunable: (i) pinching locations are tuned using movable elements, and (ii) couplings can be tuned by varying the effective coupling length of the pinching elements. While the former is feasible to be addressed dynamically in settings with low user mobility, the latter cannot be addressed at a high rate. We thus develop a class of hybrid dynamic-static algorithms, which maximize the energy efficiency by updating the system parameters at different rates. Our experimental results depict that dynamic tuning of pinching locations can significantly boost energy efficiency of PASSs.</description>

      <title>SSMRadNet : A Sample-wise State-Space Framework for Efficient and Ultra-Light Radar Segmentation and Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce SSMRadNet, the first multi-scale State Space Model (SSM) based detector for Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radar that sequentially processes raw ADC samples through two SSMs. One SSM learns a chirp-wise feature by sequentially processing samples from all receiver channels within one chirp, and a second SSM learns a representation of a frame by sequentially processing chirp-wise features. The latent representations of a radar frame are decoded to perform segmentation and detection tasks. Comprehensive evaluations on the RADIal dataset show SSMRadNet has 10-33x fewer parameters and 60-88x less computation (GFLOPs) while being 3.7x faster than state-of-the-art transformer and convolution-based radar detectors at competitive performance for segmentation tasks.</description>

      <title>Power Control Design for ISAC Optimization in User-Target-Centric Cell-Free mMIMO Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the power control design for a cell-free massive MIMO (CF-mMIMO) system that performs integrated sensing and communications (ISAC). Specifically, the case where many access points are deployed to simultaneously communicate with mobile users and monitor the surrounding environment at the same time-frequency slot is considered. On top of the user-centric architecture used for the data services, a target-centric approach is introduced for the detection tasks. As a valuable performance metric, we derive the receive sensing signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio under generalized likelihood ratio test processing. Based on that, we formulate a quality-of-service (QoS) scheme that maximizes the two figures of merit: achievable data rate and effective sensing SNR. Simulations demonstrate that our proposal surpasses orthogonal resource algorithms, underscoring the potential of ISAC-enabled CF-mMIMO networks.</description>

      <title>DRL-Based Beam Positioning for LEO Satellite Constellations with Weighted Least Squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning based beam weighting framework that couples a policy network with an augmented weighted least squares (WLS) estimator for accurate and low-complexity positioning in multi-beam LEO constellations. Unlike conventional geometry or CSI-dependent approaches, the policy learns directly from uplink pilot responses and geometry features, enabling robust localization without explicit CSI estimation. An augmented WLS jointly estimates position and receiver clock bias, improving numerical stability under dynamic beam geometry. Across representative scenarios, the proposed method reduces the mean positioning error by 99.3% compared with the geometry-based baseline, achieving 0.395 m RMSE with near real-time inference.</description>

      <title>OG-PCL: Efficient Sparse Point Cloud Processing for Human Activity Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human activity recognition (HAR) with millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar offers a privacy-preserving and robust alternative to camera- and wearable-based approaches. In this work, we propose the Occupancy-Gated Parallel-CNN Bi-LSTM (OG-PCL) network to process sparse 3D radar point clouds produced by mmWave sensing. Designed for lightweight deployment, the parameter size of the proposed OG-PCL is only 0.83M and achieves 91.75 accuracy on the RadHAR dataset, outperforming those existing baselines such as 2D CNN, PointNet, and 3D CNN methods. We validate the advantages of the tri-view parallel structure in preserving spatial information across three dimensions while maintaining efficiency through ablation studies. We further introduce the Occupancy-Gated Convolution (OGConv) block and demonstrate the necessity of its occupancy compensation mechanism for handling sparse point clouds. The proposed OG-PCL thus offers a compact yet accurate framework for real-time radar-based HAR on lightweight platforms.</description>

      <title>Linear-Bias Time Encoding for Low-Rate Quantized Representation of Bandlimited Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrate-and-fire time encoding machines (IF-TEMs) provide an efficient framework for asynchronous sampling of bandlimited signals through discrete firing times. However, conventional IF-TEMs often exhibit excessive oversampling, leading to inefficient encoding for signals with smoothly distributed information. This letter introduces a linear-bias IF-TEM (LB-IF-TEM), where the bias dynamically tracks the input signal to maintain a nearly constant integrator input, thereby localizing the firing intervals. The resulting concentrated distribution enables effective non-uniform quantization with reduced distortion. Theoretical analysis establishes explicit bounds on the achievable oversampling range, while experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method attains comparable reconstruction accuracy at significantly lower bitrate than existing IF-TEM variants. The LB-IF-TEM thus provides a low-power, communication-efficient, and analytically tractable framework for time-based signal encoding and reconstruction.</description>

      <title>RadHARSimulator V2: Video to Doppler Generator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radar-based human activity recognition (HAR) still lacks a comprehensive simulation method. Existing software is developed based on models or motion-captured data, resulting in limited flexibility. To address this issue, a simulator that directly generates Doppler spectra from recorded video footage (RadHARSimulator V2) is presented in this paper. Both computer vision and radar modules are included in the simulator. In computer vision module, the real-time model for object detection with global nearest neighbor is first used to detect and track human targets in the video. Then, the high-resolution network is used to estimate two-dimensional poses of the detected human targets. Next, the three-dimensional poses of the detected human targets are obtained by nearest matching method. Finally, smooth temporal three-dimensional pose estimation is achieved through Kalman filtering. In radar module, pose interpolation and smoothing are first achieved through the Savitzky-Golay method. Second, the delay model and the mirror method are used to simulate echoes in both free-space and through-the-wall scenarios. Then, range-time map is generated using pulse compression, moving target indication, and DnCNN. Next, Doppler-time map (DTM) is generated using short-time Fourier transform and DnCNN again. Finally, the ridge features on the DTM are extracted using the maximum local energy method. In addition, a hybrid parallel-serial neural network architecture is proposed for radar-based HAR. Numerical experiments are conducted and analyzed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the designed simulator and the proposed network model.

      <title>VAE-Based Synthetic EMG Generation with Mix-Consistency Loss for Recognizing Unseen Motion Combinations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electromyogram (EMG)-based motion classification using machine learning has been widely employed in applications such as prosthesis control. While previous studies have explored generating synthetic patterns of combined motions to reduce training data requirements, these methods assume that combined motions can be represented as linear combinations of basic motions. However, this assumption often fails due to complex neuromuscular phenomena such as muscle co-contraction, resulting in low-fidelity synthetic signals and degraded classification performance. To address this limitation, we propose a novel method that learns to synthesize combined motion patterns in a structured latent space. Specifically, we employ a variational autoencoder (VAE) to encode EMG signals into a low-dimensional representation and introduce a mixconsistency loss that structures the latent space such that combined motions are embedded between their constituent basic motions. Synthetic patterns are then generated within this structured latent space and used to train classifiers for recognizing unseen combined motions. We validated our approach through upper-limb motion classification experiments with eight healthy participants. The results demonstrate that our method outperforms input-space synthesis approaches, achieving approximately 30% improvement in accuracy.</description>

      <title>xHAP: Cross-Modal Attention for Haptic Feedback Estimation in the Tactile Internet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Tactile Internet requires ultra-low latency and high-fidelity haptic feedback to enable immersive teleoperation. A key challenge is to ensure ultra-reliable and low-latency transmission of haptic packets under channel variations and potential network outages. To address these issues, one approach relies on local estimation of haptic feedback at the operator side. However, designing an accurate estimator that can faithfully reproduce the true haptic forces remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning architecture, xHAP, based on cross-modal attention to estimate haptic feedback. xHAP fuses information from two distinct data streams: the teleoperator's historical force feedback and the operator's control action sequence. We employ modality-specific encoders to learn temporal representations, followed by a cross-attention layer where the teleoperator haptic data attend to the operator input. This fusion allows the model to selectively focus on the most relevant operator sensory data when predicting the teleoperator's haptic feedback. The proposed architecture reduces the mean-squared error by more than two orders of magnitude compared to existing methods and lowers the SNR requirement for reliable transmission by $10~\mathrm{dB}$ at an error threshold of $0.1$ in a 3GPP UMa scenario. Additionally, it increases coverage by $138\%$ and supports $59.6\%$ more haptic users even under 10 dB lower SNR compared to the baseline.</description>

      <title>LMMSE-Optimal Pilot Pattern Design Based on Covariance Matrix Approximation for OFDM Channel Estimation in Doubly Dispersive Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the optimal pilot pattern design, in the linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) estimator sense, for OFDM systems in doubly dispersive channels. To enable analytical tractability, the channel covariance matrix is decomposed into the Kronecker product of two Hermitian Toeplitz matrices corresponding to the delay and Doppler domains. By invoking the Szeg\"{o} limit theorem, these matrices are shown to be approximately diagonalizable by discrete Fourier transform (DFT) matrices. Based on this structure, the LMMSE channel estimation error is reformulated into a compact analytical form, from which a closed-form lower bound is derived. Furthermore, we establish the condition under which this bound is achieved by a lattice-based pilot pattern. Numerical results verify that the proposed matrix approximation introduces negligible error and examples of the proposed lattice design are given.</description>

      <title>Mip-NeWRF: Enhanced Wireless Radiance Field with Hybrid Encoding for Channel Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work on wireless radiance fields represents a promising deep learning approach for channel prediction, however, in complex environments these methods still exhibit limited robustness, slow convergence, and modest accuracy due to insufficiently refined modeling. To address this issue, we propose Mip-NeWRF, a physics-informed neural framework for accurate indoor channel prediction based on sparse channel measurements. The framework operates in a ray-based pipeline with coarse-to-fine importance sampling: frustum samples are encoded, processed by a shared multilayer perceptron (MLP), and the outputs are synthesized into the channel frequency response (CFR). Prior to MLP input, Mip-NeWRF performs conical-frustum sampling and applies a scale-consistent hybrid positional encoding to each frustum. The scale-consistent normalization aligns positional encodings across scene scales, while the hybrid encoding supplies both scale-robust, low-frequency stability to accelerate convergence and fine spatial detail to improve accuracy. During training, a curriculum learning schedule is applied to stabilize and accelerate convergence of the shared MLP. During channel synthesis, the MLP outputs, including predicted virtual transmitter presence probabilities and amplitudes, are combined with modeled pathloss and surface interaction attenuation to enhance physical fidelity and further improve accuracy. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach: in typical scenarios, the normalized mean square error (NMSE) is reduced by 14.3 dB versus state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>Characterizing ISCI in Multi-carrier ISAC Systems over Doubly Dispersive Channel: Joint Sensing and Communication Performance Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a systematic analysis of inter-symbol and inter-carrier interference (ISCI) modeling in doubly dispersive channels for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. We propose a generalized OFDM (Weyl-Heisenberg) framework to evaluate four ISCI treatment approaches: (1) explicit estimation and compensation, (2) complete ignorance, (3) uncorrelated colored noise approximation, and (4) correlated colored noise modeling. Through continuous delay-Doppler channel characterization, we derive LMMSE channel estimators and corresponding estimation errors (as sensing metrics) for both pilot-assisted and fully-known symbol scenarios. The communication performance is quantified via ergodic capacity bounds under imperfect CSI. Our theoretical analysis and numerical results reveal fundamental performance-complexity trade-offs, providing insights for practical ISAC waveform and receiver design in doubly dispersive channels.</description>

      <title>Delay-Multiply-And-Sum Beamforming for Real-Time In-Air Acoustic Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In-air acoustic imaging systems demand beamforming techniques that offer a high dynamic range and spatial resolution while also remaining robust. Conventional Delay-and-Sum (DAS) beamforming fails to meet these quality demands due to high sidelobes, a wide main lobe and the resulting low contrast, whereas advanced adaptive methods are typically precluded by the computational cost and the single-snapshot constraint of real-time field operation. To overcome this trade-off, we propose and detail the implementation of higher-order non-linear beamforming methods using the Delay-Multiply-and-Sum technique, coupled with Coherence Factor weighting, specifically adapted for ultrasonic in-air microphone arrays. Our efficient implementation allows for enabling GPU-accelerated, real-time performance on embedded computing platforms. Through validation against the DAS baseline using simulated and real-world acoustic data, we demonstrate that the proposed method provides significant improvements in image contrast, establishing higher-order non-linear beamforming as a practical, high-performance solution for in-air acoustic imaging.</description>

      <title>Two-Dimensional Pinching-Antenna Systems: Modeling and Beamforming Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the pinching-antenna system (PASS) has emerged as a promising architecture owing to its ability to reconfigure large-scale path loss and signal phase by activating radiation points along a dielectric waveguide. However, existing studies mainly focus on line-shaped PASS architectures, whose limited spatial flexibility constrains their applicability in multiuser and indoor scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel two-dimensional (2D) pinching-antenna system (2D-PASS) that extends the conventional line-shaped structure into a continuous dielectric waveguide plane, thereby forming a reconfigurable radiating plane capable of dynamic beam adaptation across a 2D spatial domain. An optimization framework is developed to maximize the minimum received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) among user equipments (UEs) by adaptively adjusting the spatial configuration of pinching antennas (PAs), serving as an analog beamforming mechanism for dynamic spatial control. For the continuous-position scenario, a particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based algorithm is proposed to efficiently explore the nonconvex search space, while a discrete variant is introduced to accommodate practical hardware constraints with limited PA placement resolution. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed 2D-PASS substantially improves the minimum SNR compared with conventional line-shaped PASS and fixed-position antenna (FPA) benchmarks, while maintaining robustness under varying user distributions and distances.</description>

      <title>Positioning via Digital-Twin-Aided Channel Charting with Large-Scale CSI Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Channel charting (CC) is a self-supervised positioning technique whose main limitation is that the estimated positions lie in an arbitrary coordinate system that is not aligned with true spatial coordinates. In this work, we propose a novel method to produce CC locations in true spatial coordinates with the aid of a digital twin (DT). Our main contribution is a new framework that (i) extracts large-scale channel-state information (CSI) features from estimated CSI and the DT and (ii) matches these features with a cosine-similarity loss function. The DT-aided loss function is then combined with a conventional CC loss to learn a positioning function that provides true spatial coordinates without relying on labeled data. Our results for a simulated indoor scenario demonstrate that the proposed framework reduces the relative mean distance error by 29% compared to the state of the art. We also show that the proposed approach is robust to DT modeling mismatches and a distribution shift in the testing data.</description>

      <title>Constellation Design and Detection under Generalized Hardware Impairments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a maximum-likelihood detection framework that jointly mitigates hardware (HW) impairments in both amplitude and phase. By modeling transceiver distortions as residual amplitude and phase noise, we introduce the approximate phase-and-amplitude distortion detector (PAD-D), which operates in the polar domain and effectively mitigates both distortion components through distortion-aware weighting. The proposed detector performs reliable detection under generalized HW impairment conditions, achieving substantial performance gains over the conventional Euclidean detector (EUC-D) and the Gaussian-assumption phase noise detector (GAP-D), which is primarily designed to address phase distortions. In addition, we derive a closed-form high-SNR symbol error probability (SEP) approximation, which offers a generic analytical expression applicable to arbitrary constellations. Simulation results demonstrate that the PAD-D achieves up to an order-of-magnitude reduction in the error floor relative to EUC-D and GAP-D for both high-order quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) and super amplitude phase-shift keying (SAPSK) constellations, establishing a unified and practical framework for detection under realistic transceiver impairments. Building on this framework, we further develop optimized constellations tailored to PAD-D, where the symbol positions are optimized in the complex plane to minimize SEP. The optimality of these constellations is confirmed through extensive simulations, which also verify the accuracy of the proposed analytical SEP approximation, even for the optimized designs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel electromagnetic (EM) structure termed flexible continuous aperture array (FCAPA) is proposed, which incorporates inherent surface flexibility into typical continuous aperture array (CAPA) systems, thereby enhancing the degrees-of-freedom (DoF) of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems equipped with this technology. By formulating and solving a downlink multi-user beamforming optimization problem to maximize the weighted sum rate (WSR) of the multiple users with FCAPA, it is shown that the proposed structure outperforms typical CAPA systems by a wide margin, with performance increasing with increasing morphability.</description>

      <title>2D Waveguide-Fed Metasurface Antenna Arrays: Modeling and Optimization for Bistatic Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a physics-consistent framework for bistatic sensing incorporating a 2-Dimensional (2D) waveguide-fed metasurface antenna array capable of realizing eXtremely-Large Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (XL MIMO) apertures. A coupled-dipole model is presented that captures the array's mutual coupling due to both waveguide and free-space interactions, and a novel passivity constraint on the corresponding magnetic polarizabilities is proposed. Focusing on a bistatic sensing setup, we leverage a Neumann-series approximation of the array response model and derive the Cramer-Rao bound for multi-target parameter estimation, which is then incorporated into a sensing optimization formulation with respect to the metasurface's per-element resonance strength configuration. Simulation results on the position error bound in the radiative near field with the proposed design quantify the critical role of metamaterial placement in strongly coupled metasurface-based XL MIMO bistatic sensing systems.</description>

      <title>End-to-End Hardware Modeling and Sensitivity Optimization of Photoacoustic Signal Readout Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sensitivity of the acoustic detection subsystem in photoacoustic imaging (PAI) critically affects image quality. However, previous studies often focused only on front-end acoustic components or back-end electronic components, overlooking end-to-end coupling among the transducer, cable, and receiver. This work develops a complete analytical model for system-level sensitivity optimization based on the Krimholtz, Leedom, and Matthaei (KLM) model. The KLM model is rederived from first principles of linear piezoelectric constitutive equations, 1D wave equations and transmission line theory to clarify its physical basis and applicable conditions. By encapsulating the acoustic components into a controlled voltage source and extending the model to include lumped-parameter representations of cable and receiver, an end-to-end equivalent circuit is established. Analytical expressions for the system transfer functions are derived, revealing the coupling effects among key parameters such as transducer element area (EA), cable length (CL), and receiver impedance (RI). Experimental results validate the model with an average error below 5%. Additionally, a low-frequency tailing phenomenon arising from exceeding the 1D vibration assumption is identified and analyzed, illustrating the importance of understanding the model's applicable conditions and providing a potential pathway for artifact suppression. This work offers a comprehensive framework for optimizing detection sensitivity and improving image fidelity in PAI systems.</description>

      <title>A cross-modal pre-training framework with video data for improving performance and generalization of distributed acoustic sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fiber-optic distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) has emerged as a critical Internet-of-Things (IoT) sensing technology with broad industrial applications. However, the two-dimensional spatial-temporal morphology of DAS signals presents analytical challenges where conventional methods prove suboptimal, while being well-suited for deep learning approaches. Although our previous work, DAS Masked Autoencoder (DAS-MAE), established state-of-the-art performance and generalization without labels, it is not satisfactory in frequency analysis in temporal-dominated DAS data. Moreover, the limitation of effective training data fails to address the substantial data requirements inherent to Transformer architectures in DAS-MAE. To overcome these limitations, we present an enhanced framework incorporating short-time Fourier transform (STFT) for explicit temporal-frequency feature extraction and pioneering video-to-DAS cross-modal pre-training to mitigate data constraints. This approach learns high-level representations (e.g., event classification) through label-free reconstruction tasks. Experimental results demonstrate transformative improvements: 0.1% error rate in few-shot classification (90.9% relative improvement over DAS-MAE) and 4.7% recognition error in external damage prevention applications (75.4% improvement over from-scratch training). As the first work to pioneer video-to-DAS cross-modal pre-training, available training resources are expanded by bridging computer vision and distributed sensing areas. The enhanced performance and generalization facilitate DAS deployment across diverse industrial scenarios while advancing cross-modal representation learning for industrial IoT sensing.</description>

      <title>Reduced-Complexity Model Selection and Rate Allocation for Multiple-Model Electrical Signal Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper adapts a Multiple-Model Coding (MMC) approach for sampled electrical signal waveforms to satisfy reconstructed signal quality constraints. The baseline MMC approach consists of two stages processing vectors of Voltage and Current Signal (VCS) of constant size and producing bitstreams of constant rate but varying quality. In the proposed approach, the parametric model and the rate allocated to the first stage, as well as the residual compression method of the second stage and its associated rate, are jointly optimized to achieve a target distortion of the reconstructed signal. Three approaches are proposed. An exhaustive search serves as a baseline for comparison. Then, an approach involving a Golden Section search is exploited to determine the rate of the first stage with reduced complexity. Finally, rate-distortion models of the compression efficiency for each model in the first stage are employed to obtain a subset of promising models in the first stage and reduced-size search intervals for the rate selection in both stages. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed reduced-complexity MMC approach reduces the rate for a given distortion constraint compared to state-of-the-art solutions for VCS with equivalent complexity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The massive scale of Internet of Things (IoT) connectivity expected in 6G networks raises unprecedented challenges in energy use, battery waste, and lifecycle sustainability. Current cellular IoT solutions remain bound to the lifetime of underlying network generations and rely on billions of disposable batteries, creating unsustainable economic and environmental costs. This article proposes generation-agnostic zero-energy devices (XG-ZEDs), a new class of backscatter based IoT devices that are battery-less, spectrum-agnostic, and future-proof across successive network generations. XG-ZEDs exploit existing ambient wireless signals for communication, sensing, and localization, transforming infrastructure and user devices into universal enablers of ultra-low-power connectivity. We review architectural classifications, communication protocols, network integration, and representative applications such as sensing, localization, and radio-SLAM, while outlining the challenges ahead.</description>

      <title>Equivalence of Several 6G Modulation Schemes for Doubly-Selective Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is significant recent interest in designing new modulation schemes for doubly-selective channels with large delay and Doppler spreads, where legacy modulation schemes based on time-frequency signal representations do not perform well. In this paper, we develop a framework for analyzing such modulations using two characteristics -- non-selectivity and predictability -- which directly relate to the diversity and spectral efficiency that the modulations achieve. We show that modulations in the delay-Doppler, chirp and time-sequency domains are non-selective, predictable and equivalent to one another, whereas time-frequency modulations are selective and non-predictable.</description>

      <title>LLM Enabled Beam Training for Pinching Antenna Systems (PASS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To enable intelligent beam training, a large language model (LLM)-enabled beam training framework is proposed for the pinching antenna system (PASS) in downlink multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications. A novel LLM-based beam training supervised learning mechanism is developed, allowing context-aware and environment-adaptive probing for PASS to reduce overheads. Both single-user and multi-user cases are considered. 1) For single-user case, the LLM-based pinching beamforming codebook generation problem is formulated to maximize the beamforming gain. Then, the optimal transmit beamforming is obtained by maximum ratio transmission (MRT). 2) For multi-user case, a joint codebook generation and beam selection problem is formulated based on the system sum rate under the minimum mean square error (MMSE) transmit beamforming. The training labels for pinching beamforming are constructed by selecting the beam combination that maximizes system performance from each user's Top-S candidate beams. Based on pretrained Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPTs), the LLM is trained in an end-to-end fashion to minimize the cross-entropy loss. Simulation results demonstrate that: i) For single-user case, the proposed LLM-enabled PASS attains over 95% Top-1 accuracy in beam selection and achieves 51.92% improvements in beamforming gains compared to conventional method. ii) For multi-user case, the proposed LLM-enabled PASS framework significantly outperforms both the LLM-based massive MIMO and conventional PASS beam training, achieving up to 57.14% and 33.33% improvements in sum rate, respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fully digital massive MIMO systems with large numbers (1000+) of antennas offer dramatically increased capacity gains from spatial multiplexing and beamforming. Designing digital receivers that can scale to these array dimensions presents significant challenges regarding both channel estimation overhead and digital computation. This paper presents a computationally efficient and low-overhead receiver design based on long-term beamforming. The method combines finding a low-rank projection from the spatial covariance estimate with a fast polynomial matrix inverse. Ray tracing simulations show minimal loss relative to complete instantaneous beamforming while offering significant overhead and computational gains.</description>

      <title>Outage Probability Analysis of MRC-Based Fluid Antenna Systems under Rician Fading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates a fluid antenna system (FAS) where a single-antenna transmitter communicates with a receiver equipped with a fluid antenna (FA) over a Rician fading channel. Considering that multiple ports among the M available FA ports can be activated, the receiver selects the best K with the highest instantaneous signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and combines the received signals at the selected ports using maximum ratio combining. The statistics of the post-combining SNR are derived using a Laplace transform-based approach, which allows to analyze the outage probability (OP) of the FAS. Additional closed-form expressions for a lower bound on the OP and the asymptotic OP at high SNR are presented. Numerical results validate the analytical framework and demonstrate the interplay of key system parameters on the performance of the considered MRC-based FAS.</description>

      <title>ParaS2S: Benchmarking and Aligning Spoken Language Models for Paralinguistic-aware Speech-to-Speech Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech-to-Speech (S2S) models have shown promising dialogue capabilities, but their ability to handle paralinguistic cues--such as emotion, tone, and speaker attributes--and to respond appropriately in both content and style remains underexplored. Progress is further hindered by the scarcity of high-quality and expressive demonstrations. To address this, we introduce a novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework for paralinguistic-aware S2S, ParaS2S, which evaluates and optimizes both content and speaking style directly at the waveform level. We first construct ParaS2SBench, a benchmark comprehensively evaluates S2S models' output for content and style appropriateness from diverse and challenging input queries. It scores the fitness of input-output pairs and aligns well with human judgments, serving as an automatic judge for model outputs. With this scalable scoring feedback, we enable the model to explore and learn from diverse unlabeled speech via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Experiments show that existing S2S models fail to respond appropriately to paralinguistic attributes, performing no better than pipeline-based baselines. Our RL approach achieves a 11% relative improvement in response content and style's appropriateness on ParaS2SBench over supervised fine-tuning (SFT), surpassing all prior models while requiring substantially fewer warm-up annotations than pure SFT.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, a measurement-driven framework is proposed for early radio link failure (RLF) prediction in 5G non-standalone (NSA) railway environments. Using 10 Hz metro-train traces with serving and neighbor-cell indicators, we benchmark six models, namely CNN, LSTM, XGBoost, Anomaly Transformer, PatchTST, and TimesNet, under varied observation windows and prediction horizons. When the observation window is three seconds, TimesNet attains the highest F1 score with a three-second prediction horizon, while CNN provides a favorable accuracy-latency tradeoff with a two-second horizon, enabling proactive actions such as redundancy and adaptive handovers. The results indicate that deep temporal models can anticipate reliability degradations several seconds in advance using lightweight features available on commercial devices, offering a practical path to early-warning control in 5G-based railway systems.</description>

      <title>Enabling Smart Radio Environments in the Frequency Domain With Movable Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Smart radio environments (SREs) enhance wireless communications by allowing control over the channel. They have been enabled through surfaces with reconfigurable electromagnetic (EM) properties, known as reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), and through flexible antennas, which can be viewed as realizations of SREs in the EM domain and space domain, respectively. However, these technologies rely on electronically reconfigurable or movable components, introducing implementation challenges that could hinder commercialization. To overcome these challenges, we propose a new domain to enable SREs, the frequency domain, through the concept of movable signals, where the signal spectrum can be dynamically moved along the frequency axis. We first analyze movable signals in multiple-input single-output (MISO) systems under line-of-sight (LoS) conditions, showing that they can achieve higher average received power than quantized equal gain transmission (EGT). We then study movable signals under non-line-of-sight (NLoS) conditions, showing that they remain effective by leveraging reflections from surfaces made of uniformly spaced elements with fixed EM properties, denoted as fixed intelligent surfaces (FISs). Analytical results reveal that a FIS-aided system using movable signals can achieve up to four times the received power of a RIS-aided system using fixed-frequency signals.</description>

      <title>MoE-Gyro: Self-Supervised Over-Range Reconstruction and Denoising for MEMS Gyroscopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06318v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: MEMS gyroscopes play a critical role in inertial navigation and motion control applications but typically suffer from a fundamental trade-off between measurement range and noise performance. Existing hardware-based solutions aimed at mitigating this issue introduce additional complexity, cost, and scalability challenges. Deep-learning methods primarily focus on noise reduction and typically require precisely aligned ground-truth signals, making them difficult to deploy in practical scenarios and leaving the fundamental trade-off unresolved. To address these challenges, we introduce Mixture of Experts for MEMS Gyroscopes (MoE-Gyro), a novel self-supervised framework specifically designed for simultaneous over-range signal reconstruction and noise suppression. MoE-Gyro employs two experts: an Over-Range Reconstruction Expert (ORE), featuring a Gaussian-Decay Attention mechanism for reconstructing saturated segments; and a Denoise Expert (DE), utilizing dual-branch complementary masking combined with FFT-guided augmentation for robust noise reduction. A lightweight gating module dynamically routes input segments to the appropriate expert. Furthermore, existing evaluation lack a comprehensive standard for assessing multi-dimensional signal enhancement. To bridge this gap, we introduce IMU Signal Enhancement Benchmark (ISEBench), an open-source benchmarking platform comprising the GyroPeak-100 dataset and a unified evaluation of IMU signal enhancement methods. We evaluate MoE-Gyro using our proposed ISEBench, demonstrating that our framework significantly extends the measurable range from 450 deg/s to 1500 deg/s, reduces Bias Instability by 98.4%, and achieves state-of-the-art performance, effectively addressing the long-standing trade-off in inertial sensing.</description>

      <title>Veli: Unsupervised Method and Unified Benchmark for Low-Cost Air Quality Sensor Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02724v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Urban air pollution is a major health crisis causing millions of premature deaths annually, underscoring the urgent need for accurate and scalable monitoring of air quality (AQ). While low-cost sensors (LCS) offer a scalable alternative to expensive reference-grade stations, their readings are affected by drift, calibration errors, and environmental interference. To address these challenges, we introduce Veli (Reference-free Variational Estimation via Latent Inference), an unsupervised Bayesian model that leverages variational inference to correct LCS readings without requiring co-location with reference stations, eliminating a major deployment barrier. Specifically, Veli constructs a disentangled representation of the LCS readings, effectively separating the true pollutant reading from the sensor noise. To build our model and address the lack of standardized benchmarks in AQ monitoring, we also introduce the Air Quality Sensor Data Repository (AQ-SDR). AQ-SDR is the largest AQ sensor benchmark to date, with readings from 23,737 LCS and reference stations across multiple regions. Veli demonstrates strong generalization across both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings, effectively handling sensor drift and erratic sensor behavior. Code for model and dataset will be made public when this paper is published.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08273v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents the analytical design of a new wide tuning range and low-noise millimeter-wave voltage control oscillators (VCO) for 5G technology. The small signal model analysis and phase noise of the VCOs will be presented to evaluate the start-up oscillation condition, oscillation frequency, and phase noise affecting factors. Theoretical analysis and simulation results show the outperformance of the proposed cascode cross-couple LC VCO topology compared to the conventional cross-coupled LC VCO in terms of frequency tuning range, VCO gain and phase noise level.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Hybrid Resource Utilisation and MCS-based Intelligent Layering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08383v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The coexistence of heterogeneous service classes in 5G Enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB), Ultra-Reliable Low Latency Communication (URLLC), and Massive Machine-Type Communication (mMTC) poses major challenges for meeting diverse Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements under limited spectrum and power resources. Existing radio access network (RAN) slicing schemes typically optimise isolated layers or objectives, lacking physical-layer realism, slot-level adaptability, and interpretable per-slice performance metrics. This paper presents a joint optimisation framework that integrates Dynamic Hybrid Resource Utilisation with MCS-Based Intelligent Layering, formulated as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) that jointly allocates bandwidth, power, and modulation and coding scheme (MCS) indices per slice. The model incorporates finite blocklength effects, channel misreporting, and correlated fading to ensure realistic operation. Two modes are implemented: a Baseline Mode that ensures resource-efficient QoS feasibility, and an Ideal-Chaser Mode that minimises deviation from ideal per-slice rates. Simulation results show that the proposed approach achieves energy efficiencies above $10^7$~kb/J in Baseline Mode and sub-millisecond latency with near-ideal throughput in Ideal-Chaser Mode, outperforming recent optimisation and learning-based methods in delay, fairness, and reliability. The framework provides a unified, interpretable, and computationally tractable solution for dynamic cross-layer resource management in 5G and beyond networks.</description>

      <title>Coexistence of eMBB+ and mMTC+ in Uplink Cell-Free Massive MIMO Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19117v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper tackles the problem of designing proper uplink multiple access schemes for coexistence between enhanced mobile broadband+ (eMBB+) users and massive machine-type communications+ (mMTC+) devices in a terminal-centric cell-free massive MIMO system. Specifically, the use of a time-frequency spreading technique for the mMTC+ devices has been proposed. Coupled with the assumption of imperfect channel knowledge, closed-form bounds of the achievable (ergodic) rate for the two data services are derived. Using suitable power control mechanisms, we show it is possible to efficiently multiplex eMBB+ and mMTC+ traffic in the same time-frequency resource grid. Numerical experiments reveal interesting trade-offs in the selection of the spreading gain and the number of serving access points within the system. Results also demonstrate that the performance of the mMTC+ devices is slightly affected by the presence of the eMBB+ users. Overall, our approach can endow good quality of service to both 6G cornerstones at once.</description>

      <title>Waveform Design for Over-the-Air Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20877v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In response to the increasing number of devices expected in next-generation networks, a shift to over-the-air (OTA) computing has been proposed. By leveraging the superposition of multiple access channels, OTA computing enables efficient resource management by supporting simultaneous uncoded transmission in the time and frequency domains. To advance the integration of OTA computing, our study presents a theoretical analysis that addresses practical issues encountered in current digital communication transceivers, such as transmitter synchronization (sync) errors and intersymbol interference (ISI). To this end, we investigate the theoretical mean squared error (MSE) for OTA transmission under sync errors and ISI, while also exploring methods for minimizing the MSE in OTA transmission. Using alternating optimization, we also derive optimal power policies for both the devices and the base station. In addition, we propose a novel deep neural network (DNN)-based approach to design waveforms that improve OTA transmission performance under sync errors and ISI. To ensure a fair comparison with existing waveforms such as raised cosine (RC) and better-than-raised-cosine (BTRC), we incorporate a custom loss function that integrates energy and bandwidth constraints along with practical design considerations such as waveform symmetry. Simulation results validate our theoretical analysis and demonstrate performance gains of the designed pulse over RC and BTRC waveforms. To facilitate testing of our results without the need to rebuild the DNN structure, we also provide curve-fitting parameters for the selected DNN-based waveforms.</description>

      <title>Meeting Future Mobile Traffic Needs by Peak-Throughput Design of Next-Gen RAN</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12621v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Growing congestion in current mobile networks necessitates innovative solutions. This paper explores the potential of mmWave 5G networks in urban settings, focusing on Integrated Access and Backhaul (IAB) and the Smart Radio Environment (SRE). The mmWave traffic will be mainly made of short bursts to transfer large volumes of data and long idle periods where data are processed. This must change the way of designing mobile radio networks. To this extent, we propose network planning models leveraging the maximization of the achievable peak throughput. Results highlight the advantages of this approach during the network planning phase, providing insights into better accommodating the demands of mobile traffic without sacrificing the overall network capacity.</description>

      <title>anyECG-chat: A Generalist ECG-MLLM for Flexible ECG Input and Multi-Task Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00942v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The advent of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has sparked interest in their application to electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis. However, existing ECG-focused MLLMs primarily focus on report generation tasks, often limited to single 12-lead, short-duration (10s) ECG inputs, thereby underutilizing the potential of MLLMs. To this end, we aim to develop a MLLM for ECG analysis that supports a broader range of tasks and more flexible ECG inputs. However, existing ECG-QA datasets are often monotonous. To address this gap, we first constructed the anyECG dataset, which encompasses a wide variety of tasks, including report generation, abnormal waveform localization, and open-ended question answering. In addition to standard hospital ECGs, we introduced long-duration reduced-lead ECGs for home environments and multiple ECG comparison scenarios commonly encountered in clinical practice. Furthermore, we propose the anyECG-chat model, which supports dynamic-length ECG inputs and multiple ECG inputs. We trained the model using a three-stage curriculum training recipe with the anyECG dataset. A comprehensive evaluation was conducted, demonstrating that anyECG-chat is capable of supporting various practical application scenarios, including not only common report generation tasks but also abnormal waveform localization for long-duration reduced-lead ECGs in home environments and comprehensive comparative analysis of multiple ECGs. Our code and data are available at: https://github.com/CuCl-2/anyECG-chat.</description>

      <title>Optimising Communication Control Factors for Energy Consumption in Rural V2X</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12539v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Connected braking can reduce fatal collisions in connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) by using reliable, low-latency 5G New Radio (NR) links, especially NR Sidelink Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X). In rural areas, road side units are sparse and power-constrained or off-grid, so energy efficiency must be considered alongside safety. This paper studies how three communication control factors including subcarrier spacing ($\mathrm{SCS}$), modulation and coding scheme ($\mathrm{MCS}$), and transmit power ($P_{\mathrm{t}}$) should be configured to balance safety and energy consumption in rural scenarios in light and heavy traffic scenarios. Safety is quantified by the packet receive ratio ($\mathrm{PRR}$) against the minimum communication distance $D_{\mathrm{comm}}$, defined as the distance that the vehicle travels during the transmission of the safety message. Results show that, under heavy traffic, increasing $P_{\mathrm{t}}$ and selecting a low-rate $\mathrm{MCS}$ at $\mathrm{SCS} = 30$ kHz sustains high $\mathrm{PRR}$ at $D_{\mathrm{comm}}$, albeit with higher energy cost. In light traffic, maintaining lower $P_\mathrm{t}$ with low $\mathrm{MCS}$ levels achieves a favorable reliability-energy trade-off while preserving acceptable $\mathrm{PRR}$ at $D_{\mathrm{comm}}$. These findings demonstrate the necessity of adaptive, energy-aware strategy to guarantee both safety and energy efficiency in rural V2X systems.</description>

      <title>Information Capacity: Evaluating the Efficiency of Large Language Models via Text Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08066v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent years have witnessed the rapid advancements of large language models (LLMs) and their expanding applications, leading to soaring demands for computational resources. The widespread adoption of test-time scaling further aggravates the tension between model capability and resource consumption, highlighting the importance of inference efficiency. However, a unified metric that accurately reflects an LLM's efficiency across different model sizes and architectures remains absent. Motivated by the correlation between compression and intelligence, we introduce information capacity, a measure of model efficiency based on text compression performance relative to computational complexity. Larger models can predict the next token more accurately, achieving greater compression gains but at higher computational costs. Empirical evaluations on mainstream open-source models show that models of varying sizes within a series exhibit consistent information capacity. This metric enables a fair efficiency comparison across model series and accurate performance prediction within a model series. A distinctive feature of information capacity is that it incorporates tokenizer efficiency, which affects both input and output token counts but is often neglected in LLM evaluations. We assess the information capacity of 49 models on 5 heterogeneous datasets and observe consistent results on the influences of tokenizer efficiency, pretraining data, and the mixture-of-experts architecture.</description>
