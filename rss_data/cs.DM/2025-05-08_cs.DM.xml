      <title>SAT-Solving the Poset Cover Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The poset cover problem seeks a minimum set of partial orders whose linear extensions cover a given set of linear orders. Recognizing its NP-completeness, we devised a non-trivial reduction to the Boolean satisfiability problem using a technique we call swap graphs, which avoids the complexity explosion of the naive method. By leveraging modern SAT solvers, we efficiently solve instances with reasonable universe sizes. Experimental results using the Z3 theorem prover on randomly generated inputs demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</description>

      <title>Learning-Based Approaches for Job Shop Scheduling Problems: A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Job Shop Scheduling (JSS) is one of the most studied combinatorial optimization problems. It involves scheduling a set of jobs with predefined processing constraints on a set of machines to achieve a desired objective, such as minimizing makespan, tardiness, or flowtime. Since it introduction, JSS has become an attractive research area. Many approaches have been successfully used to address this problem, including exact methods, heuristics, and meta-heuristics. Furthermore, various learning-based approaches have been proposed to solve the JSS problem. However, these approaches are still limited when compared to the more established methods. This paper summarizes and evaluates the most important works in the literature on machine learning approaches for the JSSP. We present models, analyze their benefits and limitations, and propose future research directions.</description>

      <title>On the mutiplicities of interpoint distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a set $X\subseteq\mathbb{R}^2$ of $n$ points and a distance $d&gt;0$, the multiplicity of $d$ is the number of times the distance $d$ appears between points in $X$. Let $a_1(X) \geq a_2(X) \geq \cdots \geq a_m(X)$ denote the multiplicities of the $m$ distances determined by $X$ and let $a(X)=\left(a_1(X),\dots,a_m(X)\right)$. In this paper, we study several questions from Erd\H{o}s's time regarding distance multiplicities. Among other results, we show that:
  (1) If $X$ is convex or ``not too convex'', then there exists a distance other than the diameter that has multiplicity at most $n$.
  (2) There exists a set $X \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2$ of $n$ points, such that many distances occur with high multiplicity. In particular, at least $n^{\Omega(1/\log\log{n})}$ distances have superlinear multiplicity in $n$.
  (3) For any (not necessarily fixed) integer $1\leq k\leq\log{n}$, there exists $X\subseteq\mathbb{R}^2$ of $n$ points, such that the difference between the $k^{\text{th}}$ and $(k+1)^{\text{th}}$ largest multiplicities is at least $\Omega(\frac{n\log{n}}{k})$. Moreover, the distances in $X$ with the largest $k$ multiplicities can be prescribed.
  (4) For every $n\in\mathbb{N}$, there exists $X\subseteq\mathbb{R}^2$ of $n$ points, not all collinear or cocircular, such that $a(X)= (n-1,n-2,\ldots,1)$. There also exists $Y\subseteq\mathbb{R}^2$ of $n$ points with pairwise distinct distance multiplicities and $a(Y) \neq (n-1,n-2,\ldots,1)$.</description>

      <title>Improved bounds on the zeros of the chromatic polynomial of graphs and claw-free graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that for any graph $G$ the (complex) zeros of its chromatic polynomial, $\chi_G(x)$, lie inside the disk centered at $0$ of radius $4.25 \Delta(G)$, where $\Delta(G)$ denote the maximum degree of $G$. This improves on a recent result of Jenssen, Patel and the second author, who proved a bound of $5.94\Delta(G)$. We moreover show that for graphs of sufficiently large girth we can replace $4.25$ by $3.60$ and for claw-free graphs we can replace $4.25$ by $3.81$.
  Our proofs build on the ideas developed by Jenssen, Patel and the second author, adding some new ideas. A key novel ingredient for claw-free graphs is to use a representation of the coefficients of the chromatic polynomial in terms of the number of certain partial acyclic orientations.</description>

      <title>New bounds for proper $h$-conflict-free colourings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A proper $k$-colouring of a graph $G$ is called $h$-conflict-free if every vertex $v$ has at least $\min\, \{h, {\rm deg}(v)\}$ colours appearing exactly once in its neighbourhood. Let $\chi_{\rm pcf}^h(G)$ denote the minimum $k$ such that such a colouring exists. We show that for every fixed $h\ge 1$, every graph $G$ of maximum degree $\Delta$ satisfies $\chi_{\rm pcf}^h(G) \le h\Delta + \mathcal{O}(\log \Delta)$. This expands on the work of Cho et al., and improves a recent result of Liu and Reed in the case $h=1$. We conjecture that for every $h\ge 1$ and every graph $G$ of maximum degree $\Delta$ sufficiently large, the bound $\chi_{\rm pcf}^h(G) \le h\Delta + 1$ should hold, which would be tight. When the minimum degree $\delta$ of $G$ is sufficiently large, namely $\delta \ge \max\{100h, 3000\log \Delta\}$, we show that this upper bound can be further reduced to $\chi_{\rm{pcf}}^h(G) \le \Delta + \mathcal{O}(\sqrt{h\Delta})$. This improves a recent bound from Kamyczura and Przyby{\l}o when $\delta \le \sqrt{h\Delta}$.</description>

      <title>A characterization of testable hypergraph properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.03303</link>
      <description>arXiv:1707.03303v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a combinatorial characterization of all testable properties of $k$-uniform hypergraphs ($k$-graphs for short). Here, a $k$-graph property $P$ is testable if there is a randomized algorithm which makes a bounded number of edge queries and distinguishes with probability $2/3$ between $k$-graphs that satisfy $P$ and those that are far from satisfying $P$. For the $2$-graph case, such a combinatorial characterization was obtained by Alon, Fischer, Newman and Shapira. Our results for the $k$-graph setting are in contrast to those of Austin and Tao, who showed that for the somewhat stronger concept of local repairability, the testability results for graphs do not extend to the $3$-graph setting. Our proof relies on a random subhypergraph sampling result proved in a companion paper.</description>

      <title>Star colouring and locally constrained graph homomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00086v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We relate star colouring of even-degree regular graphs to the notions of locally constrained graph homomorphisms to the oriented line graph $ \vec{L}(K_q) $ of the complete graph $ K_q $ and to its underlying undirected graph $ L^*(K_q) $. Our results have consequences for locally constrained graph homomorphisms and oriented line graphs in addition to star colouring. We show that $ L^*(H) $ is a 2-lift of the line graph $ L(H) $ for every graph $ H $. Dvo\v{r}\'ak, Mohar and \v{S}\'amal (J. Graph Theory, 2013) proved that for every 3-regular graph $ G $, the line graph of $ G $ is 4-star colourable if and only if $ G $ admits a locally bijective homomorphism to the cube $ Q_3 $. We generalise this result as follows: for $ p\geq 2 $, a $ K_{1,p+1} $-free $ 2p $-regular graph $ G $ admits a $ (p+2) $-star colouring if and only if $ G $ admits a locally bijective homomorphism to $ L^*(K_{p+2}) $. As a result, if a $ K_{p+1} $-free $ 2p $-regular graph $ G $ with $ p\geq 2 $ is $ (p+2) $-star colourable, then $ -2 $ and $ p-2 $ are eigenvalues of $ G $. We also prove the following: (i) for $ p\geq 2 $, a $ 2p $-regular graph $ G $ admits a $ (p+2) $-star colouring if and only if $ G $ has an orientation that admits an out-neighbourhood bijective homomorphism to $ \vec{L}(K_{p+2}) $; (ii) the line graph of a 3-regular graph $ G $ is 4-star colourable if and only if $ G $ is bipartite and distance-two 4-colourable; and (iii) it is NP-complete to check whether a planar 4-regular 3-connected graph is 4-star colourable.</description>

      <title>Random sampling of permutations through quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03018v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a classical algorithm for random sampling of permutations, drawing inspiration from the Steinhaus-Johnson-Trotter algorithm. Our approach takes a comprehensive view of permutation sampling by expressing them as products of adjacent transpositions. Building on this, we develop a quantum analogue of the classical algorithm using a quantum circuit model for random sampling of permutations. As an application, we present a quantum algorithm for the two-sample randomization test to assess the difference of means in classical data. Finally, we propose a nested corona product graph generative model for symmetric groups, which facilitates random sampling of permutations from specific sets of permutations through a quantum circuit model.</description>

      <title>Approximation Algorithms for Optimal Hopsets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06522v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a given graph $G$, a "hopset" $H$ with hopbound $\beta$ and stretch $\alpha$ is a set of edges such that between every pair of vertices $u$ and $v$, there is a path with at most $\beta$ hops in $G \cup H$ that approximates the distance between $u$ and $v$ up to a multiplicative stretch of $\alpha$. Hopsets have found a wide range of applications for distance-based problems in various computational models since the 90s. More recently, there has been significant interest in understanding these fundamental objects from an existential and structural perspective. But all of this work takes a worst-case (or existential) point of view: How many edges do we need to add to satisfy a given hopbound and stretch requirement for any input graph?
  We initiate the study of the natural optimization variant of this problem: given a specific graph instance, what is the minimum number of edges that satisfy the hopbound and stretch requirements? We give approximation algorithms for a generalized hopset problem which, when combined with known existential bounds, lead to different approximation guarantees for various regimes depending on hopbound, stretch, and directed vs. undirected inputs. We complement our upper bounds with a lower bound that implies Label Cover hardness for directed hopsets and shortcut sets with hopbound at least $3$.</description>

      <title>Vertex-Based Localization of Erd\H{o}s-Gallai Theorems for Paths and Cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01501v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a simple graph $G$, let $n$ and $m$ denote the number of vertices and edges in $G$, respectively. The Erd\H{o}s-Gallai theorem for paths states that in a simple $P_k$-free graph, $m \leq \frac{n(k-1)}{2}$, where $P_k$ denotes a path with length $k$ (that is, with $k$ edges). In this paper, we generalize this result as follows: For each $v \in V(G)$, let $p(v)$ be the length of the longest path that contains $v$. We show that \[m \leq \sum_{v \in V(G)} \frac{p(v)}{2}\] The Erd\H{o}s-Gallai theorem for cycles states that in a simple graph $G$ with circumference (that is, the length of the longest cycle) at most $k$, we have $m \leq \frac{k(n-1)}{2}$. We strengthen this result as follows: For each $v \in V(G)$, let $c(v)$ be the length of the longest cycle that contains $v$, or $2$ if $v$ is not part of any cycle. We prove that \[m \leq \left( \sum_{v \in V(G)} \frac{c(v)}{2} \right) - \frac{c(u)}{2}\] where $c(u)$ denotes the circumference of $G$. \newline Furthermore, we characterize the class of extremal graphs that attain equality in these bounds.</description>
