      <title>Experiment Design with Gaussian Process Regression with Applications to Chance-Constrained Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning for control in repeated tasks allows for well-designed experiments to gather the most useful data. We consider the setting in which we use a data-driven controller that does not have access to the true system dynamics. Rather, the controller uses inferred dynamics based on the available information. In order to acquire data that is beneficial for this controller, we present an experimental design approach that leverages the current data to improve expected control performance. We focus on the setting in which inference on the unknown dynamics is performed using Gaussian processes. Gaussian processes not only provide uncertainty quantification but also allow us to leverage structures inherent to Gaussian random variables. Through this structure, we design experiments via gradient descent on the expected control performance with respect to the experiment input. In particular, we focus on a chance-constrained minimum expected time control problem. Numerical demonstrations of our approach indicate our experimental design outperforms relevant benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Review on the Control of Heat Pumps for Energy Flexibility in Distribution Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decarbonization plans promote the transition to heat pumps (HPs), creating new opportunities for their energy flexibility in demand response programs, solar photovoltaic integration and optimization of distribution networks. This paper reviews scheduling-based and real-time optimization methods for controlling HPs with a focus on energy flexibility in distribution networks. Scheduling-based methods fall into two categories: rule-based controllers (RBCs), which rely on predefined control rules without explicitly seeking optimal solutions, and optimization models, which are designed to determine the optimal scheduling of operations. Real-time optimization is achieved through model predictive control (MPC), which relies on a predictive model to optimize decisions over a time horizon, and reinforcement learning (RL), which takes a model-free approach by learning optimal strategies through direct interaction with the environment. The paper also examines studies on the impact of HPs on distribution networks, particularly those leveraging energy flexibility strategies. Key takeaways suggest the need to validate control strategies for extreme cold-weather regions that require backup heaters, as well as develop approaches designed for demand charge schemes that integrate HPs with other controllable loads. From a grid impact assessment perspective, studies have focused primarily on RBCs for providing energy flexibility through HP operation, without addressing more advanced methods such as real-time optimization using MPC or RL-based algorithms. Incorporating these advanced control strategies could help identify key limitations, including the impact of varying user participation levels and the cost-benefit trade-offs associated with their implementation.</description>

      <title>Risk-Sensitive Security-Constrained Economic Dispatch: Pricing and Algorithm Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a risk-sensitive security-constrained economic dispatch (R-SCED) formulation capturing the tradeoff between dispatch cost and resilience against potential line failures, where risk is modeled via the conditional value at risk (CVaR). In the context of our formulation, we analyze revenue adequacy and side payments of two pricing models, one based on nominal generation costs, and another based on total marginal cost including contingencies. In particular, we prove that the system operator's (SO) merchandising surplus (MS) and total revenue are nonnegative under the latter, while under the former the same does not hold in general. We demonstrate that the proposed R-SCED formulation is amenable to decomposition and describe a Benders' decomposition algorithm to solve it. In numerical examples, we illustrate the differences in MS and total revenue under the considered pricing schemes, and the computational efficiency of our decomposition approach.</description>

      <title>On the Contraction Analysis of Nonlinear System with Multiple Equilibrium Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we leverage the 2-contraction theory, which extends the capabilities of classical contraction theory, to develop a global stability framework. Coupled with powerful geometric tools such as the Poincare index theory, the 2-contraction theory enables us to analyze the stability of planar nonlinear systems without relying on local equilibrium analysis. By utilizing index theory and 2-contraction results, we efficiently characterize the nature of equilibrium points and delineate regions in 2-dimensional state space where periodic solutions, closed orbits, or stable dynamics may exist. A key focus of this work is the identification of regions in the state space where periodic solutions may occur, as well as 2-contraction regions that guarantee the nonexistence of such solutions. Additionally, we address a critical problem in engineering the determination of the basin of attraction (BOA) for stable equilibrium points. For systems with multiple equilibria identifying candidate BOAs becomes highly nontrivial. We propose a novel methodology leveraging the 2-contraction theory to approximate a common BOA for a class of nonlinear systems with multiple stable equilibria. Theoretical findings are substantiated through benchmark examples and numerical simulations, demonstrating the practical utility of the proposed approach. Furthermore, we extend our framework to analyze networked systems, showcasing their efficacy in an opinion dynamics problem.</description>

      <title>MPPI-DBaS: Safe Trajectory Optimization with Adaptive Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In trajectory optimization, Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control is a sampling-based Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework that generates optimal inputs by efficiently simulating numerous trajectories. In practice, however, MPPI often struggles to guarantee safety assurance and balance efficient sampling in open spaces with the need for more extensive exploration under tight constraints. To address this challenge, we incorporate discrete barrier states (DBaS) into MPPI and propose a novel MPPI-DBaS algorithm that ensures system safety and enables adaptive exploration across diverse scenarios. We evaluate our method in simulation experiments where the vehicle navigates through closely placed obstacles. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms standard MPPI, achieving a higher success rate and lower tracking errors.</description>

      <title>Towards Routing and Edge Computing in Satellite-Terrestrial Networks: A Column Generation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Edge computing that enables satellites to process raw data locally is expected to bring further timeliness and flexibility to satellite-terrestrial networks (STNs). In this letter, In this letter, we propose a three-layer edge computing protocol, where raw data collected by satellites can be processed locally, or transmitted to other satellites or the ground station via multi-hop routing for further processing. The overall computing capacity of the proposed framework is maximized by determining the offloading strategy and route formation, subject to channel capacity and hop constraints. Given that the problem scale grows exponentially with the number of satellites and maximum-allowed hops, the column generation approach is employed to obtain the global optimal solution by activating only a subset of variables. Numerical investigations reveal that the proposed three-layer computing protocol improves the computing capacity by 40\%, compared to the single-layer configuration.</description>

      <title>A Stackelberg Game Approach for Signal Temporal Logic Control Synthesis with Uncontrollable Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the control synthesis problem for Signal Temporal Logic (STL) specifications in the presence of uncontrollable agents. Existing works mainly address this problem in a robust control setting by assuming the uncontrollable agents are adversarial and accounting for the worst-case scenario. While this approach ensures safety, it can be overly conservative in scenarios where uncontrollable agents have their own objectives that are not entirely opposed to the system's goals. Motivated by this limitation, we propose a new framework for STL control synthesis within the Stackelberg game setting. Specifically, we assume that the system controller, acting as the leader, first commits to a plan, after which the uncontrollable agents, acting as followers, take a best response based on the committed plan and their own objectives. Our goal is to synthesize a control sequence for the leader such that, for any rational followers producing a best response, the leader's STL task is guaranteed to be satisfied. We present an effective solution to this problem by transforming it into a single-stage optimization problem and leveraging counter-example guided synthesis techniques. We demonstrate that the proposed approach is sound and identify conditions under which it is optimal. Simulation results are also provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Control of T-Product-based Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data-driven control is a powerful tool that enables the design and implementation of control strategies directly from data without explicitly identifying the underlying system dynamics. While various data-driven control techniques, such as stabilization, linear quadratic regulation, and model predictive control, have been extensively developed, these methods are not inherently suited for multi-linear dynamical systems, where the states are represented as higher-order tensors. In this article, we propose a novel framework for data-driven control of T-product-based dynamical systems (TPDSs), where the system evolution is governed by the T-product between a third-order dynamic tensor and a third-order state tensor. In particular, we offer necessary and sufficient conditions to determine the data informativity for system identification, stabilization by state feedback, and T-product quadratic regulation of TPDSs with detailed complexity analyses. Finally, we validate our framework through numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Understanding long-term energy use in off-grid solar home systems in sub-Saharan Africa</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar home systems provide low-cost electricity access for rural off-grid communities. As access to them increases, more long-term data becomes available on how these systems are used throughout their lifetime. This work analyses a dataset of 1,000 systems across sub-Saharan Africa. Dynamic time warping clustering was applied to the load demand data from the systems, identifying five distinct archetypal daily load profiles and their occurrence across the dataset. Temporal analysis reveals a general decline in daily energy consumption over time, with 57% of households reducing their usage after the first year of ownership. On average, there is a 33% decrease in daily consumption by the end of the second year compared to the peak demand, which occurs on the 96th day. Combining the load demand analysis with payment data shows that this decrease in energy consumption is observed even in households that are not experiencing economic hardship, indicating there are reasons beyond financial constraints for decreasing energy use once energy access is obtained.</description>

      <title>On the $H$-property for Step-graphons: Residual Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We sample graphs $G_n$ on $n$ nodes from a step-graphon and evaluate the probability that $G_n$ has a Hamiltonian decomposition in the asymptotic regime as $n\to\infty$. It has recently been shown that for almost all step-graphons, this probability converges to either zero or one. In this paper, we focus on the class of step-graphons such that the zero-one property does not hold. We show in this case that the limit of the probability still exists and provide an explicit expression of it.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Visual Servoing of Tendon-driven Continuum Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel Hybrid Visual Servoing (HVS) approach for controlling tendon-driven continuum robots (TDCRs). The HVS system combines Image-Based Visual Servoing (IBVS) with Deep Learning-Based Visual Servoing (DLBVS) to overcome the limitations of each method and improve overall performance. IBVS offers higher accuracy and faster convergence in feature-rich environments, while DLBVS enhances robustness against disturbances and offers a larger workspace. By enabling smooth transitions between IBVS and DLBVS, the proposed HVS ensures effective control in dynamic, unstructured environments. The effectiveness of this approach is validated through simulations and real-world experiments, demonstrating that HVS achieves reduced iteration time, faster convergence, lower final error, and smoother performance compared to DLBVS alone, while maintaining DLBVS's robustness in challenging conditions such as occlusions, lighting changes, actuator noise, and physical impacts.</description>

      <title>A Supervised Machine-Learning Approach For Turboshaft Engine Dynamic Modeling Under Real Flight Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rotorcraft engines are highly complex, nonlinear thermodynamic systems that operate under varying environmental and flight conditions. Simulating their dynamics is crucial for design, fault diagnostics, and deterioration control phases, and requires robust and reliable control systems to estimate engine performance throughout flight envelope. However, the development of detailed physical models of the engine based on numerical simulations is a very challenging task due to the complex and entangled physics driving the engine. In this scenario, data-driven machine-learning techniques are of great interest to the aircraft engine community, due to their ability to describe nonlinear systems' dynamic behavior and enable online performance estimation, achieving excellent results with accuracy competitive with the state of the art. In this work, we explore different Neural Network architectures to model the turboshaft engine of Leonardo's AW189P4 prototype, aiming to predict the engine torque. The models are trained on an extensive database of real flight tests featuring a variety of operational maneuvers performed under different flight conditions, providing a comprehensive representation of the engine's performance. To complement the neural network approach, we apply Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) to derive a low-dimensional dynamical model from the available data, describing the relationship between fuel flow and engine torque. The resulting model showcases SINDy's capability to recover the actual physics underlying the engine dynamics and demonstrates its potential for investigating more complex aspects of the engine. The results prove that data-driven engine models can exploit a wider range of parameters than standard transfer function-based approaches, enabling the use of trained schemes to simulate nonlinear effects in different engines and helicopters.</description>

      <title>Sample Complexity of Linear Quadratic Regulator Without Initial Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by REINFORCE, we introduce a novel receding-horizon algorithm for the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) problem with unknown parameters. Unlike prior methods, our algorithm avoids reliance on two-point gradient estimates while maintaining the same order of sample complexity. Furthermore, it eliminates the restrictive requirement of starting with a stable initial policy, broadening its applicability. Beyond these improvements, we introduce a refined analysis of error propagation through the contraction of the Riemannian distance over the Riccati operator. This refinement leads to a better sample complexity and ensures improved convergence guarantees. Numerical simulations validate the theoretical results, demonstrating the method's practical feasibility and performance in realistic scenarios.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Sampling-based Online Planning for Drone Interception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies high-speed online planning in dynamic environments. The problem requires finding time-optimal trajectories that conform to system dynamics, meeting computational constraints for real-time adaptation, and accounting for uncertainty from environmental changes. To address these challenges, we propose a sampling-based online planning algorithm that leverages neural network inference to replace time-consuming nonlinear trajectory optimization, enabling rapid exploration of multiple trajectory options under uncertainty. The proposed method is applied to the drone interception problem, where a defense drone must intercept a target while avoiding collisions and handling imperfect target predictions. The algorithm efficiently generates trajectories toward multiple potential target drone positions in parallel. It then assesses trajectory reachability by comparing traversal times with the target drone's predicted arrival time, ultimately selecting the minimum-time reachable trajectory. Through extensive validation in both simulated and real-world environments, we demonstrate our method's capability for high-rate online planning and its adaptability to unpredictable movements in unstructured settings.</description>

      <title>No Minima, No Collisions: Combining Modulation and Control Barrier Function Strategies for Feasible Dynamical Collision Avoidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As prominent real-time safety-critical reactive control techniques, Control Barrier Function Quadratic Programs (CBF-QPs) work for control affine systems in general but result in local minima in the generated trajectories and consequently cannot ensure convergence to the goals. Contrarily, Modulation of Dynamical Systems (Mod-DSs), including normal, reference, and on-manifold Mod-DS, achieve obstacle avoidance with few and even no local minima but have trouble optimally minimizing the difference between the constrained and the unconstrained controller outputs, and its applications are limited to fully-actuated systems. We dive into the theoretical foundations of CBF-QP and Mod-DS, proving that despite their distinct origins, normal Mod-DS is a special case of CBF-QP, and reference Mod-DS's solutions are mathematically connected to that of the CBF-QP through one equation. Building on top of the unveiled theoretical connections between CBF-QP and Mod-DS, reference Mod-based CBF-QP and on-manifold Mod-based CBF-QP controllers are proposed to combine the strength of CBF-QP and Mod-DS approaches and realize local-minimum-free reactive obstacle avoidance for control affine systems in general. We validate our methods in both simulated hospital environments and real-world experiments using Ridgeback for fully-actuated systems and Fetch robots for underactuated systems. Mod-based CBF-QPs outperform CBF-QPs as well as the optimally constrained-enforcing Mod-DS approaches we proposed in all experiments.</description>

      <title>A Mobile Robotic Approach to Autonomous Surface Scanning in Legal Medicine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Purpose: Comprehensive legal medicine documentation includes both an internal but also an external examination of the corpse. Typically, this documentation is conducted manually during conventional autopsy. A systematic digital documentation would be desirable, especially for the external examination of wounds, which is becoming more relevant for legal medicine analysis. For this purpose, RGB surface scanning has been introduced. While a manual full surface scan using a handheld camera is timeconsuming and operator dependent, floor or ceiling mounted robotic systems require substantial space and a dedicated room. Hence, we consider whether a mobile robotic system can be used for external documentation. Methods: We develop a mobile robotic system that enables full-body RGB-D surface scanning. Our work includes a detailed configuration space analysis to identify the environmental parameters that need to be considered to successfully perform a surface scan. We validate our findings through an experimental study in the lab and demonstrate the system's application in a legal medicine environment. Results: Our configuration space analysis shows that a good trade-off between coverage and time is reached with three robot base positions, leading to a coverage of 94.96 %. Experiments validate the effectiveness of the system in accurately capturing body surface geometry with an average surface coverage of 96.90 +- 3.16 % and 92.45 +- 1.43 % for a body phantom and actual corpses, respectively. Conclusion: This work demonstrates the potential of a mobile robotic system to automate RGB-D surface scanning in legal medicine, complementing the use of post-mortem CT scans for inner documentation. Our results indicate that the proposed system can contribute to more efficient and autonomous legal medicine documentation, reducing the need for manual intervention.</description>

      <title>Advancing Measurement Capabilities in Lithium-Ion Batteries: Exploring the Potential of Fiber Optic Sensors for Thermal Monitoring of Battery Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work demonstrates the potential of fiber optic sensors for measuring thermal effects in lithium-ion batteries, using a fiber optic measurement method of Optical Frequency Domain Reflectometry (OFDR). The innovative application of fiber sensors allows for spatially resolved temperature measurement, particularly emphasizing the importance of monitoring not just the exterior but also the internal conditions within battery cells. Utilizing inert glass fibers as sensors, which exhibit minimal sensitivity to electric fields, opens up new pathways for their implementation in a wide range of applications, such as battery monitoring. The sensors used in this work provide real-time information along the entire length of the fiber, unlike commonly used Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) sensors. It is shown that using the herein presented novel sensors in a temperature range of 0 to 80 degree celsius reveals a linear thermal dependency with high sensitivity and a local resolution of a few centimeters. Furthermore, this study presents preliminary findings on the potential application of fiber optic sensors in lithium-ion battery (LIB) cells, demonstrating that the steps required for battery integration do not impose any restrictive effects on thermal measurements.</description>

      <title>Robust Information Selection for Hypothesis Testing with Misclassification Penalties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of robust information selection for a Bayesian hypothesis testing / classification task, where the goal is to identify the true state of the world from a finite set of hypotheses based on observations from the selected information sources. We introduce a novel misclassification penalty framework, which enables non-uniform treatment of different misclassification events. Extending the classical subset selection framework, we study the problem of selecting a subset of sources that minimize the maximum penalty of misclassification under a limited budget, despite deletions or failures of a subset of the selected sources. We characterize the curvature properties of the objective function and propose an efficient greedy algorithm with performance guarantees. Next, we highlight certain limitations of optimizing for the maximum penalty metric and propose a submodular surrogate metric to guide the selection of the information set. We propose a greedy algorithm with near-optimality guarantees for optimizing the surrogate metric. Finally, we empirically demonstrate the performance of our proposed algorithms in several instances of the information set selection problem.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning with Graph Attention for Routing and Wavelength Assignment with Lightpath Reuse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many works have investigated reinforcement learning (RL) for routing and spectrum assignment on flex-grid networks but only one work to date has examined RL for fixed-grid with flex-rate transponders, despite production systems using this paradigm. Flex-rate transponders allow existing lightpaths to accommodate new services, a task we term routing and wavelength assignment with lightpath reuse (RWA-LR). We re-examine this problem and present a thorough benchmarking of heuristic algorithms for RWA-LR, which are shown to have 6% increased throughput when candidate paths are ordered by number of hops, rather than total length. We train an RL agent for RWA-LR with graph attention networks for the policy and value functions to exploit the graph-structured data. We provide details of our methodology and open source all of our code for reproduction. We outperform the previous state-of-the-art RL approach by 2.5% (17.4 Tbps mean additional throughput) and the best heuristic by 1.2% (8.5 Tbps mean additional throughput). This marginal gain highlights the difficulty in learning effective RL policies on long horizon resource allocation tasks.</description>

      <title>Tracking and Assigning Jobs to a Markov Machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a time-slotted communication system with a machine, a cloud server, and a sampler. Job requests from the users are queued on the server to be completed by the machine. The machine has two states, namely, a busy state and a free state. The server can assign a job to the machine in a first-in-first-served manner. If the machine is free, it completes the job request from the server; otherwise, it drops the request. Upon dropping a job request, the server is penalized. When the machine is in the free state, the machine can get into the busy state with an internal job. When the server does not assign a job request to the machine, the state of the machine evolves as a symmetric Markov chain. If the machine successfully accepts the job request from the server, the state of the machine goes to the busy state and follows a different dynamics compared to the dynamics when the machine goes to the busy state due to an internal job. The sampler samples the state of the machine and sends it to the server via an error-free channel. Thus, the server can estimate the state of the machine, upon receiving an update from the source. If the machine is in the free state but the estimated state at the server is busy, the sampler pays a cost. We incorporate the concept of the age of incorrect information to model the cost of the sampler. We aim to find an optimal sampling policy such that the cost of the sampler plus the penalty on the machine gets minimized. We formulate this problem in a Markov decision process framework and find how an optimal policy changes with several associated parameters. We show that a threshold policy is optimal for this problem. We show a necessary and sufficient condition for a threshold policy to be optimal. Finally, we find the optimal threshold without bounding the state space.</description>

      <title>Planning, scheduling, and execution on the Moon: the CADRE technology demonstration mission</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: NASA's Cooperative Autonomous Distributed Robotic Exploration (CADRE) mission, slated for flight to the Moon's Reiner Gamma region in 2025/2026, is designed to demonstrate multi-agent autonomous exploration of the Lunar surface and sub-surface. A team of three robots and a base station will autonomously explore a region near the lander, collecting the data required for 3D reconstruction of the surface with no human input; and then autonomously perform distributed sensing with multi-static ground penetrating radars (GPR), driving in formation while performing coordinated radar soundings to create a map of the subsurface. At the core of CADRE's software architecture is a novel autonomous, distributed planning, scheduling, and execution (PS&amp;E) system. The system coordinates the robots' activities, planning and executing tasks that require multiple robots' participation while ensuring that each individual robot's thermal and power resources stay within prescribed bounds, and respecting ground-prescribed sleep-wake cycles. The system uses a centralized-planning, distributed-execution paradigm, and a leader election mechanism ensures robustness to failures of individual agents. In this paper, we describe the architecture of CADRE's PS&amp;E system; discuss its design rationale; and report on verification and validation (V&amp;V) testing of the system on CADRE's hardware in preparation for deployment on the Moon.</description>

      <title>Compact Formulation of the First Evolution Equation for Optimal Control Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.02980</link>
      <description>arXiv:1804.02980v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The first evolution equation is derived under the Variation Evolving Method (VEM) that seeks optimal solutions with the variation evolution principle. To improve the performance, its compact form is developed. By replacing the states and costates variation evolution with that of the controls, the dimension-reduced Evolution Partial Differential Equation (EPDE) only solves the control variables along the variation time to get the optimal solution, and its definite conditions may be arbitrary. With this equation, the scale of the resulting Initial-value Problem (IVP), transformed via the semi-discrete method, is significantly reduced. Illustrative examples are solved and it is shown that the compact form evolution equation outperforms the primary form in the precision, and the efficiency may be higher for the dense discretization. Moreover, in discussing the connections to the classic iteration methods, it is uncovered that the computation scheme of the gradient method is the discrete implementation of the third evolution equation, and the compact form of the first evolution equation is a continuous realization of the Newton type iteration mechanism.</description>

      <title>Control Barrier Function based Attack-Recovery with Provable Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.03077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.03077v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies provable security guarantees for cyber-physical systems (CPS) under actuator attacks. In particular, we consider CPS safety and propose a new attack detection mechanism based on zeroing control barrier function (ZCBF) conditions. In addition, we design an adaptive recovery mechanism based on how close the system is to violating safety. We show that under certain conditions, the attack-detection mechanism is sound, i.e., there are no false negatives for adversarial attacks. We propose sufficient conditions for the initial conditions and input constraints so that the resulting CPS is secure by design. We also propose a novel hybrid control to account for attack detection delays and avoid Zeno behavior. Next, to efficiently compute the set of initial conditions, we propose a sampling-based method to verify whether a set is a viability domain. Specifically, we devise a method for checking a modified barrier function condition on a finite set of points to assess whether a set can be rendered forward invariant. Then, we propose an iterative algorithm to compute the set of initial conditions and input constraints set to limit the effect of an adversary if it compromises vulnerable inputs. Finally, we use a Quadratic Programming (QP) approach for online recovery (as well as nominal) control synthesis. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in a simulation case study involving a quadrotor with an attack on its motors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11061v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present article considers stability of the solutions to nonlinear and nonautonomous compartmental systems governed by ordinary differential equations (ODEs). In particular, compartmental systems with a right-hand side that can be written as a product of a matrix function and vector function. Sufficient, and on occasion necessary, conditions on the matrix function are provided to conclude exponential stability of the null solution. The conditions involve verifying that the matrix function takes its values in a set of compartmental matrices on a certain canonical form, and are easy to check. Similar conditions are provided to establish incremental exponential stability for compartmental systems governed by cooperative systems of ODEs. The solutions to such systems satisfy a so-called ordering. Systems that are cooperative in a box, are shown to be incrementally asymptotically stable if and only if every pair of initially ordered solutions converge to each other. Traffic Reaction Models are used to illustrate the results, which are numerical schemes to solve conservation laws in one spatial dimension. Suitable conditions on the flux function of the conservation law are given such that the numerical scheme gives rise to an incrementally exponentially stable system.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning-based Receding Horizon Control using Adaptive Control Barrier Functions for Safety-Critical Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17338v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optimal control methods provide solutions to safety-critical problems but easily become intractable. Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) have emerged as a popular technique that facilitates their solution by provably guaranteeing safety, through their forward invariance property, at the expense of some performance loss. This approach involves defining a performance objective alongside CBF-based safety constraints that must always be enforced. Unfortunately, both performance and solution feasibility can be significantly impacted by two key factors: (i) the selection of the cost function and associated parameters, and (ii) the calibration of parameters within the CBF-based constraints, which capture the trade-off between performance and conservativeness. %as well as infeasibility. To address these challenges, we propose a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based Receding Horizon Control (RHC) approach leveraging Model Predictive Control (MPC) with CBFs (MPC-CBF). In particular, we parameterize our controller and use bilevel optimization, where RL is used to learn the optimal parameters while MPC computes the optimal control input. We validate our method by applying it to the challenging automated merging control problem for Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) at conflicting roadways. Results demonstrate improved performance and a significant reduction in the number of infeasible cases compared to traditional heuristic approaches used for tuning CBF-based controllers, showcasing the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>On Adaptive Frequency Sampling for Data-driven Model Order Reduction Applied to Antenna Responses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18734v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Frequency domain sweeps of array antennas are well-known to be time-intensive, and different surrogate models have been used to improve the performance. Data-driven model order reduction algorithms, such as the Loewner framework and vector fitting, can be integrated with these adaptive error estimates, in an iterative algorithm, to reduce the number of full-wave simulations required to accurately capture the requested frequency behavior of multiport array antennas. In this work, we propose two novel adaptive methods exploiting a block matrix function which is a key part of the Loewner framework generating system approach. The first algorithm leverages an inherent matrix parameter freedom in the block matrix function to identify frequency points with large errors, whereas the second utilizes the condition number of the block matrix function. Both methods effectively provide frequency domain error estimates, which are essential for improved performance. Numerical experiments on multiport array antenna S-parameters demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms within the Loewner framework, where the proposed algorithms reach the smallest errors for the smallest number of frequency points chosen.</description>

      <title>An exact active sensing strategy for a class of bio-inspired systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06612v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a general class of translation-invariant systems with a specific category of output nonlinearities motivated by biological sensing. We show that no dynamic output feedback can stabilize this class of systems to an isolated equilibrium point. To overcome this fundamental limitation, we propose a simple control scheme that includes a low-amplitude periodic forcing function akin to so-called "active sensing" in biology, together with nonlinear output feedback. Our analysis shows that this approach leads to the emergence of an exponentially stable limit cycle. These findings offer a provably stable active sensing strategy and may thus help to rationalize the active sensing movements made by animals as they perform certain motor behaviors.</description>

      <title>Cyber-physical Defense for Heterogeneous Multi-agent Systems Against Exponentially Unbounded Attacks on Signed Digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00990v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) are subjected to attacks on both cyber and physical spaces. In reality, the attackers could launch exponentially unbounded false data injection (EU-FDI) attacks, which are more destructive and could lead to the system's collapse or instability. Existing literature generally addresses bounded attack signals and/or bounded-first-order-derivative attack signals, which exposes the CPSs to significant threats. In contrast, this paper proposes a fully-distributed attack-resilient bi-layer defense framework to address the bipartite output containment problem for heterogeneous multi-agent systems on signed digraphs, in the presence of EU-FDI attacks on both cyber-physical layer (CPL) and observer layer (OL). First, we design attack-resilient dynamic compensators that utilize data communicated on the OL to estimate the convex combinations of the states and negative states of the leaders. The attack-resilient compensators address the EU-FDI attacks on the OL and guarantee the uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB) estimation of the leaders' states. Then, by using the compensators' states, fully-distributed attack-resilient controllers are designed on the CPL to further address the EU-FDI attacks on the actuators. Rigorous mathematical proof based on Lyapunov stability analysis is provided, establishing the theoretical soundness of the proposed bi-layer resilient defense framework, by preserving the UUB consensus and stability against EU-FDI attacks on both CPL and OL. Finally, a comparative case study for heterogeneous multi-agent systems validate the enhanced resilience of the proposed defense strategies.</description>

Abstract: Perfect adaptation is a well-studied biochemical homeostatic behavior lying at the core of biochemical regulation. While the concepts of homeostasis and perfect adaptation are not new, their underlying mechanisms and associated biochemical regulation motifs are not yet fully understood. Insights from control theory unraveled the connections between perfect adaptation and integral control, a prevalent engineering control strategy. In particular, the recently introduced Antithetic Integral Controller (AIC) has been shown to successfully ensure perfect adaptation properties to the network it is connected to. The complementary structure of the two molecules the AIC relies upon allows for a versatile way to control biochemical networks, a property which gave rise to an important body of literature pertaining to mathematically elucidating its properties, generalizing its structure, and developing experimental methods for its implementation. The Antithetic Integral Rein Controller (AIRC), an extension of the AIC in which both controller molecules are used for control, holds many promises as it supposedly overcomes certain limitations of the AIC. We focus here on an AIRC structure with output inhibition that combines two AICs in a single structure. We demonstrate that rhis controller ensure structural stability and structural perfect adaptation properties for the controlled network under mild assumptions, meaning that this property is independent of the parameters of the network and the controller. The results are very general and valid for the class of unimolecular mass-action networks as well as more general networks, including cooperative and Michaelis-Menten networks. We also provide a systematic and accessible computational way for verifying whether a given network satisfies the conditions under which the structural property would hold.</description>

      <title>Incentive-based Platoon Formation: Optimizing the Personal Benefit for Drivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00570</link>

Abstract: Platooning or cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) has been investigated for decades, but debate about its lasting impact is still ongoing. While the benefits of platooning and the formation of platoons are well understood for trucks, they are less clear for passenger cars, which have a higher heterogeneity in trips and drivers' preferences. Most importantly, it remains unclear how to form platoons of passenger cars in order to optimize the personal benefit for the individual driver. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel platoon formation algorithm that optimizes the personal benefit for drivers of individual passenger cars. For computing vehicle-to-platoon assignments, the algorithm utilizes a new metric that we propose to evaluate the personal benefits of various driving systems, including platooning. By combining fuel and travel time costs into a single monetary value, drivers can estimate overall trip costs according to a personal monetary value for time spent. This provides an intuitive way for drivers to understand and compare the benefits of driving systems like human driving, adaptive cruise control (ACC), and, of course, platooning. Unlike previous similarity-based methods, our proposed algorithm forms platoons only when beneficial for the driver, rather than solely for platooning. We demonstrate the new metric for the total trip cost in a numerical analysis and explain its interpretation. Results of a large-scale simulation study demonstrate that our proposed platoon formation algorithm outperforms normal ACC as well as previous similarity-based platooning approaches by balancing fuel savings and travel time, independent of traffic and drivers' time cost.</description>
