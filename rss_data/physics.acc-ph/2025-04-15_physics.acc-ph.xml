      <title>The PUMA offline ion source beamline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The antiProton Unstable Matter Annihilation experiment (PUMA) at CERN aims to study the nucleonic composition in the matter density tail of stable and radioactive nuclei using low-energy antiprotons. Since there is no facility in which both low-energy antiprotons and radioactive nuclei can be produced, the experimental realization with exotic nuclei requires the transportation of the antiprotons from the Extra Low ENergy Antiproton (ELENA) facility to the nearby located Isotope mass Separator On-Line DEvice (ISOLDE). For tests and first applications of the proposed experimental technique to stable isotopes at ELENA, a dedicated offline ion source beamline was developed that will provide isotopically pure, cooled and bunched ion beams with intensities of more than $10^4$ ions per bunch while maintaining a vacuum of better than $5\times 10^{-10}$ mbar at the handover point. This offline ion source beamline is characterized and its capabilities are demonstrated using the example of stable krypton isotopes.</description>

      <title>Cyclotron Spiral Inflector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The most common device for injecting into a compact cyclotron is an electrostatic device known as the spiral inflector. There is a known analytic solution for the trajectory, and therefore the electrode shape, in the idealized case of a uniform magnetic field. This is re-derived in this note and the conditions for perfect centring are found. It is moreover found that the 'Muller', or hyperboloid inflector is actually a special case of the spiral inflector.</description>

      <title>Cyclotron Mirror Inflector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The device for injecting into a compact cyclotron is known as an inflector. The oldest simplest version is an electrostatic mirror. From the equations of motion through I derive the geometry of the mirror. Also the (1983 Bellomo et al.) transfer matrix is given in symplectic form.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Spatiotemporal Overlap of Femtosecond Lasers and Electron Beam With Ce:YAG Screens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interactions between short laser pulses and electron bunches determine a wide range of accelerator applications. Finding spatiotemporal overlap between few-micron-sized optical and electron beams is critical, yet there are few routine diagnostics for this purpose. We present a method for achieving spatiotemporal overlap between a picosecond laser pulse and a relativistic sub-ps electron bunch. The method uses the transient change in optical transmission of a Ce:YAG screen upon irradiation with a short electron bunch to co-time the electron and laser beams. We demonstrate and quantify the performance of this method using an inverse Compton source comprised of a 30 MeV electron beam from an X-band linac focused to a 10 $\mu$m spot, overlapped with a joule-class picosecond Yb:YAG laser system. This method is applicable to electron beams with few-microjoule bunch energies, and uses standard scintillator screens common in electron accelerators.</description>

      <title>CMS Token Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24352v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Within the LHC community, a momentous transition has been occurring in authorization. For nearly 20 years, services within the Worldwide LHC Computing Grid (WLCG) have authorized based on mapping an identity, derived from an X.509 credential, or a group/role, derived from a VOMS extension issued by the experiment. A fundamental shift is occurring to capabilities: the credential, a bearer token, asserts the authorizations of the bearer, not the identity. By the HL-LHC era, the CMS experiment plans for the transition to tokens, based on the WLCG Common JSON Web Token profile, to be complete. Services in the technology architecture include the INDIGO Identity and Access Management server to issue tokens; a HashiCorp Vault server to store and refresh access tokens for users and jobs; a managed token bastion server to push credentials to the HTCondor CredMon service; and HTCondor to maintain valid tokens in long-running batch jobs. We will describe the transition plans of the experiment, current status, configuration of the central authorization server, lessons learned in commissioning token-based access with sites, and operational experience using tokens for both job submissions and file transfers.</description>
