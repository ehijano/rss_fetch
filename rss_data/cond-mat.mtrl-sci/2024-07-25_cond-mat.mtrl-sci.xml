      <title>An All-encompassing Theory on Charge Transport in Spin Crossover Complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin crossover (SCO) complexes are highly promising candidates for a myriad of potential applications in room-temperature electronics; however, as it stands, establishing a clear connection between their spin-state switching and transport properties has been far from trivial. In this Viewpoint, an effort to unravel the underlying charge transport mechanism in these SCO complexes, via a general theory, is made. The theory presented herein is aimed at providing a unifying picture that explains the widely different trends observed in the spin-crossover-dependent carrier transport properties in the SCO molecular thin film systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the most viable renewable energies is solar power because of its versatility, reliability, and abundance.In the market, a majority of the solar panels are made from silicon wafers.These solar panels have an efficiency of 26.4 percent and can last more than 25 years.The perovskite solar cell is a relatively new type of solar technology that has a similar maximum efficiency and much cheaper costs, the only downside is that it is less stable and the most efficient type uses lead.The name perovskite refers to the crystal structure with an ABX3 formula of the perovskite layer of the cell.All materials possess a property called a band gap.The smaller the band gap the more conductive the material, but this does not necessarily mean that the smaller the band gap the better the solar cell.The Shockley-Queisser limit provides the optimal band gap in terms of efficiency for a single junction solar cell which is 1.34 eV for single junction cells.This research focuses on tuning the band gap of lead-free perovskites through B-site cation replacement. Through this investigation, the optical band gaps of tin and lead perovskites were re-established.However, the copper-based perovskite disagrees with existing DFT calculations.Additionally, the mixed tin and copper perovskite in this experiment contradicts the intuitive prediction.</description>

      <title>Transition from ferromagnetic to noncollinear to paramagnetic state with increasing Ru concentration in FeRu films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The structural and magnetic properties of sputter-deposited Fe$_{100-x}$Ru$_x$ films were studied for $x \leq 50$. The crystal structure of Fe$_{100-x}$Ru$_x$ is shown to be predominantly body-centered cubic for $x&lt;13$ and to undergo a gradual transition to hexagonal close-packed in the concentration range $13 \lesssim x \lesssim 20$. Magnetic measurements indicate that the addition of Ru induces a noncollinear magnetic order in the body-centered cubic FeRu alloys, while the hexagonal close-packed FeRu alloys exhibit paramagnetic behavior. Increasing the Ru concentration in body-centered cubic FeRu alloys decreases the size of magnetic domains, approaching the size of magnetic grains. A simple atomistic model was used to show that antiferromagnetic coupling of Fe atoms across Ru atoms can be responsible for inducing noncollinear order in the FeRu cubic structures. Magnetic multilayer structures used in thin-film magnetic devices make extensive use of both Fe and Ru layers. Our results reveal that the presence of even a small amount of Ru in Fe influences the magnetic order of Fe, which could impact the performance of these devices.</description>

      <title>Controlling structural phases of Sn through lattice engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topology and superconductivity, two distinct phenomena offer unique insight into quantum properties and their applications in quantum technologies, spintronics, and sustainable energy technologies if system can be found where they coexist. Tin (Sn) plays a pivotal role here as an element due to its two structural phases, $\alpha$-Sn and $\beta$-Sn, exhibiting topological characteristics ($\alpha$-Sn) and superconductivity ($\beta$-Sn). In this study we show how precise control of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ phases of Sn thin films can be achieved by using molecular beam epitaxy grown buffer layers with systematic control over the lattice parameter. The resulting Sn films showed either $\beta$-Sn or $\alpha$-Sn phases as the lattice constant of the buffer layer was varied from 6.10 A to 6.48 A, covering the range between GaSb (closely matched to InAs) and InSb. The crystal structures of the $\alpha$- and $\beta$-Sn films were characterized by x-ray diffraction and confirmed by Raman spectroscopy and scanning transmission electron microscopy. The smooth and continuous surface morphology of the Sn films was validated using atomic force microscopy. The characteristics of $\alpha$- and $\beta$-Sn phases were further verified using electrical transport measurements by observing resistance drop near 3.7 K for superconductivity of the $\beta$-Sn phase and Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations for the $\alpha$-Sn phase. Density functional theory calculations showed that the stability of the Sn phases is highly dependent on lattice strain, with $\alpha$-Sn being more stable under tensile strain and $\beta$-Sn becoming favorable under compressive strain, which is in good agreement with experimental observations. Hence, this study sheds light on controlling Sn phases through lattice engineering, enabling innovative applications in quantum technologies and beyond.</description>

      <title>A defect-chemisty-informed phase-field model of grain growth in oxide electroceramics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dopants can significantly affect the properties of oxide ceramics through their impact on the property-determined microstructure characteristics such as grain boundary segregation, space charge layer formation in the grain boundary vicinity, the resultant microstructure features like bimodality due to abnormal grain growth. To support rational oxide ceramics design, we propose a multiphysics-based and defect-chemistry-informed phase-field grain growth model to simulate the microstructure evolution of oxide ceramics. It fully respects the thermodynamics of charged point defects (oxygen vacancies and dopants) in the grain interior and boundaries and considers the competing kinetics of defect diffusion and grain boundary movement. The proposed phase-field model is implemented through the finite element method and benchmarked against well-known simplified bicrystal models, including the Mott-Schottky and Gouy-Chapman models. Various simulation results are presented to reveal the impacts of defect formation energy differences between the grain interior and the grain boundary core on the key microstructural aspects, including space charge layer formation, grain boundary potential, solute drag effect, resultant bimodal abnormal grain growth and also dopant cloud within the grain interior imprinted by the vanished grain boundaries during sintering. In particular, simulation results confirm that the solute drag effect alone can lead to bimodal grain size distribution, without any contribution from grain misorientation and other anisotropy. Interestingly, abnormal grain growth simulations demonstrate that grain boundary potentials can vary substantially: grain boundaries of larger grains tend to have lower potentials than those of smaller grains. Such heterogeneous grain boundary potential distribution may inspire a new material optimization strategy through microstructure design.</description>

      <title>Physical Properties and Thermal Stability of Zirconium Platinum Nitride Thin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ternary transition metal nitrides (TMNs) promise to significantly expand the material design space by opening new functionality and enhancing existing properties. However, most systems have only been investigated computationally and limited understanding of their stabilizing mechanisms restricts translation to experimental synthesis. To better elucidate key factors in designing ternary TMNs, we experimentally fabricate and analyze the physical properties of the ternary Zr-Pt-N system. Structural analysis and DFT modeling demonstrate that Pt substitutes nitrogen on the non-metallic sublattice, which destabilizes the rock-salt structure and forms a complex cubic phase. We also show insolubility of Pt in the Zr-Pt-N at 45 at % with the formation of a secondary Pt-rich phase. The measured reduced plasma frequency, decrease in resistivity, and decrease in hardness reflect a dominance of metallic behavior in bonding. Contrary to previous computational predictions, Zr-Pt-N films are shown to be metastable systems where even low Pt concentrations (1%) facilitate a solid reaction with the Si-substrate, that is inaccessible in ZrN films.</description>

      <title>Engineering two-dimensional materials from single-layer NbS$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Starting from a single layer of NbS$_2$ grown on graphene by molecular beam epitaxy, the single unit cell thick 2D materials Nb$_{5/3}$S$_3$-2D and Nb$_2$S$_3$-2D are created using two different pathways. Either annealing under sulfur-deficient conditions at progressively higher temperatures or deposition of increasing amounts of Nb at elevated temperature result in phase-pure Nb$_{5/3}$S$_3$-2D followed by Nb$_2$S$_3$-2D. The materials are characterized by scanning tunneling microscopy, scanning tunneling spectroscopy and X-ray photoemission spectroscopy. The experimental assessment combined with systematic density functional theory calculations reveals their structure. The 2D materials are covalently bound without any van der Waals gap. Their stacking sequence and structure are at variance with expectations based on corresponding bulk materials highlighting the importance of surface and interface effects in structure formation.</description>

      <title>Atomic Resolution Observations of Nanoparticle Surface Dynamics and Instabilities Enabled by Artificial Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanoparticle surface structural dynamics is believed to play a significant role in regulating functionalities such as diffusion, reactivity, and catalysis but the atomic-level processes are not well understood. Atomic resolution characterization of nanoparticle surface dynamics is challenging since it requires both high spatial and temporal resolution. Though ultrafast transmission electron microscopy (TEM) can achieve picosecond temporal resolution, it is limited to nanometer spatial resolution. On the other hand, with the high readout rate of new electron detectors, conventional TEM has the potential to visualize atomic structure with millisecond time resolutions. However, the need to limit electron dose rates to reduce beam damage yields millisecond images that are dominated by noise, obscuring structural details. Here we show that a newly developed unsupervised denoising framework based on artificial intelligence enables observations of metal nanoparticle surfaces with time resolutions down to 10 ms at moderate electron dose. On this timescale, we find that many nanoparticle surfaces continuously transition between ordered and disordered configurations. The associated stress fields can penetrate below the surface leading to defect formation and destabilization making the entire nanoparticle fluxional. Combining this unsupervised denoiser with electron microscopy greatly improves spatio-temporal characterization capabilities, opening a new window for future exploration of atomic-level structural dynamics in materials.</description>

      <title>Persistent homology elucidates hierarchical structures in amorphous solids responsible for mechanical properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the role of atomic-level structures in determining amorphous material properties has been a long-standing challenge in solid-state physics. Upon mechanical loading, amorphous materials undergo both simple affine displacement and spatially inhomogeneous non-affine displacement. These two types of displacement contribute differently to the elastic modulus, i.e., the Born (or affine) and non-affine terms. Whether "soft" local structures characterized by either small Born terms or large non-affine displacements differ has remained an unanswered question despite the importance in fundamental and applied physics. To address this question, we combined molecular dynamics simulations and persistent homology analyses for amorphous Si. We found that the characteristics of local structures with large non-affine displacements differed significantly from those with small Born terms. The local structures surrounding atoms with small Born terms are characterized at the scale of short-range order (SRO), whereas those surrounding atoms with large non-affine displacements have hierarchical structures ranging from SRO to medium-range order. Furthermore, we found that these hierarchical structures are related to low-energy localized vibrational excitations. The correlation between the non-affine displacement and hierarchical geometric features elucidated by persistent homology provides a new viewpoint for understanding and designing the mechanical properties of amorphous materials based on their static structures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the integration of Kolmogorov Networks (KANs) into molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to improve interatomic potentials. We propose that widely used potentials, such as the Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential, the embedded atom model (EAM), and artificial neural network (ANN) potentials, can be interpreted within the KAN framework. Specifically, we demonstrate that the descriptors for ANN potentials, typically constructed using polynomials, can be redefined using KAN's non-linear functions. By employing linear or cubic spline interpolations for these KAN functions, we show that the computational cost of evaluating ANN potentials and their derivatives is reduced.</description>

      <title>Chirality-tunable non-linear Hall effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The non-linear generalization of the Hall effect has recently gained much attention, with a rapidly growing list of non-centrosymmetric materials that display higher-order Hall responses under time-reversal invariant conditions. The intrinsic second-order Hall response arises due to the first-order moment of Berry curvature -- termed Berry curvature dipole -- which requires broken inversion and low crystal symmetries. Chiral materials are characterized by their lack of improper symmetries such as inversion, mirror plane, and roto-inversion. Owing to this absence of symmetries, in this work, we propose chiral systems as ideal platforms to study the Berry curvature dipole-induced non-linear Hall effects. We use state-of-the-art first-principles computations, in conjunction with symmetry analyses, to explore a variety of chiral material classes -- metallic \ch{NbSi2}, semiconducting elemental Te, insulating HgS, and topological multifold semimetal CoSi. We present the emergence and tunability of the Berry curvature dipole in these chiral materials. In particular, we demonstrate that the two enantiomeric pairs exhibit an exactly opposite sign of the Berry curvature dipole. We complement our \textit{ab initio} findings with a general tight-binding minimal model and give estimates for non-linear Hall voltages, which are experimentally accessible. Our predictions put forward chiral materials as an emerging class of materials to realize non-linear Hall phenomena and highlight an as-yet-unexplored aspect of these systems.</description>

      <title>Ab-initio study of quantum oscillation in altermagnetic and nonmagnetic phases of RuO$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnet (AM) is a new proposed magnetic state with collinear antiferromagnetic ground state but presents some transport properties that were only believed to exist in ferromagnets or non-collinear antiferromagnets. To have a comprehensive understanding of the transport properties of AMs, especially from the experimental point of view, a promising altermagnetic metal is crucial. In all the proposed altermagnetic metals, RuO$_2$ has a special position, since it is the first proposed AM with the largest spin splitting and several important altermagnetism featured experiments were first performed based on it. However, a very recent report based on sensitive muon-spin measurements suggest a super small local magnetization from Ru, i.e. a nonmagnetic ground state in RuO$_2$. Therefore, a determination of the existence of the altermagnetic ground state is the basic starting point for all the previously altermagnetic transport properties in RuO$_2$. In this work, we propose to identify its magnetic ground state from the Fermi surface (FS) via the electronic transport property of quantum oscillation (QO). We systematically analyzed the FSs of RuO$_2$ in both nonmagnetic and altermagnetic states via first principles calculations. Our work should be helpful for future experiments on QO measurements to confirm its ground state by the interplay between transport measurements and computations.</description>

      <title>3D-Ising-type Magnetic Interactions Stabilized by the Extremely Large Uniaxial Magnetocrystalline Anisotropy in Layered Ferromagnetic Cr$_2$Te$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the magnetocrystalline anisotropy, critical behavior, and magnetocaloric effect in ferromagnetic-layered Cr$_2$Te$_3$. We have studied the critical behavior around the Curie temperature ($T_C$) using various techniques, including the modified Arrott plot (MAP), the Kouvel-Fisher method (KF), and critical isothermal analysis (CI). The derived critical exponents $\beta$ = 0.353(4) and $\gamma$ = 1.213(5) fall in between the three-dimensional (3D) Ising and 3D Heisenberg type models, suggesting complex magnetic interactions by not falling into any single universality class. On the other hand, the renormalization group theory, employing the experimentally obtained critical exponents, suggests 3D-Ising-type magnetic interactions decaying with distance as $J(r) = r^{-4.89}$. We also observe an extremely large uniaxial magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy (MAE) of $K_u=2065$ kJ/m$^3$, the highest ever found in any Cr$_x$Te$_y$ based systems, originating from the noncollinear ferromagnetic ground state as predicted from the first-principles calculations. The self-consistent renormalization theory (SCR) suggests Cr$_2$Te$_3$ to be an out-of-plane itinerant ferromagnet. Further, a maximum entropy change of -$\Delta S_{M}^{max}\approx$ 2.08 $J/kg-K$ is estimated around $T_C$ for the fields applied parallel to the $c$-axis.</description>

Abstract: Type-II multiferroicity, where electric polarization is induced by specific spin patterns, is crucial in fundamental physics and advanced spintronics. However, the spin model and magnetoelectric coupling mechanisms in prototypical type-II multiferroic CuFeO$_2$ and Al-doped CuFeO$_2$ remain unclear. Here, by considering both spin and alloy degrees of freedom, we develop a magnetic cluster expansion method, which considers all symmetry allowed interactions. Applying such method, we not only obtain realistic spin model that can correctly reproduce observations for both CuFeO$_2$ and CuFe$_{1-x}$Al$_x$O$_2$, but also revisit well-known theories of the original spin-current (SC) model and $p$-$d$ hybridization model. Specifically, we find that (i) a previously overlooked biquadratic interaction is critical to reproduce the $\uparrow\uparrow\downarrow\downarrow$ ground state and excited states of CuFeO$_2$; (ii) the combination of absent biquadratic interaction and increased magnetic frustration around Al dopants stabilizes the proper screw state; and (iii) it is the generalized spin-current (GSC) model that can correctly characterize the multiferroicity of CuFeO$_2$. These findings have broader implications for understanding novel magnetoelectric couplings in, e.g., monolayer multiferroic NiI$_2$.</description>

      <title>Curie-Weiss behavior and the "interaction" temperature of magnetic nanoparticle ensembles: local structure strongly affects the magnetic behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, the Curie-Weiss type behavior and the appearance of an "interaction" or "ordering" temperature for a collection of magnetic nanoparticles is explored theoretically. We show that some systems where an interaction temperature is reported are too dilute for dipolar interactions to play a role unless at least some of the particles are clumped together. We then show using the most simple type of clumps (particle pairs) that positive and negative interaction temperatures are possible due to dipolar interactions. The clump orientation dramatically changes this result. Finally, we show that an apparent interaction temperature can be measured in magnetic nanoparticle systems that have no interactions between particles, due to some alignment of anisotropy easy axes. These results show that nanoscale physical structures affect the measured magnetic response of nanoparticles.</description>

      <title>The incredible diversity of structural and magnetic instabilities in EuTiO3: from paramagnetic to spin glass, spin liquid and antiferromagnetic order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The perovskite oxide EuTiO3 (ETO) has attracted increased scientific interest due to its potential multiferroic properties and magnetic activity above and below its structural phase transition at TS=282K. Various experiments have indirectly evidenced that this transition is neither a cubic tetragonal nor the only one occurring in ETO. Here, we show new results demonstrating two further instabilities below TS based on lattice dynamics and spin-phonon interactions combined with a Landau free energy model with coupled order parameters. The new transition temperatures perfectly agree with available experimental data where further instabilities have been anticipated.</description>

      <title>A general thermodynamically consistent phase-field-micromechanics model of sintering with coupled diffusion and grain motion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sintering is a pivotal technology for processing ceramic and metallic powders into solid objects. A profound understanding of microstructure evolution during sintering is essential for manufacturing products with tailored properties. While various phase-field models have been proposed to simulate microstructure evolution in solid-state sintering, correctly incorporating the crucial densification mechanism, particularly grain motion, remains a challenge. The fundamental obstacle lies in the ad hoc treatment of the micromechanics of grain motion, where the thermodynamical driving force cannot be derived from the system's free energy. This work presents a novel phase-field-micromechanics model for sintering (PFMMS) that addresses this challenge. We define a unified energy law, under which the governing equations for microstructure evolution in sintering are derived using variational principles. Our approach ensures thermodynamic consistency, with the driving force for grain motion derived from the system's free energy. Consequently, the proposed PFMMS guarantees the evolution of microstructure in a direction that reduces the system's energy and eliminates non-densifying phenomena. We rigorously validate PFMMS against recent benchmarks of theoretical and numerical analysis. It is found that PFMMS captures intrinsic stress distribution along and beyond grain boundaries, exhibits system-size-independent shrinkage strain, and maintains thermodynamic equilibrium states. These features are fundamental requirements for a physically consistent sintering model.</description>

      <title>Optical bounds on many-electron localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish rigorous inequalities between different electronic properties linked to optical sum rules, and organize them into weak and strong bounds on three characteristic properties of insulators: electron localization length $\ell$ (the quantum fluctuations in polarization), electric susceptibility $\chi$, and optical gap $E_{\rm G}$. All-electron and valence-only versions of the bounds are given, and the latter are found to be more informative. The bounds on $\ell$ are particularly interesting, as they provide reasonably tight estimates for an ellusive ground-state property -- the average localization length of valence electrons -- from tabulated experimental data: electron density, high-frequency dielectric constant, and optical gap. The localization lengths estimated in this way for several materials follow simple chemical trends, especially for the alkali halides. We also illustrate our findings via analytically solvable harmonic oscillator models, which reveal an intriguing connection to the physics of long-ranged van der Waals forces.</description>

      <title>Direct Optical Probing of the Magnetic Properties of the Layered Antiferromagnet CrPS$_4$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unusual magnetic properties of Van der Waals type antiferromagnetic semiconductors make them highly attractive for spintronics and optoelectronics. A link between the magnetic and optical properties of those materials, required for practical applications, has not been, however, established so far. Here, we report on a combined experimental and theoretical study of magnetic, optical, and structural properties of bulk CrPS$_{4}$ samples. We find that the magnetic-field-dependent circular polarization degree of the photoluminescence is a direct measure of the net magnetization of CrPS$_{4}$. Complementary, Raman scattering measured as a function of magnetic field and temperature enables the determination of the magnetic susceptibility curve of the material. Our experimental results are backed by Our experimental results are supported by density functional theory calculations that take as input the lattice parameters determined from temperature-dependent X-ray diffraction measurements. This allows us to explain the impact of spin ordering on the spectral position of Raman transitions in CrPS$_4$, as well as anomalous temperature shifts of selected of them. The presented method for all-optical determination of the magnetic properties is highly promising for studies of spin ordering and magnetic phase transitions in single- or a few-layer samples of magnetic layered materials, for which a poor signal-to-noise ratio precludes any reliable neutron scattering or magnetometry measurements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Doping impurity atoms is a strategy commonly used to tune the functionality of materials including catalysts, semiconductors, and quantum emitters. The location of dopants and their interaction with surrounding atoms could significantly modulate the transport, optical, or magnetic properties of materials. However, directly imaging individual impurity atoms inside materials remains a generally unaddressed need. Here, we demonstrate how single atoms can be detected and located in three dimensions via multislice electron ptychography.Interstitial atoms in a complex garnet oxide heterostructure are resolved with a depth resolution better than 2.7 nm, together with a deep-sub-{\AA}ngstrom lateral resolution. Single-scan atomic-layer depth resolution should be possible using strongly divergent electron probe illumination. Our results provide a new approach to detecting individual atomic defects and open doors to characterize the local environments and spatial distributions that underlie a broad range of systems such as single-atom catalysts, nitrogen-vacancy centers, and other atomic-scale quantum sensors.</description>

      <title>Electrically activated W-doped VO2 films for reli-able, large-area, broadband THz waves modulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: THz amplitude modulators and switches are considered to be the main building blocks of future THz communication systems. Despite rapid progress, modulation and switching devices in this electromagnetic spectrum lag far behind other frequency ranges. Currently, THz modu-lators face major challenges in consistently producing high modulations depths over large frequency bands. Moreover, a convenient integration for practical applications requires that the modulation/switching properties can be electrically controlled. Devices fulfilling all these con-ditions remain to be demonstrated. In this work we show that W-doped VO2 films grown by direct-current magnetron sputtering can be efficiently used for the development reliable, large-area, broadband THz waves modulators. We demonstrate that W doping not only permits to tune the insulator to metal transition (IMT) temperature of VO2, but also, most importantly, to control the topology of the electrically activated transition. In situ / operando X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy characterizations of the devices, coupled with standard resistivi-ty measurements and time-domain THz spectroscopy, unambiguously demonstrate that the changes in the spatial distribution of the IMT is due to structural distortions induced by W doping.</description>

      <title>A multi-physics model for the evolution of grain microstructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When a metal is loaded mechanically at high temperatures, i.e. above 300 $^o$C, its grain microstructure evolves due to multiple physical mechanisms. Two of which are the curvature-driven migration of the grain boundaries due to increased mobility, and the formation of subgrains due to severe plastic deformation. Similar phenomena are observed during heat treatment subsequent to severe plastic deformation. Grain boundary migration and plastic deformation simultaneously change the lattice orientation at any given material point, which is challenging to simulate consistently. The majority of existing simulation approaches tackle this problem by applying separate, specialized models for mechanical deformation and grain boundary migration sequentially. Significant progress was made recognizing that the Cosserat continuum represents an ideal framework for the coupling between different mechanisms causing lattice reorientation, since rotations are native degrees of freedom in this setting.
  In this work we propose and implement a multi-physics model, which couples Cosserat crystal plasticity to Henry-Mellenthin-Plapp (HMP) type orientation phase-field in a single thermodynamically consistent framework for microstructure evolution. Compared to models based on the Kobayashi-Warren-Carter (KWC) phase-field, the HMP formulation removes the nonphysical term linear in the gradient of orientation from the free energy density, thus eliminating long-range interactions between grain boundaries. Further, HMP orientation phase field can handle inclination-dependent grain boundary energies. We evaluate the model's predictions and numerical performance within a two-dimensional finite element framework, and compare it to a previously published results based on KWC phase-field coupled with Cosserat mechanics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is increased interest in the heterogeneous integration of various compound semiconductors with Si for a variety of electronic and photonic applications. This paper focuses on integrating GaAsSb (with absorption in the C-band at 1550nm) with silicon to fabricate photodiodes, leveraging epitaxial layer transfer (ELT) methods. Two ELT techniques, epitaxial lift-off (ELO) and macro-transfer printing (MTP), are compared for transferring GaAsSb films from InP substrates to Si, forming PIN diodes. Characterization through atomic force microscopy (AFM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) exhibits a high-quality, defect-free interface. Current-voltage (IV) measurements and capacitance-voltage (CV) analysis validate the quality and functionality of the heterostructures. Photocurrent measurements at room temperature and 200 K demonstrate the device's photo-response at 1550 nm, highlighting the presence of an active interface.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discovery of the large magnetocaloric effect in HoB$_2$ has highlighted the practical advantage of heavy rare-earth ions. Other holmium compounds are of interest, and we here report the synthesis and the magnetic properties of HoSi$_{1.67}$ and HoGe$_{1.67}$ which form the same AlB$_2$-type structure but with vacancies. They are found to show the antiferromagnetic order with the Neel temperature 17.6(2)K for HoSi$_{1.67}$ and 9.9(2)K for HoGe$_{1.67}$, and the magnetic entropy changes at the temperature are 0.05(1)J/cm$^3$K for HoSi$_{1.67}$ and 0.08(1)J/cm$^3$K for HoGe$_{1.67}$. Magnetic orders were suppressed by replacing vacancies with nickel, resulting in an increase of magnetic entropy changes. Distance between the in-plane Ho$^{3+}$ ions appears to be an important parameter leading to the transition between the antiferromagnetic (HoSi$_{1.67}$) and the ferromagnetic (HoB$_2$) order. The finding may aid the exploration of other heavy rare-earth compounds for similar applications.</description>

      <title>Optimizing ToF-SIMS Depth Profiles of Semiconductor Heterostructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The continuous technological development of electronic devices and the introduction of new materials leads to ever greater demands on the fabrication of semiconductor heterostructures and their characterization. This work focuses on optimizing Time-of-Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) depth profiles of semiconductor heterostructures aiming at a minimization of measurement-induced profile broadening. As model system, a state-of-the-art Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE) grown multilayer homostructure consisting of $^{\textit{nat}}$Si/$^{28}$Si bilayers with only 2 nm in thickness is investigated while varying the most relevant sputter parameters. Atomic concentration-depth profiles are determined and an error function based description model is used to quantify layer thicknesses as well as profile broadening. The optimization process leads to an excellent resolution of the multilayer homostructure. The results of this optimization guide to a ToF-SIMS analysis of another MBE grown heterostructure consisting of a strained and highly purified $^{28}$Si layer sandwiched between two Si$_{0.7}$Ge$_{0.3}$ layers. The sandwiched $^{28}$Si layer represents a quantum well that has proven to be an excellent host for the implementation of electron-spin qubits.</description>

      <title>First Demonstration of HZO/beta-Ga2O3 Ferroelectric FinFET with Improved Memory Window</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have experimentally demonstrated the effectiveness of beta-gallium oxide (beta-Ga2O3) ferroelectric fin field-effect transistors (Fe-FinFETs) for the first time. Atomic layer deposited (ALD) hafnium zirconium oxide (HZO) is used as the ferroelectric layer. The HZO/beta-Ga2O3 Fe-FinFETs have wider counterclockwise hysteresis loops in the transfer characteristics than that of conventional planar FET, achieving record-high memory window (MW) of 13.9 V in a single HZO layer. When normalized to the actual channel width, FinFETs show an improved ION/IOFF ratio of 2.3x10^7 and a subthreshold swing value of 110 mV/dec. The enhanced characteristics are attributed to the low-interface state density (Dit), showing good interface properties between the beta-Ga2O3 and HZO layer. The enhanced polarization due to larger electric fields across the entire ferroelectric layer in FinFETs is validated using Sentaurus TCAD. After 5x10^6 program/erase (PGM/ERS) cycles, the MW was maintained at 9.2 V, and the retention time was measured up to 3x10^4 s with low degradation. Therefore, the ultrawide bandgap (UWBG) Fe-FinFET was shown to be one of the promising candidates for high-density non-volatile memory devices.</description>

Abstract: Geometrically frustrated assemblies where building blocks misfit have been shown to generate intriguing phenomena from self-limited growth, fiber formation, to structural complexity. We introduce a graph theory formulation of geometrically frustrated assemblies, capturing frustrated interactions through the concept of incompatible flows, providing a direct link between structural connectivity and frustration. This theory offers a minimal yet comprehensive framework for the fundamental statistical mechanics of frustrated assemblies. Through numerical simulations, the theory reveals new characteristics of frustrated assemblies, including two distinct percolation transitions for structure and stress, a crossover between cumulative and non-cumulative frustration controlled by disorder, and a divergent length scale in their response.</description>

      <title>Microstructural Underpinnings of Giant Intrinsic Exchange Bias in Epitaxial NiCo2O4 Thin Films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.13227v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding intrinsic exchange bias in nominally single-component ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic materials is crucial for simplifying related device architectures. However, the mechanisms behind this phenomenon and its tunability remain elusive, which hinders the efforts to achieve unidirectional magnetization for widespread applications. Inspired by the high tunability of ferrimagnetic inverse spinel NiCo2O4, we have investigated the origin of intrinsic exchange bias in NiCo2O4(111) films deposited on Al2O3(0001) substrates. Our comprehensive characterizations, including electron diffraction, x-ray reflectometry and spectroscopy, and polarized neutron reflectometry, reveals that intrinsic exchange bias in NiCo2O4(111)/Al2O3(0001) arises from a reconstructed antiferromagnetic rock-salt NixCo1-xO layer at the interface between the film and the substrate due to a significant structural mismatch. Remarkably, by engineering the interfacial structure under optimal growth conditions, we can achieve exchange bias larger than coercivity, leading to unidirectional magnetization. Such giant intrinsic exchange bias can be utilized for realistic device applications. Our work establishes a new material platform based on NiCo2O4, an emergent spintronics material, to study tunable interfacial magnetic and spintronic properties.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we propose that Majorana zero modes can be realized at the corners of the two-dimensional unconventional insulator. We demonstrate that 1T-PtSe2 is a symmetry indicator-free (SI-free) unconventional insulator, originating from orbital hybridization between Pt $d$ and Se $p_{x,y}$ states. The kind of SI-free unconventionality has no symmetry eigenvalue indication. Instead, it is diagnosed directly by the Wannier charge centers by using the one-dimensional Wilson loop method. The obstructed edge states exhibit strong anisotropy and large Rashba splitting. By introducing superconducting proximity and an external magnetic field, the Majorana corner modes can be obtained in the 1T-PtSe2 monolayer. In the end, we construct a two-Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang model with anisotropy to capture the Majorana physics.</description>

      <title>The effect of LPSO phase on the high-temperature oxidation of a stainless Mg-Y-Al alloy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15182v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we investigated the oxidation of the Mg-11Y-1Al alloy at 500{\deg}C in an Ar-20%O2 environment. Multiscale analysis showed the network-like long-period stacking ordered (LPSO) phase transformed into needle-like LPSO and polygonal Mg24Y5 phases, leading to the formation of a high-dense network of needle-like oxides at the oxidation front. These oxides grew laterally along the oxide/matrix interfaces, forming a thicker, continuous scale that effectively blocked elemental diffusion. Hence, the preferential oxidation along the needle-like LPSO is believed to accelerate the formation of a thicker and continuous oxide scale, further improving the oxidation resistance of the Mg-11Y-1Al alloy.</description>

      <title>Accurate Machine Learning Predictions of Coercivity in High-Performance Permanent Magnets</title>

Abstract: Increased demand for high-performance permanent magnets in the electric vehicle and wind turbine industries has prompted the search for cost-effective alternatives.Discovering new magnetic materials with the desired intrinsic and extrinsic permanent magnet properties presents a significant challenge to researchers because of issues with the global supply of rare-earth elements, material stability, and a low maximum magnetic energy product BH$_{max}$.While first-principle density functional theory (DFT) predicts materials' magnetic moments, magneto-crystalline anisotropy constants, and exchange interactions, it cannot compute coercivity ($H_c$).Although it is possible to calculate $H_c$ theoretically with micromagnetic simulations, the predicted value is larger than the experiment by almost an order of magnitude, due to the Brown paradox.To circumvent these, we employ machine learning (ML) methods on an extensive database obtained from experiments, DFT calculations, and micromagnetic modeling.The use of a large dataset enables realistic $H_c$ predictions for materials such as Ce-doped Nd$_2$Fe$_{14}$B, comparing favorably against micromagnetically simulated coercivities.Remarkably, our ML model accurately identifies uniaxial magneto-crystalline anisotropy as the primary contributor to $H_c$. With DFT calculations, we predict the Nd-site dependent magnetic anisotropy behavior in Nd$_2$Fe$_{14}$B, confirming that Nd $4g$-sites mainly contribute to uniaxial magneto-crystalline anisotropy, and also calculate Curie temperature (T$_{C}$).Both calculated results are in good agreement with experiment.The coupled experimental dataset and ML modeling with DFT input predict $H_c$ with far greater accuracy and speed than was previously possible using micromagnetic modeling.Further, we reverse-engineer the inter-grain exchange coupling with micromagnetic simulations by employing the ML predictions.</description>

      <title>Extracting Rates and Activation Free Energies of Martensitic Transitions Using Nanomechanical Force Statistics: Theory, Models, and Analysis</title>

Abstract: Nanomechanical responses (force-time profiles) of crystal lattices under deformation exhibit random critical jumps, reflecting the underlying structural transition processes. Despite extensive data collection, interpreting dynamic critical responses and their underlying mechanisms remains a significant challenge. This study explores a microscopic theoretical approach to analyse critical force fluctuations in martensitic transitions. Extensive sampling of the critical forces was performed using nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations of an atomic model of single-crystalline titanium nickel. We demonstrate that a framework of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics offers a principled explanation of the relationship between strain rate and the critical force distribution as well as its mean. The martensitic transition is represented on a free energy landscape, taking into account the thermally activated evolution of atomic arrangements over a barrier during its time-dependent deformation. The framework enables consistent inference of the relevant fundamental properties (e.g., intrinsic rate, activation free energy) that define the rate process of structural transition. The study demonstrates how the statistical characterisation of nanomechanical response-stimulus patterns can offer microscopic insights into the deformation behaviours of crystalline materials.</description>

      <title>Electric field enhances the electronic and diffusion properties of penta-graphene nanoribbons for application in lithium-ion batteries: a first-principles study</title>

Abstract: Enhancing the electronic and diffusion properties of lithium-ion batteries is crucial for improving the performance of the fast-growing energy storage devices. Recently, fast-charging capability of commercial-like lithium-ion anodes with the least modification of the current manufactoring technology is of great interest. Here we use first principles methods with density functional theory and the climbing image-nudged elastic band method to evaluate the impact of an external electric field on the stability, electronic and diffusion properties of penta-graphene nanoribbons upon lithium adsorption. We show that by adsorbing a lithium atom, these semiconductor nanoribbons become metal with a formation energy of - 0.22 (eV). The lithium-ion mobility of this material is comparable to that of a common carbon graphite layer. Under a relatively small vertical electric field, the structural stability of these lithium-ion systems is even more stable, and their diffusion coefficient is enhanced significantly of ~719 times higher than that of the material in the absence of an applied electric field and ~521 times higher than in the case of commercial graphitic carbon layers. Our results highlight the role of an external electric field as a novel switch to improve the efficiency of lithium-ion batteries with penta-graphene nanoribbon electrodes and open a new horizon for the use of more environmentally friendly pentagonal materials as anode materials in lithium-ion battery industry.</description>

      <title>Emergence of spin-phonon coupling in Gd-doped Y$_2$CoMnO$_6$ double perovskite oxide: a combined experimental and ab-initio study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02407</link>

Abstract: One of the fundamental interactions that is found in many functional materials is the spin-phonon coupling (SPC), which is at the heart of many novel functionalities. The simultaneous presence of multi-magnetic phases makes SPC even more intriguing. We have used Raman spectroscopy as well as first-principles methods to investigate the possibility of the appearance of SPC in Gd-doped Y$_2$CoMnO$_6$ (YGCMO) double perovskite oxide and the influence of anti-site disorder on the same. YGCMO is found to exhibit anti-site disorder leading to both ferromagnetic (between Co and Mn) and anti-ferromagnetic interactions (Co-Co, Mn-Mn, Gd-Co/Mn). An analysis of the temperature-dependent phonon frequency for the stretching modes of YGCMO, obtained using RAMAN spectroscopy, indicates that SPC is possibly emerging from simultaneous presence of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions. The nature of the phonon linewidth and the insulating state of the material eliminate the role of magnetostriction on the observed anomaly. The spin-phonon coupling strength comes out to be 0.29 cm$^{-1}$. Our experimental findings are corroborated by first-principles DFT calculations which indicate the presence of SPC in ordered YGCMO getting enhanced in the presence of anti-site disorder. This indicates a strong influence of B-site (Co/Mn) ordering on SPC in the bulk double perovskite systems. An analysis of the cause behind the enhanced SPC in the presence of anti-site disorder is also presented.</description>

      <title>Component exchange theory of trions</title>

Abstract: Treating the trion problem as an effective two-body system with exciton and electron components, we identify component exchange as the reason leading to trion formation. This mechanism can be visualized as a hole that toggles back and forth between two electrons. The coined term component exchange is meant to inform that the repeated change of the electron component of the exciton originates from the exchange interaction. We develop a Bethe-Salpeter Equation for trions, showing that a bound trion state emerges if the electron and electron of the exciton are distinguishable particles (e.g., having opposite spins or residing in different valleys of the Brillouin zone). Similar to numerical techniques that treat the trion as a three-body problem, the trion Bethe-Salpeter Equation yields similar binding energy without using parameters beyond effective masses and dielectric constants.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional electrons at mirror and twistronic twin boundaries in van der Waals ferroelectrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15040v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides (MX$_2$) occur in 2H and rhombohedral (3R) polytypes, respectively distinguished by anti-parallel and parallel orientation of consecutive monolayer lattices. In its bulk form, 3R-MX$_2$ is ferroelectric, hosting an out-of-plane electric polarisation, the direction of which is dictated by stacking. Here, we predict that twin boundaries, separating adjacent polarization domains with reversed built-in electric fields, are able to host two-dimensional electrons and holes with an areal density reaching $\sim 10^{13} {\rm cm}^{-2}$. Our modelling suggests that n-doped twin boundaries have a more promising binding energy than p-doped ones, whereas hole accumulation is stable at external surfaces of a twinned film. We also propose that assembling pairs of mono-twin films with a `magic' twist angle $\theta^*$ that provides commensurability between the moir\'e pattern at the interface and the accumulated carrier density, should promote a regime of strongly correlated states of electrons, such as Wigner crystals, and we specify the values of $\theta^*$ for homo- and heterostructures of various TMDs.</description>
