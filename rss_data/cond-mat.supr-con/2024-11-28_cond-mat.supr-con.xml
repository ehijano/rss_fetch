      <title>Localized obstructed pairs with zero superfluid stiffness from doping an antiferromagnetic insulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic interactions play an important role in the pairing mechanism of strongly correlated superconductors, many of which share the layered oxide structure characteristic of the cuprate, nickelate, osmate, cobaltate, ruthenate, iridate family of high-temperature superconductors. We explore the consequences of strong magnetic interactions in a lattice model of strongly-interacting d-electrons separated by weakly-interacting p-electrons. In contrast with conventional t-J models where magnetic exchange emerges in the strong-coupling expansion of Hubbard-type models, in this framework Coulomb blockade emerges in the strong-coupling limit of spin-spin interactions. This results in an insulator at fractional filling without Hubbard interactions. Doping this correlated insulator creates localized Cooper pairs that live on the edges of a square lattice, with a d-wave form-factor. They realize the flat-band eigenfunction of the checkerboard lattice Hamiltonian, and have zero kinetic energy. We present a mean-field theory of superconductivity interpolating between this interaction-localized strong-pairing limit with d-wave Bose-Einstein condensation and a weak-pairing limit with a nodal Fermi surface gap, where the superfluid stiffness scale is controlled by the electron hopping integrals and the density, as usual. The pair wavefunction connects d-wave and s-wave molecular orbitals, so that the intra-band gap on the Fermi surface is parametrically smaller than the off-shell inter-band gap. We provide experimental predictions for this scenario of local pairing on link-orbitals, and strong incentive for ab-initio calculation of the relevant local energy scales in the strongly correlated materials tied together by the structural motif of ligands on links.</description>

      <title>Interplay of superconductivity and charge-density-wave order in kagome materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the \textit{A}V$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$ (\textit{A}~$=$~K,~Rb,~Cs) kagome materials, superconductivity coexists with a charge density wave (CDW), constituting a new platform to study the interplay of these two orders. Despite extensive research, the symmetry of the superconducting order parameter remains disputed, with experiments seemingly supporting different conclusions. As key aspects of the physics might lie in the intertwining of electronic orders, a better understanding of the impact of the CDW on superconductivity is crucial. In this work, we develop a phenomenological framework to study the interplay of superconductivity and CDW order. In particular, we derive a Ginzburg-Landau free energy for both superconducting and CDW order parameters. Given the unclear nature of the superconducting state, we discuss general pairing symmetries with a focus on $s$-wave, $d$-wave, and pair-density-wave order parameters. Motivated by experiments, we consider the additional breaking of time-reversal or point-group symmetries of the CDW and determine in detail the consequences for the superconducting state. Our results show how the superconducting state mimics the broken symmetries of the CDW and can guide future microscopic calculations, as well as the experimental identification of the superconducting state in the \textit{A}V$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$ compounds.</description>

      <title>Probing topological degeneracy on a torus using superconducting altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The notion of topological order (TO) can be defined through the characteristic ground state degeneracy of a system placed on a manifold with non-zero genus $g$, such as a torus. This ground state degeneracy has served as a key tool for identifying TOs in theoretical calculations but it has never been possible to probe experimentally because fabricating a device in the requisite toroidal geometry is generally not feasible. Here we discuss a practical method that can be used to overcome this difficulty in a class of topologically ordered systems that consist of a TO and its time reversal conjugate $\overline{\rm TO}$. The key insight is that a system possessing such ${\rm TO}\otimes\overline{\rm TO}$ order fabricated on an annulus behaves effectively as TO on a torus, provided that one supplies a symmetry-breaking perturbation that gaps out the edge modes. We illustrate this general principle using a specific example of a spin-polarized $p_x\pm ip_y$ chiral superconductor which is closely related to the Moore-Read Pfaffian fractional quantum Hall state. Specifically, we introduce a simple model with altermagnetic normal state which, in the presence of an attractive interaction, hosts a helical $(p_x-ip_y)^\uparrow\otimes(p_x+ip_y)^\downarrow$ superconducting ground state. We demonstrate that when placed on an annulus with the appropriate symmetry-breaking edge perturbation this planar two-dimensional system, remarkably, exhibits the same pattern of ground state degeneracy as a $p_x+ ip_y$ superconductor on a torus. We discuss broader implications of this behavior and ways it can be tested experimentally.</description>

      <title>Observation of Yu-Shiba-Rusinov-like states at the edge of CrBr3/NbSe2 heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hybrid ferromagnet-superconductor heterostructures have attracted extensive attention as they potentially host topological superconductivity. Relevant experimental signatures have recently been reported in CrBr3/NbSe2 ferromagnet-superconductor heterostructure, but controversies remain. Here, we reinvestigate CrBr3/NbSe2 by an ultralow temperature scanning tunneling microscope with higher spatial and energy resolutions. We find that the single-layer CrBr3 film is insulating and acts likely as a vacuum barrier, the measured superconducting gap and vortex state on it are nearly the same as those of NbSe2 substrate. Meanwhile, in-gap features are observed at the edges of CrBr3 island, which display either a zero-energy conductance peak or a pair of particle-hole symmetric bound states. They are discretely distributed at the edges of CrBr3 film, and their appearance is found closely related to the atomic lattice reconstruction near the edges. By increasing tunneling transmissivity, the zero-energy conductance peak quickly splits, while the pair of nonzero in-gap bound states first approach each other, merge, and then split again. These behaviors are unexpected for Majorana edge modes, but in consistent with the conventional Yu-Shiba-Rusinov states. Our results provide critical information for further understanding the interfacial coupling in CrBr3/NbSe2 heterostructure.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic, multiband, and strong-coupling superconductivity of the Pb0.64Bi0.36 alloy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents theoretical and experimental studies on the superconductivity of Pb${_{0.64}}$Bi$_{0.36}$ alloy, which is a prototype of strongly coupled superconductors and exhibits the strongest coupling under ambient pressure among the materials studied so far. The critical temperature, the specific heat in the superconducting state, and the magnetic critical fields are experimentally determined. Deviations from the single-gap s-wave BCS-like behavior are observed. The electronic structure, phonons and electron-phonon interactions are analyzed in relation to the metallic Pb, explaining why the Pb-Bi alloy exhibits such a large value of the electron-phonon coupling parameter $\lambda \simeq 2$. Superconductivity is studied using the isotropic Eliashberg formalism as well as the anisotropic density functional theory for superconductors. We find that while Pb is a two-gap superconductor with well-defined separate superconducting gaps, in the Pb-Bi alloy an overlapped three-gap-like structure is formed with a strong anisotropy. Furthermore, the chemical disorder, inherent to this alloy, leads to strong electron scattering, which is found to reduce the critical temperature.</description>

      <title>Field-free Josephson diode effect in interacting chiral quantum dot junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate chiral quantum dot (QD)-based Josephson junction and show the correlation-induced Josephson diode effect (JDE) in it. The presence of electron-electron interaction spontaneously creates an imbalance between up- and down-spin electrons during the non-equilibrium transport making the QD effectively magnetic. The simultaneous presence of the chirality and the interaction eventually results in the field-free JDE in our chiral QD junction. We employ the Keldysh non-equilibrium Green's function technique to study the behavior of the Josephson current (JC) and the rectification coefficient (RC) of our Josephson diode (JD). We show a sign-changing behavior of the RC with the Coulomb correlation and the lead-to-dot coupling strength and find the maximum magnitude of the RC $\sim 72\%$ for moderate interaction strength. Our proposed field-free Josephson diode (JD) based on interacting chiral QD may be a potential switching component in superconductor based devices.</description>

      <title>Interlayer couplings in cuprates: structural origins, analytical forms, and structural estimators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We quantitatively identify the multiple distinct microscopic mechanisms contributing to effective interlayer couplings (EICs) by performing first-principle calculations for two prototype superconducting cuprate families, pristine and doped Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCuO$_2$O$_{8+x}$ and Pr$_{x}$Y$_{1-x}$Ba$_2$Cu$_3$O$_7$. The major mechanisms are mediated by interlayer oxygen $p_{\sigma}$-$p_{\sigma}$ and $p_z$-$p_z$ hoppings as well as interlayer copper $d_{z^2}$-oxygen $p_{\sigma}$ hoppings. Furthermore, we show how EICs are closely related to structural distortions such as layer bucklings and bond length changes. This allows us to provide analytical formulae that permit direct estimation of the key interatomic hoppings and the EICs based only on the crystal structure. Finally, we benchmark our method on YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_7$ to estimate the strength and anisotropy of the EIC.</description>

      <title>Chemical pressure tuning of competing orders in $\textrm{Ba}_{1-x}\textrm{Ca}_{x}\textrm{Ni}_{2}\textrm{As}_{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $\mathrm{Ba}\mathrm{Ni}_{2}\mathrm{As}_{2}$, a structural-analogue to the iron-based parent compound $\mathrm{Ba}\mathrm{Fe}_{2}\mathrm{As}_{2}$, offers a unique platform to study the interplay between superconductivity, charge density waves and, possibly, electronic nematicity. Here, we report on the growth and characterization of $\mathrm{Ba}_{1-x}\mathrm{Ca}_{x}\mathrm{Ni}_{2}\mathrm{As}_{2}$ single crystals with $0 \leq x \leq 0.1$, using a combination of x-ray diffraction, diffuse x-ray scattering, heat capacity, and electronic transport measurements. Our results demonstrate that calcium substitution affects the structural, electronic and thermodynamic properties of $\mathrm{Ba}\mathrm{Ni}_{2}\mathrm{As}_{2}$ in a way that is strongly reminiscent of moderate hydrostatic pressures albeit with marked differences. In particular Ca-substitution efficiently suppresses both the triclinic structural transition and the associated commensurate charge density wave formation, while increasing the superconducting transition temperature. We found that the substitution range in which the crystals remain homogeneous is limited as for concentrations $x \geq 0.04$ intense diffuse x-ray scattering indicates the formation of stacking faults, which, despite the preserved integrity of the NiAs layers, prevents investigation up to concentrations at which the chemical pressure would completely suppress the structural instability.</description>

      <title>Structural and magnetic characterization of CeTa$_7$O$_{19}$ and YbTa$_7$O$_{19}$ with two-dimensional pseudospin-1/2 triangular lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Triangular lattice antiferromagnets are prototypes for frustrated magnetism and may potentially realize novel quantum magnetic states such as a quantum spin liquid ground state. A recent work suggests NdTa$_7$O$_{19}$ with rare-earth triangular lattice is a quantum spin liquid candidate and highlights the large family of rare-earth heptatantalates as a framework for quantum magnetism investigation. In this paper, we report the structural and magnetic characterization of CeTa$_7$O$_{19}$ and YbTa$_7$O$_{19}$. Both compounds are isostructural to NdTa$_7$O$_{19}$ with no detectable structural disorder. For CeTa$_7$O$_{19}$, the crystal field energy levels and parameters are determined by inelastic neutron scattering measurements. Based on the crystal field result, the magnetic susceptibility data could be well fitted and explained, which reveals that CeTa$_7$O$_{19}$ is a highly anisotropic Ising triangular-lattice antiferromagnet ($g_z$/$g_{xy}$$\sim$3) with very weak exchange interaction (J$\sim$0.22~K). For YbTa$_7$O$_{19}$, millimeter sized single crystals could be grown. The anisotropic magnetization and electron spin resonance data show that YbTa$_7$O$_{19}$ has a contrasting in-plane magnetic anisotropy with $g_z$/$g_{xy}$$\sim$0.67 similar as that of YbMgGaO$_4$. The above results indicate that CeTa$_7$O$_{19}$ and YbTa$_7$O$_{19}$ with pseudospin-1/2 ground states might either be quantum spin liquid candidate materials or find applications in adiabatic demagnetization refrigeration due to the weak exchange interaction.</description>

      <title>Magnetic field tuned superconducting and normal phase magnetism in CeCo$_{0.5}$Rh$_{0.5}$In$_{5}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By tuning superconductivity with an applied magnetic field, we use neutrons to compare the magnetic ordered phases in superconducting and normal states of CeCo$_{0.5}$Rh$_{0.5}$In$_{5}$. At zero field, CeCo$_{0.5}$Rh$_{0.5}$In$_{5}$ displays both superconductivity ($T_{c}$=1.3 K) and spatially long-ranged commensurate $\uparrow\downarrow\uparrow\downarrow$ antiferromagnetism ($T_{N}$=2.5 K, $\vec{Q}_{0}=({1\over 2}, {1\over 2}, {1\over 2})$). Neutron spectroscopy fails to measure propagating magnetic excitations with only temporally overdamped fluctuations observable. On applying a magnetic field we find anisotropic behavior in the static magnetism. When the field is along the crystallographic $c$-axis, no change in the static magnetic response is observable. However when the field is oriented within the $a-b$ plane, an increase in $T_{N}$ and change in the critical response are measured. At low temperatures in the superconducting phase, the elastic magnetic intensity increases linearly ($\propto |H|$) with small $a-b$ oriented fields. However, this trend is interrupted at intermediate fields where commensurate block $\uparrow\uparrow\downarrow\downarrow$ magnetism with propagation vector $\vec{Q}=({1\over 2}, {1\over 2}, {1\over 4})$ forms. For large applied fields in the [1 $\overline{1}$ 0] direction which completely suppresses superconductivity, weakly incommensurate magnetic order along $L$ is observed to replace the commensurate response present in the superconducting and vortex phases. We suggest field-induced incommensurate static magnetism, present in the normal state of superconducting and antiferromagnetic CeCo$_{0.5}$Rh$_{0.5}$In$_{5}$ for $a-b$ plane oriented magnetic fields. We speculate that these field dependent properties are tied to the field induced anisotropy associated with the local Ce$^{3+}$ crystal field environment of the tetragonal `115' structure.</description>

      <title>Fermi surface and pseudogap in highly doped Sr$_{2}$IrO$_{4}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fate of the Fermi surface in bulk electron-doped Sr$_{2}$IrO$_{4}$ remains elusive, as does the origin and extension of its pseudogap phase. Here, we use high-resolution angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES) to investigate the electronic structure of Sr$_{2-x}$La$_{x}$IrO$_{4}$ up to $x=0.2$, a factor of two higher than in previous work. Our findings reveal that the Fermi surface evolves smoothly with doping. Notably, the antinodal pseudogap persists up to the highest doping level, while nodal quasiparticle coherence increases monotonously. This demonstrates that the sharp increase in Hall carrier density recently observed above $x^{*}=0.16$ [Y.-T. Hsu et al., Nature Physics 20, 1596 (2024)] cannot be attributed to the closure of the pseudogap. Further, we determine a temperature boundary of the pseudogap of $T^{*}\simeq~200~\textrm{K}$ for $x=0.2$, comparable to cuprates. Our results suggest that pseudogaps are a generic feature of doped quasi-2D antiferromagnetic Mott insulators, likely related to short range magnetic correlations.</description>

      <title>Quantum Griffiths singularity in a three-dimensional superconductor to Anderson critical insulator transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06710v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Disorder is ubiquitous in real materials and can have dramatic effects on quantum phase transitions. Originating from the disorder enhanced quantum fluctuation, quantum Griffiths singularity (QGS) has been revealed as a universal phenomenon in quantum criticality of low-dimensional superconductors. However, due to the weak fluctuation effect, QGS is very challenging to detect experimentally in three-dimensional (3D) superconducting systems. Here we report the discovery of QGS associated with the quantum phase transition from 3D superconductor to Anderson critical insulator in a spinel oxide MgTi2O4 (MTO). Under both perpendicular and parallel magnetic field, the dynamical critical exponent diverges when approaching the quantum critical point, demonstrating the existence of 3D QGS. Among 3D superconductors, MTO shows a relatively strong fluctuation effect featured as a wide superconducting transition region. The enhanced fluctuation, which may arise from the mobility edge of Anderson localization, finally leads to the occurrence of 3D quantum phase transition and QGS. Our findings offer a new perspective to understand quantum phase transitions in strongly disordered 3D systems.</description>

      <title>Theory of Tunneling Spectroscopy in Unconventional $p$-wave Magnet-Superconductor Hybrid Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17482v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically study the tunneling conductance of a junction consisting of a two-dimensional unconventional $p$-wave magnet (UPM) and a superconductor (SC) for various pairing symmetries. The zero bias conductance peaks arising from the dispersionless surface Andreev bound states (SABSs) in $d_{xy}$-wave and $p_{x}$-wave superconductor junctions are insensitive against varying the magnetic spin-splitting strength $\alpha _{y}$. Moreover, for chiral $p$- or chiral $d$-wave SCs, zero bias conductance shows a non-monotonic change as a function of $\alpha_{y}$ indicating the existence of the dispersive SABSs. Our obtained results of tunneling spectroscopy based on a UPM serve as an effective way for the identification of the pairing symmetries of unconventional superconductors. It is noted that our used Hamiltonian of UPM is also available for persistent spin helix systems.</description>

      <title>Growth and characterization of the La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7-\delta}$ thin films: dominant contribution of the $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$ orbital at ambient pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08789v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By using the pulsed-laser-ablation technique, we have successfully grown the La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7-\delta}$ thin films with $c$-axis orientation perpendicular to the film surface. X-ray diffraction shows that the (00l) peaks can be well indexed to the La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7-\delta}$ phase. Resistive measurements show that the samples can be tuned from weak insulating to metallic behavior through adjusting the growth conditions. Surprisingly, all curves of $\rho-T$ in the temperature region of 2$\sim$300~K do not show the anomalies corresponding to either the spin density wave or the charge density wave orders as seen in bulk samples. Hall effect measurements show a linear field dependence with the dominant hole charge carriers, but the Hall coefficient $R_{H}=\rho_{xy}/H$ exhibits strong temperature dependence. The magnetoresistance above about 50~K is positive but very weak, indicating a weakened or absence of multiband effect. However, a negative magnetoresistance is observed at low temperatures, which shows the delocalization effect by magnetic field. Detailed analysis on the magnetoresistance suggests that the delocalization effect at low temperatures is due to the Kondo-like effect, rather than the Anderson weak localization. Our transport results suggest that, the electronic conduction is fulfilled by the $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$ orbital with holes as the dominant charge carriers, while the interaction through Hund's coupling with the localized $d_{z^{2}}$ orbital plays an important role in the charge dynamics.</description>

      <title>Structural Evolution from Hyper-Honeycomb to Honeycomb Networks and Superconductivity in LaPt$_x$Si$_{2-x}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17033v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the crystal structures and superconductivity (SC) of LaPt$_{x}$Si$_{2-x}$ ($0.5 \leq x \leq 1.0$) that are solid solutions of LaSi$_{2}$ and LaPtSi with centrosymmetric tetragonal ($I4_{1}/amd$, $D_{4h}^{19}$, \#141) and non-centrosymmetric tetragonal ($I4_{1}md$, $C_{4v}^{11}$, \#109) structures, respectively. It was found that at $0.86 \leq x \leq 1.00$, the non-centrosymmetric tetragonal symmetry is preserved, while partial disorder appears in alternating Pt and Si of the hyper-honeycomb network. The superconducting transition temperature $T_{\rm c}$ was drastically reduced from 3.9 K to 1.5 K as $x$ varies from 1.0 to 0.86. Additionally, a hexagonal phase with an AlB$_{2}$-type structure ($P6/mmm$, $D_{6h}^{1}$, \#191) has been discovered at $0.50 \leq x \leq 0.71$ with a honeycomb network of statistically distributed Pt and Si atoms. The hexagonal phase exhibited SC at $T_{\rm c} = 0.38$ K. This system provides an opportunity to investigate the relationship between topological electronic states, SC, and disorders</description>

      <title>Intertwined effects of elastic deformation and damage on vortex pinning and Jc degradation in polycrystalline superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11561v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The damage and the critical current density (Jc) degradation of polycrystalline superconductors induced by strain dramatically influence their performance in applications. Unfortunately, the state-of-the-art experimental techniques are unable to detect the damage of internal polycrystalline structures and the microscopic superconductivity in the presence of strain. We propose a groundbreaking multi-scale theoretical framework aimed at revealing the underlying physical mechanisms of the reversible and irreversible Jc degradation induced by the strain through tackling the complex intertwined effects of elastic deformation and damage on the superconductivity of grain boundaries and the associated vortex pinning. The results are well validated by experimental measurements. Utilizing the benchmarked physical model, we demonstrate that the damage evolutions of polycrystalline superconductors in the presence of strain can be approximately estimated by means of the electromagnetic experiments on Jc. Furthermore, we also discuss the characteristics of damage and Jc degradation of polycrystalline superconductors subjected to biaxial mechanical loads. The findings will pave the way to investigate the tunable vortex pinning and Jc of superconductors by strain, and to develop a brand new electromagnetic method to manifest the damage of polycrystalline superconductors.</description>

      <title>AI-driven inverse design of materials: Past, present and future</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09429v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The discovery of advanced materials is the cornerstone of human technological development and progress. The structures of materials and their corresponding properties are essentially the result of a complex interplay of multiple degrees of freedom such as lattice, charge, spin, symmetry, and topology. This poses significant challenges for the inverse design methods of materials. Humans have long explored new materials through a large number of experiments and proposed corresponding theoretical systems to predict new material properties and structures. With the improvement of computational power, researchers have gradually developed various electronic structure calculation methods, such as the density functional theory and high-throughput computational methods. Recently, the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology in the field of computer science has enabled the effective characterization of the implicit association between material properties and structures, thus opening up an efficient paradigm for the inverse design of functional materials. A significant progress has been made in inverse design of materials based on generative and discriminative models, attracting widespread attention from researchers. Considering this rapid technological progress, in this survey, we look back on the latest advancements in AI-driven inverse design of materials by introducing the background, key findings, and mainstream technological development routes. In addition, we summarize the remaining issues for future directions. This survey provides the latest overview of AI-driven inverse design of materials, which can serve as a useful resource for researchers.</description>
