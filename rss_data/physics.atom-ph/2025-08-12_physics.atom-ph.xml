      <title>Laser Resonance Ionization Spectroscopy of Thorium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-lying Rydberg and autoionizing (AI) states of thorium (Th) have been studied via resonance laser ionization spectroscopy at both TRIUMF Canada's particle accelerator centre and Oak Ridge National Lab (ORNL). Multiple Rydberg series converging to the ionization potential (IP) were observed via different stepwise laser excitation schemes and were assigned to be the $6d^27s (^4F_{3/2})$ $np$, $nd$, and $nf$ series. Analysis of these series enabled the determination of the IP to be 50868.735(54) cm$^{-1}$, which improved the precision by two orders of magnitude over the current adopted NIST value of 50867(2) cm$^{-1}$. Additionally, four AI Rydberg series were identified and assigned to $nf$ and $nd$ series converging to the $6d^27s$ $^4F_{5/2}$ and $6d^27s$ $^2D_{3/2}$ metastable states of Th$^+$. The measured energies of the Rydberg and AI Rydberg states are reported, and observed perturbations within the series are discussed.</description>

      <title>Engineered Molecular Clock Transitions for Symmetry Violation Searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heavy polar molecules are sensitive probes of physics Beyond the Standard Model. However, uncontrolled external electromagnetic fields pose challenges to achieving precise and accurate measurements. Minimizing susceptibility to these fields is therefore critical and has played an important role in all precision experiments of this type. Here we devise and demonstrate clock transitions engineered to realize robust symmetry violation searches in the polyatomic molecule YbOH. Sensitivities to external fields can be suppressed by orders-of-magnitude while preserving high sensitivity to the electron electric dipole moment (eEDM). We perform Ramsey measurements on these clock transitions and observe suppression of electric and magnetic sensitivities by at least a factor of 700 and 200, respectively, and demonstrate the robustness of their spin coherence against large electromagnetic field fluctuations. We further identify and employ selected quantum states to make sensitive measurements of external magnetic and electric fields, another critical feature for highly accurate measurements. This approach of molecular engineering is broadly applicable to diverse molecular species and states, including those with complex nuclei and those that are compatible with state-of-the-art cooling and trapping techniques, thereby offering the potential to significantly improve experimental sensitivity to a wide range of New Physics while expanding the chemical design space for molecular quantum science.</description>

      <title>High-Fidelity Microwave-Polarization Control in a Rydberg-Ensemble Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Control of the polarization of microwave fields is a key experimental capability for a number of atomic physics platforms. However, producing high-fidelity microwaves requires a well-controlled microwave environment, where reflections that distort the polarization must be avoided or well characterized, a constraint that often conflicts with other experimental design considerations. Here we demonstrate a microwave control system capable of producing high-fidelity microwave polarizations in a Rydberg-ensemble experiment. We use three in-vacuum DC electrodes, repurposed as microwave antennae, to produce imperfect and initially unknown polarizations. Each source is driven with independent phase and amplitude control to generate the desired microwave fields. We probe the fields produced at the position of the atoms using Rydberg-EIT spectroscopy of the microwave-induced avoided crossings. We produce $\sigma_-$, $\pi$, and $\sigma_+$ polarized microwaves with &gt; 99 % fidelity and generate their combinations. We extend our purification techniques to frequencies away from Rydberg resonances by utilizing an auxiliary microwave field, generating two-photon microwave resonances. The techniques developed here will facilitate the engineering of dipolar interactions in atomic and molecular physics experiments.</description>

      <title>Ion Coulomb crystals: an exotic form of condensed matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wigner crystals formed by laser-cooled ions in traps are unconventional condensed-matter systems, characterized by interparticle distances of several micrometers and energy scales on the order of $\mu$eV. Their crystalline structure emerges from the interplay between Coulomb repulsion and the external confining potential, which can be readily tuned. Moreover, individual ions can be precisely manipulated with lasers and imaged via resonance fluorescence. These unusual and unique properties make ion crystals a powerful platform for studying phases of matter and their dynamics in the strongly correlated quantum regime. This review examines the theoretical framework and experimental characterization of ion Coulomb crystals from a condensed-matter perspective. We highlight their dynamical and thermodynamic properties in one, two, and three dimensions, along with recent investigations into their out-of-equilibrium behavior. We provide outlooks on future directions for exploring novel condensed matter phenomena with trapped ion crystals, as well as their many scientific and technical applications, which have driven advances in controlling and measuring ion crystals in the lab.</description>

      <title>Ionization rate vs. laser intensity determined from ion count vs. peak intensity due to neutral gas exposure to an 800 nm ultrashort pulsed laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optical cycle-averaged ionization rate of Ar, O$_{2}$, and N$_{2}$ vs. local instantaneous laser intensity $I$ for linear polarized $800$ nm light is determined up to approx. $300$ TW/cm$^{2}$ by numerically inverting published time-of-flight ion spectrometer data. The published Ar$^{+}$ collection efficiency of the microchannel plate (MCP) at the end of the spectrometer and its $I_{0}$ scale are recalibrated by fitting it to its high $I_{0}$ solution. The relative collection efficiencies of the other species are determined by published MCP cathode data. Results for O$_2$ are consistent with a reevaluation of published data used to determine its cross section $\sigma_8$ in the multiphoton (low $I$) regime.</description>

      <title>Hyperfine structure and $K$-doubling in RaOCH$_3$ molecule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: RaOCH$_3$ molecule is one of the most sensitive systems for the electron electric dipole moment ($e$EDM) searches. Its hyperfine and $K-$doubling structure in the external electric field is of key importance for preparing and interpreting the experiment. We propose the method for calculation the symmetric top molecules and applied it for RaOCH$_3$. Hyperfine structure, $K-$doubling and sensitivity of the molecule to $e$EDM in the external electric field were calculated.</description>

      <title>Characterization of the electronic ground state of He$_2^+$ by high-resolution photoelectron spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Excluding the very shallow potential minimum of the electronic ground state, all bound electronic states of He$_2$ have Rydberg character. Their potential-energy functions are similar to those of the He$_2^+$ states to which the Rydberg series converge. Photoionization and electron-impact ionization of the metastable $a~^3\Sigma_u^+$ state of He$_2$ are thus characterized by diagonal Franck-Condon factors and only provide access to low vibrational levels of the He$_2^+$ $X^+$ $^2\Sigma_u^+$ electronic ground state. For this reason, little experimental information is available on the excited vibrational levels of He$_2^+$. We report a measurement, by high-resolution photoelectron spectroscopy, of 17 vibrational levels of the $X^+$ $^2\Sigma_u^+$ state of $^4$He$_2^+$, with vibrational quantum number $v^+$ from 3 to 19 and covering more than 95% of the potential well. To access these states, we exploit a hump in the potential-energy function of the $c~^3\Sigma_g^+$ state, whose vibrational wavefunctions extend to large internuclear distance by quantum-mechanical tunneling through the potential barrier. Combining these results with data on the lowest ($v^+=0-2$) and highest ($v^+=22, 23$) vibrational levels of $^4$He$_2^+$, we derive a full map of the rovibrational structure of He$_2^+$ and, in a least-squares fit, an empirical effective potential-energy function that describes all experimental data within uncertainties. This function yields the positions of the 409 bound rovibrational levels and the positions and widths of the 74 shape resonances of the $X^+$ $^2\Sigma_u^+$ state of $^4$He$_2^+$. The dissociation energy of He$_2^+$ is $D{\rm e}=19,956.10(10)$ cm$^{-1}$ [$D_0(^4{\rm He}_2^+)=19,101.29(10)$ cm$^{-1}$].</description>

      <title>Precision Spectroscopy of the Fine Structure in the $\boldsymbol{a\;{}^3\Sigma_u^+(v=0)}$ and $\boldsymbol{c\;{}^3\Sigma_g^+(v=4)}$ States of the Helium Dimer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With four electrons, He$_2$ is one of very few molecules for which first-principles quantum-chemical calculations that include the treatment of nonadiabatic, relativistic and quantum-electrodynamics corrections are possible. Precise spectroscopic measurements are needed as references to test these calculations. We report here on a spectroscopic measurement of the $c$ $^3\Sigma_g^+\leftarrow a$ $^3\Sigma_u^+$ electronic transition of $^4$He$_2$ at a precision ($\Delta \nu/\nu$) of $2.5\times 10^{-10}$ and with full resolution of the rotational, spin-spin and spin-rotational fine structures. The investigation focuses on transitions to the rotational levels of the $c$ $^3\Sigma_g^+(v=4)$ state, located energetically above the He$(1$ $^1S_0) + $He$(2$ $^3S_1)$ dissociation limit and decaying by tunneling predissociation through a barrier in the $c$ state. The new data include a full map of the energy levels of the $a$ $^3\Sigma_u^+(v=0)$ and $c$ $^3\Sigma_g^+(v=4)$ states with rotational quantum numbers $N$ up to 9 and 10, respectively, and full sets of fine-structure intervals in these levels for comparison with first-principles calculations from a parallel investigation [B. R\'acsai, P. Jeszenszki, A. Marg\'ocsy and E. Maty\'us, arXiv:2506.23879v1 (2025)]. The new data were combined with data from earlier measurements of the spectrum of the $c-a$ band system of $^4$He$_2$ to derive full sets of molecular constants for the $a$ $^3\Sigma_u^+(v=0)$ and $c$ $^3\Sigma_g^+(v=4)$ states with much improved precision over previous experimental results. A pronounced broadening of the linewidths of the transitions to the $c$ $^3\Sigma_g^+(v=4,N=10)$ fine-structure levels is attributed to tunneling predissociation through a barrier in the potential of the $c$ state and is quantitatively accounted for by calculations of the predissociation widths.</description>

      <title>Precision Test of Bound-State QED at Intermediate-Z with Kaonic Neon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report Dirac-Fock calculations of transition energies for kaonic neon (KNe). For the most intense line, the 7-6 transition, the calculated energy is 9450.28 eV, which includes a bound-state QED (BSQED) contribution of 12.66 eV. This is in excellent agreement with the recent SIDDHARTHA-2 measurement at DA$\Phi$NE of 9450.23 $\pm$ 0.37 (stat.) $\pm$ 1.50 (syst.) eV. With the QED shift far exceeding experimental uncertainty, these results establish kaonic atoms as powerful platforms for precision tests of BSQED in intermediate-Z systems.</description>

      <title>Atomic thermometry in optical lattice clocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate measurement of atomic temperature is essential for a wide range of applications, from quantum sensing to precision metrology. In optical lattice clocks, precise characterization of atomic temperature is required to minimize systematic uncertainties at the $10^{-18}$ level. In this work, we investigate atomic temperature measurements in the ytterbium optical lattice clock developed at INRIM, IT-Yb1, employing sideband and Doppler spectroscopy across a wide range of trapping conditions. By implementing clock-line-mediated Sisyphus cooling, we reduce the atomic temperature and enable operation at shallower lattice depths down to $D = 50E_{R}$. We compare temperature estimates obtained from the harmonic oscillator model with those derived using a Born-Oppenheimer-based approach, which is expected to provide a more accurate description of atomic motion in both longitudinal and radial directions, especially for hotter atoms whose motion deviates from the harmonic regime. Discrepancies up to a factor of two in extracted temperatures are observed depending on the chosen model. We assess the impact of these modeling differences on the evaluation of lattice frequency shifts and find deviations up to $8\times10^{-17}$. Even though extended Sisyphus cooling reduces these inconsistencies to the $1\times10^{-18}$ level or below, residual biases may still limit the accuracy of optical lattice clocks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unravelling the internal structure of hadrons and nuclei in terms of the quarks and gluons of Quantum Chromodynamics is a central focus of current nuclear physics research. Directly observing gluonic states in the nucleus would be groundbreaking and is an objective of the future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC). Over thirty years ago, Jaffe and Manohar identified a new double-helicity flip structure function, directly sensitive to exotic gluons. They pointed out that this could be measured in inclusive high-energy electron scattering from a transversely polarized nuclear target with spin $I \ge 1$. Here, we identify the spin-3 nucleus boron-10 as a particularly interesting system to search for exotic gluons. Leveraging technical advances in atomic physics over the past decade, we outline an experimental scheme to directly optically pump a beam of stable boron atoms to polarize the nuclear spin. Technical challenges to realize a spin-polarized beam of boron-10 in the EIC are discussed. The proposed scheme will also polarize the $^{11}$B nucleus, which could significantly enhance the pB fusion cross section.</description>

      <title>Real-time scattering and freeze-out dynamics in Rydberg-atom lattice gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the non-equilibrium dynamics of gauge theories remains a fundamental challenge in high-energy physics. Indeed, most large scale experiments on gauge theories intrinsically rely on very far-from equilibrium dynamics, from heavy-ion to lepton and hadron collisions, which is in general extremely challenging to treat ab initio. Quantum simulation holds intriguing potential in tackling this problem and pioneering experiments have observed different characteristic features of gauge theories, such as string breaking and false vacuum decay. Here, using a programmable Rydberg atom array, we observe real-time scattering and freeze-out dynamics in a (1+1)-dimensional U(1) lattice gauge theory. Through spatiotemporal Hamiltonian engineering, we demonstrate dynamical confinement-deconfinement transitions, revealing string fragmentation and symmetry restoration during quenches. We track scattering processes with single-site resolution across a range of parameter regimes. Utilizing a double quench protocol, we observe dynamical freeze-out: upon quenching the Hamiltonian after scattering, despite the injection of an extensive energy, the system evolution -- in terms of both low-order correlations and entanglement -- freezes, effectively stabilizing a highly correlated equilibrium state -- a situation that reminisces that of collisions between heavy ions. Our work establishes a high-resolution approach for probing non-perturbative gauge dynamics, opening alternative pathways toward studying far-from-equilibrium phenomena in high-energy physics.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the Variation of the QCD Interaction Scale $\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07266v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Laboratory and astrophysical tests of ''constant variation'' have so far concentrated on the dimensionless fine-structure constant $\alpha$ and on the electron or quark mass ratios $X_{e,q}=m_{e,q}/\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}$, treating the QCD scale $\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}$ as unchangeable. Certain beyond Standard Model frameworks, most notably those with a dark matter or dark energy scalar field $\phi$ coupling with the gluon field, would make $\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}$ itself time dependent while leaving $\alpha$ and the electron mass untouched. Under the minimal assumption that this gluonic channel is the sole $\phi$ interaction, we recast state-of-the-art atomic clock comparisons into $\dot{\Lambda}_{\text{QCD}}/\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}=(3.2 \pm 3.5) \times 10^{-17} \ \text{yr}^{-1}$ limits, translate the isotope yields of the 1.8-Gyr-old Oklo natural reactor into a complementary geophysical limit of $|\delta\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}/\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}|&lt;2\times10^{-9}$ over that time span, corresponding to the linear drift limit $|\dot{\Lambda}_{\text{QCD}}/\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}|&lt;1\times10^{-18} \text{yr}^{-1}$, and show that the proposed $8.4$ eV $^{229}$Th nuclear clock would amplify a putative $\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}$ drift by four orders of magnitude compared with present atomic clocks. We also obtain constraints from quasar absorption spectra and Big Bang Nucleosynthesis data.</description>

      <title>Trapping of Single Atoms in Metasurface Optical Tweezer Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05321v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical tweezer arrays have emerged as a key experimental platform for quantum computation, quantum simulation, and quantum metrology, enabling unprecedented levels of control over single atoms and molecules. However, existing tweezer platforms have fundamental limitations in array geometry, size, and scalability. Here we demonstrate the trapping of single strontium atoms in optical tweezer arrays generated via holographic metasurfaces. We realize two dimensional arrays with more than 1000 trapped atoms, arranged in arbitrary geometries with trap spacings as small as 1.5 um. The arrays have a high uniformity in terms of trap depth, trap frequency, and positional accuracy, rivaling or surpassing existing approaches. This is enabled by highly efficient holographic metasurfaces fabricated from high-refractive index materials, silicon-rich silicon nitride and titanium dioxide. Leveraging sub-micrometer pixel sizes and high pixel densities, our platform allows scaling far beyond current capabilities. As a demonstration, we realize an optical tweezer array with 360,000 traps. These advances will facilitate tweezer-array based quantum applications that require large system sizes.</description>

      <title>Ferromagnetic Traps for Quasi-Continuous Operation of Optical Nanofiber Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20734v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A soft ferromagnetic plate uniformizes Tesla-level fields generated by attached permanent magnets, producing a smooth and electronically tunable surface field on the opposite side. By arranging $n$ precisely fabricated rectangular plates, a nearly ideal magnetic quadrupole field with a substantial gradient can be created at center. This robust and rapidly tunable field configuration is well suited for two-dimensional magneto-optical trapping (2D-MOT) and magnetic guiding of cold atoms. By aligning an optical nanofiber (ONF) along the zero-field line of a planar 2D-MOT in a 2-plate assembly, we demonstrate quasi-continuous, field-free operation of the quantum optical interface without switching off the magnetic field. Transient transmission spectroscopy with nanosecond laser pulses is performed on the $^{87}$Rb D2 line at a measurement repetition rate as high as 250 kHz. The observed line broadening, while not yet fully understood, is partially attributed to residual magnetic fields in the $n=2$ assembly. Through additional measurements and simulations, we verify that these residual fields can be fully eliminated in an $n=4$ assembly, resulting in an ultra-straight 2D trap that supports uniform light-atom interaction over exceptionally long, field-free distances. We extend our discussion to $n=6$, $n=8$ designs with similar uniformity but multiple zero-field lines. With its strong gradient for magnetic trapping, the ferromagnetic devices also enable new quantum optical scenarios featuring interactions between co-guided atoms and photons at ONF interfaces.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian Approach for Strong Field QED Tests with He-like Ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04423v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Detailed comparisons between theory and experiment for quantum electrodynamics (QED) effects in He-like ions have been performed in the literature to search for hints of new physics. Different frequentist statistical analyses of the existing atomic transition energy data have shown contradictory conclusions as to the presence of possible deviations from the theory predictions. We present here an approach using Bayesian statistics which allows to assign quantitative probabilities to the different deviation models from theory for He-like ions for $Z = 5$ to 92. Potential deviations beyond the standard model or higher order QED effects are modeled with $f(Z) \propto Z^k$ functions. Considering the currently available data, no significant difference between theory and experiment is found, and we show that recent experiments have reduced the possible deviations previously observed in the literature. Using past measurements and a weighted average on the different deviation models, we indicate the accuracy required for future measurements to investigated possible divergences.</description>

      <title>Relativistic corrections of order $m\alpha^6$: singular operators and regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16645v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The finite operators are derived for the nonrecoil (leading order in the $(m/M)$ expansion) relativistic corrections in hydrogen-like atoms and ions at orders $m\alpha^6$ in the two- and three-body formalism beyond the adiabatic approximation. Singular operators that appear in the derivation are analysed, and various regularization methods are discussed.</description>
