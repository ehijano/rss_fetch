      <title>On matrix Lax representations and constructions of Miura-type transformations for differential-difference equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is part of a research project on relations between differential-difference matrix Lax representations (MLRs) with the action of gauge transformations and discrete Miura-type transformations (MTs) for (nonlinear) integrable differential-difference equations.
  The paper addresses the following problem:
  when and how can one eliminate some shifts of dependent variables from the discrete (difference) part of an MLR by means of gauge transformations?
  Using results on this problem, we present applications to constructing new MLRs and new integrable equations connected by new MTs to known equations.
  In particular, we obtain results of this kind for equations connected to the following ones:
  - The two-component Belov--Chaltikian lattice.
  - The equation (introduced by G. Mari Beffa and Jing Ping Wang) which describes the evolution induced on invariants by an invariant evolution of planar polygons.
  - An equation from [S. Igonin, arXiv:2405.08579] related to the Toda lattice in the Flaschka--Manakov coordinates.</description>

      <title>On the maximal superintegrability of strongly isochronous Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study strongly isochronous Hamiltonians that generate periodic time evolution with the same basic period for a dense set of initial values. We explain that all such Hamiltonians are maximally superintegrable, and show that if the system is subjected to Hamiltonian reduction based on a compact symmetry group and certain conditions are met, then the reduced Hamiltonian is strongly isochronous with the original basic period. We utilize these simple observations for demonstrating the maximal superintegrability of rational spin Calogero--Moser type models in confining harmonic potential.</description>

      <title>Korteweg de-Vries Dynamics at the Edge of Laughlin State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we show that the edge dynamics of the Laughlin state in the weakly nonlinear regime is governed by the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation. Our starting point is the Chern-Simons-Ginzburg-Landau theory in the lower half-plane, where the effective edge dynamics are encoded in anomaly-compatible boundary conditions. The saddle point bulk dynamics and the corresponding boundary conditions of this action can be reformulated as two-dimensional compressible fluid dynamic equations, subject to a quantum Hall constraint that links the superfluid vorticity to its density fluctuations. The boundary conditions in this hydrodynamic framework consist of no-penetration and no-stress conditions. We then apply the method of multiple scales to this hydrodynamic system and derive the KdV equation for the edge dynamics in the weakly nonlinear regime. By employing the Hamiltonian framework for the KdV equation, we show that we can recover the chiral Luttinger liquid theory in the linearized regime and provide a pathway for canonically quantizing the edge dynamics in the weakly non-linear limit.</description>

      <title>Integrable Matrix Probabilistic Diffusions and the Matrix Stochastic Heat Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a matrix version of the stochastic heat equation, the MSHE, and obtain its explicit invariant measure in spatial dimension $D=1$. We show that it is classically integrable in the weak-noise regime, in terms of the matrix extension of the imaginary-time $1D$ nonlinear Schrodinger equation which allows us to study its short-time large deviations through inverse scattering. The MSHE can be viewed as a continuum limit of the matrix log Gamma polymer on the square lattice introduced recently. We also show classical integrability of that discrete model, as well as of other extensions such as of the semi-discrete matrix O'Connell-Yor polymer and the matrix strict-weak polymer. For all these models, we obtain the Lax pairs of their weak-noise regime, as well as the invariant measure, using a fluctuation--dissipation transformation on the dynamical action.</description>

      <title>Geometrically constrained sine-Gordon field: BPS solitons and their collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09767v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider an enlarged $(1+1)$-dimensional model with two real scalar fields, $\phi$ and $\chi$ whose scalar potential $V(\phi,\chi)$ has a standard $\chi^4$ sector and a sine-Gordon one for $\phi$. These fields are coupled through a generalizing function $f(\chi)$ that appears in the scalar potential and controls the nontrivial dynamics of $\phi$. We minimize the effective energy via the implementation of the BPS technique. We then obtain the Bogomol'nyi bound for the energy and the first-order equations whose solutions saturate that bound. We solve these equations for a nontrivial $f(\chi)$. As the result, BPS kinks with internal structures emerge. They exhibit a two-kink profile. i.e. an effect due to geometrical constrictions. We consider the linear stability of these new configurations. In this sense, we study the existence of internal modes that play an important role during the scattering process. We then investigate the kink-antikink collisions, and present the numerical results for the most interesting cases. We also comment about their most relevant features.</description>
