      <title>Light-induced nonlinear Edelstein effect under ferroaxial ordering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferroaxial ordering, a spontaneous rotational distortion of the atomic arrangement, brings about a cross-product-type spin--orbit coupling (SOC) manifested as an electric toroidal dipole. We propose the light-induced nonlinear Edelstein effect (NLEE) -- a second-order optical response in which a static magnetization is induced by a time-dependent electric field -- as a promising probe of ferroaxial ordering. First, we elucidate the relationship between the NLEE tensor and the electric toroidal dipole. By decomposing the polarization modes of light, we find that both the linearly polarized and circularly polarized light couple to the electric toroidal dipole via distinct mechanisms. We then demonstrate the NLEE using a minimal model that incorporates ferroaxial ordering. Our analysis reveals that effective coupling between orbital magnetization and SOC induces spin magnetization. In particular, the spin magnetization is tilted owing to the electric toroidal dipole; the tilt angle reflects the ratio between the ferroaxial-origin SOC and the relativistic SOC.</description>

      <title>Realization of a Chiral Photonic-Crystal Cavity with Broken Time-Reversal Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light-matter interactions in chiral cavities offer a compelling route to manipulate material properties by breaking fundamental symmetries such as time-reversal symmetry. However, only a limited number of chiral cavity implementations exhibiting broken time-reversal symmetry have been demonstrated to date. These typically rely on either the application of strong magnetic fields, circularly polarized Floquet driving, or the hybridization of cavity modes with matter excitations in the ultrastrong coupling regime. Here, we present a one-dimensional terahertz photonic-crystal cavity that exhibits broken time-reversal symmetry. The cavity consists of a high-resistivity silicon wafer sandwiched between lightly n-doped InSb wafers. By exploiting the nonreciprocal response of a terahertz magnetoplasma and the exceptionally low effective mass of electrons in InSb, we demonstrate a circularly polarized cavity mode at 0.67 THz under a modest magnetic field of 0.3 T, with a quality factor exceeding 50. Temperature-, magnetic field-, and polarization-dependent measurements, supported by simulations, confirm the realization of a chiral cavity with broken time-reversal symmetry. This platform offers a robust and accessible approach for exploring chiral light--matter interactions and vacuum dressed quantum condensed matter in the terahertz regime.</description>

      <title>Terahertz amplification by injection locking of waveguide resonant tunneling diode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High power and low phase noise oscillators at terahertz frequencies are required for several burgeoning scientific and technological applications, including radioastronomy, imaging, molecular spectroscopy, radar, and wireless communications. Operating at terahertz oscillation frequencies presents unique challenges based on the method of generation. Electronic oscillators can produce ample power but suffer from relatively high phase noise due to the nonlinear multiplication of microwave sources. Meanwhile, photomixing of optical sources provides superior spectral purity but low usable power, due to the limited bandwidth of the photomixer. We propose a hybrid solution involving injection locking of an electronic oscillator, a resonant tunneling diode, by a low phase noise photomixed source, a dual-wavelength Brillouin laser. In this study, we demonstrate a proof-of-concept injection-locking amplifier at 260 GHz, achieving up to 40 dB gain for nanowatt-level input signals. For the first time, we characterize the residual phase noise of an injection-locked waveguide RTD, showing quantitative consistency with theoretical predictions based on detailed analysis of its free-running noise. This architecture has the potential to scale to frequencies of 1 THz and beyond, which would provide a clear path to realize a terahertz oscillator with high power and low phase noise.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Gradient Index Fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gradient index (GRIN) fibers are used to improve the design of many fiber optic devices. However, the properties of the GRIN fiber must be determined to optimally engineer a device which incorporates GRIN fiber components. The index of refraction of most GRIN fibers varies quadratically in the radial direction, where the quadratic coefficient is characterized by the gradient index constant $g$. We measured $g$ for Thorlabs GIF50C GRIN fiber at both $780~\mathrm{nm}$ and $1550~\mathrm{nm}$ using equipment which is commonly available in an optics laboratory. This measurement was achieve by profiling the beam exiting various lengths of GRIN fiber. A custom-built beam profiler was used, which enabled the beam position to be referenced with respect to the facet of the GRIN fiber. We report a gradient index constant of $0.0057~\mathrm{\mu m}^{-1} \pm 0.0001~\mathrm{\mu m}^{-1}$ at $780~\mathrm{nm}$ and $0.0055~\mathrm{\mu m}^{-1} \pm 0.0001~\mathrm{\mu m}^{-1}$ at $1550~\mathrm{nm}$. These results are in close agreement with previously reported gradient index constant measurements made for different wavelengths.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast optically induced tunneling in narrow metallic gaps from the time dependent density functional perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, using the time-dependent density functional theory, we address the electron tunneling triggered by short (single-cycle and several-cycle) optical pulses in narrow metallic gaps under conditions relevant for actual experiments. We identify photon-assisted tunneling with one-photon, two-photon, and higher-order photon absorption, and we discuss the effect of the tunneling barrier, applied bias, and strength of the optical field on transition from photon-assisted tunneling (weak optical fields) to the optical field emission at strong optical fields. The numerical single-electron calculations and an analytical strong-field theory model are used to gain deeper insights into the results of the time-dependent density functional theory calculations. Additionally, our parameter-free calculations allow us to retrieve and explain recent experimental results on optically induced transport in narrow metallic gaps.</description>

      <title>Fermat's Spiral-Based Characterization of Squeezed Nonlinear Motional States of Levitated Nanoparticle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling the state of motion of optically levitated nanoparticles is crucial for the advancement of precision sensing, fundamental tests of physics, and the development of hybrid classical-quantum technologies. Experimentally, such control can be achieved by pulsed modifications of the optical potential confining the nanoparticle. Most frequently, the applied potential pulses are parabolic in nanoparticle position, and they expand/squeeze or displace the initial Gaussian state of motion to a modified Gaussian state. The time-dependent mean values and covariance matrix of the phase-space variables can fully characterize such a state. However, quasi-parabolic optical potentials with added weak Duffing-type nonlinearity, encountered in real-world experiments, can generally distort the state of motion to a non-Gaussian one, for which the description based solely on the mean values and covariance matrix fails. Here, we introduce a nonlinear transformation of the phase-space coordinates using the concept of Fermat's spiral, which effectively removes the state distortion induced by the Duffing-type nonlinearity and enables characterization of the state of motion by the standard Gaussian-state metrics. Comparisons of the experimental data with theoretical models show that the proposed coordinate transformation can recover the ideal behavior of a harmonic oscillator even after extended evolution of the system in the nonlinear potential. The presented scheme enables the separation of the effects of the applied state manipulation, the system's gradual thermalization, and the nonlinearity of the confinement on the experimentally observed dynamics of the system, thereby facilitating the design of advanced protocols for levitated optomechanics.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Matching of Phase and Amplitude for Spontaneous Parametric Down-conversion in Semiconductor Waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a non-uniform modulation of $\chi^{(2)}_{xyz}$ to significantly enhance photon pair generation efficiency via spontaneous parametric down-conversion in modal phase-matched semiconductor waveguides. This approach enables amplitude-matching in the transverse direction while preserving the phase-matching along the waveguide propagation axis. Our analysis predicts a tenfold efficiency increase in comparison to the most efficient non-modulated waveguide, and up to 13 orders of magnitude efficiency enhancements relative to solely phase-matched waveguides. Furthermore, we explore the implementation of a highly efficient compact twin-photon source, tunable across the communication band, using an amplitude- and phase-matched structure.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Cavity from Tunable Coupling between Anapole and Fabry-Perot Resonance or Anti-resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enhancing light-matter interactions depends critically on the ability to tailor photonic modes at subwavelength scales, and combining distinct resonant modes has shown remarkable potential unattainable by individual resonances alone. Despite recent advances in anapole metasurfaces for energy confinement and Fabry-Perot (FP) cavities for spectral control, their synergistic coupling and resulting opportunities remain largely unexplored due to challenges such as precise nanoscale assembly. Here, we demonstrate that embedding a terahertz (THz) anapole metasurface within a tunable FP cavity results in a hybrid cavity that demonstrates exotic properties as the anapole transitions between coupling to FP resonances and anti-resonances via cavity-length tuning. At room temperature, we observe ultrastrong coupling (&gt; 30% of the anapole frequency) between anapoles and FP resonances, generating tunable-dispersion polaritons that blend favorable properties of both modes. Meanwhile, anapole spectrally aligns with FP anti-resonances, leading to weak coupling that narrows the linewidth of the anapole's transmission peak by two orders of magnitude and enhances its local density of states (LDOS) near the metasurface correspondingly. With exceptional capabilities including formation of polaritons and significant enhancement of LDOS, the hybrid cavity enables strong interaction with functional materials, paving the way for exploration of quantum optics, molecular sensing, and ultrafast nonlinear photonics.</description>

      <title>Computational electro-optic frequency comb spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computational techniques have gained significant traction in photonics, enabling the co-design of hardware and data processing algorithms to drastically simplify optical system architectures and improve their performance. However, their application in optical frequency comb spectroscopy remains considerably underexplored. In this work, we introduce a non-interferometric approach to frequency comb spectroscopy based on dynamically tailored electro-optic modulation. The core of our method is a reconfigurable electro-optic comb generator capable of producing a sequence of known comb spectra to interrogate a spectroscopic sample. Instead of recording spectrally resolved or interferometric data, our system captures a set of integrated optical power measurements--one per probe comb--from which the sample's spectral response is computationally reconstructed by solving an inverse problem. We present the theoretical foundations of this method, assess its limitations, and validate it through numerical simulations. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate the experimental reconstruction of several spectral signatures, including a molecular absorption line at 1545 nm. For these results, we use numerically computed spectra and experimentally measured power values, all acquired within 10 milliseconds. Finally, we discuss potential extensions and improvements of the method, as well as its integration into chip-scale spectroscopic systems.</description>

      <title>Localized In-Plane Cavity Optomechanics in MEMS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study demonstrates the realization of localized in-plane optomechanical microcavities embedded within an electrostatic MEMS architecture. The system consists of a curved, clamped-clamped microbeam, fabricated on a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafer. A green laser emitted from a Laser Doppler Vibrometer (LDV), is directed perpendicularly onto the device under a vacuum pressure of 7 mTorr, with the beam aligned to fill the gap between the movable microbeam and its adjacent side fixed mirror. This configuration forms localized cavity optomechanical resonators that enable the generation of optomechanical soliton frequency combs through phonon lasing without electrical excitation. The optomechanical resonators' dynamics are examined through experiments and numerical simulations. First, the experimental findings unveil that in electrostatic MEMS structures, the two reflective electrodes positioned to form a capacitive gap can inadvertently form localized cavities. These cavities significantly affect optical readouts, as the photodetected signal encodes contributions from both Doppler-shifted electromagnetic waves and light scattered from the intracavity optical field. This dual contributions can distort mechanical response interpretation unless appropriately filtered. Second, experiments show that optical pumping at various positions along the microbeam induces periodic pulse trains with distinct free spectral ranges (FSRs), each corresponding to different mechanical modes. Our results present the generation of solitary optical wavepackets using in-plane localized Fabry-P\'erot microcavities formed within a MEMS device. The results suggest a path toward chip-scale, soliton frequency combs generators featuring frequency spacing on the order of kilohertz, without relying on integrated fiber optics.</description>

      <title>Emergent momentum-space topological pseudospin defects in non-Hermitian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological defects are central to modern physics, from spintronics to photonics, due to their robustness and potential application in information processing. In this work, we discuss topological point defects that spontaneously emerge at the imaginary Fermi arcs (degeneracy lines) in momentum space of two-dimensional systems described by non-Hermitian effective Hamiltonians. In particular, we consider a generic non-Hermitian Dirac model and a phenomenological model describing hybrid light-matter quasiparticles - exciton polaritons hosted in an optical microcavity. In both cases, the eigenenergies of the system have both real and imaginary parts and form two distinct bands corresponding to two (pseudo-)spin states. We describe the trajectories of the point defects characterized by integer-valued topological winding (vorticity) analytically and show that the defects with opposite vorticity annihilate with each other in the fully gapped phases, but are protected from annihilation by the non-Hermitian spectral degeneracies (exceptional and hybrid points) in the gapless phases. We also suggest that the signatures of these defects can be experimentally measured in an exciton-polariton system.</description>

      <title>Intensified optical camera with Timepix4 readout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the first characterization results of an optical time-stamping camera based on the Timepix4 chip coupled to a fully depleted optical silicon sensor and fast image intensifier, enabling sub-nanosecond scale, time-resolved imaging for single photons. The system achieves an RMS time resolution of 0.27 ns in direct detection mode without the intensifier and from 0.55 to 1.4 ns in the single-photon regime with intensifier for different amplitude-based signal selections. This shows that Timepix4 provides a significant improvement over previous Timepix3-based cameras in terms of timing precision, pixel count, and data throughput. We analyze key factors that affect performance, including sensor bias and time-walk, and demonstrate effective correction methods to recover high temporal accuracy. The camera temporal resolution, event-driven readout and high rate capability make it a scalable platform for a wide range of applications, including quantum optics, ultrafast imaging, and time-correlated photon counting experiments.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Stain Mapping in X-ray Virtual Histology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Virtual histology is an emerging field in biomedicine that enables three-dimensional tissue visualization using X-ray micro-computed tomography. However, the method still lacks the specificity of conventional histology, in which parts of the tissue are selectively highlighted using targeted stains. Though some first X-ray stains have been developed to address this issue, their precise location and quantity inside the tissue volume remain largely unknown. In this work, we present a novel approach to virtual histology that simultaneously captures electron number density and X-ray attenuation values through modulation-based X-ray imaging with a structured phase modulator. These complementary measurements enable decomposition of tissue volumes into basis materials, which allows the extraction of three-dimensional maps of molar contrast agent distribution alongside morphological details on the micrometer scale -- here demonstrated on murine kidneys. The concentration values are validated against the established method of K-edge subtraction imaging. We also create a direct bridge from X-ray to visible light imaging by detecting the same stain both using classical histology and our proposed X-ray approach. Our methodology opens new possibilities for biomedical research into disease progression by providing quantitative three-dimensional stain mapping across entire tissue volumes alongside high-contrast morphology, enabling deeper insights into disease mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Multi-color XFEL pulses with variable color separation and time delay for multi-frame diffraction imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) of high brightness have opened new opportunities for exploring ultrafast dynamical processes in matter, enabling imaging and movies of single molecules and particles at atomic resolution. In this paper, we present a straightforward method for multi-frame diffraction imaging, using the same electron beam to generate four-color XFEL pulses with adjustable wavelength separation and time delay. The optical klystron scheme is introduced to enhance FEL intensity and reduce the total length of undulators. The time delay is tuned via a magnetic chicane between the undulators with various colors. Using parameters of SHINE, start-to-end simulations demonstrate the effectiveness and tunability of our method, achieving representative results such as time delays of hundreds of femtoseconds and four-color XFEL pulses spanning 1.8 to 2.7 nm with 0.3 nm intervals. The proposed scheme enables the recording of multi-frame diffraction images in a single exposure, providing a new perspective for ultrafast molecular and atomic dynamics studies.</description>

      <title>Ghost Imaging with Free Electron-Photon Pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coincidence imaging, also known as ghost imaging, is a technique that exploits correlations between two particles to reconstruct information about a specimen. The particle that relays the spatial information about the object remains completely non-interacting, while the particle used to probe the object is not spatially resolved. While ghost imaging has been primarily implemented on photonic platforms, it becomes particularly intriguing when applied to particles with fundamentally different properties, such as massive, charged electrons and massless, neutral photons, especially considering the role of both particles as cornerstones of highly advanced microscopic platforms. In this work, we investigate coincidence imaging using electron-cathodoluminescence photon pairs generated within a transmission electron microscope. Utilizing a custom-built free-space cathodoluminescence setup, we demonstrate ghost imaging of complex patterns. We are able to obtain a spatial resolution down to 2 $\mu$m, paving the way for adaptation of quantum-enhanced imaging techniques from photonic quantum optics to electron microscopy.</description>

      <title>Dark Photon Oscillations in Waveguide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark photons, which can kinetically mix with ordinary photons, represent the simplest extension to the standard model. Detecting their oscillations with visible photons could provide crucial insights into the nature of dark matter and fundamental interactions beyond the standard model. We propose a novel laboratory-based approach to detect dark photon oscillations using a laser in an Optical Time-domain Relectometry (OTDR) setup. The laser light propagating through the optical fiber undergoes oscillations with the dark photon, leading to measurable changes in the power flow. These oscillations can precisely measured,
  leveraging its high sensitivity and efficiency in detecting small variations in the optical signal. This approach could provide a new avenue for probing dark photon oscillations in the laboratory and greatly improve the current experimental sensitivity to dark photon in a wide mass range.</description>

      <title>Zero Indirect Band Gap in Non-Hermitian Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Zero indirect gaps in band models are typically viewed as unstable and achievable only through fine-tuning. Recent works, however, have revealed robust semimetallic phases in Hermitian systems where the indirect gap remains pinned at zero over a finite parameter range. Here, we extend this paradigm to non-Hermitian lattice models by studying a one-dimensional diamond-like system with gain and loss. We show that a zero indirect band gap can remain stable against non-Hermitian perturbations and identify the regimes where this robustness persists. Remarkably, we find that the zero indirect gap induces a suppression of the non-Hermitian skin effect distinct from other physical mechanics already discussed in the literature. Our results reveal new connections between indirect gaps, exceptional points and non-Hermitian skin effect, opening avenues for experimental realizations.</description>

      <title>Topological Control of Chirality and Spin with Structured Light</title>

Abstract: Structured light beams with engineered topological properties offer a powerful means to control spin angular momentum (SAM) and optical chirality, key quantities shaped by spin-orbit interaction (SOI) in light. Such effects are typically regarded as emerging only through light-matter interactions. Here, we show that higher-order Poincar\'e modes, carrying a tunable Pancharatnam topological charge $\ell_p$, enable precise control of SOI purely from the intrinsic topology of the light field, without requiring any material interface. In doing so, we reveal a free-space paraxial optical Hall effect, where modulation of $\ell_p$ drives spatial separation of circular polarization states - a direct signature of SOI in a regime previously thought immune to such behaviour. Our analysis identifies two propagation-induced topological mechanisms underlying this effect: differential Gouy phase shifts between orthogonal components, and radial divergence of the beam envelope. These results overturn the common view that spin-orbit effects in free space require non-paraxial conditions, and establish a broadly tunable route to generating and controlling chirality and SAM without tight focusing. This approach provides new opportunities for optical manipulation, chiral sensing, and high-dimensional photonic information processing.</description>

      <title>Topological Localisation in Time from PT Symmetry</title>

Abstract: Time has entered the domain of topological phases in the field of non-Hermitian physics. Previous studies have relied on periodic modulation in time to make an intuitive connection to established spatial topological invariants, albeit with energy and momentum exchanged. This connection has revealed the potential for topological interface states along the time axis, analogous to those in spatial models. In this work, we uncover a theoretical framework describing such topological interface states along the time axis, with no underlying connection to spatial models nor need for periodic driving. This new framework uncovers that this phenomenon -- the robust localisation of waves at an interface -- appears in every system that has parity-time symmetry and two levels or bands, regardless of its spatial dimensionality. The topological nature of this localisation is understood by the identification of certain topological phases that are specific to parity-time symmetric models of two levels. Our results set out the first approach to identifying topological effects intrinsically linked to time and showcase the universal nature of such effects.</description>

      <title>Attosecond Optical Orientation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03116v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Circularly polarized light offers opportunities to probe symmetry-dependent properties of matter such as chirality and spin. Circular dichroism measurements typically require further intrinsic or extrinsic breaking of symmetry by e.g. enantiomeric excess, orientation, magnetic fields or direction-sensitive detectors. Here we introduce circular-dichroic attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy by leveraging the angular momentum of two circular-polarized pulses, both pump and probe, in an isotropic medium, optically orienting the angular momentum of excited states on an attosecond timescale. We investigate a circular-dichroic measurement of the attosecond transient absorption of He Rydberg states. By limiting the allowed pathways via dipole selection rules for co- and counter-rotating circular polarized NIR and XUV pulses, different spectral reshapings of the XUV transient absorption due to the AC Stark effect are observed. Paired with time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation calculations, the results show the role of selection and propensity rules and open up new opportunities to study coupling pathways of excited states as well as spin-dependent dynamics in atoms and beyond via attosecond optical orientation.</description>
