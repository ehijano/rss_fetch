      <title>On Belyi's Theorem in positive characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.02595</link>
      <description>arXiv:1811.02595v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The famous theorem of Belyi can be viewed as a characterization of compact Riemann surfaces which admit a non-empty open subset uniformized by a subgroup of $SL_2(\mathbb{Z})$ of finite index. I show that if $q\geq 5$, then ${\bf F}_q(T)$ is the one and only function field of positive characteristic for which such an analogous characterization of rigid analytic spaces of dimension one can exist and that Drinfel$'$d modular curves provide examples of rigid analytic spaces of this type.</description>

      <title>Pluricanonical cycles and tropical covers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.14034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.14034v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extract a system of numerical invariants from logarithmic intersection theory on pluricanonical double ramification cycles, and show that these invariants exhibit a number of properties that are enjoyed by double Hurwitz numbers. Among their properties are (i) the numbers can be efficiently calculated by counts of tropical curves with a modified balancing condition, (ii) they are piecewise polynomial in the entries of the ramification vector, and (iii) they are matrix elements of operators on the Fock space. The numbers are extracted from the logarithmic double ramification cycle, which is a lift of the standard double ramification cycle to a blowup of the moduli space of curves. The blowup is determined by tropical geometry. We show that the traditional double Hurwitz numbers are intersections of the refined cycle with the cohomology class of a piecewise polynomial function on the tropical moduli space of curves. This perspective then admits a natural, combinatorially motivated, generalization to the pluricanonical setting. Tropical correspondence results for the new invariants lead immediately to the structural results for these numbers.</description>

      <title>Liftability and vanishing theorems for Fano threefolds in positive characteristic II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04764v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In our series of papers, we prove that smooth Fano threefolds in positive characteristic lift to the ring of Witt vectors. Moreover, we show that they satisfy Akizuki-Nakano vanishing, $E_1$-degeneration of the Hodge to de Rham spectral sequence, and torsion-freeness of Crystalline cohomologies. In this paper, we establish these results except when $|-K_X|$ is very ample and the Picard group is generated by $\omega_X$. To this end, we show that an arbitrary smooth Fano threefold is quasi-$F$-split when the Picard number or the Fano index is larger than one.</description>

      <title>Jets-separation thresholds, Seshadri constants and higher Gauss-Wahl maps on abelian varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20769v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a closed subscheme $Z$ of a polarized abelian variety $(A,\ell)$ we define its vanishing threshold with respect to $\ell$ and relate it to the Seshadri constant of the ideal defining $Z.$ As a particular case, we introduce the notion of jets-separation thresholds, which naturally arise as the vanishing threshold of the $p$-infinitesimal neighborhood of a point. Afterwards, by means of Fourier-Mukai methods we relate the jets-separation thresholds with the surjectivity of certain higher Gauss-Wahl maps. As a consequence we obtain a criterion for the surjectivity of those maps in terms of the Seshadri constant of the polarization $\ell.$</description>

Abstract: We explore computational tools that allow to compute the class on the Grothendieck ring of varieties of finite cyclic quotients in some interesting examples. As an main application, we determine the motive of low rank representation varieties associated with torus knots and general linear groups using an equivariant analogue of the strategy for special linear groups due to A.Gonz\'alez-Prieto and V.Mu\~noz.</description>

      <title>On Poincar\'e polynomials for plane curves with quasi-homogeneous singularities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08436v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define a combinatorial object that can be associated with any conic-line arrangement with ordinary singularities, which we call the combinatorial Poincar\'e polynomial. We prove a Terao-type factorization statement on the splitting of such a polynomial over the rationals under the assumption that our conic-line arrangements are free and admit ordinary quasi-homogeneous singularities. Then we focus on the so-called $d$-arrangements in the plane. In particular, we provide a combinatorial constraint for free $d$-arrangements admitting ordinary quasi-homogeneous singularities.</description>

      <title>Algebraic and Positive Geometry of the Universe: from Particles to Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13582v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, the intersection of algebra, geometry, and combinatorics with particle physics and cosmology has led to significant advances. Central to this progress is the twofold formulation of the study of particle interactions and observables in the universe: on the one hand, Feynman's approach reduces to the study of intricate integrals; on the other hand, one encounters the study of positive geometries. This article introduces key developments, mathematical tools, and the connections that drive progress at the frontier between algebraic geometry, the theory of $D$-modules, combinatorics, and physics. All these threads contribute to shaping the flourishing field of positive geometry, which aims to establish a unifying mathematical language for describing phenomena in cosmology and particle physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.13913v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider finite graphs whose vertexes are supersingular elliptic curves, possibly with level structure, and edges are isogenies. They can be applied to the study of modular forms and to isogeny based cryptography. The main result of this paper is an upper bound on the modules of the eigenvalues of their adjacency matrices, which in particular implies that these graphs are Ramanujan. We also study the asymptotic distribution of the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrices, the number of connected components, the automorphisms of the graphs, and the connection between the graphs and modular forms.</description>

      <title>Numerical characterizations for integral dependence of graded ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09346v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $R=\oplus_{m\geq 0}R_m$ be a standard graded equidimensional ring over a field $R_0$, and $I\subseteq J$ be two non-nilpotent graded ideals in $R$. Then we give a set of numerical characterizations of the integral dependence of $I$ and $J$ in terms of certain multiplicities. A novelty of this approach is that it does not involve localization and only requires checking computable and well-studied invariants.
  In particular, we show the following: let $S=R[y]$, $\mathsf{I} = IS$ and $\mathsf{J} = JS$ and $\bf d$ be the maximum of the generating degrees of both $I$ and $J$. Let $c&gt;{\bf d}$ be any given integer. Then $$\overline{I} = \overline{J}\iff e\big(S[\mathsf{I}t]_{\Delta_{(c,1)}}\big) = e\big(S[\mathsf{J}t]_{\Delta_{(c,1)}}\big),$$ where $e\big(S[\mathsf{I}t]_{\Delta_{(c,1)}}\big)$ denotes the Hilbert-Samuel multiplicity of the standard graded domain $S[\mathsf{I}t]_{\Delta_{(c,1)}} = \oplus_{n\geq 0}(\mathsf{I}^n)_{cn}t^n$. Further, if $I$ is of finite colength in $R$ then $e\big(S[\mathsf{I}t]_{\Delta_{(c,1)}}\big) = c^de(R) - e(I,R)$.
  If $R$ is also a domain, then other numerical criteria are the following: \begin{align*} \overline{I} = \overline{J} &amp; \iff \varepsilon(I)=\varepsilon(J)\;\;\mbox{and}\;\; e_i(R[It]) = e_i(R[Jt])\;\;\mbox{for all}\;\; 0\leq i &lt;\dim(R/I), \end{align*} where $\varepsilon(I)$ denotes the epsilon multiplicity of $I$, and $e_i(R[It])$'s are the mixed multiplicities of the Rees algebra $R[It]$. The relation between $e_i(S[\mathsf{I}t])$ and the polar multiplicities of $\mathsf{I}_{\geq {\bf d}}$ provides another criterion in terms of polar multiplicities of $\mathsf{I}_{\geq {\bf d}}$.
  The first two characterizations generalize Rees's classical result for ideals of finite colengths. Apart from several well-established results, the proofs of these results use the theory of density functions, which was developed in arXiv:2311.17679.</description>

      <title>Generalization of semi-regular sequences: Maximal Gr\"{o}bner basis degree, variants of genericness, and related conjectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23211v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nowadays, the notion of semi-regular sequences, originally proposed by Fr\"oberg, becomes very important not only in Mathematics, but also in Information Science, in particular Cryptology. For example, it is highly expected that randomly generated polynomials form a semi-regular sequence, and based on this observation, secure cryptosystems based on polynomial systems can be devised. In this paper, we deal with a semi-regular sequence and its extension, named a generalized cryptographic semi-regular sequence, and give precise analysis on the complexity of computing a Gr\"obner basis of the ideal generated by such a sequence with help of several regularities of the ideal related to Lazard's bound on maximal Gr\"{o}bner basis degree and other bounds. We also study the genericness of the property that a sequence is semi-regular, and its variants related to Fr\"oberg's conjecture. Moreover, we discuss on the genericness of another important property that the initial ideal is weakly reverse lexicographic, related to Moreno-Soc\'{i}as' conjecture, and show some criteria to examine whether both Fr\"oberg's conjecture and Moreno-Soc\'{i}as' one hold at the same time.</description>

      <title>An Infinite Family of Artin-Schreier Curves with Minimal a-number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11201v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $p$ be an odd prime and $k$ be an algebraically closed field with characteristic $p$. Booher and Cais showed that the $a$-number of a $\mathbb Z/p \mathbb Z$-Galois cover of curves $\phi: Y \to X$ must be greater than a lower bound determined by the ramification of $\phi$. In this paper, we provide evidence that the lower bound is optimal by finding examples of Artin-Schreier curves that have $a$-number equal to its lower bound for all $p$. Furthermore we use formal patching to generate infinite families of Artin-Schreier curves with $a$-number equal to the lower bound in any characteristic.</description>
