      <title>Enhancing Cross-Prompt Transferability in Vision-Language Models through Contextual Injection of Target Tokens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) seamlessly integrate visual and textual data to perform tasks such as image classification, caption generation, and visual question answering. However, adversarial images often struggle to deceive all prompts effectively in the context of cross-prompt migration attacks, as the probability distribution of the tokens in these images tends to favor the semantics of the original image rather than the target tokens. To address this challenge, we propose a Contextual-Injection Attack (CIA) that employs gradient-based perturbation to inject target tokens into both visual and textual contexts, thereby improving the probability distribution of the target tokens. By shifting the contextual semantics towards the target tokens instead of the original image semantics, CIA enhances the cross-prompt transferability of adversarial images.Extensive experiments on the BLIP2, InstructBLIP, and LLaVA models show that CIA outperforms existing methods in cross-prompt transferability, demonstrating its potential for more effective adversarial strategies in VLMs.</description>

      <title>Convex-hull Estimation using XPSNR for Versatile Video Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As adaptive streaming becomes crucial for delivering high-quality video content across diverse network conditions, accurate metrics to assess perceptual quality are essential. This paper explores using the eXtended Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (XPSNR) metric as an alternative to the popular Video Multimethod Assessment Fusion (VMAF) metric for determining optimized bitrate-resolution pairs in the context of Versatile Video Coding (VVC). Our study is rooted in the observation that XPSNR shows a superior correlation with subjective quality scores for VVC-coded Ultra-High Definition (UHD) content compared to VMAF. We predict the average XPSNR of VVC-coded bitstreams using spatiotemporal complexity features of the video and the target encoding configuration and then determine the convex-hull online. On average, the proposed convex-hull using XPSNR (VEXUS) achieves an overall quality improvement of 5.84 dB PSNR and 0.62 dB XPSNR while maintaining the same bitrate, compared to the default UHD encoding using the VVenC encoder, accompanied by an encoding time reduction of 44.43% and a decoding time reduction of 65.46%. This shift towards XPSNR as a guiding metric shall enhance the effectiveness of adaptive streaming algorithms, ensuring an optimal balance between bitrate efficiency and perceptual fidelity with advanced video coding standards.</description>

      <title>Towards Holistic Language-video Representation: the language model-enhanced MSR-Video to Text Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A more robust and holistic language-video representation is the key to pushing video understanding forward. Despite the improvement in training strategies, the quality of the language-video dataset is less attention to. The current plain and simple text descriptions and the visual-only focus for the language-video tasks result in a limited capacity in real-world natural language video retrieval tasks where queries are much more complex. This paper introduces a method to automatically enhance video-language datasets, making them more modality and context-aware for more sophisticated representation learning needs, hence helping all downstream tasks. Our multifaceted video captioning method captures entities, actions, speech transcripts, aesthetics, and emotional cues, providing detailed and correlating information from the text side to the video side for training. We also develop an agent-like strategy using language models to generate high-quality, factual textual descriptions, reducing human intervention and enabling scalability. The method's effectiveness in improving language-video representation is evaluated through text-video retrieval using the MSR-VTT dataset and several multi-modal retrieval models.</description>

      <title>Integration of Policy and Reputation based Trust Mechanisms in e-Commerce Industry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The e-commerce systems are being tackled from commerce behavior and internet technologies. Therefore, trust aspect between buyer-seller transactions is a potential element which needs to be addressed in competitive e-commerce industry. The e-commerce industry is currently handling two different trust approaches. First approach consists on centralized mechanism where digital credentials/set of rules assembled, called Policy based trust mechanisms . Second approach consists on decentralized trust mechanisms where reputation, points assembled and shared, called Reputation based trust mechanisms. The difference between reputation and policy based trust mechanism will be analyzed and recommendations would be proposed to increase trust between buyer and seller in e-commerce industry. The integration of trust mechanism is proposed through mapping process, strength of one mechanism with the weakness of other. The proposed model for integrated mechanism will be presented and illustrated how the proposed model will be used in real world e-commerce industry.</description>

      <title>Reinforcing Pre-trained Models Using Counterfactual Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel framework to reinforce classification models using language-guided generated counterfactual images. Deep learning classification models are often trained using datasets that mirror real-world scenarios. In this training process, because learning is based solely on correlations with labels, there is a risk that models may learn spurious relationships, such as an overreliance on features not central to the subject, like background elements in images. However, due to the black-box nature of the decision-making process in deep learning models, identifying and addressing these vulnerabilities has been particularly challenging. We introduce a novel framework for reinforcing the classification models, which consists of a two-stage process. First, we identify model weaknesses by testing the model using the counterfactual image dataset, which is generated by perturbed image captions. Subsequently, we employ the counterfactual images as an augmented dataset to fine-tune and reinforce the classification model. Through extensive experiments on several classification models across various datasets, we revealed that fine-tuning with a small set of counterfactual images effectively strengthens the model.</description>

      <title>Straight Through Gumbel Softmax Estimator based Bimodal Neural Architecture Search for Audio-Visual Deepfake Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deepfakes are a major security risk for biometric authentication. This technology creates realistic fake videos that can impersonate real people, fooling systems that rely on facial features and voice patterns for identification. Existing multimodal deepfake detectors rely on conventional fusion methods, such as majority rule and ensemble voting, which often struggle to adapt to changing data characteristics and complex patterns. In this paper, we introduce the Straight-through Gumbel-Softmax (STGS) framework, offering a comprehensive approach to search multimodal fusion model architectures. Using a two-level search approach, the framework optimizes the network architecture, parameters, and performance. Initially, crucial features were efficiently identified from backbone networks, whereas within the cell structure, a weighted fusion operation integrated information from various sources. An architecture that maximizes the classification performance is derived by varying parameters such as temperature and sampling time. The experimental results on the FakeAVCeleb and SWAN-DF datasets demonstrated an impressive AUC value 94.4\% achieved with minimal model parameters.</description>

      <title>PetalView: Fine-grained Location and Orientation Extraction of Street-view Images via Cross-view Local Search with Supplementary Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Satellite-based street-view information extraction by cross-view matching refers to a task that extracts the location and orientation information of a given street-view image query by using one or multiple geo-referenced satellite images. Recent work has initiated a new research direction to find accurate information within a local area covered by one satellite image centered at a location prior (e.g., from GPS). It can be used as a standalone solution or complementary step following a large-scale search with multiple satellite candidates. However, these existing works require an accurate initial orientation (angle) prior (e.g., from IMU) and/or do not efficiently search through all possible poses. To allow efficient search and to give accurate prediction regardless of the existence or the accuracy of the angle prior, we present PetalView extractors with multi-scale search. The PetalView extractors give semantically meaningful features that are equivalent across two drastically different views, and the multi-scale search strategy efficiently inspects the satellite image from coarse to fine granularity to provide sub-meter and sub-degree precision extraction. Moreover, when an angle prior is given, we propose a learnable prior angle mixer to utilize this information. Our method obtains the best performance on the VIGOR dataset and successfully improves the performance on KITTI dataset test 1 set with the recall within 1 meter (r@1m) for location estimation to 68.88% and recall within 1 degree (r@1d) 21.10% when no angle prior is available, and with angle prior achieves stable estimations at r@1m and r@1d above 70% and 21%, up to a 40-degree noise level.</description>

      <title>GenAI-Bench: Evaluating and Improving Compositional Text-to-Visual Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While text-to-visual models now produce photo-realistic images and videos, they struggle with compositional text prompts involving attributes, relationships, and higher-order reasoning such as logic and comparison. In this work, we conduct an extensive human study on GenAI-Bench to evaluate the performance of leading image and video generation models in various aspects of compositional text-to-visual generation. We also compare automated evaluation metrics against our collected human ratings and find that VQAScore -- a metric measuring the likelihood that a VQA model views an image as accurately depicting the prompt -- significantly outperforms previous metrics such as CLIPScore. In addition, VQAScore can improve generation in a black-box manner (without finetuning) via simply ranking a few (3 to 9) candidate images. Ranking by VQAScore is 2x to 3x more effective than other scoring methods like PickScore, HPSv2, and ImageReward at improving human alignment ratings for DALL-E 3 and Stable Diffusion, especially on compositional prompts that require advanced visio-linguistic reasoning. We will release a new GenAI-Rank benchmark with over 40,000 human ratings to evaluate scoring metrics on ranking images generated from the same prompt. Lastly, we discuss promising areas for improvement in VQAScore, such as addressing fine-grained visual details. We will release all human ratings (over 80,000) to facilitate scientific benchmarking of both generative models and automated metrics.</description>

      <title>PIN: A Knowledge-Intensive Dataset for Paired and Interleaved Multimodal Documents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have leveraged extensive multimodal datasets to enhance capabilities in complex knowledge-driven tasks. However, persistent challenges in perceptual and reasoning errors limit their efficacy, particularly in interpreting intricate visual data and deducing multimodal relationships. Addressing these issues, we introduce a novel dataset format, PIN (Paired and INterleaved multimodal documents), designed to significantly improve both the depth and breadth of multimodal training. The PIN format is built on three foundational principles: knowledge intensity, scalability, and support for diverse training modalities. This innovative format combines markdown files and comprehensive images to enrich training data with a dense knowledge structure and versatile training strategies. We present PIN-14M, an open-source dataset comprising 14 million samples derived from a diverse range of Chinese and English sources, tailored to include complex web and scientific content. This dataset is constructed meticulously to ensure data quality and ethical integrity, aiming to facilitate advanced training strategies and improve model robustness against common multimodal training pitfalls. Our initial results, forming the basis of this technical report, suggest significant potential for the PIN format in refining LMM performance, with plans for future expansions and detailed evaluations of its impact on model capabilities.</description>

      <title>Towards Event-oriented Long Video Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid development of video Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), numerous benchmarks have been proposed to assess their video understanding capability. However, due to the lack of rich events in the videos, these datasets may suffer from the short-cut bias that the answers can be deduced from a few frames, without the need to watch the entire video. To address this issue, we introduce Event-Bench, an event-oriented long video understanding benchmark built on existing datasets and human annotations. Event-Bench includes six event-related tasks and 2,190 test instances to comprehensively evaluate video event understanding ability. Additionally, we propose Video Instruction Merging~(VIM), a cost-effective method that enhances video MLLMs using merged, event-intensive video instructions, addressing the scarcity of human-annotated, event-intensive data. Extensive experiments show that the best-performing model, GPT-4o, achieves an overall accuracy of 53.33, significantly outperforming the best open-source model by 41.42%. Leveraging an effective instruction synthesis method and an adaptive model architecture, VIM surpasses both state-of-the-art open-source models and GPT-4V on the Event-Bench. All code, data, and models are publicly available at https://github.com/RUCAIBox/Event-Bench.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Stream Fusion Approach with One-Class Learning for Audio-Visual Deepfake Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of developing a robust audio-visual deepfake detection model. In practical use cases, new generation algorithms are continually emerging, and these algorithms are not encountered during the development of detection methods. This calls for the generalization ability of the method. Additionally, to ensure the credibility of detection methods, it is beneficial for the model to interpret which cues from the video indicate it is fake. Motivated by these considerations, we then propose a multi-stream fusion approach with one-class learning as a representation-level regularization technique. We study the generalization problem of audio-visual deepfake detection by creating a new benchmark by extending and re-splitting the existing FakeAVCeleb dataset. The benchmark contains four categories of fake video(Real Audio-Fake Visual, Fake Audio-Fake Visual, Fake Audio-Real Visual, and unsynchronized video). The experimental results show that our approach improves the model's detection of unseen attacks by an average of 7.31% across four test sets, compared to the baseline model. Additionally, our proposed framework offers interpretability, indicating which modality the model identifies as fake.</description>

      <title>MMBench-Video: A Long-Form Multi-Shot Benchmark for Holistic Video Understanding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advent of large vision-language models (LVLMs) has spurred research into their applications in multi-modal contexts, particularly in video understanding. Traditional VideoQA benchmarks, despite providing quantitative metrics, often fail to encompass the full spectrum of video content and inadequately assess models' temporal comprehension. To address these limitations, we introduce MMBench-Video, a quantitative benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate LVLMs' proficiency in video understanding. MMBench-Video incorporates lengthy videos from YouTube and employs free-form questions, mirroring practical use cases. The benchmark is meticulously crafted to probe the models' temporal reasoning skills, with all questions human-annotated according to a carefully constructed ability taxonomy. We employ GPT-4 for automated assessment, demonstrating superior accuracy and robustness over earlier LLM-based evaluations. Utilizing MMBench-Video, we have conducted comprehensive evaluations that include both proprietary and open-source LVLMs for images and videos. MMBench-Video stands as a valuable resource for the research community, facilitating improved evaluation of LVLMs and catalyzing progress in the field of video understanding. The evalutation code of MMBench-Video will be integrated into VLMEvalKit: https://github.com/open-compass/VLMEvalKit.</description>

Abstract: With the significant advancements of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), the development of image-text multimodal models has garnered widespread attention. Current surveys on image-text multimodal models mainly focus on representative models or application domains, but lack a review on how general technical models influence the development of domain-specific models, which is crucial for domain researchers. Based on this, this paper first reviews the technological evolution of image-text multimodal models, from early explorations of feature space to visual language encoding structures, and then to the latest large model architectures. Next, from the perspective of technological evolution, we explain how the development of general image-text multimodal technologies promotes the progress of multimodal technologies in the biomedical field, as well as the importance and complexity of specific datasets in the biomedical domain. Then, centered on the tasks of image-text multimodal models, we analyze their common components and challenges. After that, we summarize the architecture, components, and data of general image-text multimodal models, and introduce the applications and improvements of image-text multimodal models in the biomedical field. Finally, we categorize the challenges faced in the development and application of general models into external factors and intrinsic factors, further refining them into 2 external factors and 5 intrinsic factors, and propose targeted solutions, providing guidance for future research directions.

      <title>AdaMesh: Personalized Facial Expressions and Head Poses for Adaptive Speech-Driven 3D Facial Animation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07236v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Speech-driven 3D facial animation aims at generating facial movements that are synchronized with the driving speech, which has been widely explored recently. Existing works mostly neglect the person-specific talking style in generation, including facial expression and head pose styles. Several works intend to capture the personalities by fine-tuning modules. However, limited training data leads to the lack of vividness. In this work, we propose AdaMesh, a novel adaptive speech-driven facial animation approach, which learns the personalized talking style from a reference video of about 10 seconds and generates vivid facial expressions and head poses. Specifically, we propose mixture-of-low-rank adaptation (MoLoRA) to fine-tune the expression adapter, which efficiently captures the facial expression style. For the personalized pose style, we propose a pose adapter by building a discrete pose prior and retrieving the appropriate style embedding with a semantic-aware pose style matrix without fine-tuning. Extensive experimental results show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, preserves the talking style in the reference video, and generates vivid facial animation. The supplementary video and code will be available at https://adamesh.github.io.</description>

      <title>EquiAV: Leveraging Equivariance for Audio-Visual Contrastive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09502v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in self-supervised audio-visual representation learning have demonstrated its potential to capture rich and comprehensive representations. However, despite the advantages of data augmentation verified in many learning methods, audio-visual learning has struggled to fully harness these benefits, as augmentations can easily disrupt the correspondence between input pairs. To address this limitation, we introduce EquiAV, a novel framework that leverages equivariance for audio-visual contrastive learning. Our approach begins with extending equivariance to audio-visual learning, facilitated by a shared attention-based transformation predictor. It enables the aggregation of features from diverse augmentations into a representative embedding, providing robust supervision. Notably, this is achieved with minimal computational overhead. Extensive ablation studies and qualitative results verify the effectiveness of our method. EquiAV outperforms previous works across various audio-visual benchmarks. The code is available on https://github.com/JongSuk1/EquiAV.</description>
