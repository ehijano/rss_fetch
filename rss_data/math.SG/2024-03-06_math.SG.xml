      <title>Reduction of Cosymplectic Groupoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a well-known fact in Poisson geometry that reduction commutes with integration (of the associated integrable Lie algebroid). This is also valid for other types of geometries given by 2-dimensional closed forms. In this manuscript we extend this type of result to the particular case of cosymplectic groupoids, obtaining in particular the reduction of a central extension defined by a 2-IM form and a 1-IM form.</description>

      <title>Baker-Bowler theory for Lagrangian Grassmannians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Baker and Bowler (2019) showed that the Grassmannian can be defined over a tract, a ring-like structure generalizing both partial fields and hyperfields. This notion unifies theories for matroids over partial fields, valuated matroids, and oriented matroids. We extend Baker-Bowler theory for the Lagrangian Grassmannian which is the set of maximal isotropic subspaces of a $2n$-dimensional symplectic vector space. By Boege et al. (2019), the Lagrangian Grassmannian is parameterized into the projective space of dimension $2^{n-2}(4+\binom{n}{2})-1$ and its image is exactly the solutions of quadrics induced by determinantal identities of principal and almost-principal minors of a symmetric matrix. From the idea that the strong basis exchange axiom of matroids captures the combinatorial essence of the Pl\"{u}cker relations, we define matroid-like objects, called antisymmetric matroids, from the quadrics for the Lagrangian Grassmannian. We also provide its cryptomorphic definition in terms of circuits capturing the orthogonality and maximality of vectors in a Lagrangian subspace. We define antisymmetric matroids over tracts in two equivalent ways, which generalize both Baker-Bolwer theory and the parameterization of the Lagrangian Grassmannian. It provides a new perspective on the Lagrangian Grassmannian over hyperfields, especially, the tropical Lagrangian Grassmannian. Our proof involves a homotopy theorem for graphs associated with antisymmetric matroids, generalizing Maurer's homotopy theorem for matroids. We also prove that if a point in the projective space satisfies $3$-/$4$-term quadrics for the Lagrangian Grassmannian and its supports form the bases of an antisymmetric matroid, then it satisfies all quadrics, which is motivated by the earlier work of Tutte (1958) for matroids and linear spaces.</description>

      <title>Equivariant automorphisms of the Cox construction and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present paper, we give a complete description of the group of holomorphic automorphisms of the Cox construction of a simplicial fan equivariant with respect to a large enough connected complex Lie subgroup of the large torus acting on the Cox construction. We then apply this description to find the groups of holomorphic automorphisms of rational moment-angle manifolds, including Calabi--Eckmann manifolds and Hopf manifolds. We also calculate the groups of equivariant automorphisms of complete simplicial toric varieties. This paper is the first in a series of two papers dedicated to studying the automorphism groups of toric stacks with applications to complex geometry.</description>

      <title>Euler characteristics of linear symplectic quotients and $\operatorname{O}(2)$-spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give explicit computations of the $\Gamma$-Euler characteristic of several families of orbit space definable translation groupoids. These include the translation groupoids associated to finite-dimensional linear representations of the circle and real and unitary representations of the real $2\times 2$ orthogonal group. In the case of translation groupoids associated to linear symplectic quotients of representations of a arbitrary compact Lie group $G$, we show that unlike the other cases, the $\Gamma$-Euler characteristic depends only on the group and not on the representation.</description>

Abstract: To any open subset of a cotangent bundle, Tamarkin has associated a certain quotient of a category of sheaves. Here we show that the Hochschild cohomology of this category agrees with filtered symplectic cohomology.</description>

      <title>Symplectic monodromy at radius zero and equimultiplicity of $\mu$-constant families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.07007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.07007v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that every family of isolated hypersurface singularity with constant Milnor number has constant multiplicity. To achieve this, we endow the A'Campo model of "radius zero" monodromy with a symplectic structure. This new approach allows to generalize a spectral sequence of McLean converging to fixed point Floer homology of iterates of the monodromy to a more general setting which is well suited to study $\mu$-constant families.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.00601v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Williamson's normal form is well known for symmetric positive-definite linear automorphisms on a symplectic vector space. In this paper, we consider when two symmetric positive-definite linear automorphisms on a symplectic vector space can simultaneously admit a normal form under a common symplectic linear automorphism.</description>

      <title>Cluster deep loci and mirror symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16970v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Affine cluster varieties are covered up to codimension 2 by open algebraic tori. We put forth a general conjecture (based on earlier conversation between Vivek Shende and the last author) characterizing their deep locus, i.e. the complement of all cluster charts, as the locus of points with non-trivial stabilizer under the action of cluster automorphisms. We use the diagrammatics of Demazure weaves to verify the conjecture for skew-symmetric cluster varieties of finite cluster type with arbitrary choice of frozens and for the top open positroid strata of Grassmannians $\mathrm{Gr}(2,n)$ and $\mathrm{Gr}(3,n)$. We illustrate how this already has applications in symplectic topology and mirror symmetry, by proving that the Fukaya category of Grassmannians $\mathrm{Gr}(2,2n+1)$ is split-generated by finitely many Lagrangian tori, and homological mirror symmetry holds with a Landau--Ginzburg model proposed by Rietsch. Finally, we study the geometry of the deep locus, and find that it can be singular and have several irreducible components of different dimensions, but they all are again cluster varieties in our examples in really full rank cases.</description>
