      <title>Giant and Oscillatory Junction Magnetoresistance via RKKY-like Spin Coupling in Spin-Gapless Mn$_2$CoAl/SiO$_2$/p-Si Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here, we report spin-selective transport and exceptionally large positive junction magnetoresistance (JMR) in sputter-deposited Mn$_2$CoAl/native-SiO$_2$/p-Si heterostructures. Highly ordered inverse-Heusler Mn$_2$CoAl thin films with near-ideal XA chemical ordering ($S \approx 0.97$) and a Curie temperature of $\sim \SI{590}{\kelvin}$ are realized using a magnetron sputtering process. The spin-gapless semiconducting nature of Mn$_2$CoAl is experimentally supported by a weakly temperature-dependent resistivity with a very small negative temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR $\approx -4.2 \times 10^{-9}$~$\si{\ohm\meter\per\kelvin}$) and a nonsaturating linear magnetoresistance over a wide range of magnetic fields and temperatures.
  A giant positive JMR of $\sim \SI{825}{\percent}$ at \SI{10}{\kelvin} and $\sim \SI{134}{\percent}$ at room temperature is observed despite the presence of only a single ferromagnetic electrode. Systematic variation of the SiO$_2$ tunnel barrier thickness reveals a reproducible oscillatory sign reversal of the JMR accompanied by a monotonic decay in magnitude. This behavior reflects thickness-dependent modulation of spin-selective tunneling mediated by phase-coherent interfacial carriers and can be described phenomenologically by an RKKY-like functional form without invoking conventional metallic exchange interactions. These results identify Mn$_2$CoAl/native-SiO$_2$/p-Si heterostructures as robust and scalable platforms for room-temperature spin-selective transport, with potential applications in semiconductor-compatible spin filters, magnetic field sensors, and reconfigurable spintronic logic elements.</description>

      <title>Interacting electrons in silicon quantum interconnects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coherent interconnects between gate-defined silicon quantum processing units are essential for scalable quantum computation and long-range entanglement. We argue that one-dimensional electron channels formed in the silicon quantum well of a Si/SiGe heterostructure exhibit strong Coulomb interactions and realize strongly interacting Luttinger liquid physics. At low electron densities, the system enters a Wigner regime characterized by dominant 4kF correlations; increasing the electron density leads to a crossover from the Wigner regime to a Friedel regime with dominant 2kF correlations. We support these results through large-scale density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations of the interacting ground state under both screened and unscreened Coulomb potentials. We propose experimental signatures of the Wigner-Friedel crossover via charge transport and charge sensing in both zero- and high-magnetic field limits. We also analyze the impact of short-range correlated disorder - including random alloy fluctuations and valley splitting variations - and identify that the Wigner-Friedel crossover remains robust until disorder levels of about 400 micro eV. Finally, we show that the Wigner regime enables long-range capacitive coupling between quantum dots across the interconnect, suggesting a route to create long-range entanglement between solid-state qubits. Our results position silicon interconnects as a platform for studying Luttinger liquid physics and for enabling architectures supporting nonlocal quantum error correction and quantum simulation.</description>

      <title>Magnetic switching of exciton lifetime in CrSBr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exciton dynamics in layered magnetic semiconductors provide a sensitive probe of the interplay between spin order and light-matter interaction. Here, we study thin CrSBr layers using time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy in an external magnetic field, revealing a step-like reduction in the exciton lifetime from 11 to 7 ps, during the magnetization flip from the antiferromagnetic to the ferromagnetic phase. The reduction of the exciton lifetime in the ferromagnetic phase persists below the N\'eel temperature, as evidenced by its strong magnetic-field dependence that disappears in the paramagnetic phase. Ab initio calculations reveal a one-dimensional nature of free excitons accompanied by a pronounced change in the oscillator strength across the magnetic phase transition predicting a shorter radiative lifetime of free excitons in the antiferromagnetic phase of CrSBr contradicting the experimental observations. This discrepancy is explained by strong localization of excitons at low tempature. We show both experimentally and theoretically that the observed magnetic switching of the exciton lifetime is attributed to a larger exciton localization volume leading to a larger oscillator strength in the ferromagnetic phase. The results show that disorder-induced localization effects play a key role in exciton dynamics in CrSBr.</description>

      <title>Multi-resonant non-dispersive infrared gas sensing: breaking the selectivity and sensitivity tradeoff</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In applications such as atmospheric monitoring of greenhouse gases and pollutants, the detection and identification of trace concentrations of harmful gases is commonly achieved using non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) sensors. These devices employ a broadband infrared emitter, thermopile detector, and a spectrally selective bandpass filter tuned to the vibrational resonance of the target analyte. However, the fabrication of these filters is costly and limited to a single frequency. This limitation introduces a fundamental tradeoff, as broadening the optical passband width enhances sensitivity but compromises selectivity, whereas narrowing improves selectivity at the expense of sensitivity. In this work, we validate a filterless NDIR approach using a multi-peak thermal emitter developed through inverse design. This emitter enhances detection sensitivity by targeting multiple absorption bands, demonstrated through the creation of a sensor designed for the C-H vibrational modes of propane. Additionally, a set of single-peak emitters were developed to showcase the capability of designing highly selective sensors operating within close spectral proximity. These emitters, targeting the stretching modes of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, exhibit Q-factors above 50 and minimal crosstalk, enabling accurate detection of the target gas without interference from gases with spectrally adjacent absorption bands. This is enabled by the implementation of an aperiodic distributed Bragg reflectors, which allows for higher Q-factors with fewer layers than a periodic Bragg reflector using the same materials and number of layers, thereby reducing fabrication complexity and cost. Experimental results validate that this approach breaks the tradeoff between sensitivity and selectivity. This work highlights the potential of optimized thermal emitters for more efficient and compact gas sensing applications.</description>

      <title>Observation of Unconventional Ferroelectricity in Non-Moir'\e Graphene on Hexagonal Boron Nitride Boundaries and Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interfacial interactions in two parallel-stacked hexagonal boron-nitride (hBN) layers facilitate sliding ferroelectricity, enabling novel device functionalities. Additionally, when Bernal or twisted bilayer graphene is aligned with an hBN layer, unconventional ferroelectric behavior was observed, though its precise origin remains unclear. Here, we propose an alternative approach to engineering such an unconventional ferroelectricity in graphene-hBN van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures by creating specific types of hBN boundaries and interfaces. We found that the unconventional ferroelectricity can occur--without the alignments at graphene-hBN or hBN-hBN interfaces--when there are hBN edges or interfaces with line defects. By systematically analyzing the gate dependence of mobile and localized charges, we identified key characteristics of localized states that underlie the observed unconventional ferroelectricity, informing future studies. These findings highlight the complexity of the interfacial interactions in graphene/hBN systems, and demonstrate the potential for defect engineering in vdW heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Topological Superconductivity in Altermagnetic Heterostructures on a Honeycomb Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnet-superconductor heterostructures have been shown, in principle, to provide a route towards realising topological superconductivity, and therefore host topologically protected boundary states. In this work we demonstrate that the topological states observed are dependent on the structure of the underlying lattice. By deriving and analysing a model on a honeycomb lattice, we demonstrate that the topological phase diagram has a rich structure containing both chiral edge modes and Majorana corner modes, the latter of which are an indication of higher-order topology. We analyse the effect of disorder on these states and find that whilst the edge modes are robust to a disordered system, any potential observation of the corner modes may be sensitive to the microscopic details. In particular, we show that vacancies can lead to other low energy bound states that may be difficult to distinguish from the corner modes.</description>

      <title>Quantized heat flow in the Hofstadter butterfly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When subjected to a strong magnetic field, electrons on a two-dimensional lattice acquire a fractal energy spectrum called Hofstadter's butterfly. In addition to its unique recursive structure, the Hofstadter butterfly is intimately linked to non-trivial topological orders, hosting a cascade of ground states characterized by non-zero topological invariants. These states, called Chern insulators, are usually understood as replicas of the ground states of the quantum Hall effect, with electrical and thermal conductances that should be quantized, reflecting their topological order. The Hofstadter butterfly is now commonly observed in van-der-Waals heterostructures-based moir\'e superlattices. However, its thermal properties, particularly the quantized heat flow expected in the Chern insulators, have not been investigated, potentially questioning their similarity with standard quantum Hall states. Here we probe the heat transport properties of the Hofstadter butterfly, obtained in a graphene~/~hexagonal boron nitride moir\'e superlattice. We observe a quantized heat flow, uniquely set by the topological invariant, for all investigated states of the Hofstadter butterfly: quantum Hall states, Chern insulators, and even symmetry-broken Chern insulators emerging from strong electronic interactions. Our work firmly establishes the universality of the quantization of heat transport and its intimate link with topology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.05726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the scattering of a three-dimensional massless Dirac particle through a domain wall separating two regions with identical energy spectra but distinct Berry curvature dipoles. We demonstrate that the quantum geometric mismatch induces partial reflection and transmission despite identical incident and refracted momenta. These results highlight the role of engineered quantum geometric interfaces as key tools to control Dirac particle scattering.</description>

      <title>Transport characteristics in Hermitian and non-Hermitian Fibonacci rings: A comparative study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an extensive theoretical analysis of transport and circular currents and the associated induced magnetic fields in Fibonacci rings, explored in both Hermitian and non-Hermitian descriptions, with particular attention to configurations preserving or breaking PT symmetry. By engineering physically balanced gain and loss following a Fibonacci sequence, we realize two distinct geometrical configurations in which the ring either preserve or explicitly break PT symmetry, and further explore complementary realizations obtained by reversing the signs of the on site potentials. Using the non equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) formalism, we analyze transmission properties and bond current densities to quantify both transport and circulating currents. A comparison with the Hermitian limit establishes a clear baseline, where the ring supports only weak responses upon introducing disorder. In sharp contrast, non-Hermiticity leads to a pronounced amplification of transport and circular currents, and hence of the induced magnetic field. We further demonstrate that non-Hermitian transport is highly sensitive to gain and loss sign reversal and, in the non-PT-symmetric case, exhibits an unconventional dependence on system size governed by the parity of the Fibonacci sequence and hopping correlations. Remarkably, the current does not decay monotonically with increasing system size, revealing a distinct scaling behavior absent in conventional Hermitian systems. Our results highlight non-Hermitian quasiperiodic rings as versatile platforms for engineering and amplifying current driven magnetic responses through symmetry, topology, and gain-loss design.</description>

      <title>Phonon-induced Markovian and non-Markovian effects on absorption spectra of moir\'e excitons in twisted transition metal dichalcogenide bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The properties of moir\'e excitons in twisted bilayers of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) vary significantly with the twist angle, ranging from quasi localized excitons with flat dispersions for small twist angles to delocalized excitons for larger ones. This twist angle dependence directly impacts the exciton-phonon coupling, which plays a significant role for the optical properties of these materials. In this work we theoretically investigate the twist angle dependent influence of phonons on absorption spectra of intralayer moir\'e excitons in a twisted TMDC hetero-bilayer. For the lowest-lying intralayer moir\'e exciton we find that the exciton-phonon coupling interpolates between two physically distinct regimes when tuning the twist angle. At small twist angles non-Markovian polarization dynamics and phonon sidebands dominate the properties of absorption spectra for localized excitons. For larger twist angles Markovian processes become more important leading to additional line broadening. Furthermore, the absorption spectra here show a characteristic asymmetric peak similar to monolayer TMDCs. When taking into account multiple bright moir\'e exciton bands we find that intraband scattering due to optical phonons has a significant impact on absorption spectra, effectively suppressing absorption peaks of higher lying bands when their bandwidth surpasses the optical phonon energy.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear mode interactions under parametric excitation in a YIG microdisk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A pair of quantized spin-wave modes is driven by two-tone parallel pumping in a YIG microdisk. The nonlinear dynamics is experimentally investigated by probing the resulting steady state, which is found to critically depend on the chosen pair of modes, the detuning between the pump frequencies and the modes parametric resonance, as well as the temporal sequence of the two rf tones. A general theory of parametric excitation in confined structures based on magnetization normal modes is developed and quantitatively accounts for the observed dependence and non-commutative behaviors, which emerge from the interplay between the self and mutual nonlinear frequency shifts of the spin-wave modes. Owing to its high degree of external controllability and scalability to larger sets of modes, this dynamical system provides a model platform for exploring nonlinear phenomena and a promising route toward rf driven state mapping relevant to neuromorphic and unconventional computing.</description>

      <title>Gate-tunable charge-spin interconversion in graphene/heavy-metal heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spintronics has emerged as a promising field for next-generation devices, offering functionalities beyond complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS). A critical challenge in spintronics is to develop systems that can efficiently generate spin currents and enable their long-distance transport. Here, we demonstrate a graphene (Gr)/heavy metal (HM) heterostructure system that combines strong charge-spin interconversion efficiency, induced by the spin Hall effect, with a long spin diffusion length. By employing an industry-friendly magnetron sputtering technique, we deposit HM layers onto few-layer Gr while minimizing structural damage. The proximity effect from the HM enhances the spin Hall angle of Gr while limiting the reduction in its spin diffusion length. Additionally, the spin Hall angle can be tuned via an applied gate voltage, offering high controllability of the system. Importantly, these properties are observed across heterostructures composed of different HMs, indicating the generality of this approach. Our findings establish Gr/HM heterostructures as a scalable and versatile platform for spin current generation, paving the way for advanced spintronic devices with high efficiency, long spin propagation, and straightforward fabrication processes.</description>

      <title>High-Energy Interlayer Exciton Ensembles in MoSe$_2$/WSe$_2$ Heterostructures by Laguerre-Gaussian Excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reveal the higher energetic luminescence part of interlayer exciton ensembles in MoSe$_2$/WSe$_2$ heterostructures upon excitation by an optical Laguerre-Gaussian mode. The excitation is achieved with the help of a spatial light modulator giving rise to a ring-shaped distribution of interlayer excitons. A hyperspectral analysis of the exciton photoluminescence suggests that the excitation scheme allows the accumulation of high-energetic excitons in the rings' center. We discuss the mechanisms leading to such a distribution, including exciton-exciton interaction, phase-space filling, and an incomplete thermalization.</description>

      <title>Evolution of the Berry curvature dipole in uniaxially strained bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05962</link>

Abstract: While in pristine bilayer graphene the Berry curvature dipole (BCD), a necessary ingredient for the nonlinear anomalous Hall effect, is zero, uniaxial strain can give rise to finite BCD. We investigate this by using a tight-binding (TB) approach build on the Slater-Koster parameterization to capture lattice deformation effects often missed by continuum models. We demonstrate that the BCD's evolution with strain and doping is highly sensitive to the choice in parameterization, particularly when including the longer range interlayer skew hoppings. Additionally, out-of-plane compression enhances the response by broadening the Dirac cones. These findings benchmark low-energy continuum models and highlight the necessity of realistic tight-binding models for accurately predicting strain-engineered Hall effects in bilayer graphene.</description>

      <title>Mode-Selective Cloaking and Ghost Quantum Wells in Bilayer Graphene Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study ballistic electron transport through electrostatic barriers in AB-stacked bilayer graphene within a full four-band framework. A mode-resolved analysis reveals how propagating and evanescent channels couple across electrostatic interfaces and how channel selectivity governs transport at normal incidence. We show that, even when decoupled channels remain inactive, perfect transmission can occur at discrete energies due to phase matching of a single internal mode within an individual barrier. This effect is interpreted as a ghost quantum well, namely an effective cavity formed by internal phase coherence inside the barrier, without true bound states and without restoring coupling to decoupled channels. For single- and double-barrier geometries, we derive compact analytical expressions for the transmission and identify the corresponding resonance conditions. Extending the analysis to multibarrier structures using a transfer-matrix approach, we demonstrate how perfect resonances driven by internal phase matching coexist with Fabry-Perot-like resonances arising from inter-barrier interference. Our results provide a unified, channel-resolved description of tunnelling suppression and resonance-assisted transport in bilayer graphene barrier systems.</description>

      <title>Structural and magnetic properties of co-sputtered epitaxial Fe-Sn kagome thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years the intermetallic alloys of Fe and Sn have gained significant interest due to a rich variety of magnetic properties present in these materials. The crystal Fe3Sn2 is a frustrated ferromagnet, while the crystallographically similar FeSn, which differs only by the stacking sequence of its Fe-containining kagome and stanene layers, is an antiferromagnet. Thin-film growth techniques such as magnetron sputtering allow for these different stoichiometric compositions to be grown through adjustments of the rate of deposition of the individual Fe and Sn sources, while all other conditions remain constant. Here, we report the production of high quality epitaxial thin films of Fe$_3$Sn$_2$ and FeSn on sapphire with a Pt seed layer, as well as a mixed phase containing intergrowths of both crystals, all of which we have characterized using both X-ray and four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) methods. The resulting crystallographic phase content is compared to the results of magnetization measurements, with correspondence between the predicted ferromagnetic phase content and the resulting magnetization. Further magnetic properties of these films can then also be compared, leading to the discovery of a unique behavior in the temperature dependent coercivity within highly mixed phase alloys, a feature that is absent in either pure Fe3Sn2 and FeSn.</description>

      <title>Hidden time-nonlocal Floquet symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the Floquet spectrum of a detuned, driven two-level system and show that it exhibits exact quasienergy crossings when the detuning is an integer multiple of the energy quantum of the driving field. This behavior can be explained by a hidden time-nonlocal parity, which allows the Floquet modes to be classified as even or odd. Then a generic feature is the emergence of exact crossings between quasienergies of different parity. A constructive proof of the existence of the symmetry is based on a scalar recurrence relation. Moreover, we present a general scheme for its numerical computation, which can be applied to models beyond the two-level system. Analytical results are illustrated with numerical data.</description>

      <title>Thermally Configurable Multi-Order Polar Skyrmions in Multiferroic Oxide Superlattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.05950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polar topological textures in low-dimensional ferroelectrics have emerged as a versatile platform for high-density information storage and neuromorphic computing. While low-order topological states, such as vortices and skyrmions, have been extensively studied, high-order polar topological families remain largely unexplored due to their higher energy requirements and limited stabilization methods. Here, using a BiFeO3 (BFO)-based multiferroic superlattice as a model system, we demonstrate a thermal-modulation strategy that stabilizes multi-order polar skyrmions and enables reversible tuning of their topological order through phase-field simulations. It was found that temperature modulation drives the system from polar solitons through 1{\pi}-, 2{\pi}-, 3{\pi}-, and 4{\pi}-skyrmion states, with closed heating-cooling path analyses revealing the widest thermal stability window for 2{\pi}-skyrmions (up to 600 K). Leveraging this robustness, 2% Sm doping in BFO lowers the transition temperatures, enabling room-temperature stabilization of 2{\pi}-skyrmions. These findings enrich the fundamental understanding of multi-order polar topologies and establish a tunable strategy for realizing variable-order topological configurations in practical memory devices.</description>

      <title>Klein tunneling in deformed honeycomb-dice lattice: from massless to massive particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.10144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2004.10144v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that under compressive uniaxial deformation of the three-band $\alpha-T_3$ lattice, the Dirac cones move toward each other, merge, and a gap opens, while the flat band remains unchanged. Consequently, the low-energy spectrum transitions from linear to quadratic dispersion, indicating the shift from massless to massive Dirac particles. Here, we theoretically investigate the tunneling properties of particles through a sharp $np$ junction in a deformed $\alpha-T_3$ lattice, focusing on the case where the particle energy is half the junction height. We show that this transition from massless to massive particles leads to a change from omnidirectional total transmission, known as super-Klein tunneling, to omnidirectional total reflection, referred to as anti-super-Klein tunneling, in the case of the dice lattice ($\alpha=1$). For all values of $\alpha$, this transition manifests as a change from conventional Klein tunneling to anti-Klein tunneling.</description>

      <title>Topological Signatures of the Optical Bound on Maximal Berry Curvature: Application to Two-Dimensional Time-Reversal Symmetric Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17671v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unlike broken time-reversal symmetric (TRS) systems with a defined Chern number, directly measuring the bulk $Z_{2}$ invariant and Berry curvature (if nonzero) in topological insulators and their higher-order topological families remains an unsolved problem. Here, based on the refined trace-determinant inequality (TDI) involving the trace and determinant of the quantum metric and maximal Berry curvature (MBC), we establish an optical bound on the MBC for two-dimensional TRS insulators. By utilizing experimental data on the optical conductivity within a certain energy range, the topological signatures can be identified through the frequency integration of the optical bound. This is supported by the momentum integration of the refined TDI and its $f$-sum rule and topological extension, which provide a topological lower bound. Meanwhile, the decay of optical weight in the topologically trivial region can be controlled by the optical gap and the inverse mass tensor. We illustrate our approach using three representative topological models: the Kane-Mele model, mirror-protected insulator, and quadrupole insulator. Remarkably, we find that the quantized quantum volume (QV) in the mirror-protected insulator results from the Gauss-Bonnet theorem. Since QV has a topological lower bound, this suggests that double QV can be interpreted as an upper bound on the number of boundary states. Our findings offer a method for extracting the topological signatures of TRS insulators using optical conductivity data.</description>

      <title>Thickness-dependent magnon spin transport in antiferromagnetic insulators: Crossover from quasi-three-dimensional to quasi-two-dimensional regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03941v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent observation of giant room-temperature magnon spin conductivity in an ultrathin ferromagnetic insulator [X.-Y. Wei et al., Nat. Mater. 21, 1352 (2022)], we investigate thickness-dependent magnon spin transport in thin antiferromagnetic insulators (AFIs). We study the prototypical AFI hematite, known for its exceptionally low magnetic damping and two distinct magnetic phases: a low-temperature uniaxial easy-axis phase and a high-temperature biaxial easy-plane phase. Using stochastic micromagnetic simulations, we investigate thickness-dependent magnon spin transport across both magnetic phases. Our results uncover a crossover from quasi-three-dimensional to quasi-two-dimensional magnon spin transport at a critical thickness, determined by the frequency or energy of the excited magnons. Below this critical thickness, we observe a pronounced enhancement in the magnon diffusion length in both magnetic phases. This rise is attributed to a change in the effective magnon density of states, reflecting the reduced phase space available for scattering in the thinner, quasi-two-dimensional regime. Understanding and controlling long-distance magnon spin transport in AFIs is crucial for developing next-generation spintronic nanodevices, especially as materials approach the two-dimensional limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26208v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conventional spin pumping, driven by magnetization dynamics, is longitudinal since the pumped spin current flows normal to the interface between the ferromagnet and the conductor. We predict \textit{Hall-type/transverse} and \textit{unidirectional} spin pumping into conductors by near-field electromagnetic radiation emitted by, \textit{e.g.}, magnetization dynamics. The joint effect of the electric and magnetic fields results in a pure spin current flowing parallel to the interface, i.e., a Hall-type spin pumping, which is highly efficient due to the strong coupling to the electric field. Such a transverse spin current is unidirectional, with the spatial distribution controlled by the magnetization direction. Our finding reveals a robust approach for generating and manipulating spin currents in future low-dimensional spintronic and orbitronic devices.</description>

      <title>Pervasive spin-triplet superconductivity in rhombohedral graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.16578v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic fields typically suppress superconductivity once the Zeeman energy exceeds the pairing gap, unless mechanisms such as unconventional pairing, strong spin-orbit coupling, or intrinsic magnetism intervene. Several graphene platforms realize such mitigating routes, exhibiting superconductivity resilient to magnetic fields. Here we report superconductivity in rhombohedral heptalayer graphene that is both induced and stabilized by in-plane magnetic field ($B_{\parallel}$), with critical fields far beyond the Pauli paramagnetic limit. The superconductivity spans a wide gate range and emerges from a sharp zero-field resistive ridge that tracks approximately constant conduction band filling. The presence of zero-field superconductivity and the evolution of the critical temperature with $B_{\parallel}$ are highly gate sensitive. We also observe a weak superconducting diode effect in several distinct regimes within the superconducting phase, including nearby to an integer quantum anomalous Hall state generated by a boron nitride moir\'e superlattice, indicating a potential coexistence of valley imbalance and superconductivity. These results establish several intriguing new properties of spin-triplet, field-induced superconductivity in a thick rhombohedral graphene stack.</description>

      <title>Effect of hybrid field coupling in nanostructured surfaces on anisotropic signal detection in nanoscale infrared spectroscopic imaging methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.22373v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Anisotropic intensity distributions on nanostructured surfaces and polarization-sensitive spectra have been observed in a number of nanoscale infrared spectroscopic imaging methods, including nano-FTIR [Bakir et al., Molecules, 2020, 25, 4295], photothermal induced resonance (PTIR) [Waeytens et al., Analyst, 2021, 146], tapping AFM-IR [Hondl et al., ACS Meas. Sci. Au, 2025, 5, 469; Luo et al., APL, 2022, 121, 23330], infrared photoinduced force microscopy (PiF-IR) [Anindo et al., JPCC, 2025, 129, 4517; Shcherbakov et al., Rev Methods Primers, 2025, 5, 1; Ali et al., Anal. Chem., 2025, 97, 23914] and peak force infrared microscopy (PFIR) [Xie et al., JPCC, 2022, 126, 8393; Anindo, JPCC, 2025]. A recent work combining modeling and experiment demonstrated that the hybrid field coupling of the IR illumination E0 with a polymer nanosphere and a metallic AFM probe is nearly as strong as the plasmonic coupling in case of a gold nanosphere [Anindo, JPCC, 2025]. For p-polarized illumination, this results in enhanced IR absorption on the surface perpendicular to the propagation of E0 which can explain the observed anisotropic intensity distribution. An additional anisotropy may be introduced by aligned surface molecules with oriented vibrational transition moments [Bakir et al., Molecules, 2020, 25, 4295; Luo, APL, 2022]. PiF-IR is strongly surface sensitive combining an unprecedented spatial resolution &lt; 5 nm with high spectral resolution [Shcherbakov, Rev Methods Primers, 2025; Ali, Anal. Chem., 2025], which allows, for example, to visualize nanoscale chemical variation on the surface of bacteria cells affected by antimicrobial interaction [Ali, Anal. Chem., 2025]. We compare PiF-IR hyperspectra of aligned perylene Langmuir Blodgett monolayers on nanostructured and planar gold substrates and use quantum chemical calculations of the oriented vibrational oscillators to interpret the observations.</description>

      <title>Full counting statistics and first-passage times in quantum Markovian processes: Ensemble relations, metastability, and fluctuation theorems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18614v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a comprehensive framework for characterizing fluctuations in quantum transport and nonequilibrium thermodynamics using two complementary approaches: full counting statistics and first-passage times. Focusing on open quantum systems governed by Markovian Lindblad dynamics, we derive general ensemble relations that connect the two approaches at all times, and we clarify how the steady states reached at long times relate to those reached at large jump counts. In regimes of metastability, long-lived intermediate states cause violations of experimentally testable cumulant relations, as we discuss. We also formulate a fluctuation theorem governing the probability of rare fluctuations in the first-passage time distributions based on results from full counting statistics. Our results apply to general integer-valued trajectory observables that do not necessarily increase monotonically in time. Three illustrative applications, a two-state emitter, a driven qubit, and a variant of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, highlight the physical implications of our results and provide guidelines for practical calculations. Our framework provides a complete picture of first-passage time statistics in Markovian quantum systems, encompassing multiple earlier results, and it has direct implications for current experiments in quantum optics, superconducting circuits, and nanoscale heat engines.</description>

      <title>Initial-State Typicality in Quantum Relaxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01709v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Relaxation in open quantum systems is fundamental to quantum science and technologies. Yet, the influence of the initial state on relaxation remains a central, largely unanswered question. Here, by systematically characterizing the relaxation behavior of generic initial states, we uncover a typicality phenomenon in high-dimensional open quantum systems: relaxation becomes nearly initial-state-independent as system size increases under verifiable conditions. Crucially, we prove this typicality for thermalization processes above a size-independent temperature. Our findings extend the typicality to open quantum dynamics, in turn identifying a class of systems where two widely used quantities -- the Liouvillian gap and the maximal relaxation time -- merit re-examination. We formalize this with two new concepts: the 'typical strong Mpemba effect' and the 'typical relaxation time'. Beyond these conceptual advances, our results provide practical implications: a scalable route to accelerating relaxation and a typical mixing-time benchmark that complements conventional worst-case metrics for quantum simulations and state preparation.</description>
