      <title>Shell Models on Recurrent Sequences: Fibonacci, Padovan and Other Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new class of shell models is proposed, where the shell variables are defined on a recurrent sequence of integer wave-numbers such as the Fibonacci or the Padovan series, or their variations including a sequence made of square roots of Fibonacci numbers rounded to the nearest integer. Considering the simplest model, which involves only local interactions, the interaction coefficients can be generalized in such a way that the inviscid invariants, such as energy and helicity, can be conserved even though there is no exact self-similarity. It is shown that these models basically have identical features with standard shell models, and produce the same power law spectra, similar spectral fluxes and analogous deviation from self-similar scaling of the structure functions implying comparable levels of turbulent intermittency. Such a formulation potentially opens up the possibility of using shell models, or their generalizations along with discretized regular grids, such as those found in direct numerical simulations, either as diagnostic tools, or subgrid models. It also allows to develop models where the wave-number shells can be interpreted as sparsely decimated sets of wave-numbers over an initially regular grid. In addition to conventional shell models with local interactions that result in forward cascade, a particular helical shell model with long range interactions is considered on a similarly recurrent sequence of wave numbers, corresponding to the Fibonacci series, and found to result in the usual inverse cascade.</description>

      <title>Discussing a transition from bounded to unbounded energy in a time-dependent billiard</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit a time-dependent, oval-shaped billiard to investigate a phase transition from bounded to unbounded energy growth. In the static case, the phase space exhibits a mixed structure. The chaotic sea in the static scenario leads to average energy growth for a time-dependent boundary. However, inelastic collisions between the particle and the boundary limit this unbounded energy increase. This transition displays properties similar to continuous phase transitions in statistical mechanics, including scale invariance, interrelated critical exponents governed by scaling laws, and an order parameter/susceptibility approaching zero/infinity at the transition. Furthermore, the system exhibits an elementary excitation that promotes particle diffusion and lacks topological defects that provide modifications to the probability distribution function.</description>

      <title>On the relationship between Koopman operator approximations and neural ordinary differential equations for data-driven time-evolution predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work explores the relationship between state space methods and Koopman operator-based methods for predicting the time-evolution of nonlinear dynamical systems. We demonstrate that extended dynamic mode decomposition with dictionary learning (EDMD-DL), when combined with a state space projection, is equivalent to a neural network representation of the nonlinear discrete-time flow map on the state space. We highlight how this projection step introduces nonlinearity into the evolution equations, enabling significantly improved EDMD-DL predictions. With this projection, EDMD-DL leads to a nonlinear dynamical system on the state space, which can be represented in either discrete or continuous time. This system has a natural structure for neural networks, where the state is first expanded into a high dimensional feature space followed by a linear mapping which represents the discrete-time map or the vector field as a linear combination of these features. Inspired by these observations, we implement several variations of neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and EDMD-DL, developed by combining different aspects of their respective model structures and training procedures. We evaluate these methods using numerical experiments on chaotic dynamics in the Lorenz system and a nine-mode model of turbulent shear flow, showing comparable performance across methods in terms of short-time trajectory prediction, reconstruction of long-time statistics, and prediction of rare events. We also show that these methods provide comparable performance to a non-Markovian approach in terms of prediction of extreme events.</description>

      <title>Separation of periodic orbits in the delay embedded space of chaotic attractors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work explores the intersection of time-delay embeddings, periodic orbit theory, and symbolic dynamics. Time-delay embeddings have been effectively applied to chaotic time series data, offering a principled method to reconstruct relevant information of the full attractor from partial time series observations. In this study, we investigate the structure of the unstable periodic orbits of an attractor using time-delay embeddings. First, we embed time-series data from a periodic orbit into a higher-dimensional space through the construction of a Hankel matrix, formed by arranging time-shifted copies of the data. We then examine the influence of the width and height of the Hankel matrix on the geometry of unstable periodic orbits in the delay-embedded space. The right singular vectors of the Hankel matrix provide a basis for embedding the periodic orbits. We observe that increasing the length of the delay (e.g., the height of the Hankel matrix) leads to a clear separation of the periodic orbits into distinct clusters within the embedded space. Our analysis characterizes these separated clusters and provides a mathematical framework to determine the relative position of individual unstable periodic orbits in the embedded space. Additionally, we present a modified formula to derive the symbolic representation of distinct periodic orbits for a specified sequence length, extending the Poly\'a-Redfield enumeration theorem.</description>

      <title>Solver-in-the-loop approach to turbulence closure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel methodology for modeling the influence of the unresolved scales of turbulence for sub-grid modeling. Our approach employs the differentiable physics paradigm in deep learning, allowing a neural network to interact with the differential equation evolution and performing an a posteriori optimization by incorporating the solver into the training iteration (an approach known as solver-in-the-loop), thus departing from the conventional a priori instantaneous training approach. Our method ensures that the model is exposed to equations-informed input distributions, accounting for prior corrections and often leading to more accurate and stable time evolution. We present results of our methodology applied to a shell model of turbulence, and we discuss further potential applications to Navier-Stokes equations.</description>

      <title>Overcoming stretching and shortening assumptions in Euler-Bernoulli theory using nonlinear Hencky beam models: applicable to partly-shortened and partly-stretched beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21973v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges of the Euler-Bernoulli beam theory regarding shortening and stretching assumptions. Certain boundary conditions, such as a cantilever with a horizontal spring attached to its end, result in beams that partly shorten or stretch, depending on the spring stiffness. The traditional Euler-Bernoulli beam model may not accurately capture the geometrical nonlinearity in these cases. To address this, nonlinear Hencky's beam models are proposed to describe such conditions. The validity of these models is assessed against the nonlinear Euler-Bernoulli model using the Galerkin method, with examples including cantilever and clamped-clamped configurations representing shortened and stretched beams. An analysis of a cantilever with a horizontal spring, where stiffness varies, using the nonlinear Hencky's model, indicates that increasing horizontal stiffness stiffens the system. This analysis reveals a transition from softening to linear behavior to hardening near the second resonance frequency, suggesting a bifurcation point. Despite the computational demands of nonlinear Hencky's models, this study highlights their effectiveness in overcoming the inherent assumptions of stretching and shortening in Euler-Bernoulli beam theory. These models enable a comprehensive nonlinear analysis of partly shortened or stretched beams.</description>

      <title>Revealing Structure and Symmetry of Nonlinearity in Natural and Engineering Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12057v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Energy transfer across scales is fundamental in fluid dynamics, linking large-scale flow motions to small-scale turbulent structures in engineering and natural environments. Triadic interactions among three wave components form complex networks across scales, challenging understanding and model reduction. We introduce Triadic Orthogonal Decomposition (TOD), a method that identifies coherent flow structures optimally capturing spectral momentum transfer, quantifies their coupling and energy exchange in an energy budget bispectrum, and reveals the regions where they interact. TOD distinguishes three components--a momentum recipient, donor, and catalyst--and recovers laws governing pairwise, six-triad, and global triad conservation. Applied to unsteady cylinder wake and wind turbine wake data, TOD reveals networks of triadic interactions with forward and backward energy transfer across frequencies and scales.</description>
