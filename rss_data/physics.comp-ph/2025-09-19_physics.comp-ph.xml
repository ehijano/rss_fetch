      <title>The Varieties of Schelling Model Experience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Schelling model is a prototype for agent-based modeling in social systems. A comprehensive analysis of Schelling model rule variants is achieved by classification of the space of macroscopic outcomes via phase diagrams. Among 54 rule variants, only 3 phase diagram classes are found, characterized by the number of phase transitions. This classification scheme is found to be robust to the use of sociological and percolation-inspired measures of segregation. The statistical and dynamic drivers of these transitions are elucidated by analyzing the roles of vision, movement criteria, vacancies, the initial state, and rivalry. Schelling's original step function dictating satisfaction is found to be pathological at high thresholds, producing coordination failures as satisfactory sites become increasingly rare. This comprehensive classification gives new insight into the drivers of transitions in the Schelling model and creates a basis for studying more complex Schelling-like models.</description>

      <title>Evidential Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Scientific Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the fundamental theory and implementation guidelines underlying Evidential Physics-Informed Neural Network (E-PINN) -- a novel class of uncertainty-aware PINN. It leverages the marginal distribution loss function of evidential deep learning for estimating uncertainty of outputs, and infers unknown parameters of the PDE via a learned posterior distribution. Validating our model on two illustrative case studies -- the 1D Poisson equation with a Gaussian source and the 2D Fisher-KPP equation, we found that E-PINN generated empirical coverage probabilities that were calibrated significantly better than Bayesian PINN and Deep Ensemble methods. To demonstrate real-world applicability, we also present a brief case study on applying E-PINN to analyze clinical glucose-insulin datasets that have featured in medical research on diabetes pathophysiology.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetics of deeply subwavelength metamaterial particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article discusses electromagnetic properties of volumetric metamaterial samples with essentially discrete structure, that is, assembled as a periodic array of electromagnetic resonators. We develop an efficient numerical procedure for calculating quasi-static electromagnetic response precisely to analyse samples containing several million meta-atoms. We demonstrate that, contrary to a common belief, even million-``atoms'' samples with sharp edges are still quite different from uniform (``homogenised'') materials, and their properties are critically sensitive to their shape and boundary structure. We also compare our results with calculations based on the discrete dipole approximation as well as with an integral model for continuous particles, and analyse distinctions and similarities between the different approaches. In particular, discrete metamaterials present themselves as a stringent platform for assessing continuous models developed for finite objects with sharp edges. Overall, the reported results should be important for understanding mesoscopic systems with strongly interacting elements.</description>

      <title>Computational uncertainties in lattice thermal conductivity prediction of crystalline solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report computational uncertainties in Boltzmann Transport Equation (BTE)-based lattice thermal conductivity prediction of 50 diverse semiconductors from the use of different BTE solvers (ShengBTE, Phono3Py, and in-house code) and interatomic forces. The interatomic forces are obtained either using the density functional theory (DFT) as implemented in packages Quantum Espresso and VASP employing commonly used exchange correlation functionals (PBE, LDA, PBEsol, and rSCAN) or using the pre-trained foundational machine learning forcefields trained on two different material datasets.
  We find that the considered BTE solvers introduce minimal uncertainties and, using the same interatomic force constants, all solvers result in an excellent agreement with each other, with a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of only 1%. While this error increases to around 10% with the use of different DFT packages, the error is still small and can be reduced further with the use of stringent planewave energy cutoffs. On the other hand, the differences in thermal conductivity due to the use of different exchange correlation functionals are large, with a MAPE of more than 20%. The currently available pre-trained foundational ML models predict the right trend for thermal conductivity, but the associated errors are high, limiting their applications for coarse screening of materials.</description>

      <title>Immersed Boundary Projection Method for Navier Slip Boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A formulation of the immersed boundary method for incompressible flow over bodies with surface slip described by the Navier boundary condition is presented. In the present method, the wall slip velocity and the boundary force are determined implicitly through a projection to satisfy the boundary conditions and the divergence-free condition of the velocity field as constraints. The present method is first-order accurate in space and fourth-order accurate in time, overcoming the difficulty of the conventional continuous forcing approaches to accurately evaluate the velocity gradient on the boundary. Results from the simulation of the flow past stationary and moving circular cylinders are in good agreement with previous experimental and numerical results for a wide range of slip length on the surface, including the no-slip case.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectric properties of defective scandium nitride nanostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transition-metal nitrides (TMNs) are currently being studied for potential applications in energy conversion. In this work, we used the Landauer approach to relate the various effects contributing to the thermoelectric efficiency of scandium nitride (ScN) to their microscopic origins. We model the impact of electronic and structural modifications induced by oxygen impurities and spatial vacancies on electronic transport in ScN nanostructures. Taking advantage of the results of our calculations, we propose a theoretical interpretation of recent experimental results revealing a strong dependence of the thermoelectric properties of ScN thin films on procedural variations during fabrication. The thermoelectric properties of ScN are decisively influenced by structural and electronic factors arising from defects or impurities. Our findings highlight the potential of this theoretical approach in studying thermoelectricity and uncovering future strategies to improve thermoelectric efficiency.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast controlling net magnetization in g-wave altermagnets via laser fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The diverse nodal spin structures in d/g/i-wave altermagnets (AM) may cause distinct light-induced spin responses yet remain poorly understood. Using time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT), we reveal that laser induced ultrafast demagnetization dynamics in the g-wave AM CrSb are strongly governed by the laser incidence direction. Under normal incidence along the [0001] axis, two Cr sublattices exhibit symmetric temporal demagnetization but with different amplitudes, preserving the net-zero magnetization, unlike the behavior in d-wave AM. Off-normal incidence, however, induces pronounced asymmetric demagnetization between sublattices, transiently driving the system into a ferrimagnetic-like state with a sizable net magnetization. This direction-dependent response arises from the characteristic nodal structures in bulk g-wave AM electronic structure, which enable anisotropic optical intersite spin transfer (OISTR). By comparing g-wave and d-wave AMs, we propose that light-induced magnetization arises when laser polarization aligns with spin-uncompensated regions in electronic structures. This can be readily determined from the local spin density of states along specific band paths. Our results provide a fundamental understanding for laser-induced ultrafast dynamics in AM.</description>

      <title>Mapping Microstructure: Manifold Construction for Accelerated Materials Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accelerating materials development requires quantitative linkages between processing, microstructure, and properties. In this work, we introduce a framework for mapping microstructure onto a low-dimensional material manifold that is parametrized by processing conditions. A key innovation is treating microstructure as a stochastic process, defined as a distribution of microstructural instances rather than a single image, enabling the extraction of material state descriptors that capture the essential process-dependent features. We leverage the manifold hypothesis to assert that microstructural outcomes lie on a low-dimensional latent space controlled by only a few parameters. Using phase-field simulations of spinodal decomposition as a model material system, we compare multiple microstructure descriptors (two-point statistics, chord-length distributions, and persistent homology) in terms of two criteria: (1) intrinsic dimensionality of the latent space, and (2) invertibility of the processing-to-structure mapping. The results demonstrate that distribution-based descriptors can recover a two-dimensional latent structure aligned with the true processing parameters, yielding an invertible and physically interpretable mapping between processing and microstructure. In contrast, descriptors that do not account for microstructure variability either overestimate dimensionality or lose predictive fidelity. The constructed material manifold is shown to be locally continuous, wherein small changes in process variables correspond to smooth changes in microstructure descriptors. This data-driven manifold mapping approach provides a quantitative foundation for microstructure-informed process design and paves the way toward closed-loop optimization of processing--structure--property relationships in an integrated materials engineering context.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed GCN-LSTM Framework for Long-Term Forecasting of 2D and 3D Microstructure Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a physics-informed framework that integrates graph convolutional networks (GCN) with long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture to forecast microstructure evolution over long time horizons in both 2D and 3D with remarkable performance across varied metrics. The proposed framework is composition-aware, trained jointly on datasets with different compositions, and operates in latent graph space, which enables the model to capture compositions and morphological dynamics while remaining computationally efficient. Compressing and encoding phase-field simulation data with convolutional autoencoders and operating in Latent graph space facilitates efficient modeling of microstructural evolution across composition, dimensions, and long-term horizons. The framework captures the spatial and temporal patterns of evolving microstructures while enabling long-range forecasting at reduced computational cost after training.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Centric Algorithm for Sample-Based Krylov Diagonalization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09702v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Approximating the ground state of many-body systems is a key computational bottleneck underlying important applications in physics and chemistry. The most widely known quantum algorithm for ground state approximation, quantum phase estimation, is out of reach of current quantum processors due to its high circuit-depths. Subspace-based quantum diagonalization methods offer a viable alternative for pre- and early-fault-tolerant quantum computers. Here, we introduce a quantum diagonalization algorithm which combines two key ideas on quantum subspaces: a classical diagonalization based on quantum samples, and subspaces constructed with quantum Krylov states. We prove that our algorithm converges in polynomial time under the working assumptions of Krylov quantum diagonalization and sparseness of the ground state. We then demonstrate the scalability of our approach by performing the largest ground-state quantum simulation of impurity models using a Heron quantum processors and the Frontier supercomputer. We consider both the single-impurity Anderson model with 41 bath sites, and a system with 4 impurities and 7 bath sites per impurity. Our results are in excellent agreement with Density Matrix Renormalization Group calculations.</description>

      <title>Scalable projected entangled-pair state representation of random quantum circuit states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04769v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Classical simulation of a programmable quantum processor is crucial in identifying the threshold of a quantum advantage. We demonstrate the simple update of projected entangled-pair states (PEPSs) in the Vidal gauge that represent random quantum circuit states, which center around recent quantum advantage claims. Applied to square lattices of qubits akin to state-of-the-art superconducting processors, the PEPS representation is exact for circuit depths less than $\mathcal{D}_\mathrm{tr}$ = $\beta\log_2\chi$, where $\chi$ is the maximum bond dimension and $2 \lesssim \beta \lesssim 4$ depends on the choice of two-qubit gates, independent of the qubit number $n$. We find the universal scaling behaviors of the state fidelity by treating large-scale circuits of $n \leq 10^{4}$, using $\chi \leq 128$ on a conventional CPU. Our method has a polynomial scaling of computational costs with $n$ for circuit depth $\mathcal{D}=O(\log n)$ and is more advantageous than matrix product state approaches if $n$ is large. This work underscores PEPSs as a scalable tool for benchmarking quantum algorithms with future potential for sampling applications using advanced contraction techniques.</description>

      <title>Self-gravity in thin protoplanetary discs: 1. The smoothing-length approximation versus the exact self-gravity kernel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10812v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Planet-forming discs often contain structures like spiral arms, typically linked to the disc's gravitational forces. In 2D models, an ad hoc softening prescription is commonly used for self-gravity, but this overlooks the vertical structure's impact, suppresses the Newtonian nature of gravity at short distances and doesn't respect Newton's third law.
  To address these issues, associated with a Plummer potential approximation, we developed an exact self-gravity kernel for thin, hydrostatically supported discs, including a dust fluid component. Our analytical framework provides a precise 2D self-gravity prescription validated by benchmarks and 2D/3D numerical tests.
  The derived kernel, based on modified Bessel functions, maintains Newtonian gravitation features, such as point-wise symmetry, a smooth transition from light to massive discs and a singularity at zero distance, among others. In contrast to other prescriptions found in the literature, it proves capable of leading to an additional, and previously unnoticed, source of gravitational runaway discernible only at infinitesimal distances.
  We finally note that our new prescription remains compatible with methods based on the fast Fourier transform, affording superior computational efficiency. Our exact kernel formulation overcomes substantial limitations inherent in the smoothing-length approach. It permits a novel, fully consistent treatment of self-gravity in Gaussian-stratified thin discs. The approach, that makes the usage of the Plummer potential obsolete, will prove useful to studying all common planet formation scenarios, which are often backed by 2D-flat numerical simulations. Accordingly, in an accompanying paper, we will investigate how the occurence of the gravitational instability is affected.</description>
