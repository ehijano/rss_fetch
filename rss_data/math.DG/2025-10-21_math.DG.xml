      <title>Almost Gradient Ricci Solitons on Static Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to study geometrical aspects of static spacetime admitting an almost gradient Ricci soliton. Among others, We first determine the conditions under which the base manifold of static spacetime possess an almost gradient Ricci soliton and we show that the almost gradient Ricci soliton become steady gradient Ricci soliton when static spacetime turns to a vacuum static spacetime. Next, we exhibit that an expanding almost gradient Ricci soliton on base manifold of non-compact and connected static spacetime satisfies shr$\ddot{o}$dinger's equation for a smooth function $f$. Also, we find the soliton constant under which the static perfect fluid spacetime with almost gradient Ricci soliton holds the null convergence condition and the strong energy condition. Further, we study the almost gradient Ricci soliton on base manifold of static perfect fluid spacetime with potential function as warping function and it is shown that the base manifold of a static perfect fluid spacetime with an almost gradient Ricci soliton is an Einstein manifold. Next, we obtain a necessary and sufficient condition on soliton constant to obey timelike convergence condition. Further, we obtain some results for Ricci symmetric and weakly Ricci symmetric base manifold of static perfect fluid spacetime admitting gradient Ricci soliton. Finally, we find the nature of almost gradient Ricci soliton on $4$-dimensional half conformally flat base manifold of static perfect fluid spacetime.</description>

      <title>Universal Bundles of Metrics and Polymetrics: A Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formalize the ``metric bundle'' viewpoint by defining, for any smooth $n$--manifold $M$, the open fiberwise cones $\mathcal{G}^{p,q}\subset S^2\Tstar M$ of nondegenerate symmetric bilinear forms with fixed signature $(p,q)$, and we package \emph{multi\-metric} (``polymetric'') geometries as sections of finite products of such cones. This framework subsumes Riemannian and pseudo-Riemannian metrics, and admits clean extensions to conformal, densitized, Finsler, and sub-Riemannian structures. It also interfaces correctly with families index theory (Atiyah--Singer), equivariant/groupoid settings, and coarse/KK-theory. On compact $M$ the Riemannian space of metrics is convex (hence contractible), giving a transparent base for moduli and deformation theory</description>

      <title>p-lck with potential structure on LVMB manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, I present a natural generalization of all the results from [6] to LVMB manifolds: to summarize, very few LVMB manifolds are lck, and none are lck with potential except for diagonal Hopf manifolds. Moreover, if $N$ is an LVMB manifold with a sufficient number of indispensable coordinates, and under a certain assumption $(H)$ (which may be artificial, as I conjecture) on the localization of the configuration $\Lambda$, there exists a non-compact and non-K\"ahlerian $\mathbb{Z}^p$-lck with potential cover of $N$ with $p = m-1$. Furthermore, I show that the conjecture stated at the end of [5] (that $p$ is bounded below by $m-1$) is false, by exhibiting examples of LVMB manifolds that are $1$-lck with potential when $m\geq 3$ and $n&gt;2m+1$. This leads to the formulation of a new conjecture: if assumption $(H)$ holds, then $N$ is $1$-lck with potential. Moreover, assumption $(H)$ seems entirely artificial. This conjecture is supported by several examples.</description>

      <title>On Kodaira dimension and scalar curvature in almost Hermitian geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate Riemannian curvature constraints on the Kodaira dimension of compact almost Hermitian manifolds. Specifically, for a compact almost Hermitian manifold $(M, J, g)$ in the Gray-Hervella class $\mathcal{W}_2\oplus\mathcal{W}_3\oplus \mathcal{W}_4$ with nonnegative Riemannian scalar curvature, we prove that its Kodaira dimension must satisfy $\kappa(M, J)=-\infty$; or $\kappa(M, J)=0$, in which case $(M,J,g)$ is a K\"{a}hler Calabi-Yau manifold. The same conclusions also hold for compact Hermitian manifolds with an assumption of nonnegative mixed scalar curvature. As an important example, we study the twistor geometry of a compact anti-self-dual 4-manifold. In particular, for the twistor space with the Eells-Salamon almost complex structure, we show that the Kodaira dimension is zero.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We classify the hypersurfaces of dimension n &gt;= 3 with constant sectional curvature in the product spaces R^k x S^{n-k+1} and R^k x H^{n-k+1}, for 2 &lt;= k &lt;= n-1. Our results provide a complete description of these hypersurfaces and extend previous classifications of constant curvature submanifolds in product spaces of space forms.</description>

      <title>The Bounded Diameter Conjecture and Sharp Geometric Estimates for Mean Curvature Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the intrinsic diameter of mean curvature flow in $\mathbb{R}^3$ is uniformly bounded as one approaches the first singular time $T$. This confirms the \emph{bounded diameter conjecture} of Haslhofer. In addition, we establish several sharp quantitative estimates: the second fundamental form $A$ has uniformly bounded $L^1$-norm on each time slice, $A$ belongs to the weak $L^3$ space on the space-time region, and the singular set $\mathcal{S}$ has finite $\mathcal{H}^1$-Hausdorff measure. All of the results are optimal due to the marriage ring example and our results do not require any convexity assumptions on the surfaces. The proof is based on new covering theorems built from almost flat regions satisfying uniform content estimates. Furthermore, our arguments extend naturally to flows through singularities, yielding the same sharp estimates.</description>

      <title>A general connected sum formula for the families Seiberg-Witten invariant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In ordinary Seiberg-Witten theory, there are well known connected sum formulae such as the vanishing formula and the blow up formula. For families Seiberg-Witten theory, there are results such as Liu's families blow-up formula and Baraglia-Konno's gluing formula, but these have limited uses. In this paper, we prove a general connected sum formula which incorporates these results. This is subsequent work to a previous paper [arXiv:2510.14201] in which we proved a connected sum formula for the Bauer-Furuta invariant.</description>

      <title>Lower semicontinuity of restricted holonomy groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A result on the monotony of holonomy groups of metric connections in limits is proven. The main outcome is that given a sequence of metric connections that are Lipschitz continuous and converging in $C^0$, if the connections in the sequence all have holonomy contained in a closed group $H$, then also the limit connection has holonomy contained in $H$. In particular, this finds an application for Riemannian holonomy groups, where it is proven that the map assigning to a Riemannian metric the conjugacy class of its restricted holonomy group is lower semicontinuous with respect to the $C^1$-topology on the space of metrics.</description>

      <title>Polyhedral K\"ahler metrics on $\mathbb{CP}^n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of polyhedral K\"ahler metrics on $\mathbb{CP}^n$ whose singular set is a hyperplane arrangement and whose cone angles are in $(0, 2\pi)$. These conditions take the form of linear and quadratic constraints on the cone angles and are entirely determined by the intersection poset of the arrangement. Our proof of existence relies on a parabolic version of the Kobayashi-Hitchin correspondence, due to T. Mochizuki.</description>

      <title>Free boundary minimal surfaces in products of balls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we develop an extremal eigenvalue approach to the problem of construction of free boundary minimal surfaces in the product of Euclidean balls of chosen radii. The extremal problem involves a linear combination of normalized mixed Steklov-Neumann eigenvalues. The problem is motivated by the Schwarz P-surface which is a free boundary minimal surface in a cube. We show that the problem does not have an absolute maximum in the product case. By imposing a finite group of symmetries on both the surface and on the eigenfunctions we construct at least one free boundary minimal surface in a rectangular prism with arbitrary side lengths. We also show that for a genus zero surface with six boundary components and suitable reflection symmetries there is a maximizing metric which can be realized by a free boundary minimal immersion into a product of Euclidean balls.</description>

      <title>Biderivations of complete Leibniz algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.16426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: If one wishes to define a complete Leibniz algebra in such a way as to extend the notion of a complete Lie algebra, two distinct definitions can be found in the current literature. Since biderivations on complete Lie algebras have already been studied, in order to extend those results and considering that Leibniz algebras are, among others, a natural generalisation of Lie algebras, we study here the biderivations of complete Leibniz algebras according to both definitions. In each case, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for a bilinear map to be a biderivation of a Leibniz algebra. Finally, we analyse both symmetric and skew-symmetric biderivations, highlighting their structural properties.</description>

      <title>Higher traces of linear maps on finite-dimensional normed spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a unified trace-average formula for the $k$-th higher trace $\lambda_k(A)=\operatorname{tr}(\Lambda^k A)$ of a linear operator $A$ on a finite-dimensional normed space. The formula averages the matrix coefficient $w\mapsto\langle(\Lambda^kA)w, w^*\rangle$ over the unit sphere of $\Lambda^kX$ against a probability measure $\eta$; it holds for \emph{all} $A$ if and only if the operator-valued average $T_\eta=\binom{N}{k}\int w\otimes w^*\operatorname{d}\eta$ equals the identity. Two natural choices of $\eta$ satisfy this isotropy: (i) the hypersurface measure when a finite isometry group acts as an orthogonal $2$-design on $\Lambda^k\mathbb{R}^N$; and (ii) the cone probability measure (no symmetry needed). We also identify a first-order obstruction for hypersurface averages at $k=1$: only degree-$2$ spherical harmonics of the support function contribute.</description>

      <title>The Dirichlet eigenvalue problems for some concave elliptic Hessian operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16748v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we investigate a priori estimates for the solution to the Dirichlet eigenvalue problem for a broad class of concave elliptic Hessian operators of the form \[ F(D^2u)=-\Lambda u \quad \textrm{in} \, \Omega, \qquad u=0 \quad \textrm{on} \, \partial \Omega. \] These operators encompass the Monge-Amp\`ere operator, the $k$-Hessian operators, and the $p$-Monge-Amp\`ere operators. We impose a fairly mild constraint on the operator $F$, allowing us to demonstrate the existence of the first nonzero eigenvalue and its corresponding $\Gamma$-admissible eigenfunction on the smooth, strictly $\Gamma$-convex domain $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^{n}$. Furthermore, we prove that the eigenfunction $u_{1}$ belongs to $C^{\infty}(\Omega) \cap C^{1,1}(\overline{\Omega})$. As an application, we prove that every invariant G\r{a}rding-Dirichlet operator admits a unique first nonzero eigenvalue.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.16919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To empower the mathematical hitchhiker wishing to use operator methods in geometry and topology, we present this user's guide to first-order elliptic boundary value problems. Existence, regularity, and Fredholmness are discussed for general first-order elliptic operators on manifolds with compact boundary. The focus is on a very general class of elliptic boundary conditions, which contain those that are pseudo-local as a special case, yielding the relative index theorem. A new characterisation of a subclass of elliptic boundary conditions is also given.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove smoothness and interior derivative estimates for viscosity solutions to the special Lagrangian equation with almost negative phases and small enough semi-convexity. We show by example that the range of phases we consider and the semi-convexity condition are sharp. As an application, we find a new Liouville theorem for entire such solutions of the special Lagrangian equation with subcritical phase. We also find effective Hessian estimates with exponential dependence, which we show to be optimal.</description>

      <title>Strong formality of toric and homogeneous compact K\"ahler manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: All compact K\"ahler, or even $\partial\bar\partial$-manifolds, are rationally formal. Not all of them are strongly formal. Yet some of them are: For complete smooth complex toric varieties and homogeneous compact K\"ahler manifolds we show the stronger property that they are both rationally and strongly formal in a compatible way.</description>

      <title>On the {$L^\infty $} norms of spectral projectors on shrinking intervals: the cases of some spheres of revolution and of the Euclidean disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a compact Riemannian surface $M$, with Laplace-Beltrami operator $\Delta$, for $\lambda &gt; 0$, let $P\_{\lambda,\lambda^{-\frac{1}{3}}}$ be the spectral projector on the bandwidth $[\lambda-\lambda^{-\frac{1}{3}}, \lambda + \lambda^{\frac{1}{3}}]$ associated to $\sqrt{-\Delta}$. We prove a polynomial improvement on the $L^2 \to L^{\infty}$ norm of $P\_{\lambda,\lambda^{-\frac{1}{3}}}$ for generic simple spheres of revolution (away from the poles and the equator) and for the Euclidean disk away from its center but up to the boundary. We use the Quantum Integrability of those surfaces to express the norm in terms of a joint basis of eigenfunctions for $\left(\sqrt{-\Delta}, \frac{1}{i}\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}\right)$. Then, we use that those eigenfunctions are asymptotically Lagrangian oscillatory functions, each supported on a Lagrangian torus with fold-type caustic. Thus, studying the distribution of the caustics, and using BKW decay away from the caustics, we are able to reduce the problem to counting estimates.</description>

      <title>Bergman metrics induced by the ball</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate when the Bergman metric of a bounded domain is, up to a constant factor $\lambda$, induced by the Bergman metric of a finite-dimensional unit ball $\mathbb{B}^N$ via a holomorphic isometric immersion. For a strictly pseudoconvex domain in $\mathbb{C}^2$ we prove rigidity: if such an immersion extends smoothly and transversally past the boundary and $(N + 1)/\lambda - 3 \in \mathbb{N}$, then the domain is biholomorphic to the ball. We then consider two broad classes of examples: Hartogs domains over bounded homogeneous bases and egg domains over irreducible symmetric bases, and show that, in finite target dimension, the only members whose (rescaled) Bergman metric is induced by that of a ball are the balls themselves. The proofs combine Calabi's diastasis criterion with explicit Bergman kernel formulas (such as Fefferman's expansion) and algebraic arguments that force arithmetic constraints on the scaling factor. In higher dimensions, the first result follows under a Ramadanov-type assumption.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the paper, we prove the existence of a positive and essentially bounded solution to a Lichnerowicz equation in the Einstein-scalar field theory on a closed manifold with non-constant mean curvature. In particular, the non-constant mean curvature gives rise to supercritical terms in the equation, on top of singular ones. We employ a recent fixed-point argument, which involves sub- and supersolutions. Additionally, we provide several conditions on the coefficients in the equation that prevent the existence of positive classical solutions.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the modified $J$-equation introduced by Li-Shi. We show that the solvability of the modified $J$-equation is equivalent to the coercivity of the modified $J$-functional on compact K\"ahler manifolds. For smooth projective toric varieties we establish a Nakai-Moishezon type criterion for the existence of solutions, extending the results of Collins-Sz\'ekelyhidi. As a possible application, by combining our result with Delcroix-Jubert, we further discuss a numerical sufficient condition for the existence of extremal K\"ahler metrics on smooth projective toric varieties.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal approximation of minimal surfaces: optimal estimates from stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.06328v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Minimal surfaces in closed 3-manifolds are classically constructed via the Almgren-Pitts approach. The Allen-Cahn approximation has proved to be a powerful alternative, and Chodosh and Mantoulidis (in Ann. Math. 2020) used it to give a new proof of Yau's conjecture for generic metrics and establish the multiplicity one conjecture. The primary goal of this paper is to set the ground for a new approximation based on nonlocal minimal surfaces. More precisely, we prove that if $\partial E$ is a stable $s$-minimal surface in $B_1\subset \mathbb R^3$ then:
  - $\partial E\cap B_{1/2}$ enjoys a $C^{2,\alpha}$ estimate that is robust as $s\uparrow 1$ (i.e. uniform in $s$);
  - the distance between different connected components of~$\partial E\cap B_{1/2}$ must be at least of order~$(1-s)^{\frac 1 2}$ (optimal sheet separation estimate);
  - interactions between multiple sheets at distances of order $(1-s)^{\frac 1 2}$ are described by the D\'avila--del Pino--Wei system. A second important goal of the paper is to establish that hyperplanes are the only stable $s$-minimal hypersurfaces in $\mathbb R^4$, for $s\in(0,1)$ sufficiently close to $1$. This is done by exploiting suitable modifications of the results described above. In this application, it is crucially used that our curvature and separations estimates hold without any assumption on area bounds (in contrast to the analogous estimates for Allen-Cahn).</description>

      <title>A monotonicity formula for minimal connections</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.11796v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For Hermitian connections on a Hermitian complex line bundle over a Riemannian manifold $(X,g)$, we can define the ``volume", which can be considered to be the ``mirror" of the standard volume for submanifolds. We call the critical points minimal connections.
  In this paper, (1) we prove monotonicity formulas for minimal connections with respect to some versions of volume functionals under certain conditions on $\dim X$ and the curvature of $g$. These formulas would be important in bubbling analysis. As a corollary, we obtain the vanishing theorem for minimal connections on the odd dimensional Euclidean space.
  (2) We see that the formal ``large radius limit" of the defining equation of minimal connections is that of Yang--Mills connections. Then the existence theorem of minimal connections is proved for a ``sufficiently large" metric.
  (3) We can consider deformed Donaldson--Thomas (dDT) connections on $G_2$-manifolds as ``mirrors" of calibrated (associative) submanifolds. We show that dDT connections are minimal connections, just as calibrated submanifolds are minimal submanifolds. By the argument specific to dDT connections, we obtain the stronger monotonicity formulas and vanishing theorem for dDT connections than in (1).</description>

      <title>The Prescribed Metric on Convex Subsets of Anti-de Sitter Space with Quasi-Circle Ideal Boundaries</title>

Abstract: Let $h^{+}$ and $h^{-}$ be two complete, conformal metrics on the disc $\mathbb{D}$. Assume moreover that the derivatives of the conformal factors of the metrics $h^{+}$ and $h^{-}$ are bounded at any order with respect to the hyperbolic metric, and that the metrics have curvatures in the interval $\left(-\frac{1}{\epsilon}, -1 - \epsilon\right)$, for some $\epsilon &gt; 0$. Let $f$ be a quasi-symmetric map. We show the existence of a globally hyperbolic convex subset $\Omega$ (see Definition 4.1) of the three-dimensional anti-de Sitter space, such that $\Omega$ has $h^{+}$ (respectively $h^{-}$) as the induced metric on its future boundary (respectively on its past boundary) and has a gluing map $\Phi_{\Omega}$ (see Definition 5.7) equal to $f$.</description>

Abstract: We define a $\mathbb{Z}_2$-valued invariant for transversely-intersecting coassociative $4$-folds equipped with spin structures. Our main result shows this invariant provides an obstruction to separating two such coassociatives through a family of transverse coassociative deformations. We further prove that there is a canonical generalized connected sum of two such transverse coassociatives whose diffeomorphism type is determined by our invariant. When one coassociative is a graph over the other, we relate our invariant to the parity function in near-symplectic geometry. Finally, we discuss conjectural consequences for non-compactness phenomena and compute our invariant for the $Sp(1)$-invariant coassociatives discovered by Harvey and Lawson.</description>

      <title>On Geometry and Topology of Hessian Manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01176v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a differentiable manifold $M$, a pair $(M, \nabla)$ is termed an affine manifold, if $\nabla$ is a flat and torsion-free connection on the tangent bundle $TM\rightarrow M$. A Riemannian metric $g$ on $M$ is called a Hessian metric on $(M, \nabla)$, if $g$ can be expressed locally as the Hessian quadratic form $\nabla(df)$ of some smooth potential $f$. An affine manifold equipped with a Hessian metric is termed a Hessian manifold. We study the topology and geometry of Hessian manifolds.
  Key topological constraints are derived, including the vanishing of the Euler characteristic for any compact Hessian manifold and infinite torsion-freeness of its fundamental group. We demonstrate that compact Hessian manifolds with an abelian fundamental group are homeomorphic to the flat torus. The theory of flat line bundles is developed to introduce the Picard group and the canonical class, which are used to prove that a curved compact orientable Hessian manifold must be a mapping torus. Curvature properties are then discussed. As an application, we prove that all compact Hessian-Einstein manifolds are flat.
  A Hessian manifold $((M, \nabla),g)$ is said to be of Koszul type, if there exists a $1$-form $\eta\in\Omega^1(M)$ such that $g=\nabla\eta$. We place emphasis on Hessian manifolds of Koszul type, establishing an equivalence between their existence and that of positive flat line bundles, space-like Lagrangian embeddings, and hyperbolic affine structures. A duality with radiant manifolds, analogous to the classical Legendre transformation, is explored. We also develop a geometric uncertainty principle on Hessian manifolds of Koszul type, and classify all complete Hessian surfaces and closed Hessian $3$-folds.</description>

Abstract: This paper considers the Euler-Lagrange equations satisfied by the critical points of a large class of conformally invariant extrinsic energies for 4-manifolds immersed into Euclidean space (any codimension). Using invariances and Noether's theorem, we convert the Euler-Lagrange equation in a system of equations with analytically favourable structures. The present paper generalises to the four-dimensional setting ideas originally developed by Tristan Rivi\`ere in his study of the Willmore energy in two dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04442v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the context of information geometry, the concept known as left-invariant statistical structure on Lie groups is defined by Furuhata--Inoguchi--Kobayashi [Inf. Geom. (2021)]. In this paper, we introduce the notion of the moduli space of left-invariant statistical structures on a Lie group. We study the moduli spaces for three particular Lie groups, each of which has a moduli space of left-invariant Riemannian metrics that is a singleton. As applications, we classify left-invariant conjugate symmetric statistical structures and left-invariant dually flat structures (which are equivalently left-invariant Hessian structures) on these three Lie groups. A characterization of the Amari--Chentsov $\alpha$-connections on the Takano Gaussian space is also given.</description>

Abstract: In this note, we study equivariant versions of Stolz' R-groups, the positive scalar curvature structure groups $R_n(X)^G$, for proper actions of discrete groups $G$. We define the concept of a fundamental groupoid functor for a $G$-space, encapsulating all the fundamental group information of all the fixed point sets and their relations. We construct classifying spaces for fundamental groupoid functors. As a geometric result, we show that Stolz' equivariant R-group $R_n(X)^G$ depends only on the fundamental groupoid functor of the reference space $X$. The proof covers at the same time in a concise and clear way the classical non-equivariant case.</description>

Abstract: A new semi-supervised machine learning package is introduced which successfully solves the Euclidean vacuum Einstein equations with a cosmological constant, without any symmetry assumptions. The model architecture contains subnetworks for each patch in the manifold-defining atlas. Each subnetwork predicts the components of a metric in its associated patch, with the relevant Einstein conditions of the form $R_{\mu \nu} - \lambda g_{\mu \nu} = 0$ being used as independent loss components (here $\mu,\nu = 1, 2, \cdots, n$, where $n$ is the dimension of the Riemannian manifold, and the Einstein constant $\lambda \in \{+1, 0, -1\}$). To ensure the consistency of the global structure of the manifold, another loss component is introduced across the patch subnetworks which enforces the coordinate transformation between the patches, $g' = J^T g J$, for an appropriate analytically known Jacobian $J$. We test our method for the case of spheres represented by a pair of patches in dimensions 2, 3, 4, and 5. In dimensions 2 and 3, the geometries have been fully classified. However, it is unknown whether a Ricci-flat metric can exist on spheres in dimensions 4 and 5. This work hints against the existence of such a metric.</description>

      <title>Many facets of cohomology: Differential complexes and structure-aware formulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22813v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Complexes and cohomology, traditionally central to topology, have emerged as fundamental tools across applied mathematics and the sciences. This survey explores their roles in diverse areas, from partial differential equations and continuum mechanics to reformulations of the Einstein equations and network theory. Motivated by advances in compatible and structure-preserving discretisation such as Finite Element Exterior Calculus (FEEC), we examine how differential complexes encode critical properties such as existence, uniqueness, stability and rigidity of solutions to differential equations. We demonstrate that various fundamental concepts and models in solid and fluid mechanics are essentially formulated in terms of differential complexes.</description>

      <title>Forward-backward splitting in bilaterally bounded Alexandrov spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24126v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the goal of solving optimisation problems on non-Riemannian manifolds, such as geometrical surfaces with sharp edges, we develop and prove the convergence of a forward-backward method in Alexandrov spaces with curvature bounded both from above and from below. This bilateral boundedness is crucial for the availability of both the gradient and proximal steps, instead of just one or the other. We numerically demonstrate the behaviour of the proposed method on simple geometrical surfaces in $\mathbb{R}^3$.</description>

      <title>Integrable Billiards and Related Topics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03790v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper surveys our results on integrable billiards. We consider various models of billiards, including Birkhoff, outer, magnetic, and Minkowski billiards. Also, we discuss wire billiards and billiards in cones. For four models of convex plane billiards, we also discuss an isoperimetric-type inequality for the Mather $\beta$-function. We conclude with a section of open questions on this subject.</description>
