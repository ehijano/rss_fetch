      <title>log-RRIM: Yield Prediction via Local-to-global Reaction Representation Learning and Interaction Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of chemical reaction yields is crucial for optimizing organic synthesis, potentially reducing time and resources spent on experimentation. With the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), there is growing interest in leveraging AI-based methods to accelerate yield predictions without conducting in vitro experiments. We present log-RRIM, an innovative graph transformer-based framework designed for predicting chemical reaction yields. Our approach implements a unique local-to-global reaction representation learning strategy. This approach initially captures detailed molecule-level information and then models and aggregates intermolecular interactions, ensuring that the impact of varying-sizes molecular fragments on yield is accurately accounted for. Another key feature of log-RRIM is its integration of a cross-attention mechanism that focuses on the interplay between reagents and reaction centers. This design reflects a fundamental principle in chemical reactions: the crucial role of reagents in influencing bond-breaking and formation processes, which ultimately affect reaction yields. log-RRIM outperforms existing methods in our experiments, especially for medium to high-yielding reactions, proving its reliability as a predictor. Its advanced modeling of reactant-reagent interactions and sensitivity to small molecular fragments make it a valuable tool for reaction planning and optimization in chemical synthesis. The data and codes of log-RRIM are accessible through https://github.com/ninglab/Yield_log_RRIM.</description>

      <title>Advancements in Nanoparticle-based Near-Infrared Fluorescence Probes for Cancer Specific Imaging Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Infrared (IR) dyes, especially those within the near-infrared (NIR) spectrum, offer substantial advantages for in vivo imaging, owing to their deep tissue penetration and minimal background autofluorescence. Nanoparticles incorporating these IR dyes, such as indocyanine green (ICG) have undergone extensive investigation regarding their pharmacokinetic behavior, including biodistribution patterns and clearance mechanisms. These nanoparticles often preferentially accumulate in tumor tissues, primarily through the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, thereby establishing them as potent instruments for sophisticated tumor imaging and precision-targeted drug delivery systems. The development of near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) for large-scale tissue imaging is attributed to its ability to generate highly specific, targeted visualization of organs. The distinctive properties of the near-infrared spectrum, including its selective absorption by biomolecules that bind to specific sites within tissues, minimal autofluorescence, and reduced light scattering, make it an appealing option for cancer imaging. Unlike the conventional structural imaging system, molecular imaging leverages these properties to differentiate between malignant and normal tissues at the molecular level, offering a more refined and precise diagnostic capability. This review offers a timely and comprehensive overview of the latest advancements in Nanoparticle-based NIRF probes and multifunctional agents for cancer molecular imaging. These advances will extend the current concepts of cancer theranostics by NIRF imaging.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Monte Carlo methods for spectroscopy data analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a scalable Bayesian framework for the analysis of confocal fluorescence spectroscopy data, addressing key limitations in traditional fluorescence correlation spectroscopy methods. Our framework captures molecular motion, microscope optics, and photon detection with high fidelity, enabling statistical inference of molecule trajectories from raw photon count data, introducing a superresolution parameter which further enhances trajectory estimation beyond the native time resolution of data acquisition. To handle the high dimensionality of the arising posterior distribution, we develop a family of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithms that leverages the unique characteristics inherent to spectroscopy data analysis. Here, due to the highly-coupled correlation structure of the target posterior distribution, HMC requires the numerical solution of a stiff ordinary differential equation containing a two-scale discrete Laplacian. By considering the spectral properties of this operator, we produce a CFL-type integrator stability condition for the standard St\"ormer-Verlet integrator used in HMC. To circumvent this instability we introduce a semi-implicit (IMEX) method which treats the stiff and non-stiff parts differently, while leveraging the sparse structure of the discrete Laplacian for computational efficiency. Detailed numerical experiments demonstrate that this method improves upon fully explicit approaches, allowing larger HMC step sizes and maintaining second-order accuracy in position and energy. Our framework provides a foundation for extensions to more complex models such as surface constrained molecular motion or motion with multiple diffusion modes.</description>

      <title>Two-Stage Pretraining for Molecular Property Prediction in the Wild</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate property prediction is crucial for accelerating the discovery of new molecules. Although deep learning models have achieved remarkable success, their performance often relies on large amounts of labeled data that are expensive and time-consuming to obtain. Thus, there is a growing need for models that can perform well with limited experimentally-validated data. In this work, we introduce MoleVers, a versatile pretrained model designed for various types of molecular property prediction in the wild, i.e., where experimentally-validated molecular property labels are scarce. MoleVers adopts a two-stage pretraining strategy. In the first stage, the model learns molecular representations from large unlabeled datasets via masked atom prediction and dynamic denoising, a novel task enabled by a new branching encoder architecture. In the second stage, MoleVers is further pretrained using auxiliary labels obtained with inexpensive computational methods, enabling supervised learning without the need for costly experimental data. This two-stage framework allows MoleVers to learn representations that generalize effectively across various downstream datasets. We evaluate MoleVers on a new benchmark comprising 22 molecular datasets with diverse types of properties, the majority of which contain 50 or fewer training labels reflecting real-world conditions. MoleVers achieves state-of-the-art results on 20 out of the 22 datasets, and ranks second among the remaining two, highlighting its ability to bridge the gap between data-hungry models and real-world conditions where practically-useful labels are scarce.</description>

      <title>Enlightening the blind spot of the Michaelis-Menten rate law: The role of relaxation dynamics in molecular complex formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11979v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The century-long Michaelis-Menten rate law and its modifications in the modeling of biochemical rate processes stand on the assumption that the concentration of the complex of interacting molecules, at each moment, rapidly approaches an equilibrium (quasi-steady state) compared to the pace of molecular concentration changes. Yet, in the case of actively time-varying molecular concentrations with transient or oscillatory dynamics, the deviation of the complex profile from the quasi-steady state becomes relevant. A recent theoretical approach, known as the effective time-delay scheme (ETS), suggests that the delay by the relaxation time of molecular complex formation contributes to the substantial breakdown of the quasi-steady state assumption. Here, we systematically expand this ETS and inquire into the comprehensive roles of relaxation dynamics in complex formation. Through the modeling of rhythmic protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions and the mammalian circadian clock, our analysis reveals the effect of the relaxation dynamics beyond the time delay, which extends to the dampening of changes in the complex concentration with a reduction in the oscillation amplitude compared to the quasi-steady state. Interestingly, the combined effect of the time delay and amplitude reduction shapes both qualitative and quantitative oscillatory patterns such as the emergence and variability of the mammalian circadian rhythms. These findings highlight the drawback of the routine assumption of quasi-steady states and enhance the mechanistic understanding of rich time-varying biomolecular activities.</description>

      <title>FoldMark: Protecting Protein Generative Models with Watermarking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20354v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Protein structure is key to understanding protein function and is essential for progress in bioengineering, drug discovery, and molecular biology. Recently, with the incorporation of generative AI, the power and accuracy of computational protein structure prediction/design have been improved significantly. However, ethical concerns such as copyright protection and harmful content generation (biosecurity) pose challenges to the wide implementation of protein generative models. Here, we investigate whether it is possible to embed watermarks into protein generative models and their outputs for copyright authentication and the tracking of generated structures. As a proof of concept, we propose a two-stage method FoldMark as a generalized watermarking strategy for protein generative models. FoldMark first pretrain watermark encoder and decoder, which can minorly adjust protein structures to embed user-specific information and faithfully recover the information from the encoded structure. In the second step, protein generative models are fine-tuned with watermark Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) modules to preserve generation quality while learning to generate watermarked structures with high recovery rates. Extensive experiments are conducted on open-source protein structure prediction models (e.g., ESMFold and MultiFlow) and de novo structure design models (e.g., FrameDiff and FoldFlow) and we demonstrate that our method is effective across all these generative models. Meanwhile, our watermarking framework only exerts a negligible impact on the original protein structure quality and is robust under potential post-processing and adaptive attacks.</description>
