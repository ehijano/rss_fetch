      <title>Lyapunov and Reversibility error invariant indicators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this review, we present a survey of the Lyapunov Error and Reversibility Error (\cite{Faranda2012}), and we propose a generalization to make them invariant to the choice of initial conditions.
  We first define a process as the evolution in time of a a map or a flow, we then introduce the covariance matrix of a given process, and use their trace to compute LE and RE. The determinant of the covariance matrices is used to compute all invariant indicators of higher order.
  In this way, two set of invariant indicators are proposed within the framework introduced here, one for the Reversibility and one for the Lyapunov Errors, respectively. LE and RE which have been used in the literature, are the \textit{first-order} invariant indicators in their respective sets.
  The new sets of invariant indicators have the same fundamental meaning, the set for RE is used to characterize the dynamical evolution of a continuous small perturbation over an orbit, while LE is used to study the evolution of an initial displacement between two nearby orbits.
  We obtain again also the Reversibility Error Method (REM), which is a particular case of RE, where the additive noise is replaced by the round-off errors.
  REM has been proved to be a practical, accurate, and fast dynamical indicator and the results are comparable with the RE induced by a random noise of given amplitude. the behaviour of RE invariants depends on the sum of the positive Lyapunov exponents. We showcase the accuracy and reliability of those indicators on two well studied Hamiltonian. Within this new framework, a full dynamical characterization of a Hamiltonian system can be obtained. For instance, the Gibbs entropy, its asymptotic behaviour and a method to compute the fidelity over the perturbed orbit, are provided.</description>

      <title>Turbulence spreading and anomalous diffusion on combs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a simple model for such processes as chaos spreading or turbulence spillover into stable regions. In this simple model the essential transport occurs via inelastic resonant interactions of waves on a lattice. The process is shown to result universally in a subdiffusive spreading of the wave field. The dispersion of this spreading process is found to depend exclusively on the type of the interaction process (three- or four-wave), but not on a particular instability behind. The asymptotic transport equations for field spreading are derived with the aid of a specific geometric construction in the form of a comb. The results can be summarized by stating that the asymptotic spreading pursues as a continuous-time random walk (CTRW) and corresponds to a kinetic description in terms of fractional-derivative equations. The fractional indexes pertaining to these equations are obtained exactly using the comb model. A special case of the above theory is a situation when two waves with oppositely directed wave vectors couple together to form a bound state with zero momentum. This situation is considered separately and associated with the self-organization of wave-like turbulence into banded flows or staircases. Overall, we find that turbulence spreading and staircasing could be described based on the same mathematical formalism, using the Hamiltonian of inelastic wave-wave interactions and a mapping procedure into the comb space. Theoretically, the comb approach is regarded as a substitute for a more common description based on quasilinear theory. Some implications of the present theory for the fusion plasma studies are discussed and a comparison with the available observational and numerical evidence is given.</description>

      <title>The effect of friction on the dynamics of targeted energy transfer by symmetric vibro-impact dampers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the nonlinear dynamics of a symmetric vibro-impact nonlinear energy sink (VI-NES) subjected to dry friction, a crucial factor that remains insufficiently explored in previous research. The combined effect of impact and friction leads to intricate behaviors that require further investigation. To address this, the multiple scales method is extended to incorporate frictional effects and is complemented with a generalized impact map approach. This allows for a systematic exploration of periodic solutions, stability, and bifurcations, revealing critical transitions between impact-dominated and sliding-dominated regimes. The activation thresholds and amplitude levels for different response regimes, including stick-slip dynamics, are identified, offering new insights into friction-induced nonlinearities. The results bridge the gap between theoretical modeling and practical implementation, offering a more accurate predictive framework for VINES behavior. This improves design strategies for enhanced energy dissipation and robustness in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>On the sensitivity of different ensemble filters to the type of assimilated observation networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in data assimilation (DA) have focused on developing more flexible approaches that can better accommodate nonlinearities in models and observations. However, it remains unclear how the performance of these advanced methods depends on the observation network characteristics. In this study, we present initial experiments with the surface quasi-geostrophic model, in which we compare a recently developed AI-based ensemble filter with the standard Local Ensemble Transform Kalman Filter (LETKF). Our results show that the analysis solutions respond differently to the number, spatial distribution, and nonlinear fraction of assimilated observations. We also find notable changes in the multiscale characteristics of the analysis errors. Given that standard DA techniques will be eventually replaced by more advanced methods, we hope this study sets the ground for future efforts to reassess the value of Earth observation systems in the context of newly emerging algorithms.</description>

      <title>Scrambling in the Charging of Quantum Batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10590v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exponentially fast scrambling of an initial state characterizes quantum chaotic systems. Given the importance of quickly populating higher energy levels from low-energy states in quantum battery charging protocols, this work investigates the role of quantum scrambling in quantum batteries and its effect on optimal power and charging times by means of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model, a maximally-chaotic black hole physics model that has been recently proposed as a quantum battery. We adopt a bare representation with normalized bandwidths to suppress system energy dependence. To our knowledge, this is the first in-depth exploration of quantum scrambling in the context of quantum batteries. By analyzing the dynamics of out-of-time-order correlators, our findings indicate that quantum scrambling does not necessarily lead to faster charging, despite its potential for accelerating the process.</description>

      <title>Streamlined Krylov construction and classification of ergodic Floquet systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19797v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We generalize Krylov construction to periodically driven (Floquet) quantum systems using the theory of orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle. Compared to other approaches, our method works faster and maps any quantum dynamics to a one-dimensional tight-binding Krylov chain, which is efficiently simulated on both classical and quantum computers. We also suggest a classification of chaotic and integrable Floquet systems based on the asymptotic behavior of Krylov chain hopping parameters (Verblunsky coefficients). We illustrate this classification with random matrix ensembles, kicked top, and kicked Ising chain.</description>

      <title>Chaos indicators for non-linear dynamics in circular particle accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12741v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The understanding of non-linear effects in circular storage rings and colliders based on superconducting magnets is a key issue for the luminosity the beam lifetime optimisation. A detailed analysis of the multidimensional phase space requires a large computing effort when many variants of the magnetic lattice, representing the realisation of magnetic errors or configurations for performance optimisation, have to be considered. Dynamic indicators for chaos detection have proven to be very effective in finding and distinguishing the weakly-chaotic regions of phase space where diffusion takes place and regions that remain stable over time scales in the order of multiple hours of continuous operation. This paper explores the use of advanced chaos indicators, including the Fast Lyapunov Indicator with Birkhoff weights and the Reverse Error Method, in realistic lattice models for the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Their convergence, predictive power, and potential to define a magnetic lattice quality factor linked to long-term dynamic aperture are assessed. The results demonstrate the efficiency of these indicators in identifying chaotic dynamics, offering valuable insights of these chaos indicators for optimising accelerator lattices with reduced computational cost compared to the classical approach based on CPU-demanding long-term tracking campaigns.</description>
