      <title>Polarizing 3He via Metastability Exchange Optical Pumping Using a 1.2 mbar Sealed Cell at Magnetic Fields up to 5 T</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report high nuclear polarization of 1.2 mbar 3He gas in a sealed cell in magnetic fields up to 5 T using Metastability Exchange Optical Pumping (MEOP). The creation of a highly polarized 3He gas target for use in the 5 T field of Jefferson Lab's CLAS12 spectrometer would enable new studies of spin-dependent asymmetries on the neutron. A systematic study was conducted to evaluate the effects of discharge intensity, pump laser power, and optical pumping transition schemes on nuclear polarization and pumping rates. Steady-state polarizations up to 86 % in magnetic fields between 2 and 5 T were achieved, with a discharge-on relaxation time of 898 s at 5 T. These results underscore the potential of MEOP for high-field applications in nuclear physics experiments.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous generation of athermal phonons bursts within bulk silicon causing excess noise, low energy background events and quasiparticle poisoning in superconducting sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solid state phonon detectors used in the search for dark matter or coherent neutrino nucleus interactions (CE$\nu$NS) require excellent energy resolution (eV-scale or below) and low backgrounds to meet their science objectives. Unfortunately, an unknown source of phonon bursts (the low energy excess, or ``LEE'') both dominates all other above threshold background sources and produces shot noise from sub-threshold bursts which greatly exceeds all fundamental noise sources. In this paper, we measure these phonon bursts for 12 days after cool down in two nearly identical multi-phonon sensor channel 1cm$^2$ silicon detectors which differ only in the thickness of their substrate (1 mm vs 4 mm thick). We find that both the correlated shot noise and near threshold shared LEE relax with time since cooldown. Additionally, we show that both shot noise and LEE rates scale linearly with substrate thickness. When combined with previous measurements of other silicon phonon detectors with different substrate geometries and mechanical support strategies, these measurements strongly suggest that the dominant source of both above and below threshold LEE is the bulk substrate. By monitoring the relation between bias power and excess phonon shot noise we estimate that $\varepsilon = \frac{&lt;E^2&gt;}{&lt;E&gt;}$ for sub-threshold noise events is $0.68 \pm 0.38$ meV. In our final dataset, we report a world-leading energy resolution of 258.5$\pm$0.4 meV in the 1mm thick detector. Simple calculations suggest that these Si substrate phonon bursts are likely the dominant source of quasi-particle poisoning in superconducting qubits and sensors that are operated in well shielded and vibration free environments.</description>

      <title>Resistive Plate Chamber Detector Construction and Certification: State-of-the-Art Facilities at the Max Planck Institute for Physics, in Partnership with Industrial Partners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resistive Plate Chambers (RPCs) featuring 1 mm gas volumes combined with high-pressure phenolic laminate (HPL) electrodes provide excellent timing resolution down to a few hundred picoseconds, along with spatial resolution on the order of a few millimeters. Thanks to their relatively low production cost and robust performance in high-background environments, RPCs have become essential components for instrumenting large detection areas in high-energy physics experiments. The growing demand for these advanced RPC detectors, particularly for the High-Luminosity upgrade of the Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC), necessitates the establishment of new production facilities capable of delivering high-quality detectors at an industrial scale. To address this requirement, a dedicated RPC assembly and certification facility has been developed at the Max Planck Institute for Physics in Munich, leveraging strategic collaborations with industrial partners MIRION and PTS. This partnership facilitated the transfer of advanced, research-level assembly methodologies into robust, scalable industrial processes. Through a structured, phased prototyping and certification approach, initial tests on small-scale ($40 \times 50 \, cm^2$) prototypes validated the scalability and applicability of optimized production procedures to large-scale ($1.0 \times 2.0 \, m^2$) RPC detectors. Currently, the project has entered its final certification phase, involving extensive performance and longevity testing, including a year-long irradiation campaign at CERN's Gamma Irradiation Facility (GIF++). This article details the development and successful industrial implementation of novel assembly techniques, highlighting the enhanced capabilities and reliability of RPC detectors prepared through this industrial-academic collaboration, ensuring readiness for upcoming challenges in high-energy physics detector instrumentation.</description>

      <title>Die Separation for Mitigation of Phonon Bursts in Superconducting Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmic rays and background radioactive decay can deposit significant energy into superconducting quantum circuits on planar chips. This energy converts into pair-breaking phonons that travel across the substrate and generate quasiparticles, leading to correlated energy and phase errors in nearby qubits. To mitigate this, we fabricated two separate dies and placed them adjacently without a galvanic connection between them. This blocks phonon propagation from one die to the other. Using microwave kinetic inductance detectors on both dies, we successfully detected high-energy bursts and conclusively demonstrated the blocking effect. However, we also observed simultaneous events in both dies, likely from a single cosmic particle traversing both dies.</description>

      <title>Single-shot 3D characterization the spatiotemporal optical vortex via a spatiotemporal wavefront sensor (STWFS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advent of spatiotemporal wave packets (STWPs), represented by spatiotemporal optical vortices (STOVs), has paved the way for the exploration in optics and photonics. To date, despite considerable efforts, a comprehensive and efficient practical means to characterizing wave packets with such complex structures is still lacking. In this study, we introduced a new method designed to achieve high-precision and high-throughput spatiotemporal wave packet measurements using a user-friendly set up. This method is based on a quadriwave lateral shearing interferometric wavefront sensor that utilizes wavelength division multiplexing, termed the "spatiotemporal wavefront sensor (STWFS)." Using this method, we have fabricated a compact prototype with 295 * 295 spatial pixels * 36 wavelength channels of 0.5 nm spectral resolution in a single frame. This STWFS enabled, for the first time, single-shot self-referenced spatiotemporal three-dimensional (3D) optical field characterizations of STOV pulses with transverse orbital angular momenta L of 1 and 2, and obtained the dynamic visualization of the focused propagation of STOV pulses. Furthermore, the STWFS provides a 1.87 nm (0.95%) root mean square (RMS) absolute accuracy for spatiotemporal phase reconstruction. This achievement represents the highest performance compared with other three-dimensional spatiotemporal metrology methods. As a spatiotemporal optical field characterization method, the STWFS offers ultrafast 3D diagnostics, contributing to spatiotemporal photonics and broader applications across different fields, such as light-matter interactions and optical communications.</description>

      <title>Lab and Beam Tests of a SiPM-readout ASIC with a Large Dynamic Range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18927v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A front-end readout system with a large dynamic range is required for the high-granularity crystal electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL) at future Higgs factories. A new commercially available ASIC, MPT2321, which offers a significantly large dynamic range for the readout of the silicon photomultiplier (SiPM), has been tested in the laboratory and at a test beam facility. The fundamental performance metrics have been characterised, including response linearity, inter-calibration factor and noise performance. To quantitatively assess the dynamic range of the chip and evaluate its feasibility for SiPM readout in high-granularity crystal ECAL, a beamtest was conducted using scintillating crystals exposed to electron beams. Beamtest results showed that the chip exhibits a promising performance in terms of a good signal-to-noise ratio and a relatively large dynamic range.</description>

      <title>Prototype acoustic positioning system for the Pacific Ocean Neutrino Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13323v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the design and initial performance characterization of the prototype acoustic positioning system intended for the Pacific Ocean Neutrino Experiment. It comprises novel piezo-acoustic receivers with dedicated filtering- and amplification electronics installed in P-ONE instruments and is complemented by a commercial system comprised of cabled and autonomous acoustic pingers for sub-sea installation manufactured by Sonardyne Ltd. We performed an in-depth characterization of the acoustic receiver electronics and their acoustic sensitivity when integrated into P-ONE pressure housings. These show absolute sensitivities of up to $-125\,$dB re V$^2/\mu$Pa$^2$ in a frequency range of $10-40\,$kHz. We furthermore conducted a positioning measurement campaign in the ocean by deploying three autonomous acoustic pingers on the seafloor, as well as a cabled acoustic interrogator and a P-ONE prototype module deployed from a ship. Using a simple peak-finding detection algorithm, we observe high accuracy in the tracking of relative ranging times at approximately $230-280\,\mu$s at distances of up to $1600\,$m, which is sufficient for positioning detectors in a cubic-kilometer detector and which can be further improved with more involved detection algorithms. The tracking accuracy is further confirmed by independent ranging of the Sonardyne system and closely follows the ship's drift in the wind measured by GPS. The absolute positioning shows the same tracking accuracy with its absolute precision only limited by the large uncertainties of the deployed pinger positions on the seafloor.</description>

      <title>Predicting the cryogenic performance of superconducting detectors by their visual properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02357v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The testing and quality assurance of cryogenic superconducting detectors is a time- and labor-intensive process. As experiments deploy increasingly larger arrays of detectors, new methods are needed for performing this testing quickly. Here, we propose a process for flagging under-performing detector wafers before they are ever tested cryogenically. Detectors are imaged under an optical microscope, and computer vision techniques are used to analyze the images, searching for visual defects and other predictors of poor performance. Pipeline performance is verified via a suite of images with simulated defects, yielding a detection accuracy of 98.6%. Lastly, results from running the pipeline on prototype microwave kinetic inductance detectors from the planned SPT-3G+ experiment are presented.</description>

      <title>Asymmetrical cavity design that bypasses mode mixings in axion haloscope experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01108v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Microwave cavities used in axion haloscope experiments typically employ a tuning rod as a means to widen the range of resonance frequencies at which it is sensitive to axion-to-photon conversion. A realistic tuning mechanism requires a gap between the cavity end caps and the tuning rod to ensure movement, and causes some modes to hybridize with the resonant mode that is being tracked for the experiment. These so-called mode mixings lead to gaps in the frequency range that practically lose sensitivity to axions. In order to solve this problem, we present a cavity design which, for two tuning rod configurations corresponding to a lower and higher frequency range, have a dielectric rod inserted at a specific location that makes the cavity asymmetrical. Moving the tuning rod closer to the dielectric insert changes the location and frequency of the mode mixing compared to when it is farther away from it. This design is easily realizable in practical experiments and makes possible an axion dark matter search with minimal loss in sensitivity due to mode mixings. We also show that the same design has the same desired effect when cavity dimensions are scaled down to be smaller and are at higher resonance frequencies.</description>

      <title>Error-Free Demodulation of Pixelated Interferograms: Updated review and circumstantial evidence of plagiarism by 4D Technology Corporation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14927v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper examines the historical development that led to error-free phase demodulation of pixelated spatial-carrier interferograms between 2004 and 2010. It also evaluates evidence suggesting that 4D Technology Corporation (4DTC), in their SPIE 7790 publication [18], may have adopted key concepts from a manuscript submitted by Servin and collaborators, which at that time was still under peer review [17]. We analyze 4DTC algorithms based on 2x2 and 3x3 spatial convolution phase shifting methods (SC-PSA), developed from 2004 to 2009 [9-15], and show that they were fundamentally limited to narrow bandwidth fringe demodulation. Notably, only one 4DTC paper [13] acknowledged major phase errors when these methods were applied to wideband pixelated fringes, but the problem remained unsolved. In 2010, the team at Centro de Investigaciones en Optica (CIO), led by Servin, entered the field [16,17]. At that point, CIO and 4DTC were the only two known groups pursuing error free demodulation of wideband pixelated interferograms. In June 2010, Servin et al submitted to Optics Express [17] the error free solution introducing a new method: the complex fringe-carrier product followed by step-edge low-pass Fourier filtering. This approach fully superseded the 2x2 and 3x3 SC-PSAs used by 4DTC [9-15], reaching the theoretical slope limit for pixelated sensors. Given that 4DTC paper [18] was presented just seven weeks after Servin submission [17], and only these two groups were working on this problem, it is plausible that 4DTC or an affiliate had early access to the submission. The circumstantial evidence suggests that core ideas from [17] were incorporated into 4DTC August presentation [18]. This paper retraces that scientific path and examines the ethical implications of uncredited appropriation in optical research.</description>
