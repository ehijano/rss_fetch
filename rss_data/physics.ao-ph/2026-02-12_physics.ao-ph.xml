      <title>Insights from Ex-Typhoon Halong (2025) -- An Arctic Cyclone of Tropical Origin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An Arctic cyclone, Ex-Typhoon Halong, produced strong winds and devastating flooding in southwestern Alaska during 11-12 October 2025. This study examines the evolution of Halong after its transition into an extratropical cyclone through the analysis of ERA5 reanalysis and WRF model simulations. It is found that warm sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies over the western North Pacific preconditioned ex-Halong for intensification by increasing water-vapor content and reducing static stability. Quasi-geostrophic lifting associated with a subsequent interaction with another extratropical cyclone led to the rapid deepening of ex-Halong. This case demonstrates that tropical cyclones can transition into extratropical systems that are intensified by anomalously warm ocean waters, exacerbating impacts in high latitudes. Further analyses indicate that an increasing fraction of Alaskan cyclones has originated in tropical latitudes (south of 30{\deg}N) in recent decades. In particular, the frequency of Arctic cyclones of tropical origin increased by a factor of four in August and by a factor of three in September during 1980-2025 compared with 1940-1979.</description>

      <title>Collective and nonlinear structure of wind power correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe the correlation structure of wind power fluctuations in a farm of 80 turbines, sampled over 5 years. We report the presence of universal, collective, and nonlinear correlations, responsible for the excess persistency and intermittency of farm-aggregated power output. A first cross-correlation analysis of turbine production reveals a dynamical scaling transition (\`a la Family-Vicszek) from local decoherence to large-scale turbulence-driven scaling, and responsible for the geographical smoothing effect, previously reported beyond farm scale [M. M. Bandi, Phys. Rev. Lett. 118, 028301 (2017)]. A second bivariate analysis shows the long-range correlation of non-Gaussian features, responsible for their amplification in total farm output. These findings provide a new perspective on wind power variability, highlighting the importance of nonlinear correlations in power production dynamics. By better characterizing these fluctuations, our results can inform strategies for grid management, storage optimization, and wind farm design, ultimately improving the integration of wind energy into modern power systems.</description>

      <title>Near-inertial waves enhance vertical transport at ocean fronts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23460v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interactions between near-inertial waves (NIWs) and submesoscale currents in the surface ocean are challenging to deconvolve due to their overlapping temporal and spatial scales. The frequency of NIW is modulated by the relative vorticity, $\zeta$, of submesoscale currents, which varies between positive and negative $\zeta$ of $O(f)$ on spatial scales of 1 -- 10~$km$, particularly across fronts where the horizontal buoyancy gradient, $\nabla_H b$, is intensified. The effective NIW frequency $f_{\scriptstyle{eff}} = f + \zeta/2$ can therefore also vary by $O(f)$ on these scales, causing the waves to be out of phase. This generates periodic convergence and divergence in the surface layer, particularly at fronts. The resulting vertical motion, known as inertial pumping, is traditionally considered to be reversible. However, the strong vertical shear of the horizontal velocity at fronts, $v_z \sim |\nabla_H b|/f$, implies that not all of the water that is pumped downward will return. We examine the effect of this asymmetry on the vertical transport of tracers with an ambient vertical gradient, analogous to biogeochemical tracers, such as oxygen and dissolved organic carbon. Using numerical simulations of an unstable front forced by NIW, we demonstrate that inertial pumping can lead to net vertical tracer transport. Spectral analysis of the vertical tracer flux given by the covariance between tracer and vertical velocity anomalies reveals that the interaction of strong NIW with submesoscale currents enhances the vertical exchange at the front on both the sub-inertial and inertial time scales.</description>
