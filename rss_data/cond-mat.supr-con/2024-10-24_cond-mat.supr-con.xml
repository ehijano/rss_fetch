      <title>Impurity States in D-wave Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The structure of the order parameter and the excitation spectrum are investigated for isolated impurities in d-wave superconductors. Atomic scale impurities, or defects, scatter quasiparticles and lead to local suppression (pair-breaking) near the impurity. The pair-breaking effect arises from the formation of quasiparticle states bound to the impurity. The corresponding reduction in spectral weight in the pair condensate is responsible for pair-breaking. The formation of the bound state is due to multiple Andreev scattering by the combined effects of potential scattering, which leads to changes in momentum of the scattered quasiparticle, and the anisotropy of the d-wave order on the Fermi surface. The spectral weight of the bound state decays exponentially away from the impurity on a length scale $\xi_{*}=\hbar v_f/ \sqrt{|\Delta({\bf p}_f)|^2-\varepsilon_{*}^2}$, where $\varepsilon_{*}$ is the energy of the impurity state. The continuum spectrum exhibits Tomasch oscillations due to the interference between Andreev reflected particle- and hole-like quasiparticles.</description>

      <title>High resistance of superconducting TiN thin films against environmental attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconductors, an essential class of functional materials, hold a vital position in both fundamental science and practical applications. However, most superconductors, including MgB$_2$, Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$, and FeSe, are highly sensitive to environmental attacks (such as water and moist air), hindering their wide applications. More importantly, the surface physical and chemical processes of most superconductors in various environments remain poorly understood. Here, we comprehensively investigate the high resistance of superconducting titanium nitride (TiN) epitaxial films against acid and alkali attacks. Unexpectedly, despite immersion in acid and alkaline solutions for over 7 days, the crystal structure and superconducting properties of TiN films remain stable, as demonstrated by high-resolution X-ray diffraction, electrical transport, atomic force microscopy, and scanning electron microscope. Furthermore, combining scanning transmission electron microscopy analysis with density functional theory calculations revealed the corrosion mechanisms: acid corrosions lead to the creation of numerous defects due to the substitution of Cl ions for N anions, whereas alkaline environments significantly reduce the film thickness through the stabilization of OH$^\ast$ adsorbates. Our results uncover the unexpected stability and durability of superconducting materials against environmental attacks, highlighting their potential for enhanced reliability and longevity in diverse applications.</description>

      <title>Liquid Metal Printed Superconducting Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the discovery of superconductor one hundred years ago, tremendous theoretical and technological progresses have been achieved. The zero resistance and complete diamagnetism of superconducting materials promise many possibilities in diverse fields. However, the complexity and expensive manufacturing costs associated with the time-consuming superconductor fabrication process may retard their practices in a large extent. Here, via liquid metal printing we proposed to quickly fabricate superconducting electronics which can work at the prescribed cryogenic temperatures. By way of the room temperature fluidity of liquid metal composite inks, such one-step printing allows to pattern various superconducting circuits on the desired substrate. As the first-ever conceptual trial, the most easily available gallium-based liquid alloy inks were particularly adopted to composite with copper particles to achieve superconductivity under specific temperatures around 6.4K. Further, a series of liquid metal alloy and particles loaded composites were screened out and comparatively interpreted regarding their superconducting properties and potential values as printable inks in fabricating superconducting devices. The cost-effective feature and straightforward adaptability of the fabrication principle were evaluated. This work suggests an easy-going way for fabricating ending user superconducting devices, which may warrant more promising investigations and practices in the coming time.</description>

      <title>Finite-Momentum Pairing State in Unconventional Rashba Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In systems with unconventional Rashba bands, we propose that a finite-momentum pairing state can emerge without the need for an external magnetic field. We analyze the phase transition from a zero-momentum Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) state to a finite-momentum pairing state using a microscopic interaction model. We demonstrate that the coexistence of zero-momentum and Larkin-Ovchinnikov (LO)-type pairings in different channels provides a well understanding of recent experimental observations of pair-density-wave (PDW) states. Furthermore, we propose that an s-wave BCS superconductor-unconventional Rashba metal (SC-URM) junction can generate an LO-type pairing state via an orbital-selective proximity effect. This nontrivial state can be detected by measuring the Josephson current in an SC-URM-SC junction or through Josephson scanning tunneling microscopy/spectrosscopy (JSTM/S). Our results reveal that the internal multi-orbital degrees of freedom play a crucial role in facilitating finite-momentum pairing states.</description>

      <title>Mystery of superconductivity in FeTe films and the role of neighboring layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the discovery of superconductivity in the Fe(Te,Se) system, it has been a general consensus that the end member of FeTe is not superconducting. Nonetheless, in recent years, there have been reports of superconducting FeTe films, but the origin of their superconductivity remains mysterious. Here, we provide the first comprehensive review of all the reported FeTe films regarding the relationship between their superconductivity and neighboring layers. Based on this review, we show that telluride neighboring layers are the key to superconducting FeTe films. Then, with additional new studies, we show that stoichiometric Te content, which can be readily achieved in FeTe films with the assistance of neighboring telluride layers, might be crucial to stabilizing the superconductivity in this system. This work provides insights into the underlying mechanism behind superconductivity in FeTe films and sheds light on the critical role of neighboring layers and stoichiometry control toward manipulating topological superconductivity in FeTe heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Magnetic field sorting of superconducting graphite particles with T$_c$$&gt;$400K</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been claimed that graphite hosts superconductivity at room temperature, although all efforts to isolate it have been vain. Here we report a separation method that uses magnetic field gradients to sort the superconducting from normal grains out of industrial graphite powders. We have obtained a concentrate of above room temperature superconducting particles. Electrical resistance measurements on agglomerates of sorted grains of three types of graphite show transition temperatures up to T$_{c{_{onset}}} \sim$ 700K with zero resistance up to $\sim$ 500K. Magnetization measurements confirm these values through jumps at \textit{T$_c$} in the zero field cooled curves, and by the occurrence diamagnetic hysteretic cycles shrinking with temperature. Our results open the door towards the study of above room temperature superconducting ill-stacked graphite phases.</description>

      <title>Magnetization texture imprints produced by flux avalanches in ferromagnet/insulator/superconductor heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetic textures generated by a perpendicularly applied magnetic field at the ferromagnetic layer of $Co/Al_{2}O_{3}/Nb$ thin film heterostructures are investigated using magneto-optical imaging and micromagnetic simulations. It is observed that the stray field caused by flux avalanches in the superconducting layer prints out a non-trivial in-plane texture in the cobalt layer, which remains stable up to temperatures much above the Nb critical temperature. These textures mimic quite closely the dendritic thermomagnetic flux avalanches that penetrate the Nb layer from its edges. For low cobalt thickness, the filamentary magnetic textures occur in pairs with opposite polarity. The previous in-plane magnetization determines the relative location of the magnetic filaments with respect to the avalanche position. Micromagnetic simulations solving the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation confirm the interpretation given for the experimental findings.</description>

      <title>Rare-Earth Chalcogenides: An Inspiring Playground For Exploring Frustrated Magnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rare-earth chalcogenide $ARECh_{2}$ family ($A =$ alkali metal or monovalent ions, $RE =$ rare earth, $Ch =$ chalcogen) has emerged as a paradigmatic platform for studying frustrated magnetism on a triangular lattice. The family members exhibit a variety of ground states, from quantum spin liquid to exotic ordered phases, providing fascinating insight into quantum magnetism. Their simple crystal structure and chemical tunability enable systematic exploration of competing interactions in quantum magnets. Recent neutron scattering and thermodynamic studies have revealed rich phase diagrams and unusual excitations, refining theoretical models of frustrated systems. This review provides a succinct introduction to $ARECh_{2}$ research. It summarizes key findings on crystal structures, single-ion physics, magnetic Hamiltonians, ground states, and low-energy excitations. By highlighting current developments and open questions, we aim to catalyze further exploration and deeper physical understanding on this frontier of quantum magnetism.</description>

      <title>Connecting High-Field and High-Pressure Superconductivity in UTe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The existence of multiple superconducting phases induced by either pressure or magnetic field is one of the most striking features of superconductivity of UTe$_2$, among the many unusual superconducting properties of this system. Here we report thermodynamic measurements of the superconducting phase diagram combining pressure and magnetic fields up to 30 T. We show that the ambient pressure, high-field, superconducting phase evolves continuously with pressure to join the high-pressure, zero-field superconducting phase. This proves that these two phases are one and the same, and must have the same order parameter.</description>

      <title>Anodization-free fabrication process for high-quality cross-type Josephson tunnel junctions based on a Nb/Al-AlO$_x$/Nb trilayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01806v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Josephson tunnel junctions form the basis for various superconducting electronic devices. For this reason, enormous efforts are routinely taken to establish and later on maintain a scalable and reproducible wafer-scale manufacturing process for high-quality Josephson junctions. Here, we present an anodization-free fabrication process for Nb/Al-AlO$_x$/Nb cross-type Josephson junctions that requires only a small number of process steps and that is intrinsically compatible with wafer-scale fabrication. We show that the fabricated junctions are of very high-quality and, compared to other junction types, exhibit not only a significantly reduced capacitance but also an almost rectangular critical current density profile. Our process hence enables the usage of low capacitance Josephson junctions for superconducting electronic devices such as ultra-low noise dc-SQUIDs, microwave SQUID multiplexers based on non-hysteretic rf-SQUIDs and RFSQ circuits.</description>

      <title>Magic angle of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$: Optimizing correlation-driven superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14926v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding of unconventional superconductivity is crucial for engineering materials with specific order parameters or elevated superconducting transition temperatures. However, for many materials, the pairing mechanism and symmetry of the order parameter remain unclear: reliable and efficient methods of predicting the order parameter and its response to tuning parameters are lacking. Here, we investigate the response of superconductivity in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ to structural distortions via the random phase approximation (RPA) and functional renormalization group (FRG), starting from realistic models of the electronic structure. Our results suggest that RPA misses the interplay of competing fluctuation channels. FRG reproduces key experimental findings. We predict a magic octahedral rotation angle, maximizing the superconducting $T_c$ and a dominant $d_{x^2-y^2}$ pairing symmetry. To enable experimental verification, we provide calculations of the phase-referenced Bogoliubov Quasiparticle Interference imaging. Our work demonstrates a designer approach to tuning unconventional superconductivity with relevance and applicability for a wide range of quantum materials.</description>
