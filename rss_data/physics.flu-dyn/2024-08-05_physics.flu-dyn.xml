      <title>Mesoscopic hydrodynamic model for spreading, sliding and coarsening compound drops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the mesoscopic hydrodynamic description of the dynamics of sessile compound drops, i.e., of drops that consist of two immiscible nonvolatile partially wetting liquids and are situated on a smooth rigid solid substrate. We briefly discuss and complete existing models employing a gradient dynamics approach. Basing the underlying free energy on capillarity and wettability contributions for all relevant interfaces in their full-curvature variant we establish transparent consistency relations between macroscopic and mesoscopic parameters. In consequence, we obtain mesoscopic Neumann and Young laws that are also fully consistent with the macroscopic ones. In particular, we discuss the minimal requirements for the wetting energy that ensure the full spectrum of macroscopic parameters is addressed by the mesoscopic model. Having established the dynamic model in long-wave and full-curvature variants, the latter is employed to illustrate the usage of the mesoscopic model. As examples, we use the spreading of individual compound drops on one-dimensional horizontal substrates, sliding compound drops on one-dimensional inclined substrates, and the coarsening of drop ensembles on one- and two-dimensional horizontal substrates. In each case, the discussion emphasizes occurring qualitative changes in the drop configurations.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the bi-stable character of stealthy hydrogen-air flames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-lean hydrogen-air flames propagating in narrow gaps, under the influence of cold walls and high preferential diffusion, can form two distinct isolated structures. They exhibit either circular or double-cell shapes and propagate at different speeds, with the latter roughly doubling in size and traveling speed to the former. Hydrogen mass diffusivity, convective effects and conductive heat losses are the physical mechanisms that explain the alterations in morphology and propagation speed. In previous experiments, Veiga et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 124, 174501 (2020) found these clearly distinguished flame structures for different combinations of equivalence ratio, channel gap and the effect of gravity on the dynamics of upwards and downwards propagating flames in a vertical chamber. Present observations in horizontal channels show the simultaneous appearance of these two stable structures, which arise under identical experimental conditions and conform the first evidence that multiplicity of stable solutions coexists in real devices. To explain the observations, we performed numerical simulations using the simplified model, which show that symmetry-breaking details during the ignition transient explain the concurrent emergence of the two stable configurations. This discovery urges the need to implement additional engineering tools to account for the possibility of formation and propagation of isolated flame kernels at different speeds in hydrogen-fueled systems.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Integral Method for Void Fraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a novel method for the calculation of void fractions in the Computational Fluid Dynamics-Discrete Element Method (CFD-DEM) simulations known as the Gaussian Integral Method (GIM). GIM demonstrates versatility across different types of grids including structured and unstructured polyhedral meshes without the need for any treatment at the boundaries. An optimization method is developed for making GIM grid-independent from resolution and type. The method is validated against experimental data of a fluidized bed. The validation results demonstrate realistic results which resemble experimental data. Furthermore, unstructured polyhedral grids outperformed structured grids of equivalent resolution providing results more aligned with experimental data. The gradient of the void fraction is solved in the CFD solver and is used in the DEM solver for precise estimation of the void fraction at a particle location. In conclusion, GIM provides a solution for void fraction calculations in particulate media simulations with complex geometries applicable to industrial needs.</description>

      <title>Instabilities in strongly shear-thinning viscoelastic flows through channels and tubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The linear stability of a shear-thinning, viscoelastic fluid undergoing any of the canonical rectilinear shear flows, viz., plane Couette flow and pressure-driven flow through a channel or a tube is analyzed in the creeping-flow limit using the White--Metzner model with a power-law variation of the viscosity with shear rate. While two-dimensional disturbances are considered for plane Couette and channel flows, axisymmetric disturbances are considered for pressure-driven flow in a tube. For all these flows, when the shear-thinning exponent is less than $0.3$, there exists an identical instability at wavelengths much smaller than the relevant geometric length scale (gap between the plates or tube radius). There is also a finite-wavelength instability in these configurations governed by the details of the geometry and boundary conditions at the centerline of the channel or tube. The most unstable mode could be either of the short-wave or finite-wavelength instabilities depending on model parameters. For pressure-driven channel flow, it is possible to have sinuous or varicose unstable modes depending on the symmetry of the normal velocity eigenfunction about the channel centerline. This difference in symmetry is relevant only for the finite wavelength instability, in which case sinuous modes turn out to be more unstable, in accordance with experimental observations. In all the three configurations, the short wavelength unstable modes are localized near the walls, and are insensitive to symmetry conditions at the centerline. It is argued that this instability should be a generic feature in any wall-bounded shear flow of strongly shear-thinning viscoelastic fluids. Our predictions for the finite-wavelength instability in pressure-driven channel and pipe flows are in good agreement with experimental observations for the flow of concentrated polymer solutions in these geometries.</description>

      <title>Modelling the three-dimensional, diagnostic anisotropy field of an ice rise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polar ice develops anisotropic crystal orientation fabrics under deformation, yet ice is most often modelled as an isotropic fluid. We present three-dimensional simulations of the crystal orientation fabric of Derwael Ice Rise including the surrounding ice shelf using a crystal orientation tensor evolution equation corresponding to a fixed velocity field. We use a semi-Lagrangian numerical method that constrains the degree of crystal orientation evolution to solve the equations in complex flow areas. We perform four simulations based on previous studies, altering the rate of evolution of the crystal anisotropy and its dependence on a combination of the strain rate and deviatoric stress tensors. We provide a framework for comparison with radar observations of the anisotropy field, outlining areas where the assumption of one vertical eigenvector may not hold and provide resulting errors in measured eigenvalues. We recognise the areas of high horizontal divergence at the ends of the flow divide as important areas to make comparisons with observations. Here, poorly constrained model parameters result in the largest difference in fabric type. These results are important in the planning of future campaigns for gathering data to constrain model parameters and as a link between observations and computationally-efficient, simplified models of anisotropy.</description>

      <title>Entropy conservative discretization of compressible Euler equations with an arbitrary equation of state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study proposes a novel spatial discretization procedure for the compressible Euler equations which guarantees entropy conservation at a discrete level when an arbitrary equation of state is assumed. The proposed method, based on a locally-conservative discretization, guarantees also the spatial conservation of mass, momentum, and total energy and is kinetic energy-preserving. In order to achieve the entropy-conservation property for an arbitrary non-ideal gas, a general strategy is adopted based on the manipulation of discrete balance equations through the imposition of global entropy conservation and the use of a summation by parts rule. The procedure, which is extended to an arbitrary order of accuracy, conducts to a general form of the internal-energy numerical flux which results in a nonlinear function of thermodynamic and dynamic variables and still admits the mass flux as a residual degree of freedom. The effectiveness of the novel entropy-conservative formulation is demonstrated through numerical tests making use of some of the most popular cubic equations of state.</description>

      <title>Numerical study of cavitation bubble dynamics in a flowing tube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cavitation in tubes is a common occurrence in nature and engineering applications. Previous studies of cavitation bubble dynamics mainly consider bubbles in stagnant-water tubes, but the dynamics of cavitation bubbles in tubes with flow is not clear. This study investigates the dynamics of cavitation bubbles in tubes with flow by numerical simulations. The results show that, unlike bubbles in stagnant-water tubes, bubbles under the combined effects of water inflow and tube wall confinement exhibit asymmetric behavior along the axis of the tube. The inflow suppresses the development of the bubble interface near the tube inlet, causing that side of the interface to move with the inflow. In contrast, the expansion and contraction of the bubble and the generation of liquid jets occur on the side near the outlet. This feature results in significant asymmetry in the bubble interface, therefore we introduce a skewness parameter to characterize the difference in length between the left and right parts of the bubble during the bubble evolution. The evolution of the bubble significantly affects the mass flow rate at the outlet of the tube, and even leads to backflow during the bubble contraction process.</description>

      <title>Discovery of Green's function based on symbolic regression with physical hard constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Green's function, serving as a kernel function that delineates the interaction relationships of physical quantities within a field, holds significant research implications across various disciplines. It forms the foundational basis for the renowned Biot-Savart formula in fluid dynamics, the theoretical solution of the pressure Poisson equation, and et al. Despite their importance, the theoretical derivation of the Green's function is both time-consuming and labor-intensive. In this study, we employed DISCOVER, an advanced symbolic regression method leveraging symbolic binary trees and reinforcement learning, to identify unknown Green's functions for several elementary partial differential operators, including Laplace operators, Helmholtz operators, and second-order differential operators with jump conditions. The Laplace and Helmholtz operators are particularly vital for resolving the pressure Poisson equation, while second-order differential operators with jump conditions are essential for analyzing multiphase flows and shock waves. By incorporating physical hard constraints, specifically symmetry properties inherent to these self-adjoint operators, we significantly enhanced the performance of the DISCOVER framework, potentially doubling its efficacy. Notably, the Green's functions discovered for the Laplace and Helmholtz operators precisely matched the true Green's functions. Furthermore, for operators without known exact Green's functions, such as the periodic Helmholtz operator and second-order differential operators with jump conditions, we identified potential Green's functions with solution error on the order of 10^(-10). This application of symbolic regression to the discovery of Green's functions represents a pivotal advancement in leveraging artificial intelligence to accelerate scientific discoveries, particularly in fluid dynamics and related fields.</description>

      <title>A Numerical Technique for Coupling the Momentum and the Continuity Equations for Semi-Implicit 3D Ocean Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semi-implicit methods are powerful and efficient tools for the three-dimensional modeling of coastal and oceanic processes. A semi-implicit finite difference method for 3D hydrostatic primitive equations is presented in this paper. The governing equations are time-discretized with an implicit treatment of barotropic pressure gradient and vertical viscosity. The discretized momentum equations along a water column are coupled with the depth-integrated continuity equation of the column to construct a linear system for free-surface elevations. The novelty of this work lies in formulating an efficient method with the order of complexity O(N) for coupling the momentum and the continuity equations. In this method, the horizontal velocity components are expressed in terms of neighbor free-surface elevations by some simple recursive formulas and then are substituted in the integrated continuity equation.</description>

      <title>PLIC-Net: A Machine Learning Approach for 3D Interface Reconstruction in Volume of Fluid Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The accurate reconstruction of immiscible fluid-fluid interfaces from the volume fraction field is a critical component of geometric Volume of Fluid (VOF) methods. A common strategy is the Piecewise Linear Interface Calculation (PLIC), which fits a plane in each mixed-phase computational cell. However, recent work goes beyond PLIC by using two planes or even a paraboloid. To select such planes or paraboloids, complex optimization algorithms as well as carefully crafted heuristics are necessary. Yet, the potential exists for a well-trained machine learning model to efficiently provide broadly applicable solutions to the interface reconstruction problem at lower costs. In this work, the viability of a machine learning approach is demonstrated in the context of a single plane reconstruction. A feed-forward deep neural network is used to predict the normal vector of a PLIC plane given volume fraction and phasic barycenter data in a $3\times3\times3$ stencil. The PLIC plane is then translated in its cell to ensure exact volume conservation. Our proposed neural network PLIC reconstruction (PLIC-Net) is equivariant to reflections about the Cartesian planes. Training data is analytically generated with $\mathcal{O}(10^6)$ randomized paraboloid surfaces, which allows for sampling a wide range of interface shapes. PLIC-Net is tested in multiphase flow simulations where it is compared to standard (E)LVIRA reconstruction algorithms, and the impact of training data statistics on PLIC-Net's performance is also explored. It is found that PLIC-Net greatly limits the formation of spurious planes and generates cleaner numerical break-up of the interface. Additionally, the computational cost of PLIC-Net is lower than that of (E)LVIRA. These results establish that machine learning is a viable approach to VOF interface reconstruction and is superior to current reconstruction algorithms for some cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2107.13736v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present study, new turbulence closure equations are derived in the light of continuous (often termed second order) phase transition. Closed form Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes equations due to those closure equations are solved numerically for a plane turbulent free jet. There turbulent viscosity is treated as a tensor unlike the eddy viscosity. An overall agreement of the obtained results with the existing literature for the jet flow proves the effectiveness of the new closure equations. Besides, turbulent stresses as a function of normalized mean velocity are found to exhibit their odd and even symmetries which seem to be the manifestations of the free energy symmetry of continuous phase transition.</description>

      <title>Modelling turbulence in axisymmetric wakes: an application to wind turbine wakes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07225v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A novel fast-running model is developed to predict the three-dimensional (3D) distribution of turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) in axisymmetric wake flows. This is achieved by mathematically solving the partial differential equation of the TKE transport using the Green's function method. The developed solution reduces to a double integral that can be computed numerically for a wake prescribed by any arbitrary velocity profile. It is shown that the solution can be further simplified to a single integral for wakes with Gaussian-like velocity-deficit profiles. Wind tunnel experiments were performed to compare model results against detailed 3D laser Doppler anemometry data measured within the wake flow of a porous disk subject to a uniform freestream flow. Furthermore, the new model is used to estimate the TKE distribution at the hub-height level of the rotating non-axisymmetric wake of a model wind turbine immersed in a rough-wall boundary layer. Our results show the important impact of operating conditions on TKE generation in wake flows, an effect not fully captured by existing empirical models. The wind-tunnel data also provide insights into the evolution of important turbulent flow quantities such as turbulent viscosity, mixing length, and the TKE dissipation rate in wake flows. Both mixing length and turbulent viscosity are found to increase with the streamwise distance. The turbulent viscosity however reaches a plateau in the far-wake region. Consistent with the non-equilibrium theory, it is also observed that the normalised energy dissipation rate is not constant, and it increases with the streamwise distance.</description>

Abstract: We develop a quantum representation for Newtonian viscous fluid flows by establishing a mapping between the Navier-Stokes equation (NSE) and the Schr\"odinger-Pauli equation (SPE). The proposed nonlinear SPE incorporates the two-component wave function and the imaginary diffusion. Consequently, classical fluid flow can be interpreted as a non-Hermitian quantum spin system. Using the SPE-based numerical simulation of viscous flows, we demonstrate the quantum/wave-like behavior in flow dynamics. Furthermore, the SPE equivalent to the NSE can facilitate the quantum simulation of fluid dynamics.</description>

      <title>Microscale physics and macroscale convective heat transfer in supercritical fluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04119v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Driven by fundamental thermodynamic efficiency considerations, an emerging trend in the energy and propulsion systems is that the working fluid operates at a pressure above the critical pressure. Energy transport is thus accompanied by dramatic and strongly nonlinear variations of thermophysical properties, which cause abnormal heat transfer behavior and non-ideal gas effects. This situation raises a crucial challenge for the heat exchanger and turbomachinery design, overall energy and exergy efficiency. We aim to provide a multi-scale overview of the flow and thermal behavior of fluid above the critical point: microscopic physics and macroscopic transport. Microscopic physics, i.e. near-critical thermophysical properties, phase transition and fluid dynamics, are introduced. A particular focus will be on the supercritical pseudo boiling process, which is a generalization of classical liquid-vapor phase transitions to non-equilibrium supercritical states. These new perspectives lead to a revised view of the state space. Further, recent results demonstrated the possibility of stable supercritical fluid interfaces without surface tension. On the macroscale, recent progress on the modeling of turbulent flow and convective heat transfer of supercritical fluids are summarized. Direct numerical simulation is able to offer insights into the physics of thermal fluids. We start with a description of fundamental fluid mechanics problems related to supercritical fluids. In addition, the heat transfer deterioration in supercritical fluids is found to be closely connected to the flow relaminarization by the non-uniform body-force. Finally, various modeling approaches such as recently developed advanced Reynolds-averaged turbulence modeling as well as machine-learning methods are summarized.</description>

      <title>One-Dimensional, One-Phase and Two-Phase Eulerian Explicit Shock Tube Simulation Code</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14018v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, a one-dimensional simulation code was developed for both single-phase and two-phase systems, focusing on time-dependent Euler equations for gas and particles. These equations, non-linear hyperbolic conservation laws, describe the dynamics of compressible materials, where body forces, viscous stresses, and heat flux are neglected. The Euler equations were discretized using the finite volume method, and the code was written in MATLAB. To test the accuracy of the computational fluid code, the Sod shock tube problem, a physical analogue of the Riemann problem, was employed. This problem models a pressure discontinuity where high and low-pressure regions are separated by a diaphragm, which breaks at t=0, creating a discontinuity in density as well. Exact solutions were used for code verification. A key focus was on modeling a curtain of particles impacted by a shock wave, relevant to multiphase heterogeneous cylindrical explosion studies by the PSAAP II project. This initiative, funded by the US Department of Energy (DOE) National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) Office of Advanced Simulation and Computing (ASC), involves Sandia National Laboratories and the Center for Compressible Multiphase Turbulence at the University of Florida. The propagation of uncertainties in the maximum density of the particle curtain was studied by varying initial curtain thickness and initial high density. Given the computational expense of multiple code evaluations for uncertainty propagation, a multi-fidelity surrogate model combining low and high-fidelity simulations was implemented. This model facilitated uncertainty propagation using DAKOTA, a flexible and extensible interface between analysis codes and iterative systems analysis methods.</description>

Abstract: We characterize the dynamical instability responsible for the breakdown of regular rows and necklaces of quantized vortices that appear at the interface between two superfluids in relative motion. Making use of a generalized point-vortex model, we identify several mechanisms leading to the suppression of this instability. They include a non-zero mass of the vortex cores, dissipative processes resulting from the interaction between the vortices and the excitations of the superfluid, and the proximity of the vortex array to the sample boundaries. We show that massive vortex cores not only have a mitigating effect on the dynamical instability, but also change the associated scaling law and affect the direction along which it develops. The predictions of our massive and dissipative point-vortex model are eventually compared against recent experimental measurements of the maximum instability growth rate relevant to vortex necklaces in a cold-atom platform.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Scale Boltzmann Equation for Complex Systems of Neutral Gases across All Flow Regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07038v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A Multi-scale Boltzmann Equation (MBE) is found from the gas-kinetic theory and the direct modeling philosophy as a master equation for complex physical systems of neutral gases across all flow regimes, which locates between the continuum limit and the free-molecular limit, covering a vast range of applications such as hypersonic flows over aerospace crafts and delicate flows around MEMS. The most explicit characteristic of MBE is evolving the variable observation time in the expression, which distinguishes the MBE from the single-scale master or governing equation where a fixed scale is implied in the assumptions. The fundamental properties of MBE, such as the asymptotic property, are proved theoretically, while a concise numerical scheme is developed for MBE to demonstrate its validity by benchmark multi-scale problems.</description>
