      <title>Effects of Lighter-than-QCD Axions on Neutron Star Tidal Deformability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finite density corrections to the lighter-than-QCD axion can invert the effective axion potential, sourcing a non-trivial axion field inside dense objects. We perform the first numerical study of the complete dynamics of the lighter-than-QCD axion in a neutron star in 1+1 general relativity, extending the region of analysis to low-mass axions with kilometer-scale Compton wavelengths. We calculate gravitational effects of the axion field on the neutron star and show that for a broad range of axion masses and decay constants, neutron star properties, such as the mass, radius, and compactness, are affected at the order-1 level. This result indicates that approximate universal tidal deformability-compactness relation for neutron stars is non-trivially broken and can serve as a probe of lighter-than-QCD axions, independent of the unknown nuclear equation of state. We comment on the potential for axion studies with future gravitational-wave observations of neutron stars and applications of this work to other new physics signatures.</description>

      <title>Stripped-Envelope Supernovae for QCD Axion Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: QCD axions would be copiously produced in the proto-neutron star formed in a core-collapse supernova (SN). After escaping, they would convert into gamma rays in the Galactic magnetic field and, as recently shown, in that of the progenitor star itself. Here, we show that Type Ibc SNe -- whose progenitors have lost their hydrogen or even helium envelopes -- are the optimal targets for this search. The stripped progenitors are much more compact, and show larger magnetic fields than both red and blue supergiants, the progenitors of Type IIP/L SNe. If the next galactic SN is of Type Ibc, Fermi-LAT or a similar gamma-ray satellite might be able to discover the QCD axion down to masses as small as $m_a\simeq 10^{-4}\,\rm eV$ (Peccei-Quinn scale $f_a\simeq 10^{11} \,\rm GeV$).</description>

      <title>Light-Front Transverse Nucleon Charge and Magnetisation Densities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nucleon elastic electromagnetic form factors obtained using both the three-body and quark + fully-interacting-diquark pictures of nucleon structure are employed to calculate an array of light-front transverse densities for the proton and neutron and their dressed valence-quark constituents, viz. flavour separations of the proton and neutron results. These two complementary descriptions of nucleon structure deliver mutually compatible predictions, which match expectations based on modern parametrisations of available data, where such are available. Amongst other things, it is found that transverse-plane valence $u$- and $d$-quark Dirac radii are practically indistinguishable; but regarding kindred Pauli radii, the $d$ quark value is roughly 10% greater than that of the $u$-quark. Moreover, magnetically, the valence $d$ quark is far more active than the valence $u$ quark, probably because it has much greater orbital angular momentum. Both pictures of nucleon structure agree in predicting that, in a polarised nucleon, the transverse-plane charge densities are no longer rotationally invariant. Instead, for a $+\hat x$ polarised nucleon, positive charge is displaced in the $-\hat y$ direction, with the opposite effect for negative charge.</description>

      <title>Production Mechanisms of isoscalar pseudotensor mesons in pion and kaon induced reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent observation of the X(2600) resonance by the BESIII Collaboration has motivated a renewed interest in the spectroscopy of light mesons, particularly pseudotensor states. However, a significant theoretical gap exists in the poorly explored spectrum of isoscalar pseudotensor mesons, where several predicted radial excitations remain unobserved. To address this, we investigate the production of four such states ($\eta_2(4D)$, $\eta'_2(2D)$, $\eta'_2(3D)$, and $\eta'_2(4D)$) employing an effective Lagrangian approach combined with Regge trajectory phenomenology to describe the high-energy behavior of the reactions. Our calculations reveal a distinct production selectivity: the $\eta_2(4D)$ state is more prominent in pion induced ($\pi^- p \to \eta_2 n$) reactions, whereas the $\eta'_2(2D, 3D, 4D)$ states are preferentially produced in kaon induced ($K^- p \to \eta_2 \Lambda$) processes. Moreover, the total cross sections for these states exhibit characteristic peaks at specific beam momenta, providing clear kinematic windows for their discovery. This study provides the first comprehensive theoretical predictions for the production cross sections of these predicted mesons, offering crucial guidance for future experimental searches.</description>

      <title>Hybrid to Quarkonia transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid quarkonia -exotic hadrons with explicit gluonic degrees of freedom- have gained increasing attention in hadron spectroscopy, particularly with the ongoing discovery of new XYZ mesons. In this work, we update the spectrum of heavy hybrid mesons in the charmonium and bottomonium sectors using the Born-Oppenheimer Effective Field Theory framework, by incorporating the latest lattice QCD results for hybrid static potentials. We refine earlier calculations and analyze allowed transitions from hybrids to conventional quarkonia, including both spin-conserved and spin-flip decays. We carry out a comprehensive error analysis and discuss the reliability of our results. We compare them to experimental data of the Particle Data Group, which allows us to identify hybrid candidates among the observed XYZ states. We provide hybrid or quarkonium interpretations for nearly all heavy isospin-zero mesons observed and incorporate new hybrid candidates.</description>

      <title>Exploring pion emission properties of (strange) hidden-charm molecular pentaquarks in a chiral quark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The internal structure of the exotic $P_c$ and $P_{cs}$ pentaquarks remains an open question. To address this, we demonstrate that pion emission serves as a sensitive probe by calculating its properties within a molecular scenario using the chiral quark model and coupled-channel effects. Our results reveal a strong dependence of the decay widths on the internal structure and spatial wave functions. We therefore expect this study to stimulate experimental measurements of these decays, which are crucial for determining the nature of these states and guiding the search for further molecular partners.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective pion-constituent quark couplings induced by relatively weak magnetic fields are calculated, being that they disappear in the vacuum. In particular, couplings to a scalar and a vector constituent quark currents are investigated. These couplings can correspond to a fluctuation of the neutral pion into a scalar quark-antiquark meson and to a vector meson respectively. Some possible phenomenological implications are discussed.</description>

      <title>Inclusive $J/\psi$ productions in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}=$ 5.02, 7, and 13 TeV with the PACIAE model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the inclusive $J/\psi$ productions in proton-proton collisions at center-of-mass energies $\sqrt{s} = 5.02$, 7, and 13 TeV using the PACIAE 4.0 model. This model extends PYTHIA 8.3 by incorporating partonic and hadronic rescatterings before and after hadronization, respectively. Several $J/\psi$ production mechanisms are considered: the leading-order non-relativistic QCD (NRQCD) color-singlet and color-octet contributions, the cluster collapse mechanism, and the non-prompt $J/\psi$ from $b$-hadron decays. The simulated inclusive $J/\psi$ transverse momentum ($p_{\rm T}$) differential cross sections agree well with the experimental data at both the middle and forward rapidities. For the $J/\psi$ yield, the dominant contribution comes from the NRQCD channel, while the cluster collapse and non-prompt processes provide relatively minor contributions. A decomposition of the NRQCD component, comprising direct production from the parton hard scattering and feed-down from $\psi(2S)$, $\chi_{c0}$, $\chi_{c1}$, and $\chi_{c2}$, reveals that at low (high) $p_{\rm T}$ the dominant contributions come from the direct production and $\chi_{c2}$ ($\chi_{c1}$) feed-down. The $\psi(2S)$ feed-down fraction is 8-9$\%$, while the $\chi_{c0}$ contribution is around 2-3$\%$. The influence of the partonic and hadronic rescatterings is also examined. The partonic rescattering exhibits negligible impact on the $J/\psi$ yields across all production mechanisms. In contrast, the hadronic rescattering suppresses the $J/\psi$ productions from both the NRQCD and cluster collapse mechanisms, while leaving the non-prompt $J/\psi$ yield almost unaffected.</description>

      <title>Mass spectra and Mott transitions of neutral mesons at finite temperature and magnetic field in frame of three-flavor Polyakov-extended Nambu-Jona-Lasino model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mass spectra and Mott transitions of neutral mesons $K_0, \pi_0, \eta, \eta'$ at finite temperature and magnetic field are investigated in a three-flavor PNJL model. We focus on the effect of gluons, which is simulated by the Polyakov potential and the inverse magnetic catalysis (IMC) effect, which is mimicked by using a magnetic field dependent coupling constant. Mass spectra show similar structure when introducing the contribution of Polyakov potential and IMC effect. The mass of $K_0$ meson $m_{K_0}$ is controlled by chiral symmetry breaking and restoration. It increases with temperature in the low temperature region, and shows a mass jump at the Mott transition. Further increasing temperature, $m_{K_0}$ firstly decreases and then increases with temperature. $\pi_0$ meson is not only the pseudo-Goldstone boson of chiral symmetry breaking, but also influenced by the flavor mixing of $\pi_0-\eta-\eta'$. The behavior of $m_{\pi_0}$ is different from $m_{K_0}$ only at high temperature region, which decreases with temperature. For $\eta$ and $\eta'$ mesons, they are affected by both the $U_A(1)$ anomaly and the flavor mixing of $\pi_0-\eta-\eta'$. The mass of $\eta$ meson $m_{\eta}$ decreases with temperature in low temperature region and then shows a jump at its Mott transition. After that $m_{\eta}$ firstly decreases and later increases with temperature. $\eta'$ mesons is a resonant state in vacuum and in medium, and its mass $m_{\eta'}$ continuously decreases and then increases with temperature. The mass jumps of $K_0, \pi_0, \eta$ mesons are caused by the dimension reduction of the constituent quarks under external magnetic field. In the PNJL model, the Mott transition temperature of $K_0,\ \pi_0$ mesons ($ \eta$ meson) decrease (increases) with magnetic field. The IMC effect leads to the lower value for meson Mott transition temperature.</description>

      <title>Systematic analysis of $D_{(s)}$ meson semi-leptonic decays in the covariant light-front quark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The weak decays of the $D_{(s)}$ meson provide a pivotal platform to advance our understanding of the Standard Model (SM) and to explore New Physics (NP). In recent years, experiments have collected a significant amount of data on the $D_{(s)}$ meson decays, particularly from BESIII, which provides substantial support for theoretical research. In this work, we systematically investigate the semi-leptonic decays of $D_{(s)}$ meson to pseudoscalar (P), scalar (S), vector (V), and axial-vector (A) mesons within the framework of the covariant light-front quark model (CLFQM). We calculate the form factors of the transitions $D_{(s)}\to P,S,V,A$ and the branching ratios of the corresponding semi-leptonic decays, then compare them with experimental data and results from other theoretical models. The form factor values of the transitions $D_{(s)}\to P, V$ obtained from the CLFQM are consistent with those of other theoretical models and available data in most cases. However, significant discrepancies are found in some specific $D_{(s)}\to S,A$ transitions, such as $D\to a_0(980), a_0(1450)$ and $D_{(s)} \to K_{1B}$, compared to other theoretical calculations. The predicted branching ratios for the semi-leptonic decays $D\to P(V)\ell\nu_\ell$ with $\ell=e,\mu$ agree well with experimental data and other theoretical results in most decay channels, validating the reliability of the model. However, for some $D\to S(V)\ell\nu_\ell$ decays, tension exists among different theoretical predictions and experimental results. Further clarification of such differences is necessary. Our study provides important insights into the internal structures for some scalar and axial-vector mesons and serves as a theoretical reference for future experiments.</description>

      <title>Chiral Evolution and Femtoscopic Signatures of the $K_1(1270)$ Resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of the axial-vector resonance $K_1(1270)$ within the unitarized chiral perturbation theory, focusing on its two-pole structure and manifestation in femtoscopic observables. By considering the dominant $\rho K$ and $K^*\pi$ coupled channels, we reproduce the well-established double-pole structure and trace the chiral evolution of both poles as functions of the pion mass, using the vector-meson mass trajectories fitted to lattice-QCD data and experimental values. The lower pole, dominantly coupled to $K^*\pi$, evolves from an above-threshold resonance to a virtual or bound state with increasing pion mass. In comparison, the higher pole, dominantly coupled to $\rho K$, moves downward in energy, reflecting the strengthening of the chiral attraction. The influence of the finite vector-meson widths is systematically examined, showing that their inclusion smooths the pole trajectories without altering their qualitative behavior. Furthermore, femtoscopic CFs are calculated for all relevant vector-pseudoscalar channels in both charged sectors. The results exhibit distinct resonance and bound-state features consistent with the two-pole dynamics. The weak impact of higher channels, such as $\omega \bar{K}$, $\bar{K}^*\eta$, and $\phi\bar{K}$, confirms that the simplified two-channel treatment captures the essential dynamics of the $K_1(1270)$ resonance. This study demonstrates that combining chiral extrapolation and femtoscopic correlation analyses provides a powerful and complementary framework for connecting lattice-QCD calculations, chiral effective theory, and experimental measurements, offering new insights into the molecular nature and chiral origin of the $K_1(1270)$ resonance.</description>

      <title>Probing Saturon-like Limits in QCD Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-occupancy QCD matter enters a saturated regime when its entropy or occupancy approaches the unitarity bound $\sim 1/\alpha$, the ``saturon" criterion. We test this criterion for protons and nuclei at small $x$ using analytic and numerical solutions of the BK equation. From these solutions we construct the gluon occupancy $N_g(x)$ and a thermodynamic entropy $S(x)$ via an Unruh-like temperature $T = Q_s/(2\pi)$ and an emergent gluon mass $M_g \sim Q_s$. For protons, both $N_g$ and $S$ rise toward small $x$ yet stay below $1/\alpha_s$ in our baseline setup. For nuclei, by contrast, the nuclear entropy $S_A$ attains the $1/\alpha_s$ benchmark in a small-$x$ window where the proton does not. This singles out nuclei as the natural environment to search for saturon-like behavior and motivates precision small-$x$ measurements and high-occupancy $pA$ and $AA$ collisions.</description>

      <title>Correction to $CP$-asymmetry in $\Upsilon(4S)$ decays due to the admixture of $B^0 \bar B^0$ in a $C$-even state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $BB$ pairs from $\Upsilon(4S)\to BB$ decays are in $C$-odd state. However, there is a small admixture of the $C$-even state and it modifies the time dependent $CP$-asymmetry. The $C$-even component appears due to soft photon emission, breaking the pure $C$-odd nature of the initial state. Using the two-particle wave function formalism, we derive analytical expressions for $CP$-asymmetry in both pure and mixed $C$-parity states. We emphasize the strong energy dependence of the admixture magnitude.</description>

      <title>Parton distributions with higher twist and jet power corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a global determination of parton distribution functions (PDFs) that accounts for higher twist corrections in deep-inelastic scattering (DIS) and linear power corrections for single inclusive jet and dijet production data from the LHC. We determine these corrections and their associated correlated uncertainties using a methodology based on the theory covariance formalism, previously used to account for nuclear uncertainties and missing higher order uncertainties (MHOUs) in global PDF determinations. We then study the impact of the power corrections on the extracted PDFs, and demonstrate an improved description of the data due to a reduced sensitivity to DIS data in the low-$x$ region where higher twist uncertainties are relatively large, and a reduced sensitivity to single inclusive jet data at relatively low $p_T$, where linear power corrections can be significant. Finally, we assess the impact of power corrections on observables relevant to LHC phenomenology, including Higgs production via gluon fusion, and the determination of $\alpha_s$. We find that these effects, while small, can be significant, improving perturbative convergence.</description>

      <title>Charged Higgs bosons associated with neutral gauge bosons at future multi--TeV muon colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first results for charged Higgs pair production associated with neutral gauge bosons at future multi--TeV muon colliders are presented within the framework of the Two-Higgs-Doublet Model. In the phenomenological studies for the production processes, we first update the parameter space of the Type-X Two-Higgs-Doublet Model. From the viable regions of the parameter space, we compute the production cross sections, including all two-body decay modes of the charged Higgs boson. We mention that all two-body decay modes of the charged Higgs boson are evaluated with one-loop electroweak corrections, with two-loop QCD corrections also included for the decays of the charged Higgs into two fermions. The signal significances are also examined for several benchmark points within the updated parameter space. It is worth emphasizing that the production cross sections used for computing the significances in this work include initial-state radiation corrections up to two-loop order. With the help of the high integrated luminosity planned for future multi--TeV muon colliders, the production signals can be observed with a statistical significance exceeding $5\sigma$ for several selected points within the allowed parameter space.</description>

      <title>Impact of conversion-driven processes on singlet-doublet Majorana dark matter relic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The singlet-doublet dark matter model offers a rich framework for exploring the nature of dark matter (DM) through its unique fermion structure. In this model, the important parameters are singlet-doublet mass splitting $\Delta{M}$, singlet-doublet mixing angle $\sin\theta$, and DM mass $M_{\rm DM}$. If the DM is assumed to be of Dirac nature, then the annihilation, co-annihilation, and conversion driven processes combinedly allows a range of parameter space: $1~{\rm GeV} \lesssim M_{\rm DM}\lesssim750$ GeV and $10^{-6}\lesssim\sin\theta\lesssim0.04$ for all $\Delta{M}&gt;1$ GeV. While the nature of DM either Dirac or Majorana is not known, in this work we assume the nature of singlet-doublet DM to be of Majorana type and find that the relic density and direct detection can be satisfied in a larger parameter space. In particular, the allowed ranges of DM mass and $\sin\theta$ are: $1~{\rm GeV}\lesssim M_{\rm DM}\lesssim1750$ GeV and $2\times10^{-7}\lesssim\sin\theta\lesssim0.16$ for all $\Delta{M}&gt;1$ GeV.</description>

      <title>Anomalous spontaneous induction of magnetic and electric fields in dense quark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we will demonstrate that a dense quark-matter system in the dual chiral density wave (DCDW) phase behaves as a ferromagnet in the sense that its magnetic-field dependent magnetization remains different from zero even at $B\rightarrow 0$. The corresponding permanent magnetization is a function of the baryonic chemical potential $\mu$, decreasing up to zero as $\mu$ increases in the range of intermediate densities ($312$ MeV $\leqslant \mu \leqslant 342$ MeV) and then increasing from zero in the higher density interval $490$ MeV$\leqslant \mu \leqslant 550$ MeV. We will show that this system's ability to generate permanent magnetization, together with the existence of the axial anomaly, open up the possibility of spontaneously generating a magnetic field coupled to a collinear electric field. The generated magnetic field can reach values up to $10^{16}$ G, depending on $\mu$, and the electric field will be 3 orders smaller. The fact that the DCDW phase is able to induce a magnetic field can be seen as its spontaneous tendency to remove the so called Landau-Peierls instability that is present in this single-modulated phase in the absence of a magnetic field. The spontaneous induction of a strong magnetic field at intermediate to high densities can be of interest for the astrophysics of compact stellar objects exhibiting strong magnetic fields as magnetars.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the article, the study of unpolarized $J/\psi$ production in proton-proton collisions is presented. The Soft Gluon Resummation approach as a TMD framework was used for description of small-$p_T^{}$ production cross section. The Improved Color Evaporation model was considered as an approach to describe hadronization of produced quarks into charmonium state. We find that the experimental data at various center-of-mass energies $\sqrt{s}$ demonstrate the dependence of hadronization parameter $F^{J/\psi}$ on energy. The predictions for $J/\psi$ production in the kinematics of the SPD NICA experiment have been made.</description>

      <title>Probing the Phenomenology of Dark Matter from Decoupled Freeze-Out</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a model of dark matter where the mediator corresponds to a superposition of a scalar and pseudoscalar, and the scenario where, after reheating, the number densities of the dark sector particles, i.e. the dark matter and the mediators, are negligible. If the coupling of the mediators to the Standard Model is feeble, but the coupling to the dark matter is large enough, the dark sector may reach equilibrium at a temperature distinct from that of the thermal bath. The relic density is then said to be obtained via decoupled freeze out (DFO). We focus on the $s$-wave annihilation scenario, which particularly benefits from the DFO mechanism by evading standard CMB limits while still yielding indirect detection signals. We calculate the relic density by solving a set of four coupled Boltzmann equations for the number densities of the dark sector particles and the energy transfer from the light to dark sector. We finally perform a thorough analysis of experimental bounds on this scenario, namely from indirect detection and the CMB, as well as from BBN, and find that, while there are considerable constraints on the parameter space where the correct relic density is obtained, a viable region remains to be explored.</description>

      <title>Uncharted Logarithmic Structures in QCD Transverse-Energy Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the QCD transverse-energy ($E_T$) flow distribution within an azimuthal region of phase space, defined by an angular interval $\Delta \phi$ on the plane transverse to a chosen jet axis. Vetoes on the resulting $E_T$ are widely employed at the LHC to isolate missing transverse momentum in final states with invisible particles. We show that this observable has logarithmic structures never seen before in QCD calculations. Notably, its description involves the resummation of non-global and coherence-violating logarithmic contributions that are more singular than any reported to date. We analyze its all-orders behavior, providing analytical resummations at next-to-double-logarithmic accuracy for $e^+e^-$ and $pp$ collisions, and numerical resummations at leading-logarithmic accuracy in the Veneziano limit for $pp$ collisions. We further present a computation of the leading coherence-violating correction for $pp$ collisions. The intricate structure of vetoes in azimuthal gaps reveals new aspects of QCD dynamics and offers a novel probe of collinear-factorization breaking at the LHC.</description>

      <title>The Cosmic Star Formation History: Insights from Kilonova-Associated Gamma-Ray Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The origin of the Universe and its material content remains one of the most fundamental questions in science. Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), with their extreme luminosities and high-redshift detectability, provide a unique window into the history of cosmic formation and chemical evolution. Consequently, the GRB formation rate (FR) has been employed to trace the star formation rate (SFR) across cosmic time. GRBs are conventionally classified into long and short categories (lGRBs and sGRBs) based on their $ T_{90} $ duration. sGRBs are widely employed as tracers of the delayed SFR, owing to their origin linked to the inspiral timescales of compact binary systems. However, some studies suggest that the detection of supernova-associated sGRBs may indicate potential contamination by core-collapse events. In this work, we move beyond the $ T_{90} $ classification and focus exclusively on GRBs with confirmed kilonova signatures, which provide unambiguous evidence of binary compact star mergers, to reassess their connection with the delayed SFR. Through analysis of a kilonova-associated GRB (KN/GRBs) sample, we find that even within this robust subset, the KN/GRB FR displays a trend contrary to that of the delayed SFR at low redshifts ($ z &lt; 1 $). This result challenges the conventional theory by indicating that low-redshift KN/GRBs may not accurately trace the delayed SFR, independent of core-collapse contamination, while further validation with larger KN/GRB samples is essential to determine the reliability of compact binary mergers as probes of delayed SFR.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Black holes in our Universe are rarely truly isolated, being instead embedded in astrophysical environments such as plasma or dark matter. A particularly intriguing possibility is that light scalar fields form bound states around black holes, producing extended ''clouds'' known as gravitational atoms. When these clouds become sufficiently compact, the spacetime can no longer be described by a vacuum solution of General Relativity. In this regime, one can construct quasi-stationary, spherically symmetric, self-gravitating scalar gravitational-atom configurations. Here, we explore an observationally relevant aspect of these systems by computing their fundamental quasi-normal mode. We present a fully relativistic calculation of the axial modes in both the time and frequency domains, finding frequency shifts relative to the vacuum case that depends mostly on the compactness of the gravitational atom. For sufficiently compact configurations, these shifts may be detectable by current or future gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <title>The Scoured Spike: Suppression of Indirect Dark Matter Signals by a Hidden Companion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A massive "dark companion"-such as an intermediate-mass black hole or other compact dark object-orbiting the supermassive black hole at the Galactic Center can dynamically reshape the surrounding dark-matter spike. Through gravitational heating and angular-momentum exchange, the companion excavates a "scoured" region that lowers the inner density and suppresses the expected annihilation signal. We quantify this effect by computing the suppression of the dark-matter annihilation $J$-factor induced by such a companion, combining an analytic scouring-radius model with full numerical integrations of the modified density profile. We scan the parameter space of companion mass, orbital separation, system age, and spike slope, explicitly including the interplay with the annihilation plateau. For canonical Gondolo-Silk spikes with $\gamma_{\rm sp} \gtrsim 2$, we find that the distribution is remarkably resilient and that the companion produces at most mild reductions of the $J$-factor. In contrast, for pre-heated or otherwise shallow spikes with $\gamma_{\rm sp} \lesssim 1.8$, even a modest $\sim 10^{4}\,M_\odot$ companion on a O(100) AU orbit and O(Gyr) age can suppress the annihilation flux by one to two orders of magnitude. The numerical results are accurately captured (typically at the $\lesssim 10\%$ level) by a simple fitting formula in terms of a dimensionless scouring parameter that measures the ratio between the scoured region and the annihilation core. Our findings demonstrate that neglecting a dark companion can lead to substantial overestimates of the Galactic Center $J$-factor, with direct consequences for interpreting gamma-ray, neutrino, and antimatter searches for annihilating dark matter.</description>

      <title>Large Scale White Noise and Cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The generation of white noise on large scales is a generic property of the dynamics of physical systems described by local non-linear partial differential equations. Non-linearities prevent the small scale dynamics from being erased by smoothing. Unresolved small scale dynamics act as an uncorrelated (white or Poissonian) noise (seemingly stochastic but actually deterministic) contribution to large scale dynamics. This white noise exists even when the dynamics is very nearly linear. In cases where the power spectrum is sub-Poissonian on large scales, this noise will dominate on the largest scale power no matter the amplitude of the inhomogeneities. Such is the case in the standard model of cosmology, where the primordial density power spectrum is expected to have an almost Harrison-Zel'dovich, $P[k]\sim k$, spectrum on a much broader range of scales than can be observed. Even though linear gravitational evolution dominates non-linear corrections by a factor $\sim10^5$, the non-observation of white noise on the Hubble scale precludes the extrapolation of this power law below the comoving $1\,$pc scale. More generally, observation or non-observation of large scale white noise provides a powerful probe of the universe on very small scales in the early early universe. Gravitational radiation, phase transitions, vorticity, and running of the spectral index are all phenomena that can be probed with large scale white noise. Large scale white noise is a non-optional feature of all cosmological models but one which has not heretofore been appreciated.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Origin of the Tully-Fisher Relation in Dark Matter Dominated Galaxies: A Theoretical-Empirical Derivation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we introduce the concept of self-interacting dark matter with scale-dependent equation of state, in the context of which dark matter is collisional and its equation of state is radius-dependent and has the form $P(r)=K(r)\left(\frac{\rho(r)}{\rho_{\star}}\right)^{\gamma(r)}$. We confronted the effectively 2-parameter model with 174 galaxies from the SPARC data, and we found that the rotation curves of 100 galaxies can be perfectly fitted by the model. These galaxies are dark matter dominated, mostly dwarfs, low-luminosity and low-surface-brightness spiral galaxies. We demonstrate that scale-dependent self-interacting dark matter solves the cusp-core issue for dark matter dominated galaxies. More importantly, the structure of the scale-dependent SIDM model produces in a semi-theoretically and semi-empirically way the canonical Tully-Fisher and the baryonic Tully-Fisher relations when these 100 viable dwarfs, low-surface-brightness and low-luminosity galaxies are taken into account. The behavior of the entropy function $K(r)$ is assumed to be $K(r)=K_0\times\left(1+\frac{r}{r_c}\right)^{-p}$. The perfect fits of the rotation curves come for a nearly isothermal and virialized dark matter halo, which naturally predicts the correlation $K_0\sim V_{\mathrm{max}}^2$. This correlation holds true empirically as confirmed by the data and we also find empirically $L\sim K_0^2$ from the data, thus the canonical Tully-Fisher relation is reproduced semi-theoretically and semi-empirically. We perform the same task and we find theoretically, for dark matter dominated galaxies, that $K_0\sim V_{\mathrm{flat}}^2$ which is also confirmed empirically from the data, along with the correlation $K_0\sim M_b^{0.5}$, hence the baryonic Tully-Fisher law naturally emerges in a semi-theoretical and semi-empirical manner.</description>

      <title>Infrared Quantum Electrodynamics and the Rayleigh-Jeans Physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Infrared quantum electrodynamics (IR-QED) acquires a natural geometric interpretation once soft photons are described as adiabatically transported electron-photon clouds. Within this framework, the relevant infrared structure is encoded in a functional Berry phase associated with the space of gauge connections, and the corresponding Berry corrections modify the Rayleigh-Jeans spectrum. The infrared scaling symmetry of the Rayleigh-Jeans law leads to a simple renormalization-group equation whose solution determines the frequency dependence of an effective factor $F_{\rm eff}(\omega)$ controlling the strength of the electron-photon cloud dressing. As a result, the energy density of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) receives a Berry-induced correction that scales as a power law and produces a frequency-dependent temperature excess in the radio domain. Although the exponent $\gamma$ governing this scaling behaviour is not fixed internally by the present formulation of IR-QED and must instead be determined phenomenologically, the existence and structure of the excess are genuine predictions of the theory. Remarkably, the resulting expression is extremely simple and naturally aligns with the deviations suggested by the ARCADE 2 data. Taken together, these results indicate that Berry phases in IR-QED may lead to observable consequences in the low-frequency tail of the CMB spectrum.</description>

      <title>Exact, non-singular black holes from a phantom DBI Field as primordial dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first exact, non-singular black hole solution in General Relativity sourced by a Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) scalar field. Crucially, the solution is exclusively supported by the phantom branch of the DBI action, dynamically replacing the central singularity with a regular core. The solution is asymptotically flat, possesses non-trivial scalar hair, and replaces the central singularity with a regular 2-sphere. The mechanism for singularity resolution is a dynamical kinetic stiffness -- analogous to shear thickening in non-Newtonian fluids -- which also explains the evasion of classical no-hair theorems. We show these black holes evaporate to a stable, non-singular, extremal Planck-scale relic. This provides a robust mechanism to evade standard evaporation constraints, opening a vast, previously forbidden mass window for light Primordial Black Holes to constitute dark matter. The model is testable via distinctive gravitational-wave signatures from its scalar hair.</description>

Abstract: With the advancement of first-principles calculations for baryon-baryon interactions, it becomes possible to obtain reliable hyperon-nucleon potentials by lattice QCD simulations with the HAL QCD method. High-precision few-body methods, such as the Gaussian Expansion Method (GEM), are applicable to solve quantum few-body systems up to four- and five-body systems. By combining the HAL QCD potentials with the GEM, one can predict the level structure of novel hypernuclei prior to experimental observation. In this review, we utilize the lattice QCD $N\Xi$ potential obtained by the HAL QCD method to investigate the few-body systems $NN\Xi$ and $NNN\Xi$. Our analysis indicates that the lightest bound $\Xi$ hypernucleus is the $NNN\Xi$ system. To extract detailed information on the isospin and spin components of the $N\Xi$ interaction, we perform a four-body calculation for the $\alpha\alpha N\Xi$ system with the total isospin $T = 0$ and $T = 1$. We demonstrate that the level structure of this system is sensitive to the isospin and spin dependencies of the $N\Xi$ interaction. Furthermore, we propose experimental investigations to produce the $NNN\Xi$ and $\alpha\alpha N\Xi$ systems via the $(K^-, K^+)$ and $(K^-, K^0)$ reactions on $^4$He and $^{10}$B targets, respectively.</description>

      <title>Numerical simulations of magnetic monopole evolution in an expanding universe</title>

Abstract: Magnetic monopoles are an inevitable feature of post-inflation symmetry-breaking phase transitions in grand unified theories. Analytic estimates of their density indicate that they are compatible with standard cosmology only if their mass is less than $10^{11}$ GeV. We initiate a programme of numerical studies of monopole dynamics by simulating a gas of 't Hooft-Polyakov monopoles formed by the Kibble mechanism after a phase transition. In this paper we simulate monopoles in a radiation background, but without interactions with the radiation, in order to resolve differences between analytical models. We find that during the radiation era, the monopoles find each other and annihilate efficiently enough to keep their density fraction constant, which supports the modelling of Zel'dovich and Khlopov and Preskill in the epoch when plasma interactions can be neglected. In the matter era the density fraction decreases logarithmically. Further work is needed to quantify the effect of the thermal bath, which is expected to reduce the annihilation rate at later times.</description>

      <title>Exotic compact objects in Einstein-Scalar-Maxwell theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In k-essence theories within general relativity, where the matter Lagrangian depends on a real scalar field $\phi$ and its kinetic term $X$, static and spherically symmetric compact objects with a positive-definite energy density cannot exist without introducing ghosts. We show that this no-go theorem can be evaded when the k-essence Lagrangian is extended to include a dependence on the field strength $F$ of a $U(1)$ gauge field, taking the general form ${\cal L}(\phi, X, F)$. In Einstein-scalar-Maxwell theories with a scalar-vector coupling $\mu(\phi) F$, we demonstrate the existence of asymptotically flat, charged compact stars whose energy density and pressure vanish at the center. With an appropriate choice of the coupling function $\mu(\phi)$, we construct both electric and magnetic compact objects and derive their metric functions and scalar- and vector-field profiles analytically. We compute their masses and radii, showing that the compactness lies in the range ${\cal O}(0.01)&lt;{\cal C}&lt;{\cal O}(0.1)$. A linear perturbation analysis reveals that electric compact objects are free of strong coupling, ghost, and Laplacian instabilities at all radii for $\mu(\phi)&gt;0$, while magnetic compact objects suffer from strong coupling near the center.</description>

      <title>Vortex stability in pseudo-Hermitian theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pseudo-Hermitian (including $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric) field theories support phenomenology that cannot be replicated in standard Hermitian theories. We describe a concrete example in which the vortex solutions that are realised in a prototypical pseudo-Hermitian field theory exhibit a novel metastability, despite the model parameters residing within the naively stable regime of exact antilinear symmetry of the vacuum theory. This instability is identified analytically and confirmed through numerical simulations, and it arises from the small breaking of the underlying antilinear symmetry of the pseudo-Hermitian theory due to the presence of the topological defect. This leads to spacetime-dependent parameters in the equations of motion governing fluctuations around the vortex, inducing non-trivial exceptional-point structures and complex frequencies within their spectrum. Aside from offering intriguing possibilities for cosmology, this result serves to illustrate the ability to produce long-lived metastable configurations in pseudo-Hermitian field theories of relevance beyond cosmology and high energy physics.</description>

      <title>Simulating quantum electrodynamics in 2+1 dimensions with qubits and qumodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a hybrid qubit-qumode framework for simulating quantum electrodynamics in 2+1 dimensions. In this approach, fermionic matter fields are represented by qubits, while U(1) gauge fields are encoded in continuous-variable bosonic modes whose canonical quadratures capture the electric and vector-potential components of the theory. To reconcile the non-compact phase space of the qumodes with the compact U(1) gauge symmetry, we introduce and compare two complementary constraint-enforcement strategies: (i) a squeezing-based projection that confines qumode states to the unit circle through an effective modification of the inner product, and (ii) a method that dynamically enforces compactness via a penalty Hamiltonian term. We construct the corresponding hybrid Hamiltonian, derive its decomposition into experimentally accessible qubit-qumode gates, and analyze its spectrum in the analytically tractable single-plaquette limit. The hybrid formulation reproduces the correct gauge-invariant dynamics and provides a scalable route toward simulating Abelian lattice gauge theories coupled to fermionic matter on near-term hybrid quantum architectures. Ground-state preparation and convergence are demonstrated using a continuous-variable extension of the Quantum Imaginary Time Evolution (QITE) algorithm, establishing a general framework for hybrid discrete-continuous quantum simulations of lattice gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Early Universe Constraints on Variations in Fundamental Constants Induced by Ultralight Scalar Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the cosmological impact of ultralight dark matter (ULDM) with a quadratic coupling to Standard Model particles. In addition to the suppression of small-scale power from ULDM itself, the coupling induces a variation of fundamental constants that is modulated by the ULDM oscillatory field value. In this work, we consider the ULDM-induced, time-dependent variation of the fine structure constant and the mass of the electron. These variations modify the predicted abundance of light elements during Big Bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) and the process of recombination, thereby affecting the anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). We use CMB anisotropy data and baryon acoustic oscillation measurements to obtain constraints on the variation of couplings over a wide range of ULDM masses. We self-consistently account for the modification of the primordial helium abundance during BBN in computing the CMB power spectra. We find that the allowed ULDM fraction of total dark matter abundance is more constrained for ULDM masses $\lesssim 10^{-26}~\mathrm{eV}$ in the presence of the variations. Moreover, our constraints on the variational couplings for ULDM masses $\lesssim 10^{-27}~\mathrm{eV}$ are stronger than the ones derived from the primordial helium abundance at BBN. Under our ULDM model, the variation of fundamental constants has no appreciable impact on the Hubble constant inferred from CMB data and thus does not present a viable solution to the Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>Systems with Quantum Dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose quantum-mechanical systems in which the number of spatial dimensions is promoted to a dynamical quantum variable. As a consequence, the effective dimension depends on the physical state of the system. Interestingly, systems of this form exhibit enhanced symmetries compared to their fixed-dimensional counterparts. As an explicit example, we analyze a harmonic oscillator for which the spatial dimension is represented by a quantum operator. By evaluating the corresponding partition function, we uncover a temperature-dependent effective dimension. Our framework opens a new avenue for constructing physical systems, from gravity to condensed matter, where the very notion of dimensionality becomes quantum.</description>

      <title>Closing in on $\alpha$-attractors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent observations of cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies combined with large-scale structure may point towards higher values of the scalar spectral index, $n_s$. This puts previously preferred inflationary models, such as $\alpha$-attractors, in tension with the new measurements. Pending a resolution of the tension between BAO parameters as determined by CMB datasets and those determined by DESI, we explore in this work the large-$n_s$ regime of $\alpha$-attractor T-models. We show that some T-models can self-consistently produce an extended reheating stage with a stiff equation of state $(\bar w&gt;1/3)$, which allows values for $n_s$ closer to unity. We employ constraints from P-ACT-LB-BK18 data to illustrate what large-$n_s$ observations might imply for T-models. We show that the $n_s$ measurement yields an upper limit on $\alpha$ that is stronger than the one from the tensor-to-scalar ratio only. We find that $n_s$ is maximised for $\alpha\sim1$, therefore the seven Poincar\'e models are well placed to deliver large $n_s$. However, the ability of a stiff reheating stage to increase the compatibility of T-models with large-$n_s$ measurements saturates as $\bar{w}\to1$. Thanks to this effect, we establish that the largest $n_s$ that T-models can produce is $n_s=0.9682$. T-models are therefore highly predictive in the large-$n_s$ regime and our result provides, under the assumption of perturbative reheating, a benchmark which could be used in the future to rule out T-models.</description>

      <title>Constraining the Nature of Dark Matter from Tidal Radii of Cluster Galaxy Subhalos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational lensing by galaxy clusters provides a powerful probe of the spatial distribution of dark matter and its microphysical properties. Strong and weak lensing constraints on the density profiles of subhalos and their truncation radii offer key diagnostics for distinguishing between collisionless cold dark matter (CDM) and self-interacting dark matter (SIDM). Notably, in the strongly collisional SIDM regime, subhalo core collapse and enhanced mass loss from ram-pressure stripping predict steeper central density slopes and more compact truncation radii--features that are directly testable with current lensing data. We analyze subhalo truncation in eight lensing clusters (Abell 2218, 383, 963, 209, 2390, and MACS J0416.1, J1206.2, J1149.6) that span the redshift range &lt;$z_\text{spec}$&gt;$ \simeq 0.17$-$0.54$ with virial masses $M_{200} \simeq0.41$-$2.2\times 10^{15}$ M$_\odot$ to constrain SIDM versus CDM. Our results indicate that the outer spatial extents of subhalos are statistically consistent with CDM, corroborated by redshift- and mass-matched analogs from the Illustris-TNG simulations. We conclude that the tidal radii of cluster galaxy subhalos serve as an important and complementary diagnostic of the nature of dark matter in these violent, dense environments.</description>

Abstract: We present a framework of dark- and visible-sector unification in the E6 embedding of the standard model. The demand for consistently getting the standard model leads to the existence of the dark-sector. We show that the hierarchy of vevs typifying unified models leads to multicomponent dark matter at the IR. The symmetry breaking itself categorises the matter content into dark- and visible-sector particles, the categorisation being uniform across different breaking chains. We discuss the stability of the dark matter particles and compare them to existing phenomenological models of dark matter. The central results follow from symmetry and hierarchy arguments. We present an indicative set of models of gauge coupling unification, to show that the framework can be embedded in realistic models of E6.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12071v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radiation reaction, the force experienced by an accelerated charge due to radiation emission, has long been the subject of extensive theoretical and experimental research. Experimental verification of a quantum, strong-field description of radiation reaction is fundamentally important, and has wide-ranging implications for astrophysics, laser-driven particle acceleration, next-generation particle colliders and inverse-Compton photon sources for medical and industrial applications. However, the difficulty of accessing regimes where strong field and quantum effects dominate inhibited previous efforts to observe quantum radiation reaction in charged particle dynamics with high significance. We report the first high significance (&gt; 5{\sigma}) observation of strong-field radiation reaction on electron spectra where quantum effects are substantial. We obtain the first, quantitative, strong evidence favouring the quantum-continuous and quantum-stochastic models over the classical model; the quantum models perform comparably. The lower electron energy losses predicted by the quantum models accounts for their improved performance. Model comparison was performed using a novel Bayesian framework which has widespread utility for laser-particle collision experiments, including those utilising conventional accelerators, where some collision parameters cannot be measured directly.</description>

Abstract: We investigate nuclear modification and the universality of short-range correlation (SRC) in pion-induced Drell-Yan process. Employing nuclear parton distribution functions (nPDFs) and pion PDFs, the ratio of differential cross sections of different nuclei relative to the free nucleon is presented. A kind of universal modification function was proposed which would provide nontrivial tests of SRC universality on the platform of pion-induced Drell-Yan. This work improves our understanding of nuclear structure and strong interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19488v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have developed an extension of the inert doublet model in which the CP-phases in the weak sector are generated from one-loop level corrections mediated by dark fields, while the strong-CP phase arises at three-loop. In this framework, the tiny masses of the active neutrinos are produced through a radiative inverse seesaw mechanism at a two-loop level, the masses of the first and second families of SM-charged fermions arise from a one-loop level radiative seesaw mechanism, and the third generation of SM charged fermion masses are generated at tree level. We have demonstrated that the proposed model successfully accounts for SM fermion masses and mixings. The radiative nature of the seesaw mechanisms is attributed to preserved discrete symmetries, which are required for ensuring the stability of fermionic and scalar dark matter candidates. The preserved discrete symmetries also allow for multi-component dark matter, whose annihilation processes permits to successfully reproduce the measured amount of dark matter relic abundance for an appropriate region of parameter space, which has shown to be compatible with current dark matter direct detection limits. Besides that, we explore the model's ability to explain the $95$ GeV diphoton excess observed by the CMS collaboration, showing that it readily accommodates this anomaly. We have shown that charged lepton flavor violating decays acquire rates within the current experimental sensitivity.</description>

Abstract: Supernova shocks can boost dark matter (DM) particles to high, yet nonrelativistic, velocities, providing a suitable mechanism for analysis within the framework of the nonrelativistic effective field theory (NREFT). These accelerated DM sources extend the experimental ability to scan the parameter space of light DM into the sub-GeV region. In this study, we specifically analyze DM accelerated by the Monogem Ring supernova remnant, whose age ($\sim 68000$ yr) and distance to Earth ($\sim 300$ parsec) are strategically matched to enable detection with current terrestrial detectors. Utilizing the 205.4 kg$\cdot$day data obtained from the CDEX-10 experiment at the China Jinping Underground Laboratory, we derive new constraints on boosted DM within the NREFT framework. The NREFT coupling constant exclusion regions now penetrate the sub-GeV mass range, with optimal sensitivity achieved for operators $\mathcal{O}_{3}$, $\mathcal{O}_{6}$, $\mathcal{O}_{15}$ in the 0.4--0.6 GeV mass range.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning in the Hunt for Heavy Charged Higgs Bosons at Gamma-Gamma Colliders in the Type III Two Higgs Doublet Model</title>

Abstract: We conduct a detailed exploration of charged Higgs boson masses $M_{H^{\pm}}$ within the range of $100-190~GeV$. This investigation is grounded in the benchmark points that comply with experimental constraints, allowing us to systematically account for uncertainties inherent in the analysis. Our results indicate significant production prospects for the process $H^{+}H^{-} \rightarrow \tau \nu_{\tau} \tau \nu_{\tau}$, which could provide essential insights into the properties of $H^{\pm}$ bosons. By examining these decay channels, we aim to illuminate the interplay between the charged Higgs boson and the established Standard Model. The research uses machine learning methods like Boosted Decision Trees (BDT) and Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP), as well as Likelihood and LikelihoodD, to improve the identification of heavy charged Higgs bosons compared to Standard Model backgrounds at a 3.0 TeV $\gamma\gamma$ collider with an integrated luminosity of $\mathcal{L}_{int}=3000~fb^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Understanding baryon stopping at the BNL Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider top energies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09826v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nucleon exhibits a rich internal structure governed by Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), where its electric charge arises from valence quarks, while its spin and mass emerge from complex interactions among valence quarks, sea (anti-)quarks, and gluons. At the advent of QCD, an alternative hypothesis emerged suggesting, at high energies, the transport of a nucleon's baryon number could be traced by a non-perturbative configuration of gluon fields connecting its three valence quarks, forming a $Y$-shaped topology known as the gluon junction. Recent measurements by the STAR experiment are compatible with this scenario. In light of these measurements, this study aims to explore the mechanisms of baryon transport in high-energy nuclear collisions using the PYTHIA-8 framework, which incorporates a state-of-the-art hadronization model with advanced Color Flow (CF) and Color Reconnection (CR) mechanisms that mimic signatures of a baryon junction. Within this model setup, we investigate (i) the rapidity slope of the net-baryon distributions in photon-included processes ($\gamma$+p) and (ii) baryon over charge transport in the isobaric (Ru+Ru and Zr+Zr) collisions. Our study highlights the importance of the CF and CR mechanisms in PYTHIA-8, which play a crucial role in baryon transport. The results show that the CF and CR schemes significantly affect the isobaric baryon-to-charge ratio, leading to different predictions for baryon stopping and underscoring the need to account for CF and CR effects in comparisons with experimental measurements.</description>

      <title>Estimating of CP Violation in $B_{c}\rightarrow B K^{0}+B {\bar{K}}^0\rightarrow B \pi^{\pm} e^{\mp} \nu_{e}$ Decays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19123v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the CP asymmetries ${\mathcal A}_{CP}^{pm}$ and ${\mathcal A}_{CP}^{mp}$ in $B_{c}^{\pm}\rightarrow B^{\pm} K^{0}+B^{\pm} {\bar{K}}^0\rightarrow B^{\pm} \pi^{\pm} e^{\mp} \nu_{e}$ and $B_{c}^{\pm}\rightarrow B^{\pm} K^{0}+B^{\pm} {\bar{K}}^0\rightarrow B^{\pm} \pi^{\mp} e^{\pm} \nu_{e}$ decays, both of them consist of three parts: the indirect CP violations in $K^0 -\bar{K}^0$ mixing $A_{CP,mix}^{pm}$ and $A_{CP,mix}^{mp}$, the direct CP violations in $B_{c}$ decay $A_{CP,dir}^{pm}$ and $A_{CP,dir}^{mp}$, the new CP violation effects $A_{CP,int}^{pm}$ and $A_{CP,int}^{mp}$, which originate from the interference between the amplitude of the $B_{c}^{-}\rightarrow B^{-} K^{0} ({\bar{K}}^0) \rightarrow B^{-} \pi^{-} e^{+} \nu_{e}(\pi^{+} e^{-} \bar{\nu}_{e})$ decay with the difference between the oscillating effect of $K^0\rightarrow {\bar{K}}^0$ and that of ${\bar{K}}^0\rightarrow K^0 $. The strong phase differences of the direct CP asymmetries $A_{CP,dir}^{pm}$ and $A_{CP,dir}^{mp}$ arising from $K^0-\bar{K}^0$ mixing parameters. ${\mathcal A}_{CP}^{pm}$ and ${\mathcal A}_{CP}^{mp}$ are of the order $\mathcal{O}(10^{-4})$ and $\mathcal{O}(10^{-3})$, respectively. The new CP violation effect ${\mathcal A}_{CP,int}^{pm}$ plays a dominant role in ${\mathcal A}_{CP}^{pm}$, the CP asymmetry ${\mathcal A}_{CP}^{mp}$ is dominated by the indirect CP violation ${\mathcal A}_{CP,mix}^{mp}$, so the CP asymmetry ${\mathcal A}_{CP}^{pm}$ provides an ideal place to study the new CP violation effect. We derive another two asymmetry observables ${\mathcal A}_{CP}^{pp}$ and ${\mathcal A}_{CP}^{mm}$, which are dominated by $K^0-\bar{K}^0$ mixing. The observables ${\mathcal A}_{CP}^{pm}$, ${\mathcal A}_{CP}^{mp}$, ${\mathcal A}_{CP}^{pp}$ and ${\mathcal A}_{CP}^{mm}$ are hopefully to be marginally observed at the LHC experiment and the HL-LHC experiment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06206v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the momentum broadening of a high-energy quark jet in the large density gluon medium created right after the collision of two ultrarelativistic heavy nuclei, the Glasma. Previous Glasma studies modeled the jet as a classical probe particle, for which position and momentum are simultaneously determined. In this work, we use the light-front QCD Hamiltonian formalism to treat the jet as a fully quantum state. We compute its real-time evolution while propagating through the Glasma classical background fields, which act as an interaction potential in the quantum evolution of the jet. We present results for the momentum broadening and jet quenching parameter of a jet at mid-rapidity, with special emphasis on the anisotropies between the longitudinal and transverse directions relative to the collision axis. In addition, we compare our results to classical calculations, and initiate a study of the distinction between kinetic and canonic momentum in the context of jet momentum broadening.</description>

      <title>The quantum criticality of the Standard Model and the hierarchy problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15919v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The naturalness principle has long guided efforts to understand physics beyond the Standard Model, with the hierarchy problem as the central issue. We revisit the role of quantum corrections in the fine-tuning of the low-energy effective description and its phase structure. We implement, for the first time in this context, the full Standard Model within the Wilsonian functional renormalization group. Crucially, this method captures conveniently both logarithmic and quadratic scalings, which must both be considered in the tuning, and allows us to provide a new generic and quantitative study of fine-tuning and its interpretation in terms of critical phenomena. We emphasize on the connection between the hierarchy problem and the near-criticality of the Standard Model and extract scheme-independent information on the infrared Higgs phases and the associated quantum phase transition as well as discuss a related enhanced fine-tuning usually not considered in tuning estimates. Finally, we illustrate the framework's versatility by exploring new physics coupled to the Higgs sector that can soften high-scale sensitivity, recovering also the large-anomalous-dimension solution to the hierarchy problem.</description>

Abstract: In this letter, we relate the factorization for $e^+e^- \to h_1 h_2 X$ to the factorization for energy-energy correlators in the collinear limit. This enables us to give a nonperturbative proof of factorization for the energy correlators, relate the energy correlator jet function to transverse-momentum-sensitive dihadron fragmentation functions, and provide a rigorous description of the confinement transition region.</description>

Abstract: The gallium anomaly, a persistent discrepancy exceeding $4\sigma$ in the $^{71}$Ga neutrino capture rates from $^{51}$Cr and $^{37}$Ar radioactive sources by the GALLEX, SAGE, and recently BEST experiments, has challenged particle physics and nuclear theory for over three decades. We present a new calculation of the neutrino capture cross-section, abandoning the conventional leading-order approximation for electronic wave functions by numerically solving the Dirac-Coulomb equation for both bound and continuum electron states. Finally, we re-evaluate the gallium anomaly, updating its global significance and presenting the most up-to-date status of its interpretation in terms of sterile neutrinos.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17429v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electroweak (EW) amplitudes in the gauge-Goldstone five-component formalism have a distinctive property: gauge symmetry is imprinted in the amplitudes, manifested as the massive Ward identity (MWI) $k^M\mathcal M_M=0$. In this study, we used the HELAS package to numerically study gauge symmetry in EW amplitudes. First, we directly tested gauge symmetry by examining the MWI of amplitudes. Second, we modified the couplings within a vertex and among vertices to check if and how the MWI changes. Third, we tested gauge symmetry by considering the couplings modified by operators from the standard model effective field theory (SMEFT). Similar to the standard model, there are relations between different couplings that are protected by gauge symmetry. We observed that, if we modify the couplings to deviate from the relations, the MWI is violated. In contrast, the MWI is restored when the relations between couplings reduce to those in the SMEFT.</description>

Abstract: High-intensity muon beams could enable a muonium-based search for ultralight axions through resonant quantum transitions between hyperfine states. Combining theoretical calculations with simulation results, we demonstrate that such a muonium-based experimental approach -exemplified by one of the facilities under development in Huizhou- could improve constraints on the axion-muon coupling by up to two orders of magnitude compared with existing limits from the muon g-2 measurement, over the axion mass range of $10^{-15}$ eV to $10^{-12}$ eV. These results establish muonium spectroscopy as a powerful probe of physics beyond the Standard Model.</description>

Abstract: We present a complete classification of domain wall solutions in the two-Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM) with a global $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry, categorised as superconducting, CP-violating, or neither, depending on the scalar particle masses and the ratio of the two Higgs doublets' vacuum expectation values. We demonstrate that any domain wall solution can be reduced to depend on only six of the eight general field components, with further field reductions possible within different regions of the parameter space. Furthermore, we show that the superconducting solutions can be used to construct stable, current-carrying domain walls in two spatial dimensions. Similarly, the CP-violating solutions allow for two-dimensional configurations where CP symmetry is locally broken on the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetric wall, which could provide an out-of-equilibrium environment for CP-violating processes to occur.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2204.08484v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We initiate the exploration of the cosmology of dark fifth forces: new forces acting solely on Dark Matter. We focus on long range interactions which lead to an effective violation of the Equivalence Principle on cosmological scales today. At the microscopic level, the dark fifth force can be realized by a light scalar with mass smaller than the Hubble constant today ($\lesssim 10^{-33}\,\text{eV}$) coupled to Dark Matter. We study the behavior of the background cosmology and linear perturbations in such a Universe. At the background level, the new force modifies the evolution of the Dark Matter energy density and thus the Hubble flow. At linear order, it modifies the growth of matter perturbations and generates relative density and velocity perturbations between Dark Matter and baryons that grow over time. We derive constraints from current CMB and BAO data, bounding the strength of the dark fifth force to be less than a percent of gravity. These are the strongest constraints to date. We present potential implications of this scenario for the Hubble tension and discuss how our results are modified if the light scalar mediator accounts for the observed density of the Dark Energy. Finally, we comment on the interplay between our constraints and searches for violations of the Equivalence Principle in the visible sector.</description>

      <title>More Nonlinearities? II. A Short Guide of First- and Second-Order Electromagnetic Perturbations in the Schwarzschild Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01441v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study second-order electromagnetic perturbations in the Schwarzschild background and derive the effective source terms for Regge-Wheeler equation which are quadratic in first-order gravitational and electromagnetic perturbations. In addition to the induced mixed quadratic modes, we find that linear gravitational modes are also excited, with amplitudes dependent on the electromagnetic potential. A toy model involving a Dirac delta function potential demonstrates mixing of linear gravitational and electromagnetic perturbations with frequencies \( \omega^{(1)} \) and \( \Omega^{(1)} \), resulting in the second-order QNM mixing in the electromagnetic field at \( \Omega^{(2)} =\Omega^{(1)} + \omega^{(1)} \). This complements prior work in \cite{aly2024nonlinearities} on the second-order gravitational perturbation mixing and highlights potential applications in multi-messenger astrophysics for systems observed by LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) and upcoming LISA. We also study first-order perturbations due to a point charge and show it could be reduced to a one-dimensional path integral. Within the toy model, we investigate the first-order electromagnetic perturbation due to a radially free-falling single charge \( q \) and radial dipole moment \( p = q \eta \), employing semi-analytical and numerical methods. For the dipole case, we show that the QNM perturbation is excited with a nearly constant amplitude. Future work will focus on incorporating mixing in more realistic potentials and exploring numerical approach in the context of rotating spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the dark matter-baryon interaction cross section from galaxy cluster thermodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18706v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dark matter (DM) models with a non-zero DM-baryon interaction cross section imply energy transfer between DM and baryons. We present a new method of constraining the DM-baryon interaction cross section and DM particle mass for velocity-independent interactions using the thermodynamics of galaxy clusters. If the baryonic gas in these clusters is in thermodynamic equilibrium and DM cools baryons, this cooling rate is limited by the net heating rate of other mechanisms in the cluster. We use the REFLEX clusters from the Meta-Catalogue of X-ray detected Clusters of Galaxies (MCXC) with mass estimates from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) catalog of Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) selected galaxy clusters. This yields 95% upper bounds on the DM-proton interaction cross section for velocity-independent interactions of $\sigma_0\leq9.3\times10^{-28} \mathrm{~cm^2}$ for DM masses, $m_\chi = 10^{-4} - 10^{-1}$ GeV. These constraints are within an order of magnitude of the best constraints derived in this mass range, and serve as a complementary, independent constraint. We also apply this model to the fractional interacting DM scenario, where only 10% and 1% of the DM is interacting. Unlike other methods, this constraint scales linearly with this fraction. This yields 95% upper bounds of $\sigma_0\leq1.1\times10^{-26} \mathrm{~cm^2}$ and $\sigma_0\leq8.2\times10^{-26} \mathrm{~cm^2}$, which are the strongest existing constraints for this scenario. This paper serves as a proof of concept. Upcoming SZ measurements will provide temperature profiles for galaxy clusters. Combining these measurements with more complex thermodynamic models could lead to more robust constraints.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of magnetized BPS baryonic layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18007v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Through the Hamilton-Jacobi equation of classical mechanics, BPS magnetized Baryonic layers (possessing both baryonic charge and magnetic flux) have been constructed in the gauged non-linear sigma model (G-NLSM), which is one of the most relevant effective theories for Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) in the strongly interacting low-energy limit. Since the topological charge that naturally appears on the right hand side of the BPS bound is a non-linear function of the baryonic charge, the thermodynamics of these magnetized Baryonic layers is highly non-trivial. In this work, using tools from the theory of Casimir effect, we derive analytical relationship between baryonic charge, topological charge, magnetic flux and relevant thermodynamical quantities (such as pressure, specific heat and magnetic susceptibility) of these layers. The critical Baryonic chemical potential is identified. Quite interestingly, the grand canonical partition function can be related with the Riemann zeta function. On the technical side, it is quite a remarkable result to derive explicit expressions for all these thermodynamics quantities of a strongly interacting magnetized system at finite Baryon density. On the physical side, such expressions allow a direct physical interpretation which we discuss.</description>

      <title>The Hidden Symmetries of Yang-Mills Theory in (3+1)-dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15832v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that classical, non-supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories coupled to spin-1/2 and spin-0 elementary matter fields, in (3+1)-dimensional Minkowski space-time, possess exact structures that resemble integrability, with an infinite number of conserved charges in involution. Such structures live in the space of non-abelian electric and magnetic charges, and are based on flat connections in generalized loop spaces, presenting an R-matrix, and Sklyanin relation. We present two novel symmetries of Yang-Mills theories. The first one corresponds to global transformations generated by the infinity of those conserved charges under the Poisson brackets. The gauge and matter fields, as well as Wilson lines and fluxes, have interesting transformation laws under such a global symmetry. The second one corresponds to symmetries of the integral Yang-Mills equations, which lead to the conserved charges. They generate an infinite-dimensional group, where the elements are holonomies of connections on the loop space of functions from the circle S^1 to the space-time. Our approach certainly applies to the Standard Model of the Fundamental Interactions. The conserved charges are gauge invariant, and so, in the case of QCD, they are color singlets and perhaps are not confined. Therefore, the hadrons may carry such charges. Our results open up the way for the construction of non-perturbative methods for Yang-Mills theories.</description>

      <title>Impacts of axion cooling on the direct detection of supernova axions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18491v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Core-collapse supernovae provide a unique opportunity to probe axions because they can be a copious source of the particles. It has recently been proposed that axion helioscopes can be used for the direct search for supernova axions if a supernova event appears within a few hundred parsecs. However, the event number of supernova axions has been estimated only within the post-process framework. In this study, we perform long-term supernova simulations for a 9.6M_sun star coupled with the axion emission to reevaluate the event number of axions detected by the helioscopes. We find that the additional cooling induced by the axion emission can significantly decrease the temperature in the proto-neutron star. As a result, the axion luminosity and hence the axion event number are reduced, compared with the result obtained through post-processing. Our result indicates that the nonlinear feedback of the axion emission is an essential factor to predict the axion detectability, and underscores the need for systematic simulation studies across various progenitor models.</description>

      <title>Testing the Heterotic String with the Axion-Photon Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08042v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The discovery of an axion-like particle above the QCD line would rule out Grand Unified Theories, including the perturbative heterotic string with the Standard Model embedded in a single $E_8$ factor or $SO(32)$. In this work we study a possible loophole to this observation, given by compactifications of the $E_8\times E_8$ heterotic string with a non-standard embedding of the Standard Model into the 10-dimensional gauge group. If electromagnetism is embedded into both $E_8$ factors, axions can couple to photons via the anomaly without coupling to QCD. We obtain upper bounds to the coupling-to-mass ratio $g_{a\gamma}/m_a$ for these axion-like particles as a function of the supersymmetry breaking scale and the unified gauge coupling. To be compatible with the measured gauge couplings and the weak mixing angle $\sin^2\theta_w$ at low-energies, phenomenologically viable models with non-standard $U(1)_Y$ embedding require sizeable one-loop threshold corrections from string states and/or charged matter at intermediate energy scales. We study how these effects modify the tree-level upper bounds to $g_{a\gamma}/m_a$ and show that, in the perturbative regime, they reduce the leading order estimates. Axion-like particles far above the QCD line are only possible in certain models where perturbation theory is lost. The main conclusion is that the discovery of an axion violating the bounds found in this work would be incompatible with large classes of otherwise phenomenologically viable string models, including the perturbative heterotic $SO(32)$ and $E_8\times E_8$ string, the type-I string, and certain heterotic M-theories. The role of small gauge instantons and worldsheet instantons in making some of the axion-like particles heavy and cosmologically relevant is briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>High energy gamma rays and neutrinos from the Sun, Jupiter and Earth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20970v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmic rays reaching the atmosphere of an astrophysical object produce showers of secondary particles that may then escape into space. Here we obtain the flux of gamma rays and neutrinos of energy $E&gt;10$ GeV emitted by the Sun, Jupiter and Earth. We show that, while the solar magnetic field induces a flux of gamma rays from all the points on the Sun's surface, the dipolar magnetic field in the planets implies high energy photons only from the very peripheral region. Neutrinos, in contrast, can cross these objects and emerge from any point on their surface. The emission from these astrophysical objects exceeds the diffuse flux from cosmic ray interactions with the interstellar medium and has a distinct spectrum and gamma ray to neutrino ratio.</description>

      <title>Isotensor $\pi\pi \pi$ scattering with a $\rho$ resonant subsystem from QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24894v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work presents a lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD) determination of $\pi\pi\pi$ scattering amplitudes for the isospin-2 channel with angular momentum and parity $J^{P} = 1^+$. The calculation is performed using unphysically heavy light-quark masses, corresponding to a pion mass of $m_{\pi} \approx 400$~MeV, for which the $\rho$ meson manifests as a narrow resonance. The analysis employs a previously developed formalism that non-perturbatively relates the finite-volume spectra of two- and three-pion systems to their infinite-volume scattering amplitudes. We combine earlier lattice QCD results for $\pi\pi$ systems with isospins 1 and 2 with new determinations of the isospin-2 three-pion finite-volume spectrum, obtained for three cubic, periodic lattice volumes with box length ranging from $\approx 4/m_\pi$ to $6/m_\pi$. These combined data constrain the low-lying partial waves of the infinite-volume three-pion K matrix, from which we solve a set of coupled integral equations to extract the corresponding scattering amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Addressing the DESI DR2 Phantom-Crossing Anomaly and Enhanced $H_0$ Tension with Reconstructed Scalar-Tensor Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04610v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent cosmological data, including DESI DR2, highlight significant tensions within the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. When analyzed in the context of General Relativity (GR), the latest DESI data favor a dynamical dark energy (DDE) equation of state, $w(z)$, that crosses the phantom divide line $w=-1$. However, this framework prefers a lower Hubble constant, $H_0$, than Planck 2018, thereby worsening the tension with local measurements. This phantom crossing is a key feature that cannot be achieved by minimally coupled scalar fields (quintessence) within GR. This suggests the need for a new degree of freedom that can simultaneously: (A) increase the best-fit value of $H_0$ in the context of the DESI DR2 data, and (B) allow the crossing of the $w=-1$ line within a new theoretical approach. We argue that both of these goals may be achieved in the context of Modified Gravity (MG), and in particular, Scalar-Tensor (ST) theories, where phantom crossing is a natural and viable feature. We demonstrate these facts by analyzing a joint dataset including DESI DR2, Pantheon+, CMB, and growth-rate (RSD) data in the context of simple parametrizations for the effective gravitational constant, $\mu_G(z) \equiv G_{eff}/G_N$, and the DDE equation of state, $w(z)$. This MG framework significantly alleviates the tension, leading to a higher inferred value of $H_0 = 70.6 \pm 1.7 \, \text{km s}^{-1} \text{Mpc}^{-1}$. We also present a systematic, data-driven reconstruction of the required underlying ST Lagrangian and provide simple, generic analytical expressions for both the non-minimal coupling $F(\Phi) = 1+\xi\Phi^{2}e^{n\Phi}$ and the scalar potential $U(\Phi) = U_{0}+ae^{b\Phi^{2}}$, which well-describe the reconstructed functions.</description>

      <title>Symmetry of Bounce Solutions at Finite Temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05950v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The seminal work of Coleman, Glaser, and Martin established that, at zero temperature, any non-trivial solution to the equations of motion with the least Euclidean action is $O(D)$-symmetric. This paper extends their foundational analysis to finite temperature. We rigorously prove that for a broad class of scalar potentials, any saddle-point configuration with the least action is necessarily $O(D\!-\!1)$-symmetric and monotonic in the spatial directions. This result provides a firm mathematical justification for the symmetry properties widely assumed in studies of thermal vacuum decay and cosmological phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Experimental review on the chiral magnetic effect in relativistic heavy ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07358v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The chiral magnetic effect (CME) refers to a predicted phenomena in quantum chromodynamics that manifests as a charge separation along an external magnetic field, driven by an imbalance of quark chirality. Searches for the CME has been carried out by azimuthal particle correlations in relativistic heavy ion collisions where such a chirality imbalance is anticipated and a strong magnetic field is created in the initial stage. No conclusive experimental evidence on the CME has been established so far because of large background contributions to azimuthal correlation observables. We review the status of the experimental search for the CME, covering the observables used, the techniques to mitigate backgrounds, and the strengths and limitations of various experimental approaches, and outline a future prospect of the CME search in high-energy nuclear collisions.</description>

      <title>Gravitational--Electromagnetic Coupling on Kerr Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13642v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend previous metric-based Schwarzschild studies of gravitational--electromagnetic (GEM) coupling to rotating black holes by working directly in a curvature-based Newman--Penrose/Teukolsky framework on Kerr spacetime. Within a minimally coupled Einstein--Maxwell system, we derive explicit quadratic electromagnetic source terms for the spin-$-2$ Teukolsky equation, providing a foundation for future numerical studies of GEM interactions in the framework of black-hole spectroscopy. Moreover, we give order-of-magnitude arguments showing that GEM quadratic quasinormal modes (QQNMs) can become relevant in a range of charged and magnetized astrophysical scenarios. Finally, we show through a brief dilaton-theory example that the GEM QQNM spectrum is sensitive to how gravity couples to electromagnetism, thereby providing a model-based way to test minimal coupling and to constrain hidden $U(1)$ sectors with gravitational-wave observations.</description>
