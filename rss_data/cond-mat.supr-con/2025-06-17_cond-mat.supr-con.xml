      <title>Unconventional superconductivity in a non-centrosymmetric ${\alpha}$-Mn alloy NbTaOs$_{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-centrosymmetric superconductors have emerged as a fascinating avenue for exploring unconventional superconductivity. Their broken inversion and time-reversal symmetries make them prime candidates for realizing the intrinsic superconducting diode effect (SDE). In this work, we synthesize the ternary non-centrosymmetric $\alpha$-Mn alloy NbTaOs$_{2}$ and conduct a comprehensive investigation of its superconducting properties through resistivity, magnetization, specific heat and muon spin rotation/relaxation ($\mu$SR) techniques. Our transverse field-$\mu$SR and specific heat results provide evidence of a moderately coupled, fully-gaped superconducting state. Zero field-$\mu$SR measurements reveal a subtle increase in the relaxation rate below the transition temperature, suggesting time reversal symmetry breaking in the superconducting ground state of NbTaOs$_{2}$.</description>

      <title>Layer Pseudospin Superconductivity in Twisted MoTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experiments have observed signatures of spin-valley-polarized unconventional superconductivity in twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ (tMoTe$_2$). Here, we explore the rich physics of superconducting tMoTe$_2$, enabled by its unique layer-pseudospin structure. Within a minimal two-orbital layer-pseudospin model framework, both interlayer and intralayer Cooper pairings can be effectively visualized using a layer-space Bloch sphere representation. Remarkably, we find that interlayer pairing prevails in the spin-valley-polarized state, whereas intralayer pairing dominates in the spin-valley-unpolarized state. Strikingly, we further predict that for spin-valley-polarized intravalley superconducting state, experimentally feasible weak displacement fields can stabilize finite-momentum pairings at low temperatures. Additionally, in-plane magnetic fields, which break three-fold rotational symmetry, induce field-direction-dependent finite-momentum pairing states, leading to a versatile momentum-selection phase diagram. Our work highlights the crucial role of layer pseudospin in tMoTe$_2$'s unconventional superconductivity and demonstrates its unique tunability via external fields.</description>

      <title>The impact of parameter spread of high-temperature superconducting Josephson junctions on the performance of quantum-based voltage standards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum metrology based on Josephson junction array reproduces the most accurate desired voltage by far, therefore being introduced to provide voltage standards worldwide. In this work, we quantitatively analyzed the dependence of the first Shapiro step height of the junction array at 50 GHz on the parameter spread of 10,000 Josephson junctions by numerical simulation with resistively shunted junction model. The results indicate an upper limit spread of the critical current and resistance of the Josephson junctions. Specifically, to keep the maximum first Shapiro step above 0.88 mA, the critical current standard deviation, $\sigma$, should not exceed 25%, and for it to stay above 0.6 mA, the resistance standard deviation should not exceed 1.5%.</description>

      <title>Tunneling conductance in superconducting junctions with $p$-wave unconventional magnets breaking time-reversal symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new type of magnet called $p$-wave unconventional magnet is proposed, stimulated by the discovery of altermagnet. We study the tunneling conductance of $p$-wave unconventional magnet/superconductor junctions by adopting the effective Hamiltonian of $p$-wave unconventional magnets with time-reversal symmetry breaking, suggested in Ref [arXiv: 2309.01607 (2024)]. The tunneling conductance shows an asymmetric behavior with respect to bias voltage in the helical $p$-wave superconductor junctions. It is caused by the lack of helical edge states contributing to the charge conductance owing to the momentum-dependent spin-split feature of the Fermi surface in $p$-wave unconventional magnets. In chiral $d$ and $p$-wave superconductor junctions, the resulting spin-resolved tunneling conductance takes a different value for spin sectors due to the time-reversal symmetry breaking in superconductors. Our results qualitatively reproduce the results based on the simplified Hamiltonian in Ref [J.\ Phys.\ Soc.\ Jpn.\ \textbf{93}, 114703 (2024)], where only the odd function of the exchange coupling of $p$-wave unconventional magnets is taken into account, which gives the shift of the Fermi surface and preserves the time-reversal symmetry similar to the spin-orbit coupling.</description>

      <title>Role of topotactic hydrogen in Superconductivity of Infinite-layer Nickelate NdNiO$_{2}$: A first-principles and variational Monte Carlo study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Employing combination of first-principles calculations, low-energy model construction, and variational Monte Carlo solution of the ab-initio derived Hubbard model, we study the effect of hydrogenation in the electronic structure and superconducting properties of infinite-layer nickelate, NdNiO$_2$. We find that the introduction of hydrogen at the apical oxygen vacancy position strongly influences the Wannier function corresponding to the effective interstitial orbital at the Ni site bound to the hydrogen. This results in the near disappearance of the electron pocket at the $k_z$ = $\pi$ Fermi surface, keeping that of $k_z$ = 0 unchanged, compared to the dehydrogenated case. The two-band model thus remains valid even in the presence of H. The calculated superconducting order parameters both in absence and presence of H, show a two-hump superconductivity arising the two overlapping domes, one arising from $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$ and another arising from interstitial orbital degree of freedom. Hydrogenation strengthens the latter, marginally affecting the former.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity with repulsion: a variational approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the stability of the superconducting state within mean-field theory in the presence of repulsive pairing interactions, focusing on multiband systems where such channels naturally arise. We show that, when repulsion is present, the self-consistent BCS solution appears as a saddle point of the conventional mean-field free energy, casting doubt on its physical stability. We show that this pathology is an artifact of using a non-variational functional. Recasting the problem with Bogoliubov's variational principle restores a free energy that is bounded from below and places the BCS solution at a genuine minimum. Using a two-band toy model relevant to iron-based superconductors, we demonstrate the stability of the s$_\pm$ state and clarify how projection schemes that rely only on the interaction matrix can misidentify the attractive eigenmode that drives pairing. Our results clarify the instability issue highlighted by Aase et al. and provide a consistent foundation for analyzing fluctuations in the presence of repulsive interactions.</description>

      <title>Freestanding single-crystal superconducting electron-doped cuprate membrane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thin films of cuprate superconductors are easier to control in terms of doping as compared to bulk samples. However, they require specific substrates to facilitate epitaxial growth. These substrates are often incompatible with materials used in electronic applications. Furthermore, it is challenging to separate the substrate's properties from the material of interest. Here, we demonstrate the fabrication of an electron-doped cuprate membrane. We show that the membrane has a coherent crystal structure. Furthermore, the superconducting properties of the membrane post-liftoff closely resemble those of the thin films pre-lift-off, as revealed by a scanning superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) microscope. Such membranes pave the way for designing new material properties and incorporating complex superconducting materials into typically incompatible electronic devices.</description>

      <title>Quantifying stored energy release in irradiated YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_7$ through molecular dynamics annealing simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the lifetime of a fusion power plant, irradiation-induced defects will accumulate in the superconducting magnets compromising their ability to carry current without losses, generate high magnetic fields, and thus maintain plasma confinement. These defects also store potential energy within the crystalline lattice of materials, which can be released upon annealing. This phenomenon raises the question of whether the energy stored in defects may be sufficient to accelerate, or even trigger, a magnet quench? To provide an order of magnitude estimate, we used molecular dynamics simulations to generate defected YBCO supercells and conduct isothermal annealing simulations. Our results reveal that the maximum volumetric stored energy in a 4 mDPA defected single crystal of YBCO (240 $J/cm^3$) is 30 times greater than the experimental minimum quench energy values for YBCO tapes (8.1 $J/cm^3$). Our simulations also show that the amount of energy released increases as a function of annealing temperature or irradiation dose. This trend demonstrates that localized heating events in an irradiated fusion magnet have the potential to release significant amounts of defect energy. These findings underscore the critical need for experimental validation of the accumulation and release of defect stored energy, and highlight the importance of incorporating this contribution into quench detection systems, to enhance the operational safety of large-scale YBCO fusion magnets.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Superfluid Density in Pair-Density-Wave Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the superfluid density $n_s(T)$ of pair-density-wave (PDW) superconductors; this determines where they are unstable and establishes signatures of their unusual order. Here we compute $n_s(T)$ for the 2D unidirectional PDW superconducting phases that emerge from a microscopic model (with nearest neighbor attraction). With gapped and gapless bands in the Bogoliubov quasiparticle dispersion, this theory provides self-consistently determined wavevectors \(\mathbf{Q}\) for the spatially modulated pairing. We report a negative $n_s$ for a significant fraction of the purportedly physical phase diagram. Independent of the microscopic model, we can generally understand that the implied instability in these superconductors arises from the variationally large \(|\mathbf{Q}|\). In the stable regime, the finite-temperature superfluid density \(n_s(T)\) displays unusual temperature dependences originating from the gapless Bogoliubov bands which reflect Van Hove-singularity-induced Sommerfeld contributions. These gapless bands, as well as the negative contributions from the Higgs mode, additionally lead to an anomalously small (highly anisotropic) superfluid density. This will then yield an unexpectedly large finite-frequency weight in the optical conductivity.</description>

Abstract: Chiral phonons, circularly polarized lattice vibrations carrying intrinsic angular momentum, offer unprecedented opportunities for controlling heat flow, manipulating quantum states through spin-phonon coupling, and realizing exotic transport phenomena. Despite their fundamental importance, a universal framework for identifying and classifying these elusive excitations has remained out of reach. Here, we address this challenge by establishing a comprehensive symmetry-based theory that systematically classifies the helicity and the velocity-angular momentum tensor underlying phonon magnetization in thermal transport across all 230 crystallographic space groups. Our approach, grounded in fundamental representations of phononic angular momentum, reveals three distinct classes of crystals: achiral crystals with vanishing angular momentum, chiral crystals with s-wave helicity, and achiral crystals exhibiting higher-order helicity patterns beyond the s-wave. By performing high-throughput computations and symmetry analysis of the dynamical matrices for 11614 crystalline compounds, we identified 2738 materials exhibiting chiral phonon modes and shortlisted the 170 most promising candidates for future experimental investigation. These results are compiled into an open-access Chiral Phonon Materials Database website, enabling rapid screening for materials with desired chiral phonon properties. Our theoretical framework transcends phonons--it provides a universal paradigm for classifying chiral excitations in crystalline lattices, from magnons to electronic quasiparticles.</description>

      <title>Theoretical study on the possibility of high $T_c$ s$\pm$-wave superconductivity in the heavily hole-doped infinite layer nickelates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21461v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically propose a possibility of realizing high $T_c$ superconductivity having $s\pm$-wave symmetry in the heavily hole-doped infinite layer nickelates La$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$NiO$_2$. We consider situations where the original $P4/mmm$ symmetry of LaNiO$_2$ is maintained even for a significant amount of Sr substitution by growing thin films on substrates having tetragonal symmetry. Considering such cases is indeed justified by our phonon calculations. For electron configurations somewhat close to $d^8$, the interaction between the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ band and the other $3d$ bands that lie just below the Fermi level results in an enhancement of superconductivity where the sign of the gap function is reversed between the former and the latter bands. The strong enhancement of superconductivity can be attributed to the large energy level offset between $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and other orbitals due to the absence of the apical oxygens, as has been pointed out in previous studies.</description>

      <title>Conditions for orbital selective altermagnetism in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$: tight binding model, similarities with cuprates and implications on superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14378v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The vibrational modes in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ easily induce octahedral rotations without tilting. Being on the verge of a magnetic instability, such propensity of octahedral rotation may also produce magnetic fluctuations. In this work, we analyze the long-range magnetic phase diagram incorporating such octahedral rotations and demonstrate the possibility of an altermagnetic phase in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$. Using ab-initio calculations, we first study single layer Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ with octahedral rotations, obtaining an orbital-selective $g$-wave altermagnetic phase. We further provide an effective $t_{2g}$ tight-binding model, demonstrating that the $g$-wave altermagnetism is primarily a product of second and third nearest neighbor interorbital hybridizations between the ${\gamma}z$ ($\gamma=x,y$) orbitals, but only a much longer range intraorbital hybridization in the $xy$ orbitals, establishing a strong orbital-selectiveness for the altermagnetism. Notably, by replacing the $xy$ orbital with the $x^2-y^2$ orbital, a similar tight-biding model may be used to investigate the hole-doped cuprate superconductors. We then study bulk Sr$_2$RuO$_4$, where we find the altermagnetic phase as the magnetic ground state for a range of finite octahedral rotations. In the bulk, interlayer hopping breaks some of the symmetries of the $g$-wave altermagnet, resulting in a $d_{xy}$-wave altermagnet, still with orbital selectiveness. We also include relativistic effects through spin-orbit coupling and obtain that an effective staggered Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction generates weak ferromagnetism. Finally, we discuss the implications of the altermagnetic order on the intrinsic superconductivity of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$. Assuming in-plane and intraorbital pairing, the altermagnetism favors spin-singlet $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave or $g$-wave pairing, or (nematic or chiral) combinations thereof.</description>

      <title>Planar Josephson junction devices with narrow superconducting strips: Topological properties and optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04468v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the low-energy physics of planar Josephson junction structures realized in a quasi-two dimensional semiconductor system proximity-coupled to narrow superconducting films. Using both a recursive Green's function approach and an effective Hamiltonian approximation, we investigate the topological superconducting phase predicted to emerge in this type of system. We first characterize the effects associated with varying the electrostatic potentials applied within the unproximitized semiconductor regions. We then address the problem of optimizing the width of the superconductor films and identifying the optimal regimes characterized by large topological gap values. We find that structures with narrow superconducting films of widths ranging between about $100~$nm and $200~$nm can support topological superconducting phases with gaps up to $40\%$ of the parent superconducting gap, significantly larger than those characterizing the corresponding wide-superconductor structures. This work represents the first component of a proposed comprehensive strategy to address this optimization problem in planar Josephson junction structures and realize robust topological devices.</description>

      <title>Optical absorption activated by an ultrashort half-cycle pulse in metallic and superconducting states of the Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00313v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The development of high-intensity ultrashort laser pulses unlocks the potential of pump-probe spectroscopy in sub-femtosecond timescale. Notably, subcycle pump pulses can generate electronic states unreachable by conventional multicycle pulses, leading to a phenomenon that we refer to as subcycle-pulse engineering. In this study, we employ the time-dependent density-matrix renormalization group method to unveil the transient absorption spectra of superconducting and metallic states in nearly half-filled one-dimensional and two-dimensional Hubbard models excited by an ultrashort half-cycle pulse, which can induce a current with inversion-symmetry breaking. In a superconducting state realized in attractive on-site interactions, we find the transient activation of absorptions at energies corresponding to the amplitude modes of superconducting and charge-density-wave states. On the other hand, in a metallic state realized in the two-dimensional model with repulsive on-site interactions, we obtain another type of absorption enhancements, which are distributed broadly in spin excitation energies. These findings indicate that superconducting and metallic states are sensitive to an ultrashort half-cycle pulse, leading to the transient activations of optical absorptions with their respective mechanisms.</description>
