      <title>Long-lived Topological Flatband Excitons in Semiconductor Moir\'e Heterostructures: a Bosonic Kane-Mele Model Platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moir\'e superlattices based on two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have emerged as a highly versatile and fruitful platform for exploring correlated topological electronic phases. One of the most remarkable examples is the recently discovered fractional quantum anomalous Hall effect (FQAHE) under zero magnetic field. Here we propose a minimal structure that hosts long-lived excitons -- a ubiquitous bosonic excitation in TMD semiconductors -- with narrow topological bosonic bands. The nontrivial exciton topology originates from hybridization of moir\'e interlayer excitons, and is tunable by controlling twist angle and electric field. At small twist angle, the lowest exciton bands are isolated from higher energy bands, and provides a solid-state realization of bosonic Kane-Mele model with topological flatbands, which could potentially support the bosonic version of FQAHE.</description>

      <title>Non-Abelian fractionalization in topological minibands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent discovery of fractional quantum anomalous Hall states in moir\'e systems, we consider the possibility of realizing non-Abelian phases in topological minibands. We study a family of moir\'e systems, skyrmion Chern band (SCB) models, which can be realized in two-dimensional semiconductor/magnetic skyrmion heterostructures and also capture the essence of twisted transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) homobilayers. We show using many-body exact diagonalization that, in spite of strong Berry curvature variations in momentum space%and real-space emergent magnetic field, , the non-Abelian Moore-Read state can be realized at half filling of the second miniband. These results demonstrate the feasibility of non-Abelian fractionalization in moir\'e systems without Landau levels and shed light on the desirable conditions for their realization. In particular, we discuss the prospect of realizing the Moore-Read state at filling factor $\nu=3/2$ in twisted semiconductor bilayers.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian reconstruction via ringdown dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many experimental techniques aim at determining the Hamiltonian of a given system. The Hamiltonian describes the system's evolution in the absence of dissipation, and is often central to control or interpret an experiment. Here, we theoretically propose and experimentally demonstrate a method for Hamiltonian reconstruction from measurements over a large area of phase space, overcoming the main limitation of previous techniques. A crucial ingredient for our method is the presence of dissipation, which enables sampling of the Hamiltonian through ringdown-type measurements. We apply the method to a driven-dissipative system -- a parametric oscillator -- observed in a rotating frame, and reconstruct the (quasi-)Hamiltonian of the system. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our method provides direct experimental access to the so-called symplectic norm of the stationary states of the system, which is tied to the particle- or hole-like nature of excitations of these states. In this way, we establish a method to unveil qualitative differences between the fluctuations around stabilized minima and maxima of the nonlinear out-of-equilibrium stationary states. Our method constitutes a versatile approach to characterize a wide class of driven-dissipative systems.</description>

      <title>Ab initio modelling of quantum dot qubits: Coupling, gate dynamics and robustness versus charge noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron spins in semiconductor devices are highly promising building blocks for quantum processors (QPs). Commercial semiconductor foundries can create QPs using the same processes employed for conventional chips, once the QP design is suitably specified. There is a vast accessible design space; to identify the most promising options for fabrication, one requires predictive modeling of interacting electrons in real geometries and complex non-ideal environments. In this work we explore a modelling method based on real-space grids, an ab initio approach without assumptions relating to device topology and therefore with wide applicability. Given an electrode geometry, we determine the exchange coupling between quantum dot qubits, and model the full evolution of a $\sqrt{\text{SWAP}}$ gate to predict qubit loss and infidelity rates for various voltage profiles. Moreover we explore the impact of unwanted charge defects (static and dynamic) in the environment, and test robust pulse sequences. As an example we exhibit a sequence correcting both systematic errors and (unknown) charge defects, observing an order of magnitude boost in fidelity. The technique can thus identify the most promising device designs for fabrication, as well as bespoke control sequences for each such device.</description>

      <title>Surface Chern-Simons theory for third-order topological insulators and superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three-dimensional 3rd-order topological insulators (TOTIs) and superconductors (TOTSCs), as the highestorder topological phases hosting zero corner modes in physical dimension, has sparked extensive research interest. However, such topological states have not been discovered in reality due to the lack of experimental schemes of realization. Here, we propose a novel surface Chern-Simons (CS) theory for 3rd-order topological phases, and show that the theory enables a feasible and systematic design of TOTIs and TOTSCs. We show that the emergence of zero Dirac (Majorana) corner modes is entirely captured by an emergent $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ CS term that can be further characterized by a novel two-particle Wess-Zumino (WZ) term uncovered here in the surfaces of three-dimensional topological materials. Importantly, our proposed CS term characterization and two-particle WZ term mechanism provide a unique perspective to design TOTIs (TOTSCs) in terms of minimal ingredients, feasibly guiding the search for underlying materials, with promising candidates being discussed. This work shall advance both the theoretical and experimental research for highest-order topological matters.</description>

      <title>Majorana zero-modes in a dissipative Rashba nanowire</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Condensed matter systems are continuously subjected to dissipation, which often has adverse effects on quantum phenomena. We focus on the impact of dissipation on a superconducting Rashba nanowire. We reveal that the system can still host Majorana zero-modes (MZMs) with a finite lifetime in the presence of dissipation. Most interestingly, dissipation can also generate two kinds of dissipative boundary states: four robust zero-modes (RZMs) and two MZMs, in the regime where the non-dissipative system is topologically trivial. The MZMs appear via bulk gap closing and are topologically characterized by a winding number. The RZMs are not associated with any bulk states and possess no winding number, but their emergence is instead tied to exceptional points. Further, we confirm the stability of the dissipation-induced RZMs and MZMs in the presence of random disorder. Our study paves the way for both realizing and stabilizing MZMs in an experimental setup, driven by dissipation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rhombohedral multilayer graphene (RnG) featuring partially flat bands has emerged as an important platform to probe strong Coulomb correlation effects. Theoretical consideration of local electron-electron interactions are of particular importance for electronic eigenstates with a tendency to spatially localize. We present a method to incorporate mean-field electron-electron interaction corrections in the tight-binding hopping parameters of the band Hamiltonian within the extended Hubbard model that incorporates ab initio estimates of on-site ($U$) and inter-site ($V$) Hubbard interactions for the $\pi$ bands of RnG. Our Coulomb-interaction renormalized band structures feature electron-hole asymmetry, band flatness, band gap, and anti-ferromagnetic ground states in excellent agreement with available experiments for $n \geq 4$. We reinterpret the putative gaps proposed in $n=3$ systems in terms of shifting electron and hole density of states peaks depending on the range of the Coulomb interaction models.</description>

      <title>Decoherence in Andreev spin qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically study the dephasing of an Andreev spin qubit (ASQ) due to electric and magnetic noise. Using a tight-binding model, we calculate the Andreev states formed in a Josephson junction where the link is a semiconductor with strong spin-orbit interaction. As a result of both the spin-orbit interaction and induced superconductivity, the local charge and spin of these states varies as a function of externally controllable parameters: the phase difference between the superconducting leads, an applied magnetic field, and filling of the underlying semiconductor. Concomitantly, coupling to fluctuations of the electric or magnetic environment will vary, which informs the rate of dephasing. We qualitatively predict the dependence of dephasing on the nature of the environment, magnetic field, phase difference between the junction, and filling of the semiconductor. Comparing the simulated electric- and magnetic-noise-induced dephasing rate to experiment suggests that the dominant source of noise is magnetic. Moreover, by appropriately tuning these external parameters, we find sweet-spots at which we predict an enhancement in ASQ coherence times.</description>

      <title>Entropy Driven Inductive Response of Topological Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D topological insulators are characterized by an insulating bulk and extended surface states exhibiting a helical spin texture. In this work, we investigate the hyperfine interaction between the spin-charge coupled transport of electrons and the nuclear spins in these surface states. Previous work has predicted that in the quantum spin Hall insulator phase, work can be extracted from a bath of polarized nuclear spins as a resource. We employ nonequilibrium Green's function analysis to show that a similar effect exists on the surface of a 3D topological insulator, albeit rescaled by the ratio between electronic mean free path and device length. The induced current due to thermal relaxation of polarized nuclear spins has an inductive nature. We emphasize the inductive response by rewriting the current-voltage relation in harmonic response as a lumped element model containing two parallel resistors and an inductor. In a low-frequency analysis, a universal inductance value emerges that is only dependent on the device's aspect ratio. This scaling offers a means of miniaturizing inductive circuit elements. An efficiency estimate follows from comparing the spin-flip induced current to the Ohmic contribution. The inductive effect is most prominent in topological insulators which have a large number of spinful nuclei per coherent segment, of which the volume is given by the mean free path length, Fermi wavelength and penetration depth of the surface state.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic phonon-plasmon polaritons in a hBN-graphene van der Waals structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper a thorough theoretical study of a new class of collective excitations, dubbed hyperbolic surface phonon plasmon polaritons, is performed. This new type of light-matter excitations are shown to have unique properties that allows to explore them both as the basis of ultra-sensitive devices to the dielectric nature of its surroundings. The system is a van der Waals heterostructure -- a layered metamaterial, composed of different 2D materials in direct contact one with another, namely graphene ribbons and hexagonal boron nitride slabs of nanometric size. In the paper we discuss the spectrum of these new class of excitations, the associated electromagnetic fields, the sensitivity to the dielectric function of its surroundings, and the absorption spectrum. All this is accomplished using an analytical model that considerably diminishes the computational burden, as well as elucidates the underling physical mechanism of the excitations supported by the device.</description>

      <title>Dichotomous Dynamics of Magnetic Monopole Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recent advance in the study of emergent magnetic monopoles was the discovery that monopole motion is restricted to dynamical fractal trajectories (J. Hall\'en et al, Science 378, 1218 (2022)) thus explaining the characteristics of magnetic monopole noise spectra (Dusad, R. et al. Nature 571, 234 (2019); Samarakoon, A. M. et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 119, e2117453119 (2022)). Here we apply this new theory to explore the dynamics of field-driven monopole currents, finding them comprised of two quite distinct transport processes: initially swift fractal rearrangements of local monopole configurations followed by conventional monopole diffusion. This theory also predicts a characteristic frequency dependence of the dissipative loss-angle for AC-field-driven currents. To explore these novel perspectives on monopole transport, we introduce simultaneous monopole current control and measurement techniques using SQUID-based monopole current sensors. For the canonical material Dy2Ti2O7, we measure ${\Phi}(t)$, the time-dependence of magnetic flux threading the sample when a net monopole current $J(t) = \dot{\Phi}(t)/\mu_0$ is generated by applying an external magnetic field $B_0(t)$. These experiments find a sharp dichotomy of monopole currents, separated by their distinct relaxation time-constants before and after $t \approx 600 {\mu}s$ from monopole current initiation. Application of sinusoidal magnetic fields $B_0(t) = Bcos({\omega}t)$ generates oscillating monopole currents whose loss angle ${\theta}(f)$ exhibits a characteristic transition at frequency $f \approx 1.8$ kHz over the same temperature range. Finally, the magnetic noise power is also dichotomic, diminishing sharply after $t \approx 600 {\mu}s$. This complex phenomenology represents a new form of heterogeneous dynamics generated by the interplay of fractionalization and local spin configurational symmetry.</description>

Abstract: The goal of quantum metrology is to improve measurements' sensitivities by harnessing quantum resources. Metrologists often aim to maximize the quantum Fisher information, which bounds the measurement setup's sensitivity. In studies of fundamental limits on metrology, a paradigmatic setup features a qubit (spin-half system) subject to an unknown rotation. One obtains the maximal quantum Fisher information about the rotation if the spin begins in a state that maximizes the variance of the rotation-inducing operator. If the rotation axis is unknown, however, no optimal single-qubit sensor can be prepared. Inspired by simulations of closed timelike curves, we circumvent this limitation. We obtain the maximum quantum Fisher information about a rotation angle, regardless of the unknown rotation axis. To achieve this result, we initially entangle the probe qubit with an ancilla qubit. Then, we measure the pair in an entangled basis, obtaining more information about the rotation angle than any single-qubit sensor can achieve. We demonstrate this metrological advantage using a two-qubit superconducting quantum processor. Our measurement approach achieves a quantum advantage, outperforming every entanglement-free strategy.</description>

      <title>Crystalline axion electrodynamics in charge-ordered Dirac semimetals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Three-dimensional Dirac semimetals can be driven into an insulating state by coupling to a charge density wave (CDW) order. Here, we consider the quantized crystalline responses of such charge-ordered Dirac semimetals, which we dub Dirac-CDW insulators, in which charge is bound to disclination defects of the lattice. Using analytic and numeric methods we show the following. First, when the CDW is lattice-commensurate, disclination-line defects of the lattice have a quantized charge per length. Second, when the CDW is inversion-symmetric, disclinations of the lattice have a quantized electric polarization. Third, when the CDW is lattice-commensurate and inversion-symmetric, disclinations are characterized by a "disclination filling anomaly" -- a quantized difference in the total charge bound to disclination-lines of Dirac-CDW with open and periodic boundaries. We construct an effective response theory that captures the topological responses of the Dirac-CDW insulators in terms of a total derivative term, denoted the $R\wedge F$ term. The $R\wedge F$ term describes the crystalline analog of the axion electrodynamics that are found in Weyl semimetal-CDW insulators. We also use the crystalline responses and corresponding response theories to classify the strongly correlated topological phases of three-dimensions Dirac-semimetals.</description>

      <title>Quantum transport properties of the topological Dirac Semimetal $\alpha$-Sn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report measurements of the electrical resistivity ($\rho$) and thermoelectric power (S) in a thin film of strained single-crystalline $\alpha$-Sn grown by molecular beam epitaxy on an insulating substrate. The temperature (T) dependence of the resistivity of $\alpha$-Sn can be divided into two regions:below T* $\approx$ 135 K $\rho$(T) shows a metallic-like behaviour, while above this temperature an increasing contribution from thermally excited holes to electrical transport is observed. However, it is still dominated by highly mobile electrons, resulting in a negative sign of the Seebeck coefficient above T = 47 K. In the low temperature limit, a small positive S likely reflects the persistent contribution from low-mobility holes or the positive phonon-drag thermopower. In the presence of the magnetic field (B) applied along an electric field or thermal gradient, we note a negative magnetoresistance or a negative slope of S(B), respectively. The theoretical prediction for the former (calculated using density functional theory) agrees well with the experiment. However, these characteristics quickly disappear when the magnetic field is deviated from an orientation parallel to the electrical field or the thermal gradient. We indicate that the behaviour of the electrical resistivity and thermoelectric power can be explained in terms of the chiral current arising from the topologically non-trivial electronic structure of $\alpha$-Sn. Its decay at high temperature is a consequence of the decreasing ratio between the intervalley Weyl relaxation time to the Drude scattering time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have found a signature of current-induced sliding motion in a helimagnet MnAu$_2$ thin film. In the helimagnetic state with a uniform chirality, differential resistivity shows an abrupt change at a threshold bias current. Judging from the similarity to the canonical charge/spin density wave systems, we have ascribed the abrupt change to the sliding motion of the helimagnetic structure.

      <description>arXiv:2403.00538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical bistability and oscillating phases exist in a Sagnac interferometer and a single ring resonator made of $\chi^{(3)}$ nonlinear medium where the refractive indices are modulated by the light intensity due to the Kerr nonlinearity. An array of coupled nonlinear ring resonators behave similarly but with more complexity due to the presence of the additional couplings.Here, we theoretically demonstrate the bifurcation of topological edge modes which leads to optical bistability in the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger lattice with the Kerr nonlinearity. Additionally, we demonstrate periodic and chaotic switching behaviors in an oscillating phase resulting from the coupling between the topological edge mode and bulk modes with different chiralities, i.e., clockwise and counter-clockwise circulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semiconductor quantum dots have shown impressive breakthroughs in the last years, with single and two qubit gate fidelities matching other leading platforms and scalability still remaining a relative strength. However, due to qubit wiring considerations, mobile electron architectures have been proposed to facilitate upward scaling. In this work, we examine and demonstrate the possibility of significantly outperforming static EDSR-type single-qubit pulsing by taking advantage of the larger spatial mobility to achieve larger Rabi frequencies and reduce the effect of charge noise. Our theoretical results indicate that fidelities are ultimately bottlenecked by spin-valley physics, which can be suppressed through the use of quantum optimal control, and we demonstrate that, across different potential regimes and competing physical models, shuttling based single-qubit gates retain significant advantage over existing alternatives.</description>

      <title>Microscopic many-body theory of two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy of exciton-polarons in one-dimensional materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.11998v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have developed a microscopic many-body theory of two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy (2DCS) for a model of polarons in one-dimensional (1D) materials. Our theory accounts for contributions from all three processes: excited-state emission (ESE), ground-state bleaching (GSB), and excited-state absorption (ESA). While the ESE and GSB contributions can be accurately described using a Chevy's ansatz with one particle-hole excitation, the ESA process requires information about the many-body eigenstates involving two impurities. To calculate these double polaron states, we have extended the Chevy's ansatz with one particle-hole excitation. The validity of this ansatz was verified by comparing our results with an exact calculation using Bethe's ansatz. Our numerical results reveal that in the weak interaction limit, the ESA contribution cancels out the total ESE and GSB contributions, resulting in less significant spectral features. However, for strong interactions, the features of the ESA contribution and the combined ESE and GSB contributions remain observable in the 2DCS spectra. These features provide valuable information about the interactions between polarons. Additionally, we have investigated the mixing time dynamics, which characterize the quantum coherences of the polaron resonances. Overall, our theory provides a comprehensive framework for understanding and interpreting the 2DCS spectra of polarons in 1D materials, shedding light on their interactions and coherent dynamics.</description>

      <title>Electron-optics using negative refraction in two-dimensional inverted-band $pn$ junctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.07913v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electron optics deals with condensed matter platforms for manipulating and guiding electron beams with high efficiency and robustness. Common devices rely on the spatial confinement of the electrons into one-dimensional channels. Recently, there is growing interest in electron optics applications in two dimensions, which heretofore are almost exclusively based on graphene devices. In this work, we study band-inverted systems resulting from particle-hole hybridization and demonstrate their potential for electron optics applications. We develop the theory of interface scattering in an inverted-band $pn$ junction using a scattering matrix formalism and observe negative refraction conditions as well as transmission filtering akin to graphene's Klein tunneling but at finite angles. Based on these findings, we provide a comprehensive protocol for constructing electron optic components, such as focusing and bifurcating lenses, polarizers, and mirrors. We numerically test the robustness of our designs to disorder and finite temperatures, and motivate the feasibility of experimental realization. Our work opens avenues for electron optics in two dimensions beyond graphene-based devices, where a plethora of inverted-band materials in contemporary experiments can be harnessed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09413v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The electronic state of \alpha-type organic Dirac fermion systems such as \alpha-(ET)_2I_3 or \alpha-(BETS)_2I_3 has been studied under magnetic fields using the four-band tight-binding model with Peierls phase factors. The validity of the Dirac fermion picture in these materials was confirmed by the generated Hofstadter butterfly and its Chern numbers. The four-component envelope function of the N = 0 Landau level with valley degeneracy was studied. It was found that the two degenerate valley states have different weights on A and A' molecules connected by inversion. This feature is also recognized for the N = 0 spin-split Landau levels under the Zeeman effect and the spin-orbit interaction. The spontaneous valley symmetry breaking in the N = 0 Landau levels due to the exchange interaction results in the \nu = 1 and -1 quantum Hall states accompanied by the spatial charge and spin modulations in a unit cell.</description>

      <title>Tuning dissipation dilution in 2D material resonators by MEMS-induced tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07047v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Resonators based on two-dimensional (2D) materials have exceptional properties for application as nanomechanical sensors, which allows them to operate at high frequencies with high sensitivity. However, their performance as nanomechanical sensors is currently limited by their low quality ($Q$)-factor. Here, we make use of micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) to apply pure in-plane mechanical strain, enhancing both their resonance frequency and Q-factor. In contrast to earlier work, the 2D material resonators are fabricated on the MEMS actuators without any wet processing steps, using a dry-transfer method. A platinum clamp, that is deposited by electron beam-induced deposition, is shown to be effective in fixing the 2D membrane to the MEMS and preventing slippage. By in-plane straining the membranes in a purely mechanical fashion, we increase the tensile energy, thereby diluting dissipation. This way, we show how dissipation dilution can increase the $Q$-factor of 2D material resonators by 91\%. The presented MEMS actuated dissipation dilution method does not only pave the way towards higher $Q$-factors in resonators based on 2D materials, but also provides a route toward studies of the intrinsic loss mechanisms of 2D materials in the monolayer limit.</description>

      <title>Linear and Non-Linear Response of Quadratic Lindbladians</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06593v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quadratic Lindbladians encompass a rich class of dissipative electronic and bosonic quantum systems, which have been predicted to host new and exotic physics. In this study, we develop a Lindblad-Keldysh spectroscopic response formalism for open quantum systems that elucidates their steady-state response properties and dissipative phase transitions via finite-frequency linear and non-linear probes. As illustrative examples, we utilize this formalism to calculate the (1) density and dynamic spin susceptibilities of a boundary driven XY model at and near criticality, (2) linear and non-linear optical responses in Bernal bilayer graphene coupled to dissipative leads, and (3) steady state susceptibilities in a bosonic optical lattice. We find that the XY model spin density wavelength diverges with critical exponent 1/2, and there are gapless dispersive modes in the dynamic spin response that originate from the underlying spin density wave order; additionally the dispersing modes of the weak and ultra-strong dissipation limits exhibit a striking correspondence since the boundary dissipators couple only weakly to the bulk in both cases. In the optical response of the Bernal bilayer, we find that the diamagnetic response can decrease with increasing occupation, as opposed to in closed systems where the response increases monotonically with occupation; we study the effect of second harmonic generation and shift current and find that these responses, forbidden in centrosymmetric closed systems, can manifest in these open systems as a result of dissipation. We compare this formalism to its equilibrium counterpart and draw analogies between these non-interacting open systems and strongly interacting closed systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum Coherent States and Path Integral Method to Stochastically Determine the Anisotropic Volume Expansion in Lithiated Silicon Nanowires</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.19217v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This computational research study will analyze the multi-physics of lithium ion insertion into a silicon nanowire in an attempt to explain the electrochemical kinetics at the nanoscale and quantum level. The electron coherent states and a quantum field version of photon density waves will be the joining theories that will explain the electron-photon interaction within the lithium-silicon lattice structure. These two quantum particles will be responsible for the photon absorption rate of silicon atoms that are hypothesized to be the leading cause of breaking diatomic silicon covalent bonds that ultimately leads to volume expansion. It will be demonstrated through the combination of Maxwell stress tensor, optical amplification and path integrals that a stochastic analyze using a variety of Poisson distributions that the anisotropic expansion rates in the &lt;110&gt;, &lt;111&gt; and &lt;112&gt; orthogonal directions confirms the findings ascertained in previous works made by other research groups. The computational findings presented in this work are similar to those which were discovered experimentally using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and simulation models that used density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics (MD). The refractive index and electric susceptibility parameters of lithiated silicon are interwoven in the first principle theoretical equations and appears frequently throughout this research presentation, which should serve to demonstrate the importance of these parameters in the understanding of this component in lithium ion batteries.</description>

Abstract: Spin-valley properties in two-dimensional (2D) semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDC) has attracted significant interest due to the possible applications in quantum computing. Spin-valley properties can be exploited in TMDC quantum dot (QD) with well-resolved energy levels. This requires smaller QDs, especially in material systems with heavy carrier effective mass e.g. TMDCs and silicon. Device architectures employed for TMDC QDs so far have difficulty achieving smaller QDs. Therefore, an alternative approach in the device architecture is needed. Here, we propose a multilayer device architecture to achieve a gate-defined QD in TMDC with a relatively large energy splitting on the QD. We provide a range of device dimensions and dielectric thicknesses and its correlation with the QD energy splitting. The device architecture is modeled realistically. Moreover, we show that all the device parameters used in modeling are experimentally achievable. These studies lay the foundation for future work toward spin-valley qubits in TMDCs. The successful implementation of these device architectures will drive the technological development of 2D materials-based quantum technologies.</description>

Abstract: We present a perturbative approach to disordered systems in one spatial dimension that accesses the full range of phase disorder and clarifies the connection between localization and phase information. We consider a long chain of identically disordered scatterers and expand in the reflection strength of any individual scatterer. As an example application, we show analytically that in a discrete-time quantum walk, the localization length can depend non-monotonically on the strength of phase disorder (whereas expanding in weak disorder yields monotonic decrease). More generally, we obtain to all orders in the expansion a particular non-separable form for the joint probability distribution of the transmission coefficient logarithm and reflection phase. Furthermore, we show that for weak local reflection strength, a version of the scaling theory of localization holds: the joint distribution is determined by just three parameters.</description>

Abstract: We present a perturbative approach to disordered systems in one spatial dimension that accesses the full range of phase disorder and clarifies the connection between localization and phase information. We consider a long chain of identically disordered scatterers and expand in the reflection strength of any individual scatterer. We apply this expansion to several examples, including the Anderson model, a general class of periodic-on-average-random potentials, and a two-component discrete-time quantum walk, showing analytically in the latter case that the localization length can depend non-monotonically on the strength of phase disorder (whereas expanding in weak disorder yields monotonic decrease). More generally, we obtain to all orders in the expansion a particular non-separable form for the joint probability distribution of the transmission coefficient logarithm and reflection phase.

      <title>Particle-hole asymmetric ferromagnetism and spin textures in the triangular Hubbard-Hofstadter model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.07876v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a lattice model subject to a perpendicular magnetic field, when the lattice constant is comparable to the magnetic length, one enters the "Hofstadter regime," where continuum Landau levels become fractal magnetic Bloch bands. Strong mixing between bands alters the nature of the resulting quantum phases compared to the continuum limit; lattice potential, magnetic field, and Coulomb interaction must be treated on equal footing. Using determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) and density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) techniques, we study this regime numerically in the context of the Hubbard-Hofstadter model on a triangular lattice. In the field-filling phase diagram, we find a broad wedge-shaped region of ferromagnetic ground states for filling factor $\nu \leq 1$, bounded below by filling factor $\nu = 1$ and bounded above by half-filling the lowest Hofstadter subband. We observe signatures of SU(2) quantum Hall ferromagnetism at filling factors $\nu=1$ and $\nu=3$. The phases near $\nu=1$ are particle-hole asymmetric, and we observe a rapid decrease in ground state spin polarization consistent with the formation of skyrmions only on the electron doped side. At large fields, above the ferromagnetic wedge, we observe a low-spin metallic region with spin correlations peaked at small momenta. We argue that the phenomenology of this region likely results from exchange interaction mixing fractal Hofstadter subbands. The phase diagram derived beyond the continuum limit points to a rich landscape to explore interaction effects in magnetic Bloch bands.</description>

      <title>Spin-orbit enabled unconventional Stoner magnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00838v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Stoner instability remains a cornerstone for understanding metallic ferromagnets. This instability captures the interplay of Coulomb repulsion, Pauli exclusion, and two-fold fermionic spin degeneracy. In materials with spin-orbit coupling, this fermionic spin is generalized to a two-fold degenerate pseudospin which is typically believed to have symmetry properties as spin. Here we identify a distinct symmetry of this pseudospin that forbids it to couple to a Zeeman field. This `spinless' property is required to exist in five non-symmorphic space groups and has non-trivial implications for superconductivity and magnetism. With Coulomb repulsion, Fermi surfaces composed primarily of this spinless pseudospin feature give rise to Stoner instabilities into magnetic states that are qualitatively different than ferromagnets. These spinless-pseudospin ferromagnets break time-reversal symmetry, have a vanishing magnetization, are non-collinear, and exhibit altermagnetic-like energy band spin-splittings. In superconductors, for all pairing symmetries and field orientations, this spinless pseudospin extinguishes paramagnetic limiting. We discuss applications to superconducting UCoGe and magnetic NiS$_{2-x}$Se$_x$.</description>

      <title>Identifying gap-closings in open non-Hermitian systems by Biorthogonal Polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12213v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate gap-closings in one- and two-dimensional tight-binding models with two bands, containing non-Hermitian hopping terms, and open boundary conditions (OBCs) imposed along one direction. We compare the bulk OBC spectra with the periodic boundary condition (PBC) spectra, pointing out that they do not coincide, which is an intrinsic characteristic of non-Hermitian systems. The non-Hermiticity, thus, results in the failure of the familiar notions of bulk-boundary correspondence found for Hermitian systems. This necessitates the search for topological invariants which can characterize gap-closings in open non-Hermitian systems correctly and unambiguously. We elucidate the behaviour of two possible candidates applicable for one-dimensional slices -- (1) the sum of winding numbers for the two bands defined on a generalized Brillouin zone and (2) the biorthogonal polarization (BP). While the former shows jumps/discontinuities for some of the non-Hermitian systems studied here, at points when an edge mode enters the bulk states and becomes delocalized, it does not maintain quantized values in a given topological phase. On the contrary, BP shows jumps at phase transitions, and takes the quantized value of one or zero, which corresponds to whether an actual edge mode exists or whether that mode is delocalized and absorbed within the bulk (not being an edge mode anymore).</description>
