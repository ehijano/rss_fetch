      <title>Continuous persistence landscapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the size of data increase, persistence diagrams often exhibit structured asymptotic behavior, converging weakly to a Radon measure. However, conventional vector summaries such as persistence landscapes are not well-behaved in this setting, particularly for diagrams with high point multiplicities. We introduce continuous persistence landscapes, a new vectorization defined on a special class of Borel measures, which we call q-tame measures. It includes both the persistence diagrams and their weak limits. Our construction generalizes persistence landscapes to a measure-theoretic setting, preserving the intrinsic structure of persistence measures. We show that this vector summary is bijective and L^1-stable under mild assumptions, and that the original measure can be uniquely reconstructed. This approach gives a more faithful description of the shape of data in the limit and provides a stable, invertible way to analyze topological features in large systems.</description>

      <title>On coshuffle comultiplication on configuration spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a coshuffle comultiplication on the singular chain complex of configuration spaces, and we show that this structure endows the configuration space with the structure of a differential graded coalgebra (DGCoAlg). We then prove that the coshuffle comultiplication is compatible with the external product through a natural commutation relation. As an application, we investigate configuration spaces of graphs and the associated graph braid groups. In particular, for graphs of topological circumference at most 1, we prove that the singular chain complex of the configuration space is formal as a DGCoAlg. Moreover, we obtain a complete classification of the primitivity in the homology of configuration spaces of such graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish periodicity results for higher real $K$-theories at all heights and for all finite subgroups of the Morava stabilizer group at the prime 2. We further analyze the $RO(G)$-periodicity lattice of the height-$h$ Lubin--Tate theory, proving new $RO(G)$-graded periodicities and explicit finiteness results for the $RO(G)$-graded homotopy groups of $E_h$. Together, these results provide a foundation for both the structural and computational study of higher real $K$-theories.</description>

      <title>Foundations of Simplicial Complexes:From Geometric Independence to Realizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a complete foundational treatment of simplicial complexes from Euclidean spaces through geometric realizations, emphasizing concrete computations, examples, and practical verification methods. Beginning with finite point sets in finite and infinite-dimensional Euclidean spaces, geometric independence is established via linear independence of relative vectors, with explicit matrix rank tests. $n$-simplices arise as convex hulls of such independent points, proven convex, compact, uniquely spanned, and homeomorphic to unit balls, with detailed barycentric coordinate. Simplicial complexes form through collections closed under faces and with simplex intersections either empty or common faces, verified by necessary and sufficient disjoint interior conditions, illustrated across dimensions from lines to tetrahedra plus non-examples. Derived structures including subcomplexes, $p$-skeletons, vertices, stars, and links lead to geometric realizations as continuous spaces with weak topology, proven Hausdorff and locally compact, alongside ray characterizations of convexity and continuity via simplicial maps.</description>

      <title>Even torsions in the homology group of the Milnor fiber boundary of hyperplane arrangements in $\mathbb{C}^3$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the homology group of the Milnor fiber boundary of a hyperplane arrangement in $\mathbb{C}^{3}$. By the work of N\'emethi--Szil\'ard, the homeomorphism type of the Milnor fiber boundary is combinatorially determined, and an explicit formula for the first Betti number is known. However, the torsion part of the first homology group is poorly understood. In this paper, under some conditions, we prove that the number of even-order torsion summands of the first homology group is greater than or equal to the Euler characteristic of the projectivized complement.</description>

      <title>Simplicial Complex Emergence on Directed Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study when co-evolving (or adaptive) higher-order networks defined on directed hypergraphs admit a simplicial description. Binary and triadic couplings are modelled by time-dependent weight tensors. Using representation theory of the symmetric group $S_k$, we decompose these tensors into fully symmetric, fully antisymmetric, and mixed isotypic components, and track their Frobenius norms to define three asymptotic regimes and a quantitative notion of convergence. In the symmetric (resp. antisymmetric) limit, we certify emergence and stability of simplicial complexes via a local boundary test and interior drift conditions that enforce downward-closure; in the mixed limit, we show that the minimal faithful object is a semi-simplicial set. We illustrate the theory with simulations that track the isotypic Frobenius norms and the higher-order structure. Practically, our work provides rigorous conditions under which homological tools are justified for adaptive higher-order systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the K-theory spectra of many assemblers, such as the assembler of polytopes in euclidean, hyperbolic or spherical geometry, as well as the assembler of definable sets, are equivalent to the K-theory spectrum of a squares category. We use this to lift the definable Euler characteristic of definable sets in an o-minimal structure to a map of K-theory spectra.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14146v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note, (rational) Betti numbers of homotopy colimits for toric diagrams and their classifying spaces are described in terms of sheaf cohomology under CW poset assumption on opposite to the respective indexing category. Split $T$-CW complexes with a CW orbit poset have such a decomposition (up to an equivariant homeomorphism). Cohen-Macaulayness (over $\mathbb{Q}$) of the $T$-action on $hocolim\ D$ is equivalent to acyclicity for a certain sheaf provided that $D$ is a $T$-diagram over $C$, and $C^{op}$ is a homology manifold. The ordinary and bigraded Betti numbers are computed for skeletons of equivariantly formal spaces from this class (in particular, of compact nonsingular toric varieties).</description>

      <title>Cohomology of Tanabe algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00599v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study the (co)homology of Tanabe algebras, which are a family of subalgebras of the partition algebras exhibiting a Schur-Weyl duality with certain complex reflection groups. The homology of the partition algebras has been shown to be related to the homology of the symmetric groups by Boyd-Hepworth-Patzt and the results they obtain depend on a parameter. In all known results, the homology of a diagram algebra is dependent on one of two things: the invertibility of a parameter in the ground ring or the parity of the positive integer indexing the number of pairs of vertices. We show that the (co)homology of Tanabe algebras is isomorphic to the (co)homology of the symmetric groups and that this is independent of both the parameter and the parity of the index. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of a result of this sort. Along the way we will also study the (co)homology of the uniform block permutation algebra and the totally propagating partition algebra as well collecting cohomological analogues of known results for the homology of partition algebras and Jones annular algebras.</description>

      <title>Equivariant and Invariant Parametrized Topological Complexity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12921v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a $G$-equivariant fibration $p \colon E\to B$, we introduce and study the invariant analogue of Cohen, Farber and Weinberger's parametrized topological complexity, called the invariant parametrized topological complexity. This notion generalizes the invariant topological complexity introduced by Lubawski and Marzantowicz. When $G$ is a compact Lie group acting freely on $E$, we show that the invariant parametrized topological complexity of the $G$-fibration $p \colon E\to B$ coincides with the parametrized topological complexity of the induced fibration $\overline{p} \colon \overline{E} \to \overline{B}$ between the orbit spaces. Furthermore, we compute the invariant parametrized topological complexity of equivariant Fadell-Neuwirth fibrations, which measures the complexity of motion planning in the presence of obstacles with unknown positions, where the order of their placement is irrelevant. In addition, we study the equivariant sectional category and the equivariant parametrized topological complexity, which serve as essential tools for obtaining several results in this paper.</description>

We then apply these results to analyze higher coalgebra structures of topological coHochschild homology (coTHH) and establish its Morita-Takeuchi invariance, which are precisely dual to the corresponding properties of topological Hochschild homology.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a classification of the total spaces of $S^3$-bundles over $\mathbb{C}P^2$ up to orientation-preserving homotopy equivalence. Our approach proceeds in two steps: we first derive the PL-homeomorphism classification for these manifolds by computing their Kreck-Stolz invariants. Then, building upon this PL classification result and through an application of surgery theory, we establish the homotopy equivalence classification.</description>

Abstract: We prove that an \'etale fibration between $L_\infty$-bundles admits local sections composed of several elementary morphisms of particularly simple and accessible type. As applications, we establish an inverse function theorem for $L_\infty$-bundles and provide an elementary proof that every weak equivalence of $L_\infty$-bundles induces a quasi-isomorphism of the differential graded algebras of global functions. Furthermore, we apply this inverse function theorem to show that the homotopy category of $L_\infty$-bundles admits a simple description in terms of homotopy classes of morphisms, when $L_\infty$-bundles are restricted to their germs around their classical loci.</description>

      <title>Towards 2-derivators for formal $\infty$-category theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05216v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Derivators, introduced independently by Grothendieck and Heller in the 1980s, provide a categorical framework for studying homotopy theory. They are based on the idea that, while the homotopy 1-category of a single model category or $(\infty, 1)$-category retains only limited information, the structured collection of homotopy 1-categories of diagram categories often suffices for many homotopical purposes. In this paper, we introduce a set of axioms for a 2-dimensional analog of derivators: a refinement of the homotopy 2-category of an enriched model category or $(\infty, 2)$-category into a coherent system of homotopy 2-categories of higher categories of diagrams. We show that these axioms are satisfied in a variety of models, including standard ones related to $(\infty, 1)$-category theory. Moreover, we prove that the axioms are preserved under a certain shift operation.</description>

      <title>Dagger $n$-categories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01651v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Category theory provides a unified language for organizing composable operations in many disciplines. In disciplines where unitarity is fundamental -- such as functional analysis, quantum field theory, and quantum logic -- this language must also capture adjoints, leading to the notion of dagger categories. Higher category theory, which extends this framework to encode operations between operations, has recently become indispensable in both theoretical physics and pure mathematics. Finding a higher categorical analogue of a dagger category is therefore key to the foundations of quantum field theory.
  In this work, we present a coherent definition of \emph{dagger $(\infty,n)$-category} in terms of equivariance data trivialized on parts of the category. Our main example is the bordism $(\infty,n)$-category $\mathbf{Bord}_{n}^X$. This allows us to define (fully-local) \emph{reflection-positive topological quantum field theories} to be higher dagger functors out of $\mathbf{Bord}_{n}^X$.</description>

Abstract: For a given pair of numbers $(d,k)$, we establish the minimal number of vertices in pure $d$-dimensional simplicial complexes with non-trivial homology in dimension $k$. Furthermore, we solve the problem under the additional constraint of strong connectivity with respect to any intermediate dimension.</description>
