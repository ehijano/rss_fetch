      <title>Engineering deterministic, tunable, and reversible folds in graphene with the use of ultrafast laser micro-patterned stretchable polymer substrate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The unique atomic monolayer structure of graphene gives rise to a broad range of remarkable mechanical folding properties. However, significant challenges remain in effectively harnessing them in a controllable and scalable manner. In this study, we introduce an innovative approach that employs micron-scale cavities, fabricated through ultrafast laser patterning, in a stretchable polymer substrate to locally modulate adhesion and strain transfer to a graphene monolayer. This technique enables the deterministic induction of single folds in graphene with fold dimensions, width and height in the hundreds of nanometers, tunable through the geometry of the polymer cavities and the applied strain. Importantly, these folds are reversible, returning to a flat morphology with minimal structural damage, as confirmed by Raman spectroscopy. Additionally, our method allows for the creation of fields of folds with reproducible periodicity, defining clear potential for practical applications. These findings pave the way for the development of advanced devices that would leverage the strain and morphology-sensitive properties of graphene.</description>

      <title>Future prospect of anisotropic 2D tin sulfide (SnS) for emerging electronic and quantum device applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The family of anisotropic two-dimensional (2D) emerging materials is rapidly evolving due to their low crystal symmetry and in-plane structural anisotropy. Among these, 2D tin sulfide (SnS) has gained significant attention because of its distinctive crystalline symmetry and the resulting extraordinary anisotropic physical properties. This perspective explores recent developments in anisotropic 2D SnS. In particular, it highlights advances in isolating high-quality SnS monolayers (1L-SnS) and in applying advanced techniques for anisotropic characterization. The discussion continues with an overview of the anisotropic optical properties of SnS, followed by recent progress in emerging electronic device applications, including energy storage, neuromorphic (synaptic) systems, and quantum technologies. In addition to presenting significant research findings on SnS, this perspective outlines current limitations and discusses emerging opportunities and future prospects for its application in quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Controlling Topological Quantum Transport via Non-Perturbative Light-Matter Interaction in Disordered Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the possibility to induce topological quantum transport in otherwise trivial systems through non-perturbative light-matter interactions, as well as the enhancement of this effect in the presence of disorder. Going beyond prior theoretical approaches, we introduce a computational framework which performs large-scale real-space quantum dynamics simulations, including carrier thermalization and disorder effects, in systems driven out of equilibrium by light or other external interactions. This methodology is illustrated in gapped single-layer and Bernal bilayer graphene but can be implemented in arbitrarily complex systems, including disordered and aperiodic systems, opening novel avenues for the design of multifunctional topological electronic devices that work in far-from-equilibrium regimes.</description>

      <title>Effect of Berry connection on attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy in gapped graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated the attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy (ATAS) in gapped graphene by numerically solving the four-band density-matrix equations. Our results reveal that, in contrast to graphene whose fishbone-shaped spectra primarily oscillates at twice the frequency of the pump laser, the ATAS of gapped graphene exhibits a first-order harmonic component induced by the Berry connection. To gain insight into this interesting results, we employ a simplified model that considers only the nonequivalent electrons at $\Gamma$ and $\textrm{M}$ points in the Brillouin zone. This model allows us to derive an analytical expression for the ATAS contribution stemming from the Berry connection. Our analytical results qualitatively reproduce the key features observed in the numerical simulations, and reveal that the first-order harmonic component of spectra arises ont only from the Berry connections but also from the energy shifts associated with the effective mass of electrons at the $\Gamma$ and $\textrm{M}$ points. These results shed light on the complex generation mechanism of the ATAS in symmetry-broken materials.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Cu$_2$O Rydberg excitons -- real density matrix approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Basing on recent reliable measurements of the life- and coherence time of Cu$_2$O Rydberg excitons, we present an analytical method which enables to describe the experimental results. The real-density matrix approach (RDMA) is applied to describe two-photon absorption in Cu$_2$O through the excitonic response to the exciting fields. This approach produces an analytical expression for the emission intensity time evolution, and can be used to explain trends in reported experimental data. Our approach takes into account the effect of the coherence between the electron-hole pair and the electromagnetic fields, the quantum beats and the life- and coherence time dependence on the applied laser power. Adding a separation of slow- and rapid dynamics components we find excellent agreement with the experimental data.</description>

      <title>Tunable phase transitions from semimetals to Chern insulators in two-dimensional quadratic-band-crossing materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We systematically investigate how static symmetry-breaking perturbations and dynamic Floquet terms via a polarized light manipulate the topological phase transitions in the two-dimensional quadratic-band-crossing-point (QBCP) materials. The Berry curvature shows distinct behavior in such two situations. It is linearly and quadratically proportional to the product of microstructural parameters $t_{x,z}$ for the former and the latter, respectively. The static perturbation eliminates the QBCP and opens an energy gap, which leads to the momentum-inversion symmetry of Berry curvature. This yields a nontrivial Chern number determined by the microstructural parameters. In contrast, we demonstrate that either a circularly or an elliptically polarized light breaks the time-reversal symmetry, transforming the QBCP semimetal into a Chern insulator with a quantized anomalous Hall conductivity $\sigma_{xy} = Ce^2/\hbar$, where the Chern number is governed by the polarization angle. Moreover, the linear polarization preserves the central antisymmetry of the Berry curvature, giving rise to a topological trivial insulator. These results establish a tunable topological phase transition from a QBCP semimetal to Chern insulator in the two-dimensional QBCP materials.</description>

      <title>Valley resolved optical spectroscopy and coherent excitation of quantum Hall edge states in graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that chiral edge states in graphene under Quantum Hall effect conditions can be selectively probed and excited by terahertz or infrared radiation with single-quasiparticle sensitivity without affecting bulk states. Moreover, valley-selective excitation of edge states is possible with high fidelity. The underlying physical mechanism is the inevitable violation of adiabaticity and inversion symmetry breaking for electron states near the edge. This leads to the formation of Landau level-specific and valley-specific absorbance spectral peaks that are spectrally well separated from each other and from absorption by the bulk states, and have different polarization selection rules. Furthermore, inversion symmetry breaking enables coherent driving of chiral edge photocurrents due to second-order nonlinear optical rectification which becomes allowed in the electric dipole approximation.</description>

      <title>Probing Phonon Modes in Reconstructed twisted Homo and Hetero Bilayer System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twist angle engineering in van der Waals homo and hetero-bilayers introduces profound modifications in their electronic, optical and mechanical properties due to lattice reconstruction. In these systems, the interlayer coupling and atomic rearrangement strongly depend on the twist angle, leading to the formation of periodic Moire superlattices. At small twist angles, significant lattice relaxation results in the emergence of domain structures separated by one dimensional soliton networks, influencing electronic band structures and phonon modes. Here we systematically investigate the impact of lattice reconstruction on phonon renormalization in twisted bilayer graphene (TBLG,homo) and graphene-hBN Moire superlattices(hetero). Using Raman spectroscopy, we identify distinct phonon behaviours across different twist angle regimes. In TBLG, we observe the evolution of the G peak, including broadening, splitting, and the emergence of additional peaks in the small angle range 0.3 to 1 degree, attributed to Moire modified phonon interactions. At large twist angles, the peaks gradually merge back into a single feature, reflecting the reduced impact of lattice reconstruction. Similarly, in hBN graphene Moire superlattices, we detect Moire induced Raman peaks above and below the G peak, while the central G peak remains largely invariant to twist angle variation. The theoretical calculations uncover Moire phonon modes originating from different stacking regions providing insights into phonon renormalization. Our results establish a direct link between twist angle, lattice reconstruction, Moire phonons, and interlayer coupling, offering a fundamental framework for understanding phonon engineering in twisted bilayer systems. These findings pave the way for controlling phononic, optoelectronic and heat flow properties in next generation van der Waals heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Decoherence and fidelity enhancement during shuttling of entangled spin qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shuttling of spin qubits between different locations is a key element in many prospective semiconductor systems for quantum information processing, but the shuttled qubits should be protected from decoherence created by time- and space-dependent noises. Since the paths of different spin qubits are interrelated, the noises acting on the shuttled spins exhibit complex and unusual correlations. We appraise the role of these correlations using the concept of trajectories on random sheets, and demonstrate that they can drastically affect efficiency of the coherence protection. These correlations can also be exploited to enhance the shuttling fidelity, and we show that by encoding logical qubit in a state of two consequtively shuttled entangled spins, high fidelity can be achieved even for very slow shuttling. We identify the conditions favoring this encoding, and quantify improvement in the shuttling fidelity in comparison with the single-spin shuttling.</description>

      <title>Striped excitonic (super)solid in anisotropic semiconductors with screened exciton interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the Gross-Pitaevskii framework, we reveal the emergence of a crystallized phase of an exciton condensate in an atomically-thin anisotropic semiconductor, where screening of exciton-exciton interactions is introduced by a proximal doped graphene layer. While such screened interactions are expected to yield a hexagonal crystal lattice in the excitonic condensate in isotropic semiconductor quantum wells [see e.g. Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{108}, 060401 (2012)], here we show that for atomically thin semiconductors with strong electronic anisotropy, such as few-layer black phosphorus, the crystallized exciton phase acquires a parallel stripe structure - unanticipated to date. The optimal conditions for the emergence of this phase, as well as for its coexistence with excitonic superfluidity in a striped supersolid phase, are identified.</description>

      <title>Fast readout of quantum dot spin qubits via Andreev spins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin qubits in semiconducting quantum dots are currently limited by slow readout processes, which are orders of magnitude slower than gate operations. In contrast, Andreev spin qubits benefit from fast measurement schemes enabled by the large resonator couplings of superconducting qubits but suffer from reduced coherence during qubit operations. Here, we propose fast and high-fidelity measurement protocols based on an electrically-tunable coupling between quantum dot and Andreev spin qubits. In realistic devices, this coupling can be made sufficiently strong to enable high-fidelity readout well below microseconds, potentially enabling mid-circuit measurements. Crucially, the electrical tunability of our coupler permits to switch it off during idle periods, minimizing crosstalk and measurement back-action. Our approach is fully compatible with germanium-based devices and paves the way for scalable quantum computing architectures by leveraging the advantages of heterogeneous qubit implementations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the out-of-equilibrium driving protocol of score-based generative models (SGMs) can be learned via a local learning rule. The gradient with respect to the parameters of the driving protocol are computed directly from force measurements or from observed system dynamics. As a demonstration, we implement an SGM in a network of driven, nonlinear, overdamped oscillators coupled to a thermal bath. We first apply it to the problem of sampling from a mixture of two Gaussians in 2D. Finally, we train a network of 10x10 oscillators to sample images of 0s and 1s from the MNIST dataset.</description>

      <title>High-Efficiency Tunable Microwave Photon Detector Based on a Semiconductor Double Quantum Dot Coupled to a Superconducting High-Impedance Cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-efficiency single-photon detection in the microwave domain is a key enabling technology for quantum sensing, communication, and information processing. However, the extremely low energy of microwave photons (~{\mu}eV) presents a fundamental challenge, preventing direct photon-to-charge conversion as achieved in optical systems using semiconductors. Semiconductor quantum dot (QD) charge qubits offer a compelling solution due to their highly tunable energy levels in the microwave regime, enabling coherent coupling with single photons. In this work, we demonstrate microwave photon detection with an efficiency approaching 70% in the single-photon regime. We use a hybrid system comprising a double quantum dot (DQD) charge qubit electrostatically defined in a GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure, coupled to a high-impedance Josephson junction (JJ) array cavity. We systematically optimize the hybrid device architecture to maximize the conversion efficiency, leveraging the strong charge-photon coupling and the tunable DQD tunnel coupling rates. Incoming cavity photons coherently excite the DQD qubit, which in turn generates a measurable electrical current, realizing deterministic photon-to-charge conversion. Moreover, by exploiting the independent tunability of both the DQD transition energy and the cavity resonance frequency, we characterize the system efficiency over a range of 3-5.2 GHz. Our results establish semiconductor-based cavity-QED architectures as a scalable and versatile platform for efficient microwave photon detection, opening new avenues for quantum microwave optics and hybrid quantum information technologies.</description>

      <title>Even-in-magnetic field part of transverse resistivity as a probe of magnetic transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14498v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The component of the resistivity tensor $\rho_{ij}$ corresponding to voltage transverse to both an applied current and a magnetic field can be separated into odd and even parts with respect to the applied magnetic field. The former contains information, for example, about the ordinary or anomalous Hall effect. The latter is often ascribed to experimental artefacts and ignored. Here, we show that upon suppressing these artefacts in carefully controlled experiments, useful information remains. We first investigate the well-explored ferromagnet CoFeB, where the even part of $\rho_{yx}$ contains a contribution from the anisotropic magnetoresistance, which we confirm by Stoner--Wohlfarth modelling. We then apply our approach to magnetotransport measurements of $\rm Mn_5Si_3$ thin films, which undergo a transition from non-collinear to an altermagnetic collinear state. In this material, the even part of the transverse signal is sizable only in the low-spin-symmetry phase below $\approx 80$~K. Transverse resistivity measurements thus offer a simple and readily available probe of magnetic order transitions.</description>

Abstract: We investigate charge and spin conductance, charge and spin quantum noise, along with charge and spin $\Delta_T$ noise, as diagnostic tools to distinguish Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) states from Majorana-bound states (MBS) in a one-dimensional metal/spin-flipper/metal/insulator/superconductor junction. YSR states arise from magnetic impurities acting as spin-flippers within a trivial s-wave superconducting gap, while MBS emerge in topological superconductors, often leading to ambiguity in experiments where magnetic impurities mimic zero-energy MBS signatures. By replacing the trivial superconductor with a topological one exhibiting triplet pairing (e.g., chiral p or spinless p-wave nanowires), we identify robust and distinguishing features of YSR and MBS states. Our analysis demonstrates that combined measurements of both charge and spin conductance, charge and spin quantum noise, and their $\Delta_T$ noise counterparts offer unique and reliable signatures to differentiate YSR states from genuine MBS, thereby reducing false-positive interpretations in topological superconductivity experiments.</description>

      <title>Single electron interference and capacitive edge mode coupling generates $\Phi_0/2$ flux periodicity in Fabry-Perot interferometers</title>

Abstract: Experimental observations of flux periodicity $\phi_{0}/2$, where $\phi_0=h/e$, for interference of the outermost edge mode in the integer quantum Hall regime have been attributed to an exotic electron pairing mechanism. We present measurements of an AlGaAs/GaAs Fabry-Perot interferometer operated in the integer quantum Hall regime for filling factors $1\leq \nu \leq 3$ that has been designed to simultaneously express measurable bulk-edge and edge-edge couplings. At integer fillings $\nu=2$ and $\nu=3$, we observe interference with flux periodicity $\phi_{0}/2$ for the outermost edge mode. Our analysis indicates that the periodicity $\phi_0/2$ is not driven by electron pairing but is the result of capacitive coupling between isolated edge modes and the interfering outer edge. The interfering unit of charge for the outermost edge mode at $\nu=2$ and $\nu=3$ was determined to be $e^*=1$, where the effective charge $e^*$ is normalized to the charge of an electron. Our measurements demonstrate that the magnitude of the interfering charge can be determined in operando in a Fabry-Perot interferometer.</description>

      <title>Phonon thermal Hall as a lattice Aharonov-Bohm effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18236v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a growing list of insulators, experiments find that magnetic field induces a misalignment between the heat flux and the thermal gradient vectors. This phenomenon, known as the phonon thermal Hall effect, implies energy flow without entropy production along the orientation perpendicular to the temperature gradient. Experimentally, the thermal Hall angle is maximal at the temperature of peak longitudinal thermal conductivity. At this temperature, $T_{max}$, Normal phonon-phonon collisions dominate over Umklapp and boundary scattering events. In the presence of a magnetic field, Born-Oppenheimer approximated molecular wave functions are known to acquire a phase, due to the difference in the spatial distributions of the positive charge of the nuclei and the negative charge of the electrons. Combined with unavoidable anharmonicity, the field-induced phase of the molecular wave-function gives rise to a geometric [Berry] phase for phonons and modifies three-phonon interference. The rough amplitude of the thermal Hall angle expected in this picture is set by the wavelength, $\lambda_{ph}$, and the crest displacement, $\delta u_m$, of phonons at $T_{max}$. The derived expression is surprisingly close to what has been experimentally found in black phosphorus, germanium and silicon.</description>

      <title>Quantum Resistor-Capacitor Circuit with two Majorana Bound States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21255v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive the equations of motion for a system composed of a spinless quantum dot coupled to two normal leads and two Majorana bound states (MBSs), utilizing the auxiliary-mode expansion method and the nonequilibrium Green function technique. Subsequently, we use these equations to analyze the linear conductance, adiabatic linear capacitance, and adiabatic linear relaxation resistance of the system. We find that when the phase difference between the two MBSs is an integer multiple of $\pi$, the MBSs enter the zero mode, leading to the complete suppression of the linear relaxation resistance. In this case, the relaxation resistance is highly sensitive to the MBSs modes. On the other hand, when the phase difference is not an integer multiple of $\pi$, the linear conductance is fully suppressed. Furthermore, the linear relaxation resistance remains completely suppressed, even when the MBSs are not in the zero mode, and the system loses its sensitivity to the MBSs modes.</description>

      <title>Antichiral edge states and Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces in a two-dimensional proximity-induced superconductor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11256v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that a magnetic field parallel to the plane of a two-dimensional electron gas with Rashba spin orbit coupling in proximity to a superconductor leads to a topological phase in coexistence with a single pair of Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces. This phase hosts antichiral edge states of co-propagating Majorana fermions and are spatially localized at the opposite edges of the sample, perpendicular to the magnetic field. We discuss the characteristic signatures in the current-phase relation of a Josephson junction formed by two reservoirs in the topological phase.</description>

      <title>Exceeding the maximum classical energy density in fully charged quantum batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01832v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum batteries are anticipated to achieve significant advancements in energy storage capacity. In classical batteries, the energy density at each subsystem reaches its maximum value, denoted as $E_C$, which is determined by dividing the maximum energy by the number of subsystems. We demonstrate that this limit can be surpassed in quantum batteries by protocols of Quantum Energy Teleportaion (QET), allowing for the energy density at a subsystem to exceed the value of $E_C$. Our protocol offers enhanced efficiency, reduces experimental complexity on quantum computers, and enables instantaneous energy charging through Local Operations and Classical Communication (LOCC). Leveraging quantum entanglement, this protocol significantly improves quantum energy storage systems, promising advances in quantum computing and new technological applications. This work represents a crucial step towards revolutionizing quantum energy storage and transfer.</description>

      <title>Emergence of non-ergodic multifractal quantum states in geometrical fractals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18559v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Eigenstate multifractality, a hallmark of non-interacting disordered metals which can potentially be observed in many-body localized states as well, is characterized by anomalous slow dynamics and appears relevant for many areas of quantum physics from measurement-driven systems to superconductivity. We propose a novel approach to achieve non-ergodic multifractal (NEM) states without disorder by iteratively introducing defects into a crystal lattice, reshaping it from a plain structure into fractal geometry. By comprehensive analysis of the Sierpi\'nski gasket case, we find a robust evidence of the emergence of NEM states that go beyond the conventional classification of quantum states and designate new pathways for quantum transport studies. We discuss potential experimental signatures of these states.</description>

      <title>Chiral Nonlinear Polaritonics with van der Waals Metasurfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18760v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the strong-coupling regime, the interaction between light and matter reaches a hybridization state where the photonic and material components are inseparably linked. Using tailored states of light to break symmetries in such systems can facilitate the development of novel non-equilibrium quantum materials. Chiral optical cavities offer a promising approach for this, enabling either temporal or spatial symmetry-breaking, both of which are unachievable with conventional mirror cavities. For spatial symmetry-breaking, a cavity must discriminate the handedness of circularly polarized light, a functionality uniquely provided by chiral metamaterials. Here, we propose and demonstrate experimentally a chiral transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) metasurface with broken out-of-plane symmetry, allowing for the selective formation of self-hybridized exciton-polaritons with specific handedness. Our metasurface maintains maximal chirality for oblique incidence up to 20{\deg}, significantly outperforming all previously known designs, thereby transforming the angle of incidence from a constraint into a new degree of freedom for sub-nanometer-precise tuning of the cavity's resonant wavelength. Moreover, we study the chiral strong-coupling regime in nonlinear experiments and reveal the polariton-driven nature of chiral third-harmonic generation. Our results demonstrate a clear pathway towards van der Waals (vdW) metasurfaces as a novel and potent platform for chiral polaritonics with implications in a wide range of photonics research, such as non-reciprocal photonic devices and valleytronics.</description>

      <title>Disordered quantum antiferromagnetism in doped semiconductors: Density of states approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07305v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a theoretical study of the exchange interaction in a system of spatially disordered magnetic moments. A typical example of such a system is an impurity semiconductor, whose magnetic properties are associated with the exchange interaction of the impurity atoms. In this study, we consider the case of antiferromagnetic exchange interaction, which we describe by the Heisenberg Hamiltonian. To calculate the magnetic properties of the disordered system, we employ the density of states method. Our calculations demonstrate a good quantitative agreement with the dependence of the Si:P magnetic susceptibility on temperature in a wide range of impurity concentrations and temperatures.</description>

      <title>Ion Track Formation via Electric-Field-Enhanced Nanoscale Energy Deposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12884v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-energy ion irradiation deposits extreme energy in a narrow range (1-10 nm) along ion trajectories in solid through electronic energy loss, producing unique irradiation effects such as ion tracks. However, intrinsic velocity effects impose an upper limit on electronic energy loss that cannot be overcome by adjusting irradiation parameters. We introduce a method using electric fields during irradiation to enhance nanoscale energy deposition by accelerating ion-excited electrons within sub-picosecond timescales.Our extended thermal spike model quantitatively describes this enhancement and predicts a significant reduction in the electronic energy loss required for ion track formation in amorphous SiO2, which is in excellent agreement with experimental observations. This work provides a new approach to control energy deposition during irradiation and boosts the wide application of ion tracks in material modification and nanoengineering to much broader extents.</description>
