      <title>Periodic Beurling-Ahlfors Extensions and Quasisymmetric Rigidity of Carpets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish periodic quasiconformal extension theorems for periodic orientation-preserving quasisymmetric self homeomorphisms of quasicircles or quasi-round carpets. As applications, we prove that, if $f$ is a periodic orientation-preserving quasisymmetric self homeomorphism of a quasi-round carpet $S$ of measure zero in $\mathbb{C}$, which has a fixed point in the outer peripheral circle of $S$, then $f$ is the identity on $S$. Moreover, we prove that, if $f$ is a quasisymmetric self homeomorphism of a square carpet $S$ of measure zero in a rectangle ring, which fixes each of the four vertices of the outer peripheral circle of $S$, then $f$ is the identity on $S$. An analogous rigidity problem for the $\mathbb{C}^*$-square carpets is discussed.</description>

      <title>Bicombing the mapping class group and Teichm\"uller space via stable cubical intervals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this mostly expository article, we provide a new account of our proof with Minsky and Sisto that mapping class groups and Teichm\"uller spaces admit bicombings. More generally, we explain how the hierarchical hull of a pair of points in any colorable hierarchically hyperbolic space is quasi-isometric to a finite CAT(0) cube complex of bounded dimension, with the added property that perturbing the pair of points results in a uniformly bounded change to the cubical structure. Our approach is simplified and new in many aspects.</description>

      <title>Rational Angle Bisection Problem in Higher Dimensional Spaces and Incenters of Simplices over Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we generalize the following problem, which is called the rational angle bisection problem, to the $n$-dimensional space $k^n$ over a subfield $k$ of $\mathbb R$: on the coordinate plane, for which rational numbers $a$ and $b$ are the slopes of the angle bisectors between two lines with slopes $a$ and $b$ rational? First, we give a few characterizations of when the angle bisectors between two lines with direction vectors in $k^n$ have direction vectors in $k^n.$ To find solutions to the problem in the case when $k = \mathbb Q,$ we also give a formula for the integral solutions of $x_1{}^2+\dots +x_n{}^2 = dx_{n+1}{}^2,$ which is a generalization of the negative Pell's equation $x^2-dy^2 = -1,$ where $d$ is a square-free positive integer. Second, by applying the above characterizations, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for the incenter of a given $n$-simplex with $k$-rational vertices to be $k$-rational. On the coordinate plane, we prove that every triangle with $k$-rational vertices and incenter can be obtained by scaling a triangle with $k$-rational side lengths and area, which is a generalization of a Heronian triangle. We also state certain fundamental properties of a few centers of a given triangle with $k$-rational vertices.</description>

      <title>Penny graphs in the hyperbolic plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of finding the maximum number $e_d(n)$ of pairs of touching circles in a packing of $n$ congruent circles of diameter $d$ in the hyperbolic plane of curvature $-1$. In the Euclidean plane, the maximum comes from a spiral construction of the tiling of the plane with equilateral triangles (Harborth 1974), with a similar result in the hyperbolic plane for the values of $d$ corresponding to the order-$k$ triangular tilings (Bowen 2000). We present various upper and lower bounds for $e_d(n)$ for all values of $d &gt; 0$. In particular, we prove that if $d &gt; 0.66114\dots$ except for $d=0.76217\dots$, then the number of touching pairs is less than the one coming from a spiral construction in the order-$7$ triangular tiling, which we conjecture to be extremal. We also give a lower bound $e_d(n) &gt; (2+\varepsilon_d)n$ where $\varepsilon_d &gt; 1$ for all $d &gt; 0$.</description>

      <title>Convex Hulls of Dragon Curves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.12434v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The fundamental geometry of self-similar sets becomes significantly more complex when the generating contractive maps include non-trivial rotational components. A well-known family exemplifying this complexity is that of the dragon curves in the plane. In this paper, we prove that every dragon curve has a polygonal convex hull. Moreover, we completely characterize their convex hulls.</description>

      <title>The Z-Gromov-Wasserstein Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08233v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) distance is a powerful tool for comparing metric measure spaces which has found broad applications in data science and machine learning. Driven by the need to analyze datasets whose objects have increasingly complex structure (such as node and edge-attributed graphs), several variants of GW distance have been introduced in the recent literature. With a view toward establishing a general framework for the theory of GW-like distances, this paper considers a vast generalization of the notion of a metric measure space: for an arbitrary metric space $Z$, we define a $Z$-network to be a measure space endowed with a kernel valued in $Z$. We introduce a method for comparing $Z$-networks by defining a generalization of GW distance, which we refer to as $Z$-Gromov-Wasserstein ($Z$-GW) distance. This construction subsumes many previously known metrics and offers a unified approach to understanding their shared properties. This paper demonstrates that the $Z$-GW distance defines a metric on the space of $Z$-networks which retains desirable properties of $Z$, such as separability, completeness, and geodesicity. Many of these properties were unknown for existing variants of GW distance that fall under our framework. Our focus is on foundational theory, but our results also include computable lower bounds and approximations of the distance which will be useful for practical applications.</description>

      <title>Sobolev and quasiconformal distortion of intermediate dimension with applications to conformal dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10525v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the distortion of intermediate dimension under supercritical Sobolev mappings and also under quasiconformal or quasisymmetric homeomorphisms. In particular, we extend to the setting of intermediate dimensions both the Gehring--V\"ais\"al\"a theorem on dilatation-dependent quasiconformal distortion of dimension and Kovalev's theorem on the nonexistence of metric spaces with conformal dimension strictly between zero and one. Applications include new contributions to the quasiconformal classification of Euclidean sets and a new sufficient condition for the vanishing of conformal box-counting dimension. We illustrate our conclusions with specific consequences for Bedford--McMullen carpets, samples of Mandelbrot percolation, and product sets containing a polynomially convergent sequence factor.</description>

      <title>Pointwise Distance Distributions for detecting near-duplicates in large materials databases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.04798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.04798v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many real objects are modeled as discrete sets of points, such as corners or other salient features. For our main applications in chemistry, points represent atomic centers in a molecule or a solid material. We study the problem of classifying discrete (finite and periodic) sets of unordered points under isometry, which is any transformation preserving distances in a metric space.
  Experimental noise motivates the new practical requirement to make such invariants Lipschitz continuous so that perturbing every point in its epsilon-neighborhood changes the invariant up to a constant multiple of epsilon in a suitable distance satisfying all metric axioms. Since the given points are unordered, the key challenge is to compute all invariants and metrics in a near-linear time of the input size.
  We define the Pointwise Distance Distribution (PDD) for any discrete set and prove, in addition to the properties above, the completeness of PDD for all periodic sets in general position. The PDD can compare nearly 2 million crystals from the world's five largest databases within 2 hours on a modest desktop computer. The impact is upholding data integrity in crystallography because the PDD will not allow anyone to claim a `new' material as a noisy disguise of a known crystal.</description>

      <title>Results on Lorentzian metric spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24423v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a short introduction to ``Lorentzian metric spaces" i.e., spacetimes defined solely in terms of the two-point Lorentzian distance. As noted in previous work, this structure is essentially unique if minimal conditions are imposed, such as the continuity of the Lorentzian distance and the relative compactness of chronological diamonds. The latter condition is natural for interpreting these spaces as low-regularity versions of globally hyperbolic spacetimes. Confirming this interpretation, we prove that every Lorentzian metric space admits a Cauchy time function. The proof is constructive for this general setting and it provides a novel argument that is interesting already for smooth spacetimes.</description>
