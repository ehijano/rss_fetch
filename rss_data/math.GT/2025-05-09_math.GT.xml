      <title>Detecting right-veering diffeomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02210v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A result of Honda, Kazez, and Mati\'{c} states that a contact structure is tight if and only if all its supporting open books are right-veering. We show a combinatorial way of detecting the left-veering arcs in open books, implying the existence of an algorithm that detects the right-veering property for compact surfaces with boundary.</description>

      <title>Cyclic quantum Teichm\"uller theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02316v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on the pioneering ideas of Kashaev [Kas98,Kas00], we present a fully explicit construction of a finite-dimensional projective representation of the dotted Ptolemy groupoid when the quantum parameter $q$ is a root of unity, which reproduces the central charge of the $SU(2)$ Wess--Zumino--Witten model. A basic ingredient is the cyclic quantum dilogarithm [FK94].
  A notable contribution of this work is a reinterpretation of the relations among the parameters in the cyclic quantum dilogarithm to ensure its pentagon identity in terms of the \emph{mutations of coefficients}. In particular, we elucidate the dual roles of these parameters: as coefficients in quantum cluster algebras and as the central characters of quantum cluster variables.
  We introduce the quantum intertwiner associated with a mapping class as a composite of cyclic quantum dilogarithm operators, whose trace defines a quantum invariant. We prove that it gives an intertwiner of local representations of quantum Teichm\"uller space in the sense of Bai--Bonahon--Liu [BBL07], and also coincides with the transpose of the reduced quantum hyperbolic operator of Baseilhac--Benedetti [BB18].
  We provide a geometric method to decompose the space of quantum states into irreducible modules of the Chekhov--Fock algebra. The reduced version of quantum intertwiner conjecturally coincides with the Bonahon--Liu intertwiner [BL07].</description>

      <title>Locally homogeneous Axiom A flows II: geometric structures for Anosov subgroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20195v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a non-compact semisimple real Lie group $G$ and an Anosov subgroup $\Gamma$, we utilize the correspondence between $\mathbb R$-valued additive characters on Levi subgroups $L$ of $G$ and $\mathbb R$-affine homogeneous line bundles over $G/L$ to systematically construct families of non-empty domains of proper discontinuity for the $\Gamma$-action. If $\Gamma$ is torsion-free, the analytic dynamical systems on the quotients are Axiom A, and assemble into a single partially hyperbolic multiflow. Each Axiom A system admits global analytic stable/unstable foliations with non-wandering set a single basic set on which the flow is conjugate to Sambarino's refraction flow, establishing that all refraction flows arise in this fashion. Furthermore, the $\mathbb R$-valued additive character is regular if and only if the associated Axiom A system admits a compatible pseudo-Riemannian metric and contact structure, which we relate to the Poisson structure on the dual of the Lie algebra of $G$.</description>

      <title>The Manhattan curve, ergodic theory of topological flows and rigidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.13451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.13451v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For every non-elementary hyperbolic group, we introduce the Manhattan curve associated to any pair of left-invariant hyperbolic metrics which are quasi-isometric to a word metric. It is convex; we show that it is continuously differentiable and moreover is a straight line if and only if the corresponding two metrics are roughly similar, i.e., they are within bounded distance after multiplying by a positive constant. Further, we prove that the Manhattan curve associated to two strongly hyperbolic metrics is twice continuously differentiable. The proof is based on the ergodic theory of topological flows associated to general hyperbolic groups and analyzing the multifractal structure of Patterson-Sullivan measures. We exhibit some explicit examples including a hyperbolic triangle group and compute the exact value of the mean distortion for pairs of word metrics.</description>

      <title>Irrational rotations and 2-filling rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00097v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a skew product transformation associated to an irrational rotation of the circle [0,1]/~. This skew product keeps track of the number of times an orbit of the rotation lands in the two complementary intervals of {0,1/2} in the circle. We show that under certain conditions on the continued fraction expansion of the irrational number defining the rotation, the skew product transformation has certain dense orbits. This is in spite of the presence of numerous non-dense orbits. We use this to construct laminations on infinite type surfaces with exotic properties. In particular, we show that for every infinite type surface with an isolated planar end, there is an infinite clique of 2-filling rays based at that end. These 2-filling rays are relevant to Bavard--Walker's loop graphs.</description>

      <title>Topological 8d $\mathcal{N}=1$ Gauge Theory: Novel Floer Homologies, and $A_\infty$-categories of Six, Five, and Four-Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18575v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work is a continuation of the program initiated in [arXiv:2311.18302]. We show how one can define novel gauge-theoretic (holomorphic) Floer homologies of seven, six, and five-manifolds, from the physics of a topologically-twisted 8d $\mathcal{N}=1$ gauge theory on a Spin$(7)$-manifold via its supersymmetric quantum mechanics interpretation. They are associated with $G_2$ instanton, Donaldson-Thomas, and Haydys-Witten configurations on the seven, six, and five-manifolds, respectively. We also show how one can define hyperk\"ahler Floer homologies specified by hypercontact three-manifolds, and symplectic Floer homologies of instanton moduli spaces. In turn, this will allow us to derive Atiyah-Floer type dualities between the various gauge-theoretic Floer homologies and symplectic intersection Floer homologies of instanton moduli spaces. Via a 2d gauged Landau-Ginzburg model interpretation of the 8d theory, one can derive novel Fukaya-Seidel type $A_\infty$-categories that categorify Donaldson-Thomas, Haydys-Witten, and Vafa-Witten configurations on six, five, and four-manifolds, respectively -- thereby categorifying the aforementioned Floer homologies of six and five-manifolds, and the Floer homology of four-manifolds from [arXiv:2311.18302] -- where an Atiyah-Floer type correspondence for the Donaldson-Thomas case can be established. Last but not least, topological invariance of the theory suggests a relation amongst these Floer homologies and Fukaya-Seidel type $A_\infty$-categories for certain Spin$(7)$-manifolds. Our work therefore furnishes purely physical proofs and generalizations of the conjectures by Donaldson-Thomas [2], Donaldson-Segal [3], Cherkis [4], Hohloch-Noetzel-Salamon [5], Salamon [6], Haydys [7], and Bousseau [8], and more.</description>

      <title>Topological regularity of Busemann spaces of nonpositive curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14455v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the topological results of Lytchak-Nagano and Lytchak-Nagano-Stadler for CAT(0) spaces to the setting of Busemann spaces of nonpositive curvature, i.e., BNPC spaces. We give a characterization of locally BNPC topological manifolds in terms of their links and show that the singular set of a locally BNPC homology manifold is discrete. We also prove that any (globally) BNPC topological 4-manifold is homeomorphic to Euclidean space. Applications include a topological stability theorem for locally BNPC G-spaces. Our arguments also apply to spaces admitting convex geodesic bicombings.</description>
