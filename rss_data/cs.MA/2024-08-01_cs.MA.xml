      <title>Learning in Multi-Objective Public Goods Games with Non-Linear Utilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Addressing the question of how to achieve optimal decision-making under risk and uncertainty is crucial for enhancing the capabilities of artificial agents that collaborate with or support humans. In this work, we address this question in the context of Public Goods Games. We study learning in a novel multi-objective version of the Public Goods Game where agents have different risk preferences, by means of multi-objective reinforcement learning. We introduce a parametric non-linear utility function to model risk preferences at the level of individual agents, over the collective and individual reward components of the game. We study the interplay between such preference modelling and environmental uncertainty on the incentive alignment level in the game. We demonstrate how different combinations of individual preferences and environmental uncertainties sustain the emergence of cooperative patterns in non-cooperative environments (i.e., where competitive strategies are dominant), while others sustain competitive patterns in cooperative environments (i.e., where cooperative strategies are dominant).</description>

      <title>Condorcet's Jury Theorem with Abstention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The well-known Condorcet's Jury theorem posits that the majority rule selects the best alternative among two available options with probability one, as the population size increases to infinity. We study this result under an asymmetric two-candidate setup, where supporters of both candidates may have different participation costs.
  When the decision to abstain is fully rational i.e., when the vote pivotality is the probability of a tie, the only equilibrium outcome is a trivial equilibrium where all voters except those with zero voting cost, abstain. We propose and analyze a more practical, boundedly rational model where voters overestimate their pivotality, and show that under this model, non-trivial equilibria emerge where the winning probability of both candidates is bounded away from one.
  We show that when the pivotality estimate strongly depends on the margin of victory, victory is not assured to any candidate in any non-trivial equilibrium, regardless of population size and in contrast to Condorcet's assertion. Whereas, under a weak dependence on margin, Condorcet's Jury theorem is restored.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Games with Minimally Bounded Action Costs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18010v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In many multi-player interactions, players incur strictly positive costs each time they execute actions e.g. 'menu costs' or transaction costs in financial systems. Since acting at each available opportunity would accumulate prohibitively large costs, the resulting decision problem is one in which players must make strategic decisions about when to execute actions in addition to their choice of action. This paper analyses a discrete-time stochastic game (SG) in which players face minimally bounded positive costs for each action and influence the system using impulse controls. We prove SGs of two-sided impulse control have a unique value and characterise the saddle point equilibrium in which the players execute actions at strategically chosen times in accordance with Markovian strategies. We prove the game respects a dynamic programming principle and that the Markov perfect equilibrium can be computed as a limit point of a sequence of Bellman operations. We then introduce a new Q-learning variant which we show converges almost surely to the value of the game enabling solutions to be extracted in unknown settings. Lastly, we extend our results to settings with budgetory constraints.</description>
