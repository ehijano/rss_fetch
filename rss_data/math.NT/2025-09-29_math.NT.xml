      <title>Nombres de Pisot, nombres de Salem et la conjecture de Lehmer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the relationship between the set S of Pisot numbers and the set T of Salem numbers. Salem first established that: " every Pisot number is an accumulation point of the set T ". Building on Boyd's method, we show that every accumulation point of T belongs to S. Together, these results imply that the union S U T forms a closed subset of the real half-line ]1,+infinity[. Consequently, this settles Boyd's conjecture while disproving Lehmer's conjecture.</description>

      <title>Modular analogs of character formulas and minimal lifts of modular forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If $f$ is a mod-$3$ eigenform of weight 2 and level $\Gamma_0(\ell^2)$ for a prime $\ell$ such that $\ell \equiv -1 \pmod{3}$, and $\ell$ is a vexing prime for $f$, we show that there is no obstruction to finding a minimal lift of $f$, but that there is an obstruction to finding a nonminimal lift. The key new ingredient that we prove is a modular analog of the standard character formula for a cuspidal representation of $\mathrm{GL}_2(\mathbb{F}_\ell)$, an enhancement that allows us to easily compute the group cohomology of a $3$-adic lattice in such a representation. In fact, we provide a general framework for proving such modular analogs for a broader class of representations using results of Brou\'e and Puig in modular representation theory. We show that this class includes certain Deligne--Lusztig representations and representations coming from higher-depth supercuspidal representations of $\mathrm{GL}_2$.</description>

      <title>Some series equivalent to the extended Riemann hypothesis for Dedekind zeta functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The extended Riemann hypothesis (ERH) for Dedekind zeta functions remains one of the most elusive open problems in number theory. Over the last century, many equivalent statements to the classical Riemann hypothesis alone have been discovered. We seek to show that the closed form of some infinite series over the non-trivial zeros of Dedekind zeta functions is equivalent to ERH.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.21603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain a new family of relations satisfied by the partition function. In contrast with most partition relations, these involve non-trivial roots of unity. We present two proofs, one using the fact that the discriminant modular form is a multiplicative Hecke eigenform, and one direct proof using q-series.</description>

      <title>Non-periodicity of the sequence of the last nonzero digits of factorials and its applications to transcendence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the sequence of the last nonzero digits of factorials in every integer base $b&gt;2$ is not eventually periodic. We also extend the Adamczewski--Bugeaud criterion, originally formulated for integer base expansions, to Cantor base expansions associated with a periodic Cantor base. As an application, we show that a certain real number expressed through a Cantor base expansion is transcendental when the Cantor base and the digit sequence satisfy suitable conditions.</description>

      <title>Diophantine analysis and Arthur's trace formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a $G$-homogeneous space over a number field $k$ such that $X\cong G_\gamma\backslash G$. Here, $G$ is a simply connected semisimple group over $k$ and $\gamma\in G(k)$ whose centralizer $G_\gamma$ is a maximal torus in $G$ which is anisotropic over $k$. We formulate the asymptotic for the number of integral points on $X$ bounded by a fixed norm $T&gt;0$ as $T\rightarrow \infty$ in terms of $\kappa$-orbital integrals, which play a role in the stabilization of Arthur's trace formula. This formula coincides with the contribution of the stable conjugacy class of $\gamma$ to the geometric side of the trace formula.
  As an application, we obtain an asymptotic formula for the number of $n \times n$ matrices over the ring of integers $\mathcal{O}_k$ whose characteristic polynomial equals a fixed irreducible polynomial $\chi(x)$ of degree $n$. This result generalizes a case studied by Eskin-Mozes-Shah (1996).</description>

      <title>An upper bound for the size of the ideal class monoid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ideal class monoid for an order $R$ in a finite field extension $E/F$ of a number field, denoted by $\overline{\mathrm{Cl}}(R)$, is a fundamental object to study in number theory which has useful applications in algebraic geometry and topology. In this paper, we describe an upper bound for $\#\overline{\mathrm{Cl}}(R)$, in terms of the class number of $E$ and (local) orbital integrals for $\mathfrak{gl}_n$. We also describe an upper bound for the class number of $E$ in terms of the Minkowski bound.
  When $[E:F]\leq 3$ or when $R$ is a Bass order, we refine our upper bound, using a known formula for local orbital integrals in the authors' previous work. In particular, if $R=\mathbb{Z}[x]/(x^3-mx^2+(m-1)x-1)$ with $m\in \mathbb{Z}$ which arises in a study of Cappell-Shaneson homotopy 4-spheres in topology, then we further refine our upper bound in terms of the discriminants of $R$ and $E$, which is $\frac{2}{3^5} \Delta_R^{\frac{1}{2}}\cdot \Delta_E^{\frac{3}{2}}$, when $\Delta_E&gt;3075$.</description>

Abstract: We prove the density hypothesis for congruence subgroups of an irreducible uniform lattice in $\mathrm{PSL}_2(\mathbb{R})^d$, extending previous results on the spherical density hypothesis to bound multiplicities of non-tempered non-spherical representations. Our bounds are uniform in the level as well as the spectral parameters.</description>

      <title>Summation Formulas for Harmonic Maass Forms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a previous work (arXiv:2505.05574), a summation formula for harmonic Maass forms of polynomial growth was established. In this note, we use the theory of $L$-series of harmonic Maass forms to state and prove a summation formula for such forms without any restrictions on their growth. We deduce a summation formula for the partition function. We further employ the same theory to derive a result on classical modular forms, namely, a summation formula and the asymptotics of a Riesz sum attached to a cusp form.</description>

      <title>The Number of Parts in the (Distinct) Partitions With Parts From a Set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The number of parts in the partitions (resp. distinct partitions) of $n$ with parts from a set were considered. Its generating functions were obtained. Consequently, we derive several recurrence identities for the following functions: the number of prime divisors of $n$, $p$-adic valuation of $n$, the number of Carlitz-binary compositions of $n$ and the Hamming weight function. Finally, we obtain an asymptotic estimate for the number of parts in the partitions of $n$ with parts from a finite set of relatively prime integers.</description>

      <title>An $L$-function Approach to Two-Dimensional Conformal Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a framework for two-dimensional conformal field theory (CFT) in the language of analytic number theory. Attached to the torus partition function of every two-dimensional CFT is a self-dual, degree-4 $L$-function of root number $\varepsilon=1$, with a universal gamma factor determined by $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ and local conformal invariance. Due to the richness of CFT operator spectra, these are not, in general, standard $L$-functions. We explicate their analytic structure, exploring the interplay of the Hadamard product over non-trivial zeros with the generalized Dirichlet series over CFT scalar primary conformal dimensions. We derive a zero sum rule in terms of the spectrum, and a global zero density bound in terms of the spectral gap. Convergence of the series representation implies square root cancellation of the degeneracies; we relate this to random matrix behavior of high-energy level spacings. Random matrix universality of the CFT implies "Riemann zeta universality" of the $L$-function: an average relation between the $L$-function on the critical line and Riemann zeta on the 1-line. This in turn yields a subconvexity bound. For a compact free boson, the $L$-function is a product of Riemann zeta functions times an analytic factor. Extensions to correlator $L$-functions and spinning spectra are briefly discussed.
  In the course of this work, we are led to sharpen the notion of random matrix universality in two-dimensional CFTs. We formulate a precise version of the following standalone conjecture, logically independent of $L$-functions: in unitary, compact Virasoro CFTs with central charge $c&gt;1$, fixed-spin primary spectra at high energy are asymptotically simple, with random extreme gap statistics.</description>

      <title>Wild Brauer classes via prismatic cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a finite extension of $\mathbb{Q}_p$ and $X$ a smooth proper $K$-variety with good reduction. Under a mild assumption on the behaviour of Hodge numbers under reduction modulo $p$, we prove that the existence of a non-zero global 2-form on $X$ implies the existence of $p$-torsion Brauer classes with surjective evaluation map, after a finite extension of $K$. This implies that any smooth proper variety over a number field which satisfies weak approximation over all finite extensions has no non-zero global 2-form. The proof is based on a prismatic interpretation of Brauer classes with eventually constant evaluation, and a Newton-above-Hodge result for the mod $p$ reduction of prismatic cohomology. This generalises work of Bright and the second-named author beyond the ordinary reduction case.</description>

      <title>On Arratia's coupling and the Dirichlet law for the factors of a random integer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09360v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $x \ge 2$, let $N_x$ be an integer chosen uniformly at random from the set $\mathbb Z \cap [1, x]$, and let $(V_1, V_2, \ldots)$ be a Poisson--Dirichlet process of parameter $1$. We prove that there exists a coupling of these two random objects such that $$ \mathbb E \, \sum_{i \ge 1} |\log P_i- V_i\log x| \asymp 1, $$ where the implied constants are absolute and $N_x = P_1P_2 \cdots$ is the unique factorization of $N_x$ into primes or ones with the $P_i$'s being non-increasing. This establishes a 2002 conjecture of Arratia arXiv:1305.0941 who constructed a coupling for which the left-hand side in the above estimate is $\ll \log\!\log x$, and who also proved that the left-hand side is $\ge 1-o(1)$ for all couplings. In addition, we use our refined coupling to give a probabilistic proof of the Dirichlet law for the average distribution of the integer factorization into $k$ parts proved in 2023 by Leung arXiv:2206.14728 and we improve on its error term.</description>

      <title>Locally analytic vectors and decompletion in mixed characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19791v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In $p$-adic Hodge theory and the $p$-adic Langlands program, Banach spaces with $\mathbb{Q}_p$-coefficients and $p$-adic Lie group actions are central. Studying the subrepresentation of $\Gamma$-locally analytic vectors, $W^{\mathrm{la}}$, is useful because $W^{\mathrm{la}}$ can be analyzed via the Lie algebra $\mathrm{Lie}(\Gamma)$, which simplifies the action of $\Gamma$. Additionally, $W^{\mathrm{la}}$ often behaves as a decompletion of $W$, making it closer to an algebraic or geometric object.
  This article introduces a notion of locally analytic vectors for $W$ in a mixed characteristic setting, specifically for $\mathbb{Z}_p$-Tate algebras. This generalization encompasses the classical definition and also specializes to super-H\"older vectors in characteristic $p$. Using binomial expansions instead of Taylor series, this new definition bridges locally analytic vectors in characteristic $0$ and $p$.
  Our main theorem shows that under certain conditions, the map $W \mapsto W^{\mathrm{la}}$ acts as a descent, and the derived locally analytic vectors $\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{la}}^i(W)$ vanish for $i \geq 1$. This result extends Theorem C of \cite{Po24}, providing new tools for propagating information about locally analytic vectors from characteristic $0$ to characteristic $p$.
  We provide three applications: a new proof of Berger-Rozensztajn's main result using characteristic $0$ methods, the introduction of an integral multivariable ring $\widetilde{\mathbf{A}}_{\mathrm{LT}}^{\dagger,\mathrm{la}}$ in the Lubin-Tate setting, and a novel interpretation of the classical Cohen ring ${\mathbf{A}}_{\mathbb{Q}_p}$ from the theory of $(\varphi,\Gamma)$-modules in terms of locally analytic vectors.</description>

      <title>Irreducibility of polynomials defining parabolic parameters of period 3</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04850v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Morton and Vivaldi defined the polynomials whose roots are parabolic parameters for a one-parameter family of polynomial maps. We call these polynomials delta factors. They conjectured that delta factors are irreducible for the family $z\mapsto z^2+c$. One can easily show the irreducibility for periods $1$ and $2$ by reducing it to the irreducibility of cyclotomic polynomials. However, for periods $3$ and beyond, this becomes a challenging problem. This paper proves the irreducibility of delta factors for the period $3$ and demonstrates the existence of infinitely many irreducible delta factors for periods greater than $3$.</description>

      <title>On certain correlations into the divisor problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18136v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a fixed irrational $\theta &gt; 0$ with a prescribed irrationality measure function, we study the correlation $\int_1^X \Delta(x) \Delta(\theta x) dx$, where $\Delta$ is the Dirichlet error term in the divisor problem. When $\theta$ has a finite irrationality measure, it is known that decorrelation occurs at a rate expressible in terms of this measure. Strong decorrelation occurs for all positive irrationals, except possibly Liouville numbers. We show that for irrationals with a prescribed irrationality measure function $\psi$, decorrelation can be quantified in terms of $\psi^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Quadratic Chabauty Experiments on Genus 2 Bielliptic Modular Curves in the LMFDB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03784v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present results of quadratic Chabauty experiments on genus 2 bielliptic modular curves of Jacobian rank 2 that have recently been added to the LMFDB. We apply quadratic Chabauty methods over both the rationals and quadratic imaginary fields. In a number of cases, the experiments yielded algebraic irrational points among the set of mock rational points. We highlight specific notable examples, including the non-split Cartan modular curve $X^+_{ns}(15)$. Lastly, we offer a conjecture relating the level of the modular curve to the potential number fields over which points can arise.</description>

      <title>On a Theorem of Jiang and Rallis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18757v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Jiang and Rallis (1997) defined a family of local integrals attached to a cubic polynomial and proved explicit evaluations of them over a non-archimedean local field $F$, when either $F$ contains three third roots of unity, or the defining polynomial is reducible. The restriction on $F$ allowed them, among other things, to reduce the case of irreducible polynomials of the form $x^3-a$. Pleso (2009) began the work of removing the restriction on $F$ by expressing the integral as a sum of $16$ integrals for the cubic polynomial $x^3 - b x - c$ with $b,c\in F$, and computing nine of them. In this work, we compute $15$ of Pleso's integrals, and reduce the last to an elementary assertion about the number of points on a surface over a finite field, in the special case when $F$ is the $p$-adic numbers, $F=\mathbb{Q}_p$, and $p$ is equivalent to $5$ mod $6$. Our computations essentially complete Pleso's work in that special case. In the interim, Xiong (2020) has computed the integrals for an arbitrary non-archimedean local field by a totally different approach. Our direct approach might be more extendable to analogous integrals defined using quintic polynomials, in a higher-rank setting.</description>

      <title>Bernstein-Sato theory modulo $p^m$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07082v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For fixed prime integer $p &gt; 0$ we develop a notion of Bernstein-Sato polynomial for polynomials with $\mathbb{Z} / p^m$-coefficients, compatible with existing theory in the case $m = 1$. We show that the ``roots" of such polynomials are rational and we show that the negative roots agree with those of the mod-$p$ reduction. We give examples to show that, surprisingly, roots may be positive in this context. Moreover, our construction allows us to define a notion of ``strength" for roots by measuring $p$-torsion, and we show that ``strong" roots give rise to roots in characteristic zero through mod-$p$ reduction.</description>

      <title>On the $p$-adic Skolem Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14413v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Skolem Problem asks to determine whether a given linear recurrence sequence (LRS) has a zero term. Showing decidability of this problem is equivalent to giving an effective proof of the Skolem-Mahler-Lech Theorem, which asserts that a non-degenerate LRS has finitely many zeros. The latter result was proven over 90 years ago via an ineffective method showing that such an LRS has only finitely many $p$-adic zeros. In this paper we consider the problem of determining whether a given LRS has a $p$-adic zero, as well as the corresponding function problem of computing exact representations of all $p$-adic zeros. We present algorithms for both problems and report on their implementation. The output of the algorithms is unconditionally correct, and termination is guaranteed subject to the $p$-adic Schanuel Conjecture (a standard number-theoretic hypothesis concerning the $p$-adic exponential function). While these algorithms do not solve the Skolem Problem, they can be exploited to find natural-number and rational zeros under additional hypotheses. To illustrate this, we apply our results to show decidability of the Simultaneous Skolem Problem (determine whether two coprime linear recurrences have a common natural-number zero), again subject to the $p$-adic Schanuel Conjecture.</description>
