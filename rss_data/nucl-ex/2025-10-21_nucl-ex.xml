      <title>Studies of jet quenching in O+O collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 200 GeV by STAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jet quenching is a well-established probe of the QGP in large collision systems such as Au+Au and Pb+Pb, but is absent in smaller p+A collisions despite the presence of collectivity. This makes it important to study its dependence on system size. O+O collisions offer an ideal opportunity, bridging the gap between small and large systems. In these proceedings, we present the measurements of the following observables related to jet quenching: inclusive charged hadron $R_{\rm AA}$ and $R_{\rm CP}$ at high transverse momentum ($p_{\rm T}$), inclusive jet $R_{\rm CP}$, and semi-inclusive hadron+jet $I_{\rm CP}$, using O+O collisions data collected with the STAR detector in 2021 at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 200$ GeV. For jet measurements, combinatorial background is subtracted based on the event mixing technique, while background fluctuations and detector effects are corrected via unfolding. Inclusive charged hadron and jet $R_{\rm CP}$ and h+jet $I_{\rm CP}$ are found to be below unity, indicating suppression relative to peripheral events.</description>

      <title>The beam test facility at Jefferson Lab for the precise energy measurement of future calorimeter concepts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In experimental nuclear physics (NP), high-precision electromagnetic calorimetry typically requires a good energy resolution and linear photosensor response on the level of (1-2)% over a full dynamic range of the detector. The beam of secondary leptons at the Jefferson Lab experimental complex, provided by the Hall D pair spectrometer (PS), is an optimal facility for studies aiming to understand the impact of light collection and signal processing on calorimetry energy resolution under real experimental conditions. The light emission and collection processes depend on radiator component quality and type, while signal processing depends on photosensor type and front-end electronics design. Various calorimeter tower components and detector assemblies for current and future NP experiments were tested within the lepton momentum range of (3-6) GeV/c using PS. The energy resolution of the PS itself is estimated to be better than approximately 0.6%.</description>

      <title>Charm-strange meson production in relativistic heavy ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study charm-strange mesons, or $D_s$, $D_s^*$, $D_{s0}^*(2317)$, and $D_{s1}(2460)$ mesons by focusing on their production by coalescence from a quark-gluon plasma in relativistic heavy ion collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=5.02$ TeV. Starting from the investigation of the transverse momentum distribution of both charm and strange quarks through transverse momentum distributions of $\phi$ and $D^0$ mesons, we calculate the transverse momentum distributions and yields of $D_s$, $D_s^*$, $D_{s0}^*(2317)$, and $D_{s1}(2460)$ mesons based on the coalescence model. We find that the yield and transverse momentum distribution of the $D_s$ meson agree well with the experimental measurements at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=5.02$ TeV at LHC. We further evaluate the transverse momentum ratio between $D_s$ and $D^0$ mesons, and investigate the role of light and strange quarks in the production of charmed mesons in heavy ion collisions. Finally, we calculate the transverse momentum distribution and yield of the $D_{s0}^*(2317)$ meson in a four-quark state, and compare to those of $D_{s0}^*(2317)$ meson in a two-quark state.</description>

      <title>Analysis note: measurement of thrust and track energy-energy correlator in e+e- collisions at 91.2 GeV with DELPHI open data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent theoretical developments, as well as experimental measurements at hadron collisions, have renewed interest in studying event shape variables in e+e- collisions. We present a measurement of thrust and track-based energy-energy correlator in e+e- collisions at center-of-mass energy of 91.2 GeV, using newly released open data from the DELPHI experiment. The event shapes, measured with unprecedented resolution and precision, are compared to various Monte Carlo and analytic predictions. Leveraging DELPHI's unique detector geometry and reconstruction capabilities, the track energy-energy correlator measurement provides data with the highest angular resolution, offering critical inputs for precision tests of QCD in both collinear and back-to-back limits. This note presents the first physics analysis using DELPHI open data and establishes benchmarks necessary for future studies exploiting this legacy dataset.</description>

      <title>Lifetimes and Transition Probabilities in $N = 76 ^{130}Xe$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01369v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lifetimes for the ${4}_1^+$ and ${6}_1^+$ states have been directly measured using $\gamma-\gamma$ fast timing technique for low lying states of $^{130}Xe$, populated from $\beta ^-$ decay of the parent $^{130}I$ produced through $^{nat}U(\alpha,f)$ reaction at $E_{\alpha}~=~40~MeV$. VENTURE array comprising of eight fast CeBr$_3$ detectors is used for lifetime measurement. The reduced transition probabilities deduced from the measured lifetimes have been compared with theoretical values obtained from the large basis shell model calculation and the interacting boson approximation (IBM) calculation.</description>

      <title>The Early History of the Quark-Gluon Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08720v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the historical antecedents to the field of relativistic heavy ion physics, beginning with early attempts to model the strong interaction and ending with the endorsement of a relativistic heavy ion collider in the 1983 U.S. Long-Range Plan for Nuclear Science. Particular attention is paid to two major themes: 1) A program to study high density states of nuclear matter emerging from the 1974 Bear Mountain conference and 2) Efforts to understand the predictions of QCD for matter at high densities and/or temperatures.</description>

      <title>Unlocking New Frontiers: The Versatile Potential of the Brazilian Multipurpose Reactor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10657v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The multipurpose nature of nuclear research reactors has been investigated. This class of reactors has gained momentum within the international community, given the multiple benefits of nuclear technology in medicine, agriculture, industry, and the development of new materials, being characterized by the simultaneous use of several applications. In this context, Brazil has recently joined the group of countries with multipurpose reactor projects. The Brazilian Multipurpose Reactor (RMB) will be Brazil's new neutron source, with a thermal power of $30$ $MW$, with a core flux on the order of $\phi=4\times 10^{14}$ $n/cm^{2}s$ and a power density of $312.5$ $W/cm^3$, ensuring the production of radioisotopes, material and fuel irradiation testing, and neutron beam applications. In this work, the demand for neutron fluxes in different irradiation targets is investigated by Monte Carlo simulations under a perturbation caused by a highly neutron-absorbing material, the Gadolinium-157 (Gd-157) isotope. The results show that Molybdenum-99 (Mo-99) production is not affected by the Gd-157 target, and the minimum proposed thermal neutron flux for the reactor's activity ($\phi_{min}=5.1\times 10^{12}$ $n/cm^{2}s$) is guaranteed even at maximum operational capacity. The potential production of Terbium (Tb) isotopes for nuclear medicine applications in the RMB is briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Symmetry restoration in the axially deformed proton-neutron quasiparticle random phase approximation for nuclear beta decay: The effect of angular-momentum projection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16313v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the effects of symmetry restoration on nuclear beta decay within the axially deformed proton-neutron quasiparticle random phase approximation (QRPA). We employ the proton-neutron finite-amplitude method (pnFAM) to compute transition amplitudes, and perform angular-momentum projection both after variation and after the QRPA to restore rotational symmetry. Exact projection reduces the calculated beta decay half-lives from those that use the needle approximation by up to 60%, and even more when taking the effects of projection on the ground-state energy into account.</description>
