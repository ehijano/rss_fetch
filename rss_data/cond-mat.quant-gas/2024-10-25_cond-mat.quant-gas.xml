      <title>Nonrelativistic superfluids in cosmology from a relativistic approach: Revisiting two formulations of superfluidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two formulations of superfluidity are reviewed: Landau's phenomenological two-fluid model and a relativistic effective field theory description. We demonstrate how the two-fluid formalism can be recovered from the nonrelativistic limit of the relativistic effective theory at finite temperatures. We show how self-gravitating, nonrelativistic superfluids are obtained from the Newtonian limit of the relativistic approach on curved spaces. The concepts are presented in an accessible manner for readers who may not be deeply familiar with superfluidity from a condensed matter perspective.</description>

      <title>Hall signal-dominated microwave transmission through graphene-loaded waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microwave transmission line spectroscopy is used to observe the integer quantum Hall effect in two samples of monolayer graphene with different geometries that are resistively-coupled to a coplanar waveguide. We find plateaus in transmitted power that do not vary significantly with microwave frequency but are significantly different for two samples due to their shape. With each drop in transmitted power corresponding to an additional quantum Hall edge mode that short the transmission line to ground, these well-known quanta of conductance allow us to calibrate the sensitivity of the devices. One sample with short contact regions matched the sensitivity expected when considering only the quantum Hall conductance of $\nu e^2/h$; another sample with long contact regions demonstrated a nearly three-fold enhancement in sensitivity. We model this result with a purely resistive circuit that introduces an additional resistance to explain the increased sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Quantum Many-Body Scars beyond the PXP model in Rydberg simulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Persistent revivals recently observed in Rydberg atom simulators have challenged our understanding of thermalization and attracted much interest to the concept of quantum many-body scars (QMBSs). QMBSs are non-thermal highly excited eigenstates that coexist with typical eigenstates in the spectrum of many-body Hamiltonians, and have since been reported in multiple theoretical models, including the so-called PXP model, approximately realized by Rydberg simulators. At the same time, questions of how common QMBSs are and in what models they are physically realized remain open. In this Letter, we demonstrate that QMBSs exist in a broader family of models that includes and generalizes PXP to longer-range constraints and states with different periodicity. We show that in each model, multiple QMBS families can be found. Each of them relies on a different approximate $\mathfrak{su}(2)$ algebra, leading to oscillatory dynamics in all cases. However, in contrast to the PXP model, their observation requires launching dynamics from weakly entangled initial states rather than from a product state. QMBSs reported here may be experimentally probed using Rydberg atom simulator in the regime of longer-range Rydberg blockades.</description>

      <title>More on the Operator Space Entanglement (OSE): R\'enyi OSE, revivals, and integrability breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of the R\'enyi Operator Space Entanglement ($OSE$) entropies $S_n$ across several one-dimensional integrable and chaotic models. As a paradigmatic integrable system, we first consider the so-called rule $54$ chain. Our numerical results reveal that the R\'enyi $OSE$ entropies of diagonal operators with nonzero trace saturate at long times, in contrast with the behavior of von Neumann entropy. Oppositely, the R\'enyi entropies of traceless operators exhibit logarithmic growth with time, with the prefactor of this growth depending in a nontrivial manner on $n$. Notably, at long times, the complete operator entanglement spectrum ($ES$) of an operator can be reconstructed from the spectrum of its traceless part. We observe a similar pattern in the $XXZ$ chain, suggesting universal behavior. Additionally, we consider dynamics in nonintegrable deformations of the $XXZ$ chain. Finite-time corrections do not allow to access the long-time behavior of the von Neumann entropy. On the other hand, for $n&gt;1$ the growth of the entropies is milder, and it is compatible with a sublinear growth, at least for operators associated with global conserved quantities. Finally, we show that in finite-size integrable systems, $S_n$ exhibit strong revivals, which are washed out when integrability is broken.</description>

      <title>Exotic Superfluid with Emergent flux in a one-dimensional Bose-Fermi mixture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03875v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We find a novel chiral superfluid (CSF) phase in a one-dimensional Bose-Fermi Hubbard model with significant mass and density imbalance between the two species. In the CSF phase, bosons condensate at non-zero momentum $\pm 2\pi /L$ with chain length $L$. To capture the essential physics of this new phenomenon, we study an alternative simplified model that only features competition between single-fermion hopping and hopping of composite particles composed of a fermion and a boson. This model captures the low energy physics of the Hubbard model and hosts a robust CSF phase. Our unbiased numerical studies show that in the CSF phase, the local superfluid order parameter continuously rotates along the chain, indicating that time-reversal symmetry is spontaneously broken. This symmetry breaking generates an emergent flux in the background, effectively optimizing the system's ground-state energy. We provide a physical understanding at the mean-field level. Furthermore, we have explored the potential realization of this phase in cold-atom experiments.</description>

      <title>Transport through a lattice with local loss: from quantum dots to lattice gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06942v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent work has studied fermion transport through a finite one-dimensional lattice of quantum dots, with localized particle loss from the central lattice site. The dots at each end of the lattice are connected to macroscopic leads, represented as zero-temperature reservoirs of free fermions with a given potential difference. Here we show how this model represents one limiting case of a larger class of models that can be realized with cold quantum gases in optical lattices. While quantum gas realizations allow many system parameters to be varied, we note limitations from finite size effects, and conclude that quantum dots and quantum gases offer complementary views on transport through lossy finite lattices.</description>

      <title>Bose-Fermi $N$-polaron state emergence from correlation-mediated blocking of phase separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13785v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study $N$ fermionic impurities in a one-dimensional lattice bosonic bath at unit filling. Using DMRG and mixed boundary conditions -- closed for bosons, open for fermions -- we find an $N$-polaron ground state replacing phase separation at high interspecies repulsion. This tightly bound state of clustered particles emerges due to strong impurity-bath correlations which induce large impurity-impurity correlations, that we quantify via the von Neumann entropy and bipartite mutual information respectively. This system also reveals a fermionic self-localization effect from a Mott insulator background due to local correlations between the impurities and the bath. The growth of long-range correlations breaks this Mott phase, resulting in the transition to localized impurity clusters. Finally, we show that there is a critical impurity number, which depends on intraspecies bosonic interaction, beyond which phase separation is recovered.</description>

      <title>Weak ergodicity breaking transition in randomly constrained model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.11180v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Experiments in Rydberg atoms have recently found unusually slow decay from a small number of special initial states. We investigate the robustness of such long-lived states (LLS) by studying an ensemble of locally constrained random systems with tunable range $\mu$. Upon varying $\mu$, we find a transition between a thermal and a weakly non-ergodic (supporting a finite number of LLS) phases. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the LLS observed in the experiments disappear upon the addition of small perturbations so that the transition reported here is distinct from known ones. We then show that the LLS dynamics explores only part of the accessible Hilbert space, thus corresponding to localisation in Hilbert space.</description>
