      <title>ShEPhERD: Diffusing shape, electrostatics, and pharmacophores for bioisosteric drug design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Engineering molecules to exhibit precise 3D intermolecular interactions with their environment forms the basis of chemical design. In ligand-based drug design, bioisosteric analogues of known bioactive hits are often identified by virtually screening chemical libraries with shape, electrostatic, and pharmacophore similarity scoring functions. We instead hypothesize that a generative model which learns the joint distribution over 3D molecular structures and their interaction profiles may facilitate 3D interaction-aware chemical design. We specifically design ShEPhERD, an SE(3)-equivariant diffusion model which jointly diffuses/denoises 3D molecular graphs and representations of their shapes, electrostatic potential surfaces, and (directional) pharmacophores to/from Gaussian noise. Inspired by traditional ligand discovery, we compose 3D similarity scoring functions to assess ShEPhERD's ability to conditionally generate novel molecules with desired interaction profiles. We demonstrate ShEPhERD's potential for impact via exemplary drug design tasks including natural product ligand hopping, protein-blind bioactive hit diversification, and bioisosteric fragment merging.</description>

      <title>Bio-xLSTM: Generative modeling, representation and in-context learning of biological and chemical sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Language models for biological and chemical sequences enable crucial applications such as drug discovery, protein engineering, and precision medicine. Currently, these language models are predominantly based on Transformer architectures. While Transformers have yielded impressive results, their quadratic runtime dependency on the sequence length complicates their use for long genomic sequences and in-context learning on proteins and chemical sequences. Recently, the recurrent xLSTM architecture has been shown to perform favorably compared to Transformers and modern state-space model (SSM) architectures in the natural language domain. Similar to SSMs, xLSTMs have a linear runtime dependency on the sequence length and allow for constant-memory decoding at inference time, which makes them prime candidates for modeling long-range dependencies in biological and chemical sequences. In this work, we tailor xLSTM towards these domains and propose a suite of architectural variants called Bio-xLSTM. Extensive experiments in three large domains, genomics, proteins, and chemistry, were performed to assess xLSTM's ability to model biological and chemical sequences. The results show that models based on Bio-xLSTM a) can serve as proficient generative models for DNA, protein, and chemical sequences, b) learn rich representations for those modalities, and c) can perform in-context learning for proteins and small molecules.</description>

      <title>OneProt: Towards Multi-Modal Protein Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent AI advances have enabled multi-modal systems to model and translate diverse information spaces. Extending beyond text and vision, we introduce OneProt, a multi-modal AI for proteins that integrates structural, sequence, alignment, and binding site data. Using the ImageBind framework, OneProt aligns the latent spaces of modality encoders along protein sequences. It demonstrates strong performance in retrieval tasks and surpasses state-of-the-art methods in various downstream tasks, including metal ion binding classification, gene-ontology annotation, and enzyme function prediction. This work expands multi-modal capabilities in protein models, paving the way for applications in drug discovery, biocatalytic reaction planning, and protein engineering.</description>

      <title>Characterizing RNA oligomers using Stochastic Titration Constant-pH Metadynamics simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16064v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: RNA molecules exhibit various biological functions intrinsically dependent on their diverse ecosystem of highly flexible structures. This flexibility arises from complex hydrogen-bonding networks defined by canonical and non-canonical base pairs that require protonation events to stabilize or perturb these interactions. Constant pH molecular dynamics (CpHMD) methods provide a reliable framework to explore the conformational and protonation space of dynamic structures and for robust calculations of pH-dependent properties, such as the pK$_\mathrm{a}$ of titrable sites. Despite growing biological evidence concerning pH regulation of certain motifs and in biotechnological applications, pH-sensitive in silico methods have rarely been applied to nucleic acids. In this work, we extended the stochastic titration CpHMD method to include RNA parameters from the standard $\chi$OL3 AMBER force field and highlighted its capability to depict titration events of nucleotides in single-stranded RNAs. We validated the method using trimers and pentamers with a single central titrable site while integrating a well-tempered metadynamics approach into the st-CpHMD methodology (CpH-MetaD) using PLUMED. This approach enhanced the convergence of the conformational landscape and enabled more efficient sampling of protonation-conformation coupling. Our pK$_\mathrm{a}$ estimates agree with experimental data, validating the method's ability to reproduce electrostatic changes around a titrable nucleobase in single-stranded RNA. These findings provided molecular insight into intramolecular phenomena, such as nucleobase stacking and phosphate interactions, that dictate the experimentally observed pK$_\mathrm{a}$ shifts between different strands. Overall, this work validates both the st-CpHMD and the metadynamics integration as reliable tools for studying biologically relevant RNA systems.</description>

      <title>Persistent Directed Flag Laplacian (PDFL)-Based Machine Learning for Protein-Ligand Binding Affinity Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02596v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Directionality in molecular and biomolecular networks plays a significant role in the accurate represention of the complex, dynamic, and asymmetrical nature of interactions present in protein-ligand binding, signal transduction, and biological pathways. Most traditional techniques of topological data analysis (TDA), such as persistent homology (PH) and persistent Laplacian (PL), overlook this aspect in their standard form. To address this, we present the persistent directed flag Laplacian (PDFL), which incorporates directed flag complexes to account for edges with directionality originated from polarization, gene regulation, heterogeneous interactions, etc. This study marks the first application of the PDFL, providing an in-depth analysis of spectral graph theory combined with machine learning. Besides its superior accuracy and reliability, the PDFL model offers simplicity by requiring only raw inputs without complex data processing. We validated our multi-kernel PDFL model for its scoring power against other state-of-art methods on three popular benchmarks, namely PDBbind v2007, v2013, and v2016. Computational results indicate that the proposed PDFL model outperforms competitors in protein-ligand binding affinity predictions, indicating that PDFL is a promising tool for protein engineering, drug discovery, and general applications in science and engineering.</description>

      <title>RGFN: Synthesizable Molecular Generation Using GFlowNets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08506v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative models hold great promise for small molecule discovery, significantly increasing the size of search space compared to traditional in silico screening libraries. However, most existing machine learning methods for small molecule generation suffer from poor synthesizability of candidate compounds, making experimental validation difficult. In this paper we propose Reaction-GFlowNet (RGFN), an extension of the GFlowNet framework that operates directly in the space of chemical reactions, thereby allowing out-of-the-box synthesizability while maintaining comparable quality of generated candidates. We demonstrate that with the proposed set of reactions and building blocks, it is possible to obtain a search space of molecules orders of magnitude larger than existing screening libraries coupled with low cost of synthesis. We also show that the approach scales to very large fragment libraries, further increasing the number of potential molecules. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach across a range of oracle models, including pretrained proxy models and GPU-accelerated docking.</description>
