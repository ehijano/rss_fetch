      <title>Goodness-of-fit for amplitude analysis with anomaly detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Amplitude analysis serves as a pivotal tool in hadron spectroscopy, fundamentally involving a series of likelihood fits to multi-dimensional experimental distributions. While numerous robust goodness-of-fit tests are available for low-dimensional scenarios, evaluating goodness-of-fit in amplitude analysis poses significant challenges. In this work, we introduce a powerful goodness-of-fit test leveraging a machine-learning-based anomaly detection method.</description>

      <title>The Flight Physics Concept Inventory: Development of a research-based assessment instrument to enhance learning and teaching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work frames the first three publications around the development of the Flight Physics Concept Inventory (FliP-CoIn), and elaborates on many aspects in more detail. FliP-CoIn is a multiple-choice conceptual assessment instrument for improving fluid dynamics learning and teaching. I give insights into why and how FliP-CoIn was developed and how it is best used for improving conceptual learning. Further, this work presents evidence for several dimensions of FliP-CoIn's validity and reliability. Finally, I discuss key insights from the development process, the data analysis, and give recommendations for future research.

      <title>Physics-Embedded Bayesian Neural Network (PE-BNN) to predict Energy Dependence of Fission Product Yields with Fine Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a physics-embedded Bayesian neural network (PE-BNN) framework that integrates fission product yields (FPYs) with prior nuclear physics knowledge to predict energy-dependent FPY data with fine structure. By incorporating an energy-independent phenomenological shell factor as a single input feature, the PE-BNN captures both fine structures and global energy trends. The combination of this physics-informed input with hyperparameter optimization via the Watanabe-Akaike Information Criterion (WAIC) significantly enhances predictive performance. Our results demonstrate that the PE-BNN framework is well-suited for target observables with systematic features that can be embedded as model inputs, achieving close agreement with known shell effects and prompt neutron multiplicities.</description>

      <title>Network Sampling: An Overview and Comparative Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Network sampling is a crucial technique for analyzing large or partially observable networks. However, the effectiveness of different sampling methods can vary significantly depending on the context. In this study, we empirically compare representative methods from three main categories: node-based, edge-based, and exploration-based sampling. We used two real-world datasets for our analysis: a scientific collaboration network and a temporal message-sending network. Our results indicate that no single sampling method consistently outperforms the others in both datasets. Although advanced methods tend to provide better accuracy on static networks, they often perform poorly on temporal networks, where simpler techniques can be more effective. These findings suggest that the best sampling strategy depends not only on the structural characteristics of the network but also on the specific metrics that need to be preserved or analyzed. Our work offers practical insights for researchers in choosing sampling approaches that are tailored to different types of networks and analytical objectives.</description>

      <title>Datatractor: Metadata, automation, and registries for extractor interoperability in the chemical and materials sciences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18839v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two key issues hindering the transition towards FAIR data science are the poor discoverability and inconsistent instructions for the use of data extractor tools, i.e., how we go from raw data files created by instruments, to accessible metadata and scientific insight. If the existing format conversion tools are hard to find, install, and use, their reimplementation will lead to a duplication of effort, and an increase in the associated maintenance burden is inevitable. The Datatractor framework presented in this work addresses these issues. First, by providing a curated registry of such extractor tools their discoverability will increase. Second, by describing them using a standardised but lightweight schema, their installation and use is machine-actionable. Finally, we provide a reference implementation for such data extraction. The Datatractor framework can be used to provide a public-facing data extraction service, or be incorporated into other research data management tools providing added value.</description>

      <title>Dependence of the Solar Wind Plasma Density on Moderate and Extremely High Geomagnetic Activity Elucidated by Potential Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07073v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The relationship between moderate and extremely high levels of geomagnetic activity, represented by the Kp index (2- - 5+ and 6- - 9), and solar wind conditions during southward IMF intervals was revealed utilizing a newly developed machine learning technique. Potential Learning (PL) is a neural network algorithm which learns with focusing the input parameter with the highest variance and can extract the most significant input parameter to the outputs, based on a computed value of "potentiality". It has poorly been understood from what stage of geomagnetic activity the solar wind density begins to control the Kp level. The IMF three components, solar wind flow speed, and plasma density obtained from the OMNI solar wind database, corresponding from solar cycle 23 to beginning of cycle 25, were used as the PL input parameters. PL selected the solar wind velocity as the most significant solar wind parameter for the moderate and extremely high Kp levels. The value of potentiality of solar wind density was, however, could not ignore an impact on geomagnetic activity. We statistically investigated the relation between solar wind speed and plasma density used as the PL input data under all Kp levels. At higher than the moderate Kp level, geomagnetic conditions become high even under slow solar wind velocity, if the plasma density is large, suggesting that not only solar wind velocity but also density might significantly contribute to geomagnetic activity. These PL and statistical investigations show that the solar wind density begins to regulate Kp higher than moderate geomagnetic activity level under southward IMF conditions. They also would greatly help not only understand general relationship between solar wind conditions and geomagnetic activity but also forecast geomagnetic activity under various IMF conditions.</description>
