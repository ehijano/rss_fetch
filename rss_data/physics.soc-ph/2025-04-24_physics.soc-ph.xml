      <title>An alternative expression of message passing on networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Message passing techniques on networks encompasses a family of related methods that can be employed to ascertain many important properties of a network. It is widely considered to be the state of the art formulation for networked systems and advances in this method have a wide impact across multiple literatures. One property that message passing can yield is the size of the largest connected component in the network following bond percolation. In this paper, we introduce an alternative method of finding this value that differs from the standard approach. Like the canonical approach, our method is exact on trees and an approximation on arbitrary graphs. We show that our method lends itself to the description of a variety of generalisations of bond percolation such as sequential percolation and non-binary percolation and can yield information about the local environment of a node in percolation equilibrium that the traditional approach cannot.</description>

      <title>Analyzing stripes in crossing pedestrian flows using temporal matrices and a geometric model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding pattern formation in crossing pedestrian flows is essential for analyzing and managing high-density crowd dynamics in urban environments. This study presents two complementary methodological approaches to detect and characterize stripe formations, an emergent structure observed when two pedestrian groups cross at various angles. First, we propose a matrix-based method that utilizes time-resolved trajectory data to determine the relative crossing order of pedestrians from opposing groups. By identifying points of minimal spatial separation between individuals and analyzing associated time differences, we construct a crossing matrix that captures the sequence and composition of stripes. Second, we introduce a geometric model based on elliptical approximations of pedestrian groups, enabling analytical prediction of two key macroscopic quantities: the number of stripes and the interaction time between groups. The model captures how these quantities vary with the crossing angle and shows strong agreement with experimental data. Further analysis reveals that group elongation during crossing correlates with the vertical cross-section of the elliptical shape. These methods provide effective tools for analyzing large-scale movement datasets, informing the design of public spaces, and calibrating mechanistic models. The study also presents hypotheses about pattern transitions in continuous pedestrian streams, suggesting promising directions for future research on collective motion under varying flow geometries and densities.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear contagion dynamics on dynamical networks: exact solutions ranging from consensus times to evolutionary trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding nonlinear social contagion dynamics on dynamical networks, such as opinion formation, is crucial for gaining new insights into consensus and polarization. Similar to threshold-dependent complex contagions, the nonlinearity in adoption rates poses challenges for mean-field approximations. To address this theoretical gap, we focus on nonlinear binary-opinion dynamics on dynamical networks and analytically derive local configurations, specifically the distribution of opinions within any given focal individual's neighborhood. This exact local configuration of opinions, combined with network degree distributions, allows us to obtain exact solutions for consensus times and evolutionary trajectories. Our counterintuitive results reveal that neither biased assimilation (i.e., nonlinear adoption rates) nor preferences in local network rewiring -- such as in-group bias (preferring like-minded individuals) and the Matthew effect (preferring social hubs) -- can significantly slow down consensus. Among these three social factors, we find that biased assimilation is the most influential in accelerating consensus. Furthermore, our analytical method efficiently and precisely predicts the evolutionary trajectories of adoption curves arising from nonlinear contagion dynamics. Our work paves the way for enabling analytical predictions for general nonlinear contagion dynamics beyond opinion formation.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary dynamics in state-feedback public goods games with peer punishment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Public goods game serves as a valuable paradigm for studying the challenges of collective cooperation in human and natural societies. Peer punishment is often considered as an effective incentive for promoting cooperation in such contexts. However, previous related studies have mostly ignored the positive feedback effect of collective contributions on individual payoffs. In this work, we explore global and local state-feedback, where the multiplication factor is positively correlated with the frequency of contributors in the entire population or within the game group, respectively. By using replicator dynamics in an infinite well-mixed population we reveal that state-based feedback plays a crucial role in alleviating the cooperative dilemma by enhancing and sustaining cooperation compared to the feedback-free case. Moreover, when the feedback strength is sufficiently strong or the baseline multiplication factor is sufficiently high, the system with local state-feedback provides full cooperation, hence supporting the ``think globally, act locally'' principle. Besides, we show that the second-order free-rider problem can be partially mitigated under certain conditions when the state-feedback is employed. Importantly, these results remain robust with respect to variations in punishment cost and fine.</description>

      <title>Situational Preparedness Dynamics for Sequential Tropical Cyclone Hazards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sequential tropical cyclone hazards--two tropical cyclones (TCs) making landfall in the same region within a short time--are becoming increasingly likely. This study investigates situational preparedness dynamics for six sequential TC events that affected seven states in the United States from 2020 to 2024. We find a combined effect of forecast wind speed and landfall sequence of a TC. Stronger forecast wind is always associated with higher preparedness levels. People tend to show a higher preparedness level for the second TC but are more sensitive to the increasing forecast wind speed of the first TC. We also find that the counties showing high preparedness levels for the first TC consistently show high preparedness levels for the subsequent one. Power outages induced by the first TC significantly increase preparedness for the subsequent TC (e.g., approximately 13% pct for mobility needs preparedness and 24% for structural reinforcement preparedness when increasing one-unit customers out). We identified spatial dependency in preparedness across counties. Power outage experiences in first TCs show statistically significant spillover effects on neighboring counties' preparedness levels for second TCs. Throughout sequential TCs, people with access and functional needs consistently show lower preparedness levels.</description>

      <title>Towards a Generalized Theory of Observers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a formal framework for understanding and unifying the concept of observers across physics, computer science, philosophy, and related fields. Building on cybernetic feedback models, we introduce an operational definition of minimal observers, explore their role in shaping foundational concepts, and identify what remains unspecified in their absence. Drawing upon insights from quantum gravity, digital physics, second-order cybernetics, and recent ruliological and pregeometric approaches, we argue that observers serve as indispensable reference points for measurement, reference frames, and the emergence of meaning. We show how this formalism sheds new light on debates related to consciousness, quantum measurement, and computational boundaries; by way of theorems on observer equivalences and complexity measures. This perspective opens new avenues for investigating how complexity and structure arise in both natural and artificial systems.</description>

      <title>Road layout in the KPZ class</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16268v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a road layout and traffic model, based on last passage percolation (LPP). An easy naive argument shows that coalescence of traffic trajectories is essential to be considered when observing traffic networks around us. This is a fundamental feature in first passage percolation (FPP) models where nearby geodesics naturally coalesce in search of the easiest passage through the landscape. Road designers seek the same in pursuing cost savings, hence FPP geodesics are straightforward candidates to model road layouts. Unfortunately no detailed knowledge is rigorously available on FPP geodesics. To address this, we use exponential LPP instead to build a stochastic model of road traffic and prove certain characteristics thereof. Cars start from every point of the lattice and follow half-infinite geodesics in random directions. Exponential LPP is known to be in the KPZ universality class and it is widely expected that FPP shares very similar properties, hence our findings should equally apply to FPP-based modelling. We address several traffic-related quantities of this model and compare our theorems to real life road networks.</description>

      <title>Vulnerable Connectivity Caused by Local Communities in Spatial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14513v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Local communities by concentration of nodes connected with short links are widely observed in spatial networks. However, how such structure affects robustness of connectivity against malicious attacks remains unclear. This study investigates the impact of local communities on the robustness by modeling planar infrastructure reveals that the robustness is weakened by strong local communities in spatial networks. These results highlight the potential of long-distance links in mitigating the negative effects of local community on the robustness.</description>
