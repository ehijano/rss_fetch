      <title>Beyond Answers: Large Language Model-Powered Tutoring System in Physics Education for Deep Learning and Precise Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in education has shown significant promise, yet the effective personalization of learning, particularly in physics education, remains a challenge. This paper proposes Physics-STAR, a framework for large language model (LLM)- powered tutoring system designed to address this gap by providing personalized and adaptive learning experiences for high school students. Our study evaluates Physics-STAR against traditional teacher-led lectures and generic LLM tutoring through a controlled experiment with 12 high school sophomores. Results showed that Physics-STAR increased students' average scores and efficiency on conceptual, computational, and on informational questions. In particular, students' average scores on complex information problems increased by 100% and their efficiency increased by 5.95%. By facilitating step-by-step guidance and reflective learning, Physics-STAR helps students develop critical thinking skills and a robust comprehension of abstract concepts. The findings underscore the potential of AI-driven personalized tutoring systems to transform physics education. As LLM continues to advance, the future of student-centered AI in education looks promising, with the potential to significantly improve learning outcomes and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Data Science Education in Undergraduate Physics: Lessons Learned from a Community of Practice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00961v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is becoming increasingly important that physics educators equip their students with the skills to work with data effectively. However, many educators may lack the necessary training and expertise in data science to teach these skills. To address this gap, we created the Data Science Education Community of Practice (DSECOP), bringing together graduate students and physics educators from different institutions and backgrounds to share best practices and lessons learned from integrating data science into undergraduate physics education. In this article we present insights and experiences from this community of practice, highlighting key strategies and challenges in incorporating data science into the introductory physics curriculum. Our goal is to provide guidance and inspiration to educators who seek to integrate data science into their teaching, helping to prepare the next generation of physicists for a data-driven world.</description>
