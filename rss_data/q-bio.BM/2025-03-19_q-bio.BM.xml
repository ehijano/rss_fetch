      <title>Controlling Peak Sharpness in Multimodal Biomolecular Systems via the Chemical Fokker-Planck Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intracellular biomolecular systems exhibit intrinsic stochasticity due to low molecular copy numbers, leading to multimodal probability distributions that play a crucial role in probabilistic differentiation and cellular decision-making. Controlling the dispersion of multimodal probability distributions in biomolecular systems is critical for regulating stochastic behavior, robustness, and adaptability. However, modifying system parameters to adjust dispersion often affects peak positions, potentially altering a desired phenotype or even fundamental behavior in a genetic pathway. In this paper, we establish a theoretical framework that enables independent control of dispersion while preserving peak positions and modality using the Chemical Fokker-Planck Equation (CFPE) and sharpness, a measure of probability concentration around individual peaks. By analyzing the steady-state solution of the CFPE, we derive explicit conditions under which peak sharpness can be tuned monotonically without changing peak positions or modality. We validate our approach through Monte Carlo simulations on a bimodal chemical system, demonstrating effective dispersion control while maintaining structural stability. This framework provides a systematic approach for designing biomolecular systems with tunable stochastic properties, contributing to advancements in synthetic biology and probabilistic cellular regulation.</description>

      <title>Machine learning predictions from unpredictable chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chaos is omnipresent in nature, and its understanding provides enormous social and economic benefits. However, the unpredictability of chaotic systems is a textbook concept due to their sensitivity to initial conditions, aperiodic behavior, fractal dimensions, nonlinearity, and strange attractors. In this work, we introduce, for the first time, chaotic learning, a novel multiscale topological paradigm that enables accurate predictions from chaotic systems. We show that seemingly random and unpredictable chaotic dynamics counterintuitively offer unprecedented quantitative predictions. Specifically, we devise multiscale topological Laplacians to embed real-world data into a family of interactive chaotic dynamical systems, modulate their dynamical behaviors, and enable the accurate prediction of the input data. As a proof of concept, we consider 28 datasets from four categories of realistic problems: 10 brain waves, four benchmark protein datasets, 13 single-cell RNA sequencing datasets, and an image dataset, as well as two distinct chaotic dynamical systems, namely the Lorenz and Rossler attractors. We demonstrate chaotic learning predictions of the physical properties from chaos. Our new chaotic learning paradigm profoundly changes the textbook perception of chaos and bridges topology, chaos, and learning for the first time.</description>

      <title>MOFFlow: Flow Matching for Structure Prediction of Metal-Organic Frameworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17270v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are a class of crystalline materials with promising applications in many areas such as carbon capture and drug delivery. In this work, we introduce MOFFlow, the first deep generative model tailored for MOF structure prediction. Existing approaches, including ab initio calculations and even deep generative models, struggle with the complexity of MOF structures due to the large number of atoms in the unit cells. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Riemannian flow matching framework that reduces the dimensionality of the problem by treating the metal nodes and organic linkers as rigid bodies, capitalizing on the inherent modularity of MOFs. By operating in the $SE(3)$ space, MOFFlow effectively captures the roto-translational dynamics of these rigid components in a scalable way. Our experiment demonstrates that MOFFlow accurately predicts MOF structures containing several hundred atoms, significantly outperforming conventional methods and state-of-the-art machine learning baselines while being much faster.</description>
