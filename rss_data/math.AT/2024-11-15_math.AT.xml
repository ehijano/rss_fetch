      <title>Multiple Cylinder of Relations for Finite Spaces and Nerve Theorem for Strong-Good Cover</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop the concept of multiple cylinder of relations which is a generalization of the relation cylinder, extending the multiple non-Hausdorff mapping cylinder to sequences of finite T0-spaces linked by a series of relations.  This construction is important in capturing complex homotopical structures across chains of finite spaces and, when the relations are induced by maps, it serves as a third space that collapses to two distinct finite spaces. Additionally, we introduce the concept of a strong-good cover for simplicial complexes and finite spaces, char acterized by collapsible (rather than merely contractible) intersections. This leads to a strengthened version of the Nerve Theorem, which we develop for simplicial complexes as well as for finite spaces with strong-good covers, demonstrating that these complexes and spaces and their associated nerves maintain the same simple homotopy type, thereby refining classical results for finite simplicial complexes and finite topological structures.</description>

      <title>Inductive construction of path homology chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Path homology plays a central role in digraph topology and GLMY theory more general. Unfortunately, the computation of the path homology of a digraph $G$ is a two-step process, and until now no complete description of even the underlying chain complex has appeared in the literature.
  In this paper we introduce an inductive method of constructing elements of the path homology chain modules $\Omega_n(G;R)$ from elements in the proceeding two dimensions. This proceeds via the formation of what we call upper and lower \emph{extensions}, that are parametrised by certain labeled multihypergraphs which we introduce and call \emph{face multihypergraphs}.
  When the coefficient ring $R$ is a finite field the inductive elements we construct generate $\Omega_*(G;R)$. With integral or rational coefficients, the inductive elements generate at least $\Omega_i(G;R)$ for $i=0,1,2,3$. Since in low dimensions the inductive elements extended over labeled multigraphs coincide with naturally occurring generating sets up to sign, they are excellent candidates to reduce to a basis.
  Inductive elements provide a new concrete structure on the path chain complex that can be directly applied to understand path homology, under no restriction on the digraph $G$. We employ inductive elements to construct a sequence of digraphs whose path Euler characteristic can differ arbitrarily depending on the choice of field coefficients. In particular, answering an open question posed by Fu and Ivanov.</description>

      <title>Simons Lectures on Categorical Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Global Categorical Symmetries are a powerful new tool for analyzing quantum field theories. This volume compiles lecture notes from the 2022 and 2023 summer schools on Global Categorical Symmetries, held at the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics and at the Swiss Map Research Station in Les Diableret. Specifically, this volume collects the lectures:
  * An introduction to symmetries in quantum field theory, Kantaro Ohmori
  * Introduction to anomalies in quantum field theory, Clay C\'ordova
  * Symmetry Categories 101, Michele Del Zotto
  * Applied Cobordism Hypothesis, David Jordan
  * Finite symmetry in QFT, Daniel S. Freed
  These volumes are devoted to interested newcomers: we only assume (basic) knowledge of quantum field theory (QFT) and some relevant maths. We try to give appropriate references for non-standard materials that are not covered. Our aim in this first volume is to illustrate some of the main questions and ideas together with some of the methods and the techniques necessary to begin exploring global categorical symmetries of QFTs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.08919v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We build free, bigraded bidifferential algebra models for the forms on a complex manifold, with respect to a strong notion of quasi-isomorphism and compatible with the conjugation symmetry. This answers a question of Sullivan. The resulting theory naturally accomodates higher operations involving double primitives. As applications, we obtain various refinements of the homotopy groups, sensitive to the complex structure. Under a simple connectedness assumption, one obtains minimal models which are unique up to isomorphism and allow for explicit computations of the new invariants.</description>

      <title>Dowker duality, profunctors, and spectral sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13136v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The intent of this paper is to explore Dowker duality from a combinatorial, topological, and categorical perspective. The paper presents three short, new proofs of Dowker duality using various poset fiber lemmas. We introduce modifications of joins and products of simplicial complexes called relational join and relational product complexes. These relational complexes can be constructed whenever there is a relation between simplicial complexes, which includes the context of Dowker duality and covers of simplicial complexes. In this more general setting, we show that the homologies of the simplicial complexes and the relational complexes fit together in a long exact sequence. Similar results are then established for profunctors, which are generalizations of relations to categories. The cograph and graph of profunctors play the role of the relational join and relational product complexes. For a profunctor that arise from adjoint functors between $C$ and $D$, we show that $C$, $D$, the cograph, and the graph all have homotopy equivalent classifying spaces. Lastly, we show that given any profunctor from $D$ to $C$, the homologies of $C$, $D$, and the cograph form a long exact sequence.</description>

      <title>CAT(0) and cubulated Shephard groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10883v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Shephard groups are common generalizations of Coxeter groups, Artin groups, and graph products of cyclic groups. Their definition is similar to that of a Coxeter group, but generators may have arbitrary order rather than strictly order 2. We extend a well known result that Coxeter groups are $\mathrm{CAT}(0)$ to a class of Shephard groups that have "enough" finite parabolic subgroups. We also show that in this setting, if the associated Coxeter group is type (FC), then the Shephard group acts properly and cocompactly on a $\mathrm{CAT}(0)$ cube complex. As part of our proof of the former result, we introduce a new criteria for a complex made of $A_3$ simplices to be $\mathrm{CAT}(1)$.</description>

      <title>Colouring the 1-skeleton of $d$-dimensional triangulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11762v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While every plane triangulation is colourable with three or four colours, Heawood showed that a plane triangulation is 3-colourable if and only if every vertex has even degree. In $d \geq 3$ dimensions, however, every $k \geq d+1$ may occur as the chromatic number of some triangulation of ${\mathbb S}^d$. As a first step, Joswig structurally characterised which triangulations of ${\mathbb S}^d$ have a $(d+1)$-colourable 1-skeleton. In the 20 years since Joswig's result, no characterisations have been found for any $k&gt;d+1$.
  In this paper, we structurally characterise which triangulations of ${\mathbb S}^d$ have a $(d+2)$-colourable 1-skeleton: they are precisely the triangulations that have a subdivision such that for every $(d-2)$-cell, the number of incident $(d-1)$-cells is divisible by three.</description>

      <title>xPerT: Extended Persistence Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14193v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A persistence diagram provides a compact summary of persistent homology, which captures the topological features of a space at different scales. However, due to its nature as a set, incorporating it as a feature into a machine learning framework is challenging. Several methods have been proposed to use persistence diagrams as input for machine learning models, but they often require complex preprocessing steps and extensive hyperparameter tuning. In this paper, we propose a novel transformer architecture called the \textit{Extended Persistence Transformer (xPerT)}, which is highly scalable than the compared to Persformer, an existing transformer for persistence diagrams. xPerT reduces GPU memory usage by over 90\% and improves accuracy on multiple datasets. Additionally, xPerT does not require complex preprocessing steps or extensive hyperparameter tuning, making it easy to use in practice.
