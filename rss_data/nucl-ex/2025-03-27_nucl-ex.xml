      <title>MPD physics performance studies in Bi+Bi collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=9.2$ GeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Multi-Purpose Detector (MPD) is one of the three experiments of the Nuclotron Ion Collider-fAcility (NICA) complex, which is currently under construction at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna. With collisions of heavy ions in the collider mode, the MPD will cover the energy range 4-11 GeV to scan the high baryon-density region of the QCD phase diagram. With expected statistics of 50-100 million events collected during the first run, MPD will be able to study a number of observables, including measurements of light hadrons and hypernuclei production, particle flow, correlations and fluctuations, have a first look at dielectron production, and modification of vector-meson properties in dense matter. In this paper, we present selected results of the physics feasibility studies for the MPD experiment in Bismuth-Bismuth collisions at an energy of 9.2 GeV, the system considered as one of the first available at the NICA collider.</description>

      <title>First study of polarized proton-proton scattering with small-$x$ helicity evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a phenomenological study of helicity-dependent parton distribution functions (PDFs) using small-$x$ helicity evolution equations, incorporating for the first time single-inclusive jet production data in polarized proton-proton ($pp$) scattering at parton momentum fractions $x &lt; 0.1$. We also simultaneously include double-longitudinal spin asymmetries in inclusive and semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering probing $x &lt; 0.1$. Employing the polarized small-$x$ pure-glue calculation of $pp\to gX$ for the jet production cross section, we modify the large-$N_c\&amp;N_f$ KPS-CTT evolution equations by setting $N_f = 0$ to replicate the large-$N_c$ (pure-glue) limit, while retaining external quark flavors for the spinor field operators. We find that the $pp$ data have a considerable impact on the helicity PDFs at small $x$, reducing their uncertainties and leading to a total quark and gluon helicity in the proton for $x &lt; 0.1$ of $-0.04 \pm 0.23$. Combining our analysis with the a recent JAM helicity PDF analysis of the world polarized data, which includes $x &gt; 0.1$, we find a total quark and gluon helicity contribution for $x &gt; 10^{-7}$ of between 0.02 and 0.51.</description>

      <title>Global analysis of fragmentation functions to light neutral hadrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fragmentation functions (FFs) are crucial non-perturbative components in quantum chromodynamics (QCD), playing a vital role in predictions and understanding of the hadronization process. In this paper, we present the FFs for $K_S^0$, $\eta$, $\pi^0$ mesons, and $\Lambda$ baryons in the context of global QCD analysis. The data included in the fit are from single inclusive $e^+ e^-$ annihilation (SIA), semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering (SIDIS) and proton-proton collisions, with kinematic cuts carefully applied to ensure validity of collinear factorization and perturbative QCD expansion. For the first time, data from SIDIS and hadron-in-jet production in SIA have been incorporated into the extraction of FFs for light-flavor neutral hadrons. Our analysis reveals that these data play a critical role in constraining the gluon distribution, and in distinguishing between different quark flavors. Pulls from different datasets are also studied by performing alternative fits with systematically subtracting groups of data from the nominal fit. For the quality of the fit, good $\chi^2$ values are achieved for most of the datasets, and FFs are generally well constrained within the momentum fraction region $\pqty{0.1, 0.5}$. The extracted $K_S^0$ fragmentation functions, together with the $K_S^0$ FFs constructed from $K^{\pm}$ FFs via isospin symmetry, are used to test isospin symmetry in kaon fragmentation. Although a definitive conclusion cannot be reached yet, these studies have identified several potential measurements that can be performed at existing facilities, which may ultimately help us to arrive at a conclusive answer. With the comprehensive species of FFs extracted within the NPC framework, we are able to perform a test on the momentum sum rule with the light-flavor charged and neutral hadrons.</description>

      <title>The impact of future $D$- and $B$-meson measurements with the SMOG2 program at LHCb on the determination of nuclear parton distribution functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform an analysis of the potential impact of future $D$- and $B$-meson measurement within the SMOG2 fixed-target program at the LHCb experiment on nuclear parton distribution functions. Following~\cite{Bursche:2018orf}, we assume that SMOG2 will collect data for five nuclear targets: He, Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe and hydrogen which will provide a baseline for constructing nuclear ratios. The analysis is performed by using the PDF reweighting method. We demonstrate that such a measurement will allow to considerably reduce the current uncertainties of the nuclear gluon distribution and, to some extent, even the uncertainties of the light sea-quark distributions. Furthermore, it will provide the first possibility to systematically study the current assumptions on the $A$-dependence of the nuclear parton distributions.</description>

      <title>Measurement of photonuclear jet production in ultra-peripheral Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\text{NN}}} = 5.02$ TeV with the ATLAS detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11060v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions at the LHC, each nucleus acts a sources of high-energy real photons that can scatter off the opposing nucleus in ultra-peripheral photonuclear ($\gamma+A$) collisions. Hard scattering processes initiated by the photons in such collisions provide a novel method for probing nuclear parton distributions in a kinematic region not easily accessible to other measurements. ATLAS has measured production of dijet and multi-jet final states in ultra-peripheral Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\text{NN}}} = 5.02$ TeV using a data set recorded in 2018 with an integrated luminosity of 1.72 $\text{nb}^{-1}$. Photonuclear final states are selected by requiring a rapidity gap in the photon direction; this selects events where one of the outgoing nuclei remains intact. Jets are reconstructed using the anti-$k_\text{t}$ algorithm with radius parameter, $R = 0.4$. Triple-differential cross-sections, unfolded for detector response, are measured and presented using two sets of kinematic variables. The first set consists of the total transverse momentum ($H_\text{T}$),rapidity, and mass of the jet system. The second set uses $H_\text{T}$ and particle-level nuclear and photon parton momentum fractions, $x_\text{A}$ and $z_{\gamma}$, respectively. The results are compared with leading-order (LO) perturbative QCD calculations of photonuclear jet production cross-sections, where all LO predictions using existing fits fall below the data in the shadowing region. More detailed theoretical comparisons will allow these results to strongly constrain nuclear parton distributions, and these data provide results from the LHC directly comparable to early physics results at the planned Electron-Ion Collider.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01521v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We first describe the predictions concerning jet production in the very forward region, especially in the FOCAL kinematic region of the ALICE collaboration at CERN as a test of saturation. We also compare vector meson production cross sections at the LHC in Pb Pb and p Pb collisions with the Balitsky Fadin Kuraev Lipatov and the Balitsky Kovchegov evolution equations and data favor the observation of saturation at the LHC.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity study of a sapphire detector using Coherent Elastic Neutrino-Nucleus Scattering process</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09972v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Indian Coherent Neutrino-nucleus Scattering Experiment(ICNSE) has been proposed at Bhabha Atomic Research Centre in India to measure the coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering process using electron antineutrinos produced from reactors. Phenomenological studies are performed to find out the sensitivity of a sapphire detector for various fundamental physics parameters at an exposure of one year. Reactors of different core compositions, sizes, and thermal powers have been considered as sources of electron antineutrinos. The potential of the ICNSE to measure the weak mixing angle at a low energy regime has been extracted. Furthermore, the detector's capability has been investigated for examining the electromagnetic properties of neutrinos, including their magnetic moment. Additionally, an exploration has been conducted on the detector's sensitivity in restricting new interactions between neutrinos and electrons or nuclei, thereby constraining the parameter space related to light mediators. It is found that the ICNSE detector can put a stronger constraints on the scalar and vector mediators masses.</description>

      <title>Most stringent bound on electron neutrino mass obtained with a scalable low temperature microcalorimeter array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19920v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The determination of the absolute neutrino mass scale remains a fundamental open question in particle physics, with profound implications for both the Standard Model and cosmology. Direct kinematic measurements, independent of model-dependent assumptions, provide the most robust approach to address this challenge. In this Letter, we present the most stringent upper bound on the effective electron neutrino mass ever obtained with a calorimetric measurement of the electron capture decay of $^{163}$Ho. The HOLMES experiment employs an array of ion-implanted transition-edge sensor (TES) microcalorimeters, achieving an average energy resolution of 6 eV FWHM with a scalable, multiplexed readout technique. With a total of $7\times10^7$ decay events recorded over two months and a Bayesian statistical analysis, we derive an upper limit of $m_{\beta}&lt;27$ eV/c$^2$ at 90% credibility. These results validate the feasibility of $^{163}$Ho calorimetry for next-generation neutrino mass experiments and demonstrate the potential of a scalable TES-based microcalorimetric technique to push the sensitivity of direct neutrino mass measurements beyond the current state of the art.</description>
