      <title>TokaMark: A Comprehensive Benchmark for MAST Tokamak Plasma Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Development and operation of commercially viable fusion energy reactors such as tokamaks require accurate predictions of plasma dynamics from sparse, noisy, and incomplete sensors readings. The complexity of the underlying physics and the heterogeneity of experimental data pose formidable challenges for conventional numerical methods, while simultaneously highlights the promise of modern data-native AI approaches. A major obstacle in realizing this potential is, however, the lack of curated, openly available datasets and standardized benchmarks. Existing fusion datasets are scarce, fragmented across institutions, facility-specific, and inconsistently annotated, which limits reproducibility and prevents a fair and scalable comparison of AI approaches. In this paper, we introduce TokaMark, a structured benchmark to evaluate AI models on real experimental data collected from the Mega Ampere Spherical Tokamak (MAST). TokaMark provides a comprehensive suite of tools designed to (i) unify access to multi-modal heterogeneous fusion data (ii) harmonize formats, metadata, temporal alignment and evaluation protocols to enable consistent cross-model and cross-task comparisons. The benchmark includes a curated list of 14 tasks spanning a range of physical mechanisms, exploiting a variety of diagnostics and covering multiple target use cases. A baseline model is provided to facilitate transparent comparison and validation within a unified framework. By establishing a unified benchmark for both the fusion and AI-for-science communities, TokaMark aims to accelerate progress in data-driven plasma AI modeling, contributing to the broader goal of achieving sustainable and stable fusion energy. The benchmark, documentation, and tooling will be fully open sourced upon acceptance to encourage community adoption and contribution.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Kinetic-Fluid Gap: Ion-Driven Magnetogenesis to Prime Cosmic Dynamos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of cosmic magnetic fields is widely attributed to the amplification of weak seed fields by turbulent dynamos. However, a critical understanding gap remains between the microscopic generation of these seeds and the macroscopic onset of the dynamo. Current kinetic models, often constrained to electron scales, predict premature saturation via magnetic trapping, leaving the generated fields potentially too weak and small-scale to effectively prime magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) processes. Here, using high-resolution kinetic simulations with a realistic mass ratio, we reveal the physics of this unexplored ion-kinetic regime. Under generalized continuous shear driving, used to simulate ubiquitous macroscopic flows, we demonstrate that the saturation of electron instabilities is not the endpoint but a precursor to a distinct, ion-dominated evolution. Massive ions, sustaining the velocity shear, trigger a subsequent filamentation instability that accesses the vast ion kinetic energy reservoir. This mechanism amplifies the magnetic energy by orders of magnitude beyond the electron-saturation limit, expanding the field coherence to ion scales. Our results establish ion kinetics as the essential ''missing link'' that bridges the divide between microscopic plasma instabilities and macroscopic cosmic dynamos.</description>

      <title>Fully nonlinear phenomenology of the bump-on-tail (BOT) instability with drag, diffusion and Krook relaxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energetic-particle-driven modes in magnetically confined fusion plasmas often exhibit nonlinear frequency sweeping, reflecting complex wave-particle interactions near marginal stability. While the bump-on-tail (BOT) instability within the Berk-Breizman framework has served as a canonical model for understanding such phenomena, a unified nonlinear description remains incomplete when drag, diffusion, and Krook relaxation act simultaneously. In this work, we present a comprehensive numerical investigation of the BOT instability that explicitly retains all three collision operators together with external wave damping. Using a validated characteristic-based BOT code, we systematically scan the multi-dimensional collision parameter space and construct nonlinear regime maps and bifurcation diagrams. To organize the rich dynamics, we introduce a two-level categorization that combines global wave-energy evolution with chirping subtypes identified from spectral morphology. We find that diffusion and Krook relaxation regularize the nonlinear dynamics and promote ordered transitions from chaotic behaviors to periodic oscillations and steady saturation as collision strength increases, with the saturation level decreasing approximately exponentially with external damping. In contrast, drag alone does not admit steady solutions and instead drives persistent or chaotic chirping through convective deformation of resonant phase-space structures. When drag is combined with diffusion or Krook relaxation, clear transition sequences emerge: increasing drag breaks hole-clump symmetry, broadens the effective resonance region, and drives systematic transitions from transient to intermittent and persistent chirping.</description>

      <title>Generation and control of Doppler harmonics approaching $10^{22}\textrm{W/cm}^2$ on plasma mirrors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we report Doppler harmonic generation with a relativistic plasma mirror at unprecedented intensities $&gt;10^{21} ~\textrm{W/cm}^2$ using a PetaWatt-class laser. We show that beyond a few $10^{21} ~\textrm{W/cm}^2$ a precise control of the laser contrast at the sub-picosecond time scale becomes essential to drive the efficient generation of high-order harmonics. Such control is paramount for deploying plasma mirrors in high-field applications at PetaWatt-class laser facilities, including, for instance, their use as intensity boosters in the pursuit of the strong-field regime of quantum electrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Collisionless relaxation as the origin of the anisotropic, non-thermal, and multi-temperature momentum distributions observed in space plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anisotropic, non-thermal, and multi-temperature distributed particle momenta are commonly observed in collisionless space plasmas, such as the solar wind. Using Liouville's theorem, we argue that anisotropic compression or expansion of the plasma, followed by a relaxation of the resulting anisotropic stress must lead to non-equilibrium states that are either anisotropic, non-thermal distribution functions, different electron and ion temperatures, or a combination of these effects. We present arguments showing that a plasma in thermal equilibrium undergoing anisotropic compression or expansion cannot return to thermal equilibrium in the absence of particle collisions. Since most astrophysical plasmas are practically collisionless and experience significant anisotropic compression or expansion, we expect anisotropic, non-thermal, and multi-temperature particle distributions to be ubiquitous, in agreement with solar wind measurements.</description>

      <title>Charged particle motion in a strong magnetic field: The first order expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a mathematically rigorous derivation of the first order expansion of the motion of a charged particle in a strong magnetic field. In contrast to the derivations that can be found in the physics literature we solely assume throughout that the magnetic field is strong. In particular we do not need to make any structural assumptions on the particle motion, such as the gyroradius being small in comparison to the magnetic length scale. Instead, some of the additional assumptions which are usually made in the physics literature turn out to be an a posteriori consequence in our approach. Our approach further justifies the utilisation of the guiding centre approximation at "bounce points" within magnetic mirrors, a situation which violates the usual assumptions which are made in the physics literature when deriving the guiding centre approximation.</description>

      <title>Interstellar Medium Modulation of Nonlinear Kinetic Alfv\'en Morphology in Structured Galactic Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08313v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a spatially dependent framework for the existence and propagation of nonlinear kinetic Alfv\'en (KA) structures in the interstellar medium (ISM). Using a multi-component analytical model that incorporates the diffuse warm ionized medium together with localized H II regions, supernova remnants (SNR), and stellar-wind bubbles (SWB), we derive location-dependent coefficients governing KA dispersion and nonlinearity. The reductive perturbation method is applied to obtain Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equations, enabling the characterization of solitons under realistic astrophysical conditions. Numerical analysis demonstrates how superthermality, plasma $\beta$, temperature, and density gradients modulate soliton amplitude, width, and stability. Our results reveal distinct exclusion zones (EZs) for KA solitons in high-$\beta$ HII regions and SWB/SNR interiors, as well as ultra low-$\beta$ regions near central pulsar wind nebulae. While H II regions exhibit simple Gaussian-driven depletions, the complex ``hole-and-shell" morphologies of SWBs and SNRs imprint sharp spatial variations and discontinuities on soliton properties. This study establishes a direct link between macroscopic ISM morphology, ion-kinetic scale dissipation, and the emergence of coherent Alfv\'enic activity, with implications for radio scattering, pulsar scintillation, and fine-scale signatures in astrophysical observations.</description>

      <title>Kinetic renormalization of auroral turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11755v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Driven-dissipative systems often exhibit self-organization in the form of coherent dissipative structures. However, observing such critical states in natural plasmas remains elusive, leading to the traditional view that the fine structure of Earth's auroral ionosphere is shaped by local turbulent flows. Here we report the discovery of a self-organizing regime in Earth's ionosphere. We identify this by modeling the sum of saturation electric fields in the turbulent auroral electrojets as a stochastic variable that renormalizes into noise-enabled transport, via explicitly derived Bohm diffusion. This constitutes an effective field-theory for Farley-Buneman turbulence in the Martin-Siggia-Rose formalism for renormalization group theory, for which we provide strong empirical evidence. Using a composite radar-GPS power spectrum of plasma turbulence, we resolve a scale-invariant cascade that exhibits a characteristic kinetic Alfv\'{e}n $k^{-8/3}$-signature across four orders of magnitude in $k$. What is more, a large statistical analysis of how the turbulence responds to magnetospheric driving reveals a clear tendency for the observed number density of turbulent waves to scale linearly with driving power, matching the predictions made by our field theory's overdamped equations of motion, which offer closed-form calculations of macroscopic transport relations that are uniquely suitable for sub-grid parameterization in space weather modeling. This establishes geospace storms as opportunities to observe non-equilibrium phase transitions imposing global constraints on collision-dominated systems.</description>
