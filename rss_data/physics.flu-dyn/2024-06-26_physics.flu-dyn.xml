      <title>Laminar forced convection characteristics in a round microchannel with shape uncertainty: effect of wall slip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The shape of a microchannel cross-section is usually affected by a significant uncertainty due to the small hydraulic diameter. Such an uncertainty is indeed present at any scale, but is amplified in smaller scales, becoming significantly important when the hydraulic diameter is smaller than some tenth micrometers. In this scenario, this paper is focused on analyzing the sensitivity of the heat and fluid flow characteristics with respect to the channel shape, considering a random modifications in the channel cross section. Forced convection in a fully developed regime with a wall slip is considered, and the analysis includes the evaluation of the Fanning friction factor and of the Nusselt number for the H1 thermal boundary condition, considering different slip-flow configurations, as dictated by the slip-length parameter. The heat and fluid flow problem is solved for one thousand randomly generated channel geometries, based on a circular microchannel which is allowed to have its boundary points move within 10\% of its nominal diameter. The calculated data for $f \Re$ and $\Nu$ are then analyzed, and compared with the nominal values (obtained for smooth channels). The results show that, on an average basis, the roughness effect has a tendency to reduce the Nusselt number while increasing the friction factor, however, with a small number of exceptions.</description>

      <title>A Computational Study of Bubble Formation from an Orifice Submerged in Liquid with Constant Gas Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The process of bubble formation from an orifice submerged in liquid with constant gas flow is studied by numerical simulations using an OpenFOAM volume-of-fluid solver named interIsoFoam. The computed results show that the detached bubble size tends to increase with the gas flow rate, orifice size, surface tension, liquid contact angle, etc. in qualitative agreement with most previous authors. For a given orifice size and liquid properties, there exists a critical gas flow rate above which detached bubbles will combine via coalescence known as bubble pairing. The detached bubble size seems insensitive to the contact angle when the liquid adequately wets the orifice wall, but can increase substantially if the contact angle is increased beyond a critical value resulting in contact line motion on the horizontal orifice surface. The value of such a critical contact angle increases with the orifice size as well as gas flow rate. Such revelations would logically suggest that the usage of reduced orifice size for generating smaller bubbles could be more challenging and practically difficult with constant gas flow for sub-millimeter orifices.</description>

      <title>The influence of flame-pressure waves collisions on the development and evolution of tulip flames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effects of pressure waves-flame collisions and tube aspect ratio on flame evolution and the formation of tulip and distorted tulip flames were investigated using numerical simulations of the fully compressible Navier-Stokes equations coupled with a detailed chemical model for a stoichiometric hydrogen-air mixture. It is shown that: (1) the rarefaction wave generated by the decelerating flame in the unburned gas is the primary physical process leading to the flame front inversion and the tulip flame formation, (2) the flame front instabilities (Darrieus-Landau or Rayleigh-Taylor) do not participate in the formation of the tulip flame, since the time of the flame front inversion due to the rarefaction wave is considerably shorter than the characteristic times of the development of instabilities with wavelengths of the order of the tube width. The first rarefaction wave in the unburned gas mixture is generated after the flame skirt touches the tube walls and the flame is slowed down due to the reduction in flame surface area. The collision of the flame with the pressure waves reflected from the closed end of the tube leads to a faster and more pronounced formation of a tulip-shaped flame. In later stages, flame collisions with pressure waves can lead to the formation of distorted tulip flames due to short-wavelength Rayleigh-Taylor instability of the flame front. Because flame acceleration and deceleration occur much faster in 3D flames than in 2D flames, tulip flame formation also occurs much faster in 3D flames than in 2D flames.</description>

      <title>1D Poiseuille Plane Channel Flow by Second Order Response Matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With increasing miniaturization of diagnostic devices for more effective detection of blood-borne pathogens for example, Poiseuille molecular flow in micro channels has become increasingly relevant. Since continuum mechanics no longer applies for Poiseuille flow when the Knudson number is near or larger than unity, kinetic theory is required to capture the microscopic molecular scattering responsible for channel molecular flow and the velocity profile across a channel. Here, we apply a response matrix solution to the 1D Poiseuille flow with a BGK approximation featuring simplicity with precision by following a consistent numerical formulation leading to high precision, 8-place benchmarks.</description>

      <title>The intermittent vibration observed by Reynolds in a cylindrical tube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a cylindrical tube filled with incompressible fluid, the variable parameter method is applied to solve the vorticity motion equation, and the obtained results are substituted into the Poisson equation satisfied by the energy density. The static distribution of energy density in the tube and the energy density of the flowing fluid after a certain spatial sampling interval are obtained. Further numerical calculations are conducted on the energy density of the flowing fluid, the results show that the intermittent vibration observed by Reynolds 140 years ago can only be obtained with the appropriate spatial sampling interval. The energy density in the tube is proportional to to , where N is an integer It tends to infinity with increasing N.</description>

      <title>Dissipative Particle Dynamics and other particle methods for multiphase fluid flow in fractured and porous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Particle methods are less computationally efficient than grid based numerical solution of the Navier Stokes equation. However, they have important advantages including rigorous mass conservation, momentum conservation and isotropy. In addition, there is no need for explicit interface tracking/capturing and code development effort is relatively low. We describe applications of three particle methods: molecular dynamics, dissipative particle dynamics and smoothed particle hydrodynamics. The mesoscale (between the molecular and continuum scales) dissipative particle dynamics method can be used to simulate systems that are too large to simulate using molecular dynamics but small enough for thermal fluctuations to play an important role.</description>

      <title>Lubrication-mediated rebounds off fluid baths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present herein the derivation of a lubrication-mediated (LM) quasi-potential model for droplet rebounds off deep liquid baths, assuming the presence of a persistent dynamic air layer which acts as a lubricating pressure transfer. We then present numerical simulations of the LM model for axisymmetric rebounds of solid spheres and compare quantitatively to current results in the literature, including experimental data in the low speed impact regime. In this regime the LM model has the advantage of being far more computationally tractable than DNS and is also able to provide detailed behaviour within the micro-metric thin lubrication region. The LM system has an interesting mathematical structure, with the lubrication layer providing a free boundary elliptic problem mediating the drop and bath free-boundary evolutionary equations.</description>

      <title>Inhomogeneity-induced wavenumber diffusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inertia-gravity waves are scattered by background flows as a result of Doppler shift by a non-uniform velocity. In the WKB regime, the scattering process reduces to a diffusion in spectral space. Other inhomogeneities the waves encounter, such as density variations, also cause scattering and spectral diffusion. We generalise the spectral diffusion equation to account for these inhomogeneities. We apply the result to the rotating shallow water system, for which height inhomogeneities arise from velocity inhomogeneities through geostrophy, and to the Boussinesq system for which buoyancy inhomogeneities arise similarly. We compare the contributions that height and buoyancy variations make to the spectral diffusion with the contribution of the Doppler shift. In both systems, we find regimes where all contributions are significant. We support our findings with exact solutions of the diffusion equation and with ray tracing simulations in the shallow water case.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Turbulence Modeling Approach for Cold-Wall Hypersonic Boundary Layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wall-cooling effect in hypersonic boundary layers can significantly alter the near-wall turbulence behavior, which is not accurately modeled by traditional RANS turbulence models. To address this shortcoming, this paper presents a turbulence modeling approach for hypersonic flows with cold-wall conditions using an iterative ensemble Kalman method. Specifically, a neural-network-based turbulence model is used to provide closure mapping from mean flow quantities to Reynolds stress as well as a variable turbulent Prandtl number. Sparse observation data of velocity and temperature are used to train the turbulence model. This approach is analyzed using direct numerical simulation database for boundary layer flows over a flat plate with a Mach number between 6 and 14 and wall-to-recovery temperature ratios ranging from 0.18 to 0.76. Two training cases are conducted: 1) a single training case with observation data from one flow case, 2) a joint training case where data from two flow cases are simultaneously used for training. Trained models are also tested for generalizability on the remaining flow cases in each of the training cases. The results are also analyzed for insights to inform the future work towards enhancing the generalizability of the learned turbulence model.</description>

      <title>Thermocavitation in gold-coated microchannels for needle-free jet injection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous-wave lasers generated bubbles in microfluidic channels are proposed for applications such as needle-free jet injection due to their small size and affordable price of these lasers. However, water is transparent in the visible and near-IR regime, where the affordable diode lasers operate. Therefore a dye is required for absorption, which is often unwanted in thermocavitation applications such as vaccines or cosmetics. In this work we explore a different mechanism of the absorption of optical energy. The microfluidic channel wall is partially covered with a thin gold layer which absorbs light from a blue laser diode. This surface absorption is compared with the conventional volumetric absorption by a red dye. The results show that this surface absorption can be used to generate bubbles without the requirement of a dye. However, the generated bubbles are smaller and grow slower when compared to the dye-generated bubbles. Furthermore, heat dissipation in the glass channel walls affect the overall efficiency. Finally, degradation of the gold layer over time reduces the reproducibility and limits its lifetime. Further experiments and simulations are proposed to potentially solve these problems and optimize the bubble formation. Our findings can inform the design and operation of microfluidic devices used in phase transition experiments and other cavitation phenomena, such as jet injectors or liquid dispensing for bio-engineering.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Computing Methods for Nonlinear Physics Systems with Geometric Constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a landscape where scientific discovery is increasingly driven by data, the integration of machine learning (ML) with traditional scientific methodologies has emerged as a transformative approach. This paper introduces a novel, data-driven framework that synergizes physics-based priors with advanced ML techniques to address the computational and practical limitations inherent in first-principle-based methods and brute-force machine learning methods. Our framework showcases four algorithms, each embedding a specific physics-based prior tailored to a particular class of nonlinear systems, including separable and nonseparable Hamiltonian systems, hyperbolic partial differential equations, and incompressible fluid dynamics. The intrinsic incorporation of physical laws preserves the system's intrinsic symmetries and conservation laws, ensuring solutions are physically plausible and computationally efficient. The integration of these priors also enhances the expressive power of neural networks, enabling them to capture complex patterns typical in physical phenomena that conventional methods often miss. As a result, our models outperform existing data-driven techniques in terms of prediction accuracy, robustness, and predictive capability, particularly in recognizing features absent from the training set, despite relying on small datasets, short training periods, and small sample sizes.</description>

Abstract: The development of turbulence closure models, parametrizing the influence of small non-resolved scales on the dynamics of large resolved ones, is an outstanding theoretical challenge with vast applicative relevance. We present a closure, based on deep recurrent neural networks, that quantitatively reproduces, within statistical errors, Eulerian and Lagrangian structure functions and the intermittent statistics of the energy cascade, including those of subgrid fluxes. To achieve high-order statistical accuracy, and thus a stringent statistical test, we employ shell models of turbulence. Our results encourage the development of similar approaches for 3D Navier-Stokes turbulence.</description>

      <title>Reynolds-number effects on the outer region of adverse-pressure-gradient turbulent boundary layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.08714v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Reynolds-number effects on the outer region of moderate adverse-pressure-gradient (APG) turbulent boundary layers (TBLs) and find that their small scale energy reduces with increasing friction Reynolds-number ($Re_{\tau}$). The trend is based on analyzing APG TBL data across 600 $\lesssim$ $Re_{\tau}$ $\lesssim$ 7000, and contrasts with the negligible variation in small scale energy noted for canonical wall flows. The datasets considered include those from a well-resolved numerical simulation (Pozuelo et al. 2022), which provides access to an APG TBL maintained at near-equilibrium conditions across 1000 $\lesssim$ $Re_{\tau}$ $\lesssim$ 2000, with a well-defined flow history, and a new high-$Re_{\tau}$ ($\sim$ 7000) experimental study from the large Melbourne wind tunnel, with its long test section modified to permit development of an APG TBL from a 'canonical' upstream condition. The decrease in small scale energy with $Re_{\tau}$ is revealed via decomposing the streamwise normal stresses into small and large scale contributions, based on a sharp spectral cut-off. The origin for this trend is traced back to the production of turbulent kinetic energy in an APG TBL, the small scale contribution to which is also found to decrease with $Re_{\tau}$ in the outer region. The conclusion is reaffirmed by investigating attenuation of streamwise normal stresses due to changing spatial-resolutions of the numerical grid/hotwire sensors, which reduces with increasing $Re_{\tau}$ and is found to be negligible at $Re_{\tau}$ $\sim$ 7000 in this study. The results emphasize that new scaling arguments and spatial-resolution correction schemes should be tested rigorously across a broad $Re_{\tau}$ range, particularly for the outer region of pressure gradient TBLs.</description>

      <title>Quantifying local and global mass balance errors in physics-informed neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.13920v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINN) have recently become attractive for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) that describe physics laws. By including PDE-based loss functions, physics laws such as mass balance are enforced softly in PINN. This paper investigates how mass balance constraints are satisfied when PINN is used to solve the resulting PDEs. We investigate PINN's ability to solve the 1D saturated groundwater flow equations for homogeneous and heterogeneous media and evaluate the local and global mass balance errors. We compare the obtained PINN's solution and associated mass balance errors against a two-point finite volume numerical method and the corresponding analytical solution. We also evaluate the accuracy of PINN in solving the 1D saturated groundwater flow equation with and without incorporating hydraulic heads as training data. We demonstrate that PINN's local and global mass balance errors are significant compared to the finite volume approach. Tuning the PINN's hyperparameters, such as the number of collocation points, training data, hidden layers, nodes, epochs, and learning rate, did not improve the solution accuracy or the mass balance errors compared to the finite volume solution. Mass balance errors could considerably challenge the utility of PINN in applications where ensuring compliance with physical and mathematical properties is crucial.</description>

      <title>Magneto-Stokes Flow in a Shallow Free-Surface Annulus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10882v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we analyse "magneto-Stokes" flow, a fundamental magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) flow that shares the cylindrical-annular geometry of the Taylor-Couette cell, but uses applied electromagnetic forces to circulate a free-surface layer of electrolyte at low Reynolds numbers. The first complete, analytical solution for time-dependent magneto-Stokes flow is presented and validated with coupled laboratory and numerical experiments. Three regimes are distinguished (shallow-layer, transitional, and deep-layer flow regimes), and their influence on the efficiency of microscale mixing is clarified. The solution in the shallow-layer limit belongs to a newly-identified class of MHD potential flows, and thus induces mixing without the aid of axial vorticity. We show that these shallow-layer magneto-Stokes flows can still augment mixing in distinct Taylor dispersion and advection-dominated mixing regimes. The existence of enhanced mixing across all three distinguished flow regimes is predicted by asymptotic scaling laws and supported by three-dimensional numerical simulations. Mixing enhancement is initiated with the least electromagnetic forcing in channels with order-unity depth-to-gap-width ratios. If the strength of the electromagnetic forcing is not a constraint, then shallow-layer flows can still yield the shortest mixing times in the advection-dominated limit. Our robust description of momentum evolution and mixing of passive tracers makes the annular magneto-Stokes system fit for use as an MHD reference flow.</description>

      <title>Small-scale magnetohydrodynamic dynamos: from deterministic chaos to turbulence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02049v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is shown, using results of numerical simulations, and geophysical and solar observations, that the transition from deterministic chaos to hard turbulence in the magnetic field generated by the small-scale MHD dynamos occurs through a randomization process. This randomization process has been described using the notion of distributed chaos and the main parameter of distributed chaos has been used for quantifying the degree of randomization. The dissipative (Loitsianskii and Birkhoff-Saffman integrals) and ideal (magnetic helicity) magnetohydrodynamic invariants control the randomization process and determine the degree of randomization in different MHD flows, directly or through the Kolmogorov-Iroshnikov phenomenology (the magneto-inertial range of scales as a precursor of hard turbulence). Despite the considerable differences in the scales and physical parameters, the results of numerical simulations are in quantitative agreement with the geophysical and solar observations in the frames of this approach. The Hall magnetohydrodynamic dynamo has been also briefly discussed in this context.</description>

Abstract: This study performed a numerical analysis of the deformation and breakup of a liquid ligament with various disturbances on the interface in shear flow. The shear flow generates a three-dimensional flow and vortices around the liquid ligament. These vortices promote the movement of the liquid inside the liquid ligament. When the velocity difference of shear flow increases, a nonlinear effect becomes strong, and turbulence with higher wavenumber components than the initial disturbance occurs at the interface. This turbulence accelerates the ligament splitting and increases the number of breakup droplets. Then, the droplet diameters become uniform, and the atomization quality improves. As the wavenumber of the disturbance applied to the interface increases, the liquid moving velocity along the central axis of the liquid ligament increases. Furthermore, the breakup time of the liquid ligament becomes short. In addition to the initial reference disturbance with a low wavenumber, when turbulence with twice the wavenumber of the reference disturbance is applied to the interface, the interface deformation and the splitting of the liquid ligament are similar to those with the single reference disturbance. When turbulence with four times the wavenumber is added to the initial disturbance with the low wavenumber at the interface, the deformation of the liquid ligament is accelerated, and the liquid ligament splits faster. Additionally, the number of breakup droplets increases; hence, the total surface area of the liquid increases. The droplet diameter becomes uniform; therefore, the atomization quality of the liquid ligament is improved.</description>

      <title>Boundary sources of velocity gradient tensor and its invariants</title>

Abstract: The present work elucidates the boundary behaviors of the velocity gradient tensor ($\bm{A}\equiv\bm{\nabla}\bm{u}$) and its principal invariants ($P,Q,R$) for compressible flow interacting with a stationary rigid wall. Firstly, it is found that the well-known Caswell formula exhibits an inherent physical structure being compatible with the normal-nilpotent decomposition, where both the strain-rate and rotation-rate tensors contain the physical effects from the spin component of the vorticity. Secondly, we derive the kinematic and dynamic forms of the boundary $\bm{A}$-flux from which the known boundary fluxes can be recovered by applying the symmetric-antisymmetric decomposition. Then, we obtain the explicit expression of the boundary $Q$ flux as a result of the competition among the boundary fluxes of squared dilatation, enstrophy and squared strain-rate. Importantly, we emphasize that both the coupling between the spin and surface pressure gradient, and the spin-curvature quadratic interaction, are \textit{not} responsible for the generation of the boundary $Q$ flux, although they contribute to both the boundary fluxes of enstrophy and squared strain-rate. Moreover, we prove that the boundary $R$ flux must vanish on a stationary rigid wall. Finally, the boundary fluxes of the invariants of the strain-rate and rotation-rate tensors are also discussed. It is revealed that the boundary flux of the third invariant of the strain-rate tensor is proportional to the wall-normal derivative of the vortex stretching term, which serves as a source term accounting for the the spatiotemporal evolution rate of the wall-normal enstrophy flux. These theoretical results provide a unified description of boundary vorticity and vortex dynamics, which could be valuable in understanding the formation mechanisms of complex near-wall coherent structures and the boundary sources of flow noise.</description>

      <title>Influence of the flow split ratio on the position of the main atrial vortex: implications for stasis on the left atrial appendage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11388v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Background: Despite the recent advances in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques applied to blood flow within the left atrium (LA), the relationship between atrial geometry, flow patterns, and blood stasis within the left atrial appendage (LAA) remains unclear. A better understanding of this relationship would have important clinical implications, as thrombi originating in the LAA are a common cause of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF).
  Aim: To identify the most representative atrial flow patterns on a patient-specific basis and study their influence on LAA blood stasis by varying the flow split ratio and some common atrial modeling assumptions.
  Methods: Three recent techniques were applied to nine patient-specific computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models of patients with AF: a kinematic atrial model to isolate the influence of wall motion because of AF, projection on a universal LAA coordinate system, and quantification of stagnant blood volume (SBV).
  Results: We identified three different atrial flow patterns based on the position of the center of the main circulatory flow. The results also illustrate how atrial flow patterns are highly affected by the flow split ratio, increasing the SBV within the LAA. As the flow split ratio is determined by the patient's lying position, the results suggest that the most frequent position adopted while sleeping may have implications for the medium- and long-term risks of stroke.</description>
