      <title>Effects of Stochastic Games on Evolutionary Dynamics in Structured Populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuously changing environments have a paramount role in the evolution of cooperative behavior. Previous works have shown that the transitions among different games, as the feedback between behaviors and environments, can promote cooperative behavior significantly. Quantitative analysis, however, is limited to homogeneous populations, while realistic populations in nature are often more complex and highly heterogeneous. We hereby provide an analytical treatment of when the evolution of cooperation can be supported in stochastic games, applying to arbitrary spatial heterogeneity and payoff structure. We highlight that the rule and frequency of game changes can have surprisingly diverse effects on evolutionary outcomes, depending on the governing social dilemmas. While stochastic games favor the evolution of cooperation in donation games, this is not the case for public goods games and snowdrift games. Hence, our framework and model results offer a more subtle insight into the long-standing enigma.</description>

      <title>Large language models for spreading dynamics in complex systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spreading dynamics is a central topic in the physics of complex systems and network science, providing a unified framework for understanding how information, behaviors, and diseases propagate through interactions among system units. In many propagation contexts, spreading processes are influenced by multiple interacting factors, such as information expression patterns, cultural contexts, living environments, cognitive preferences, and public policies, which are difficult to incorporate directly into classical modeling frameworks. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have exhibited strong capabilities in natural language understanding, reasoning, and generation, enabling explicit perception of semantic content and contextual cues in spreading processes, thereby supporting the analysis of the different influencing factors. Beyond serving as external analytical tools, LLMs can also act as interactive agents embedded in propagation systems, potentially influencing spreading pathways and feedback structures. Consequently, the roles and impacts of LLMs on spreading dynamics have become an active and rapidly growing research area across multiple research disciplines. This review provides a comprehensive overview of recent advances in applying LLMs to the study of spreading dynamics across two representative domains: digital epidemics, such as misinformation and rumors, and biological epidemics, including infectious disease outbreaks. We first examine the foundations of epidemic modeling from a complex-systems perspective and discuss how LLM-based approaches relate to traditional frameworks. We then systematically review recent studies from three key perspectives, which are epidemic modeling, epidemic detection and surveillance, and epidemic prediction and management, to clarify how LLMs enhance these areas. Finally, open challenges and potential research directions are discussed.</description>

      <title>Effect of Electoral Seat Bias on Political Polarization: A Computational Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Research on the causes of political polarization points towards multiple drivers of the problem, from social and psychological to economic and technological. However, political institutions stand out, because -- while capable of exacerbating or alleviating polarization -- they can be re-engineered more readily than others. Accordingly, we analyze one class of such institutions -- electoral systems -- investigating whether the large-party seat bias found in many common systems (particularly plurality and Jefferson-D'Hondt) exacerbates polarization. Cross-national empirical data being relatively sparse and heavily confounded, we use computational methods: an agent-based Monte Carlo simulation. We model voter behavior over multiple electoral cycles, building upon the classic spatial model, but incorporating other known voter behavior patterns, such as the bandwagon effect, strategic voting, preference updating, retrospective voting, and the thermostatic effect. We confirm our hypothesis that electoral systems with a stronger large-party bias exhibit significantly higher polarization, as measured by the Mehlhaff index.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Sovereignty on Mars: Lessons from the International Telecommunication Union and Universal Postal Union</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As humans make ambitious efforts toward long-duration activities beyond Earth, new challenges will continue to emerge that highlight the need for governance frameworks capable of managing shared resources and technical standards in order to sustain human life in these hostile environments. Earth-based governance models of cooperative sovereignty can inform governance mechanisms for future Mars settlements, particularly regarding inter-settlement relations and the technical coordination required for multiple independent settlements to coexist. This study analyzes the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and the Universal Postal Union (UPU), two of the oldest international organizations, which have successfully established evolving standards across sovereign nations. This analysis of the development and governance structures of these two organizations, and how they resolved key sovereignty issues, reveals principles that could be applicable to future settlements beyond Earth, particularly on Mars. Key insights include the strategic necessity of institutional neutrality, the management of asymmetric power relations, and the governance of shared resources under conditions of mutual vulnerability. The study distinguishes between a "Survival Layer" of technical standards essential for immediate safety and an "Operational Layer" governing economic and political activities, suggesting different governance approaches for each. Although some of these examples of cooperative sovereignty on Earth might not be sufficient for Mars due to its unique environment, lessons from the ITU and UPU case studies offer valuable strategies for designing flexible and sustainable governance models that can function from inception through explicit Earth-based coordination.</description>

      <title>When do neural ordinary differential equations generalize on complex networks?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural ordinary differential equations (neural ODEs) can effectively learn dynamical systems from time series data, but their behavior on graph-structured data remains poorly understood, especially when applied to graphs with different size or structure than encountered during training. We study neural ODEs ($\mathtt{nODE}$s) with vector fields following the Barab\'asi-Barzel form, trained on synthetic data from five common dynamical systems on graphs. Using the $\mathbb{S}^1$-model to generate graphs with realistic and tunable structure, we find that degree heterogeneity and the type of dynamical system are the primary factors in determining $\mathtt{nODE}$s' ability to generalize across graph sizes and properties. This extends to $\mathtt{nODE}$s' ability to capture fixed points and maintain performance amid missing data. Average clustering plays a secondary role in determining $\mathtt{nODE}$ performance. Our findings highlight $\mathtt{nODE}$s as a powerful approach to understanding complex systems but underscore challenges emerging from degree heterogeneity and clustering in realistic graphs.</description>

      <title>Whose Name Comes Up? Benchmarking and Intervention-Based Auditing of LLM-Based Scholar Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for academic expert recommendation. Existing audits typically evaluate model outputs in isolation, largely ignoring end-user inference-time interventions. As a result, it remains unclear whether failures such as refusals, hallucinations, and uneven coverage stem from model choice or deployment decisions. We introduce LLMScholarBench, a benchmark for auditing LLM-based scholar recommendation that jointly evaluates model infrastructure and end-user interventions across multiple tasks. LLMScholarBench measures both technical quality and social representation using nine metrics. We instantiate the benchmark in physics expert recommendation and audit 22 LLMs under temperature variation, representation-constrained prompting, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) via web search. Our results show that end-user interventions do not yield uniform improvements but instead redistribute error across dimensions. Higher temperature degrades validity, consistency, and factuality. Representation-constrained prompting improves diversity at the expense of factuality, while RAG primarily improves technical quality while reducing diversity and parity. Overall, end-user interventions reshape trade-offs rather than providing a general fix. We release code and data that can be adapted to other disciplines by replacing domain-specific ground truth and metrics.</description>

      <title>AI-based Verbal and Visual Scaffolding in a Serious Game: Effects on Learning and Cognitive Load</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to their interactive nature, serious games offer valuable opportunities for supporting learning in educational contexts. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have further opened the door to new forms of personalized scaffolding in education. In this study, we combine both worlds and study three types of AI-based scaffolding designs in a serious game: (i) no scaffolding, (ii) chat-based (verbal) scaffolding provided by an AI-based non-player character (NPC), and (iii) combined chat-(verbal) and action-based (visual) scaffolding in which the AI may both try to explain or demonstrate the next step towards a solution. The scaffolding conditions are embedded in Qookies, a serious game designed to introduce fundamental concepts of quantum technologies. A total of 152 school students, university students, and members of the general public were randomly assigned to one of the three conditions. The results show that all groups experience significant learning gains, confirming the overall effectiveness of the serious game itself. No significant differences in learning outcomes emerged between scaffolding conditions. However, intrinsic cognitive load was lower in the combined chat-and-action (verbal+visual) scaffolding condition compared to the chat (verbal)-only condition, suggesting that visual demonstrations may offer more accessible support. Interaction analyses further revealed that players engaged with the AI character primarily for level-related questions and action recommendations, while deeper interactions were relatively rare.</description>

      <title>Reproducing the first and second moments of empirical degree distributions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10373v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of probabilistic models for the analysis of complex networks represents a flourishing research field. Among the former, Exponential Random Graphs (ERGs) have gained increasing attention over the years. So far, only linear ERGs have been extensively employed to gain insight into the structural organisation of real-world complex networks. None, however, is capable of accounting for the variance of the empirical degree distribution. To this aim, non-linear ERGs must be considered. After showing that the usual mean-field approximation forces the degree-corrected version of the two-star model to degenerate, we define a fitness-induced variant of it. Such a `softened' model is capable of reproducing the sample variance, while retaining the explanatory power of its linear counterpart, within a purely canonical framework.</description>

      <title>Scaling and Population Loss in Mexican Urban Centres</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16110v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite its pervasive implications, many cities worldwide continue to expand in a fragmented, horizontal manner. We analyse urban growth dynamics in 69 Mexican metropolitan areas from 1990 to 2020 using census data, developing a model of urban form change based on population size, density, and spatial configuration. We employ a radial probability density function and the urban expansion factor to create a framework for comparing urban expansion over time and across different regions. Over the past three decades, Mexico's urban population has nearly doubled. However, populations have shifted outward, resulting in a decline of 2.5 million residents in central areas. Our analysis shows that distances from the city centre have increased by 28% on average, driven by population losses in central zones combined with growth in peripheral regions.</description>

      <title>Deep Generative Model for Human Mobility Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06473v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding and modeling human mobility is central to challenges in transport planning, sustainable urban design, and public health. Despite decades of effort, simulating individual mobility remains challenging because of its complex, context-dependent, and exploratory nature. Here, we advance a unified event-level formulation of daily mobility and propose MobilityGen to generate multi-attribute event sequences over days to weeks at large spatial scales. By linking behavioral attributes with environmental context, MobilityGen reproduces key patterns such as scaling laws for location visits, activity time allocation, and the coupled evolution of travel mode and destination choices. It reflects spatio-temporal variability and generates diverse and plausible mobility patterns consistent with the built environment. Beyond standard validation, MobilityGen enables analyses that have been difficult with earlier models, including how access to urban space varies across travel modes and how co-presence dynamics shape social exposure and segregation. Together, these results support an integrated, data-driven basis for fine-grained studies of human mobility behavior and its societal implications.</description>

      <title>The effect of role-based resource allocation on epidemic dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21226v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a coupled dynamical model of resource allocation and epidemic spread, inspired by the hierarchical structure of real-world therapeutic resource allocation. In this framework, network nodes are assigned distinct roles as either resource allocators or resource recipients. As the average number of links per recipient from allocators increases, the prevalence exhibits one of four distinct response patterns across conditions: monotonically increasing, monotonically decreasing, U-shaped trend, or a sudden decrease with large fluctuations. A mechanistic analysis uncovers three central insights: (i) a trade-off between efficient resource allocation and infection risk faced by allocators, (ii) the critical need to avoid resource redundancy when therapeutic efficiency is high, and (iii) the emergence of cascade-induced bistability in the coupled system.</description>

      <title>Competition between private and expressed opinions in binary choice: the $\alpha$-EPO $q$-voter model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18895v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: People often express opinions that differ from their privately held views, a phenomenon known in economy as preference falsification. Expressed-private opinion (EPO) models capture this by assigning each agent two dynamical variables: a private (internal) and an expressed (external) opinion. Within the nonlinear $q$-voter model, two EPO variants have been studied so far: with and without self-anticonformity. In both formulations, agents update private and expressed binary opinions, one after another and at the same rate, which has led to two update schemes studied previously: AT (act then think), in which an agent first updates its expressed and then its private opinion, and TA (think then act), in which the order is reversed. To eliminate this ad hoc distinction and quantify the interplay between private and expressed opinions, we introduce the $\alpha$-EPO $q$-voter model with asynchronous updating - in each elementary step, an agent updates its private opinion with probability $\alpha$ or its expressed opinion with complementary probability $1-\alpha$. We derive mean-field theory and, for the first time for EPO $q$-voter dynamics, a pair approximation, and validate them with Monte Carlo simulations on artificial and real organizational networks. Comparing the two model variants, we show that the collective outcome controlled by $\alpha$ strongly depends on self-anticonformity: with self-anticonformity the results are robust to $\alpha$, whereas without it $\alpha$ shifts the agreement-disagreement threshold and, for $q=3$, changes the phase transition from continuous to discontinuous. Based on these results, we briefly discuss implications for real societies that may be relevant to managers and policymakers.</description>

      <title>Why We Experience Society Differently: Intrinsic Dispositions as Drivers of Ideological Complexity in Adaptive Social Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07848v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the emergence of inequality in complex systems requires attention to both structural dynamics and intrinsic heterogeneity. In the context of opinion dynamics, traditional models relied on static snapshots or assumed homogeneous agent behavior, overlooking how diverse cognitive dispositions shape belief evolution. While some recent models introduce behavioral heterogeneity, they typically focus on macro-level patterns, neglecting the unequal and individualized dynamics that unfold at the agent level. In this study, we analyze an adaptive social network model where each agent exhibits one of three behavioral tendencies-homophily, neophily (attention to novelty), or social conformity-and measure the complexity of individual opinion trajectories using normalized Lempel-Ziv complexity. We find that the dynamics are often counterintuitive-homophilic agents, despite seeking similarity, become increasingly unpredictable; neophilic agents, despite pursuing novelty, exhibit constrained exploration; and conformic agents display a two-phase trajectory, transitioning from early stability to later unpredictability. Moreover, these patterns remain similar across diverse network settings, suggesting that internal behavioral dispositions - rather than external environment alone - play a central role in shaping long-term opinion unpredictability. The broader implication is that individuals' experiences of ideological volatility, uncertainty, or stability are not merely environmental, but may be endogenously self-structured through their own cognitive tendencies. These results establish a novel individual-level lens on opinion dynamics, where the behavioral identity of agents serves as a dynamical fingerprint in the evolution of belief systems, and gives rise to persistent disparities in dynamical experience within self-organizing social systems, even in structurally similar environments.</description>

      <title>Community detection in network using Szegedy quantum walk</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21152v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a network, the vertices with similar characteristics construct communities. The vertices in a community are well-connected. Detecting the communities in a network is a challenging and important problem in the theory of complex networks. One approach to solving this problem uses the classical random walks on graphs. In quantum computing, quantum walks are the quantum mechanical counterparts of classical random walks. In this article, we employ a variant of Szegedy's quantum walk to develop a procedure for discovering the communities in networks. The limiting probability distribution of quantum walks assists us in determining the inclusion of a vertex in a community. We apply our community detection procedure to a variety of graphs and social networks, including the relaxed caveman graph, $l$-partition graph, Karate club graph, and the dolphin's social network, among others.</description>
