      <title>On representations of the crystallization of the quantized function algebra C(SUq(n + 1))</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The crystallization C(SU0(n + 1)) of the q-family of C*-algebras C(SUq(n + 1)) was defined by Giri &amp; Pal for all n \geq 2 and they observed that any irreducible representation at the q = 0 level is the norm limit of irreducible representations of C(SUq(n + 1)) as q\to 0+. In this article, we will generalize this to any non-degenerate representation (respectively faithful) of C(SU0(n+1)). As a consequence, one can alternatively realize C(SU0(n+1)) as the C*-algebra generated by the limit operators of faithful representations of C(SUq(n+1)).</description>

      <title>Constructing equivalences between fusion categories of quantum groups and of vertex operator algebras via quantum gauge groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We summarize some results in our previous work on a problem that Sergio Doplicher posed in the 90s in the setting of conformal nets, and on a related problem posed by Yi-Zhi Huang in the setting of vertex operator algebras. The latter asks to find a direct construction of an equivalence due to Finkelberg between the quantum group modular fusion category at certain roots of unity and the fusion categories of affine vertex operator algebras at positive integer levels. The former asks for the construction of a quantum gauge group and field algebra for the category of localized endomorphisms of a conformal net, extending Doplicher-Roberts theory of the compact gauge group and field algebra in high dimensional AQFT. We mostly focus on the affine VOA aspects. We solve Huang's problem for all the Lie types for which it is known that the centralizer algebra of the truncated tensor powers of the given generating object V listed by Hans Wenzl in 1998 for the quantum group fusion categories is generated by the representation of braid group associated to the R-matrix and for Huang-Lepowsky ribbon braided tensor structure. In the classical type A, this property becomes the classical Schur-Weyl duality and was used by Doplicher and Roberts to construct SU(d) as a special case of their unique compact gauge group and field algebra in algebraic QFT. Presently, known results in the literature allow to construct the full equivalence for the Lie types A, B, C, D, G_2 and partial equivalence for braiding and associativity morphisms in the Lie types E and F. We also solve a question posed by Frenkel and Zhu in 1992 on the quantum group structure on the Zhu algebra for all Lie types. Our main tool is the construction of a quantum gauge group and a Drinfeld twist method. The structures we find in both contexts extend Doplicher-Roberts symmetric functors which played a central role in their duality theory.</description>

      <title>There Is An Equivalence Relation Whose von Neumann Algebra Is Not Connes Embeddable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MIP$^*$=RE [Ji+22] was used to prove the existence of a non Connes embeddable tracial von Neumann algebra. Recently, similar ideas were used in [Bow+24, BCV24] to give a negative solution to the Aldous-Lyons conjecture: there is a non co-sofic IRS on any non-abelian free group. We define a notion of hyperlinearity for an IRS and show that there is a non co-hyperlinear IRS on any non-abelian free group, which reproves the main results of [Bow+24, BCV24]. As a corollary, we prove that there is a relation whose von Neumann algebra is not Connes embeddable.</description>

      <title>Bratteli diagrams, translation flows and their $C^*$-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.01537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.01537v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In [LT16], Kathryn Lindsey and the second author constructed a translation surface from a bi-infinite Bratteli diagram. We continue an investigation into these surfaces. The construction given in [LT16] was essentially combinatorial. Here, we provide explicit links between the path space of the Bratteli diagram and the surface, including various intermediate topological spaces. This allows us to relate the $C^{*}$-algebras associated with tail equivalence on the Bratteli diagram and the foliation of the surface, under some mild hypotheses. This also allows us to relate the K-theory of the $C^{*}$-algebras involved. We also treat the case of finite genus surfaces in some detail, where the process of Rauzy-Veech induction (and its inverse) provide an explicit construction of the Bratteli diagrams involved.</description>

      <title>Injective envelopes of real C*- and AW*-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04137v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is shown that every outer *-automorphism of a real C*-algebra can be uniquely extended to an injective envelope of real C*-algebra. It is proven that if a real C*-algebra is a simple, then its injective envelope is also simple, and it is a real AW*-factor. The example of a real C*-algebra that is not real AW*-algebra and the injective envelope is a real AW*-factor of type III, which is not a real W*-algebra is constructed. This leads to the interesting result that up to isomorphism, the class of injective real (resp. complex) AW*-factors of type III is at least one larger than the class injective real (resp. complex) W*-factors of type III.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2001.03095v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the equivalence of VOA tensor categories and conformal net tensor categories for the following examples: all WZW models; all lattice VOAs; all unitary parafermion VOAs; type $ADE$ discrete series $W$-algebras; their tensor products; their regular cosets. A new proof of the complete rationality of conformal nets is also given.</description>
