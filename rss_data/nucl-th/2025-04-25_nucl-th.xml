      <title>Inclusive Neutrino and Antineutrino Scattering on the $^{12}$C Nucleus Within the Coherent Density Fluctuation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate quasielastic (anti)neutrino scattering on the $^{12}$C nucleus utilizing a novel scaling variable, $\psi^*$. This variable is derived from the interacting relativistic Fermi gas model, which incorporates both scalar and vector interactions, leading to a relativistic effective mass for the interacting nucleons. For inclusive lepton scattering from nuclei, we develop a new scaling function, denoted as $f^\text{QE}(\psi^*)$, based on the coherent density fluctuation model (CDFM). This model serves as a natural extension of the relativistic Fermi gas (RFG) model applicable to finite nuclei. In this study, we compute theoretical predictions and compare them with experimental data from Miner$\nu$a and T2K for inclusive (anti)neutrino cross-sections. The scaling function is derived within the CDFM framework, employing a relativistic effective mass of $m_N^*$ = 0.8 $m_N$. The findings demonstrate a high degree of consistency with experimental data across all (anti)neutrino energy ranges.</description>

      <title>Physics-Embedded Bayesian Neural Network (PE-BNN) to predict Energy Dependence of Fission Product Yields with Fine Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a physics-embedded Bayesian neural network (PE-BNN) framework that integrates fission product yields (FPYs) with prior nuclear physics knowledge to predict energy-dependent FPY data with fine structure. By incorporating an energy-independent phenomenological shell factor as a single input feature, the PE-BNN captures both fine structures and global energy trends. The combination of this physics-informed input with hyperparameter optimization via the Watanabe-Akaike Information Criterion (WAIC) significantly enhances predictive performance. Our results demonstrate that the PE-BNN framework is well-suited for target observables with systematic features that can be embedded as model inputs, achieving close agreement with known shell effects and prompt neutron multiplicities.</description>

      <title>Exploring the giant monopole resonance in superheavy nuclei: A theoretical perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the relativistic mean field framework, in an extended Thomas-Fermi approximation, we calculate the binding energy and charge distribution radius for the latest superheavy nuclei, synthesised in various laboratories, with atomic numbers $Z = 110-118$. The binding energy and radii are compared with the results obtained from relativistic Hartree calculations along with the experimental data, wherever available, to check the reliability of the methods. The calculations are extended to estimate the giant monopole resonances to understand the collective vibration of the nucleons for such superheavy nuclei. The giant monopole resonances obtained from scaling calculations are compared with the constraint computations. Furthermore, the results are compared with other known methods, such as the relativistic Random Phase Approximation (RPA) and time-dependent mean field calculations, along with some known lighter nuclei, specifically Zr isotopes (N = 42-86) and O isotopes (N = 10-36). Finally, the nuclear compressibility of the superheavy nuclei is predicted from the energy obtained in the breathing mode.</description>

      <title>Directed and elliptic flow of light nuclei and hypernuclei in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}=3$ GeV: Coalescence vs. Statistical Fragmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The harmonic flow coefficients of light nuclei and hypernuclei in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}=3$ GeV are investigated using the Ultra-relativistic Quantum Molecular Dynamics transport model. For the Equation-of-State we employ a density and momentum dependent potential from the Chiral-Mean-Field model. Light nuclei and hypernuclei production is described at kinetic freeze-out via a coalescence mechanism or with a statistical multi-fragmentation calculation. The directed flow $v_1$ of p, d, t, $^3$He, $^4$He as well as the $\Lambda$, $^3_\Lambda$H and $^4_\Lambda$H is shown to approximately scale with mass number $A$ of the light cluster in both calculations. This is in agreement with the experimental results for the directed flow measured by STAR. Predictions for the directed and elliptic flow of (hyper)nuclei at further RHIC-FXT and FAIR energies show that the scaling properties should improve as the beam energy is increased.</description>

      <title>Study of QCD critical point with three-nucleon correlations in light nuclei yields ratios using PYTHIA8/Angantyr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study utilizes the PYTHIA8 Angantyr model to systematically investigate the effects of three nucleons correlation $C_{n^2p}$ on the light nuclei yield ratio $N_tN_p/N_d^2$ in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 7.7, 11.5, 14.5, 19.6, 27, 39, 62.4, and 200 GeV. The analysis explores this property across different rapidity ranges, collision centralities, and collision energies, while also examining the roles of multi-parton interactions (MPI) and color reconnection (CR) mechanisms. The results show that the light nuclei yield ratio remains stable with changes in rapidity coverage and collision centrality but slightly increases with rising collision energy. The impact of CR on the light nuclei yield ratio depends entirely on the presence of MPI; when MPI is turned off, CR has no effect. Additionally, the three-nucleon correlation, enhances the light nuclei yield ratio in both central and peripheral collisions. However, the non-monotonic energy dependence observed in experiments, the peak at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = $20\sim30$ GeV reported by the STAR experiment, cannot be explained by the Angantyr model due to its lack of key mechanisms related to the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). Nevertheless, the Angantyr model serves as an important baseline for studying collision behaviors in the absence of QGP effects.</description>

      <title>Exact solutions for the moments of the binary collision integral and its relation to the relaxation-time approximation in leading-order anisotropic fluid dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the moments of the nonlinear binary collision integral in the ultrarelativistic hard-sphere approximation for an arbitrary anisotropic distribution function in the local rest frame. This anisotropic distribution function has an angular asymmetry controlled by the parameter of anisotropy $\xi$, such that in the limit of a vanishing anisotropy $\lim_{\xi \rightarrow 0} \hat{f}_{0 \mathbf{k}} = f_{0 \mathbf{k}}$, approaches the spherically symmetric local equilibrium distribution function. The corresponding moments of the binary collision integral are obtained in terms of quadratic products of different moments of the anisotropic distribution function and couple to a well defined set of lower-order moments. To illustrate these results we compare the moments of the binary collision integral to the moments of the widely used relaxation-time approximation of Anderson and Witting in case of a spheroidal distribution function. We found that in an expanding system the nonlinear Boltzmann collision term leads to twice slower equilibration than the relaxation-time approximation. Furthermore we also show that including two dynamical moments helps to resolve the ambiguity which additional moment of the Boltzmann equation to choose to close the conservation laws.</description>

      <title>Baryon Number Violation: From Nuclear Matrix Elements to BSM Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Processes that violate baryon number, most notably proton decay and $n\bar n$ transitions, are promising probes of physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM) needed to understand the lack of antimatter in the Universe. To interpret current and forthcoming experimental limits, theory input from nuclear matrix elements to UV complete models enters. Thus, an interplay of experiment, effective field theory, lattice QCD, and BSM model building is required to develop strategies to accurately extract information from current and future data and maximize the impact and sensitivity of next-generation experiments. Here, we briefly summarize the main results and discussions from the workshop "INT-25-91W: Baryon Number Violation: From Nuclear Matrix Elements to BSM Physics," held at the Institute for Nuclear Theory, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, January 13-17, 2025.</description>

      <title>Charge radii measurements of exotic tin isotopes in the proximity of $N=50$ and $N=82$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report nuclear charge radii for the isotopes $^{104-134}$Sn, measured using two different collinear laser spectroscopy techniques at ISOLDE-CERN. These measurements clarify the archlike trend in charge radii along the isotopic chain and reveal an odd-even staggering that is more pronounced near the $N=50$ and $N=82$ shell closures. The observed local trends are well described by both nuclear density functional theory and valence space in-medium similarity renormalization group calculations. Both theories predict appreciable contributions from beyond-mean-field correlations to the charge radii of the neutron-deficient tin isotopes. The models fall short, however, of reproducing the magnitude of the known $B(E2)$ transition probabilities, highlighting the remaining challenges in achieving a unified description of both ground-state properties and collective phenomena.</description>

      <title>Gaussian generally covariant hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a version of fluctuating relativistic hydrodynamics in a way very different from the usual derivation: Instead of treating it as a coarse-grained deterministic theory expanded in gradients of equilibrium quantities, we treat it as a stochastic theory, characterized by partition functions in each cells, expanded in cumulants. We show that the Gaussian ansatz allows us, via the gravitational Ward identities acting as a constraint between the variance and the average, to maintain full general covariance, with hydrodynamic flow emerging as an approximate Killing vector. If the symmetry of relativistic hydrodynamics, volume-preserving diffeomorphisms, is preserved, we show that linear response formulae are also generally covariant. We discuss our results and argue that in this approach, the applicability of the effective theory is parametrized around a very different quantity than the Knudsen number, offering hope of understanding the applicability of hydrodynamics to small systems.</description>

      <title>CoMBolt-ITA, a Collective Model via relativistic Boltzmann equation in Isotropization Time Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new (2+1)-model is developed to investigate the collective behavior of the quark-gluon plasma produced in high-energy heavy-ion collisions. This framework couples pre-equilibrium dynamics with hydrodynamic evolution by solving the Boltzmann equation within the isotropization time approximation. A numerical scheme based on the method of characteristics enables the evolution to begin from a specified initial Boltzmann distribution. In this work, the spatial structure of the initial distribution is modeled using the TrENTo framework. Our results show that a medium initialized at $\tau_0 $ in the order of 1\,[fm/$c$] with a small shear viscosity to entropy density ratio ($\eta/s = 0.008$) evolves consistently with hydrodynamic simulations, such as those performed using the VISH2+1 code, while discrepancies arise for a medium with $\eta/s = 0.8$. Furthermore, when initialized with a highly anisotropic momentum distribution in the longitudinal direction at early times, the system exhibits spatially non-uniform thermalization in the transverse plane, leading to the emergence of a nontrivial hypersurface that marks the onset of hydrodynamic applicability.</description>

      <title>Flux tube clustering from magnetic coupling of adjacent type-I and -II superconductors in a neutron star: persistent gravitational radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adjacent type-I and -II proton superconductors in a rotation-powered pulsar are predicted to exist in a metastable state containing macroscopic and quantized flux tubes, respectively. Previous studies show that the type-I and -II regions are coupled magnetically, when macroscopic flux tubes divide dendritically into quantized flux tubes near the type-I-II interface, through a process known as flux branching. The studies assume that the normal-superconducting boundary is sharp, and the quantized flux tubes do not repel mutually. Here the sharp-interface approximation is refined by accounting for magnetic repulsion. It is found that flux tubes in the same flux tree cluster with a minimum-energy separation two to seven times less than that of isolated flux tubes. Neutron vortices pin and cluster about flux trees. We find that the maximum characteristic wave strain $h_0$ of the current quadrupole gravitational radiation emitted by a rectilinear array of clustered vortices exceeds by $(1+N_{\rm v,t})^{1/2}$ the strain $h_0 \sim 10^{-32}(f/30 {\rm Hz})^{5/2} (D/1 {\rm kpc})^{-1}$ emitted by uniformly distributed vortices, where $N_{\rm v,t}$ is the mean number of pinned vortices per flux tree, $f$ is the star's spin frequency, and $D$ is the star's distance from Earth. The factor $(1 + N_{\rm v,t})^{1/2}$ brings $h_0$ close to the sensitivity limit of the current generation of interferometric gravitational wave detectors under certain circumstances, specifically when flux branching forms relatively few (and hence relatively large) flux trees.</description>

      <title>In-Medium Similarity Renormalization Group at Finite Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00576v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of nuclei at finite temperature is of immense interest for many areas of nuclear astrophysics and nuclear-reaction science. A variety of ab initio methods are now available for computing the properties of nuclei from interactions rooted in Quantum Chromodynamics, but applications have largely been limited to zero temperature. In the present work, we extend one such method, the In-Medium Similarity Renormalization Group (IMSRG), to finite temperature. Using an exactly-solvable schematic model that captures essential features of nuclear interactions, we show that the FT-IMSRG can accurately determine the energetics of nuclei at finite temperature, and we explore the accuracy of the FT-IMSRG in different parameter regimes, e.g., strong and weak pairing. In anticipation of FT-IMSRG applications for finite nuclei and infinite matter, we discuss differences arising from the choice of working with the canonical and the grand canonical ensembles. In future work, we will apply the FT-IMSRG with realistic nuclear interactions to compute nuclear structure and reaction properties at finite temperature, which are important ingredients for understanding nucleosynthesis in stellar environments, or modeling reactions of hot compound nuclei.</description>

      <title>Improving the predictive power of empirical shell-model Hamiltonians</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09917v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present two developments which enhance the predictive power of empirical shell-model Hamiltonians for cases in which calibration data are sparse. A recent improvement in the ab initio derivation of effective Hamiltonians leads to a much better starting point for the optimization procedure. In addition, we introduce a protocol to avoid overfitting, enabling a more reliable extrapolation beyond available data. These developments will enable more robust predictions for exotic isotopes produced at rare isotope beam facilities and in astrophysical environments.</description>

Abstract: The chiral crossover of QCD at finite temperature and vanishing baryon density turns into a second order phase transition if lighter than physical quark masses are considered. If this transition occurs sufficiently close to the physical point, its universal critical behaviour would largely control the physics of the QCD phase transition. We quantify the size of this region in QCD using functional approaches, both Dyson-Schwinger equations and the functional renormalisation group. The latter allows us to study both critical and non-critical effects on equal footing, facilitating a precise determination of the scaling regime. We find that the physical point is far away from the critical region. Importantly, we show that the physics of the chiral crossover is dominated by soft modes even far beyond the critical region. While scaling functions determine all thermodynamic properties of the system in the critical region, the order parameter potential is the relevant quantity away from it. We compute this potential in QCD using the functional renormalisation group and Dyson-Schwinger equations and provide a simple parametrisation for phenomenological applications.</description>

      <title>Associated jet + electroweak gauge boson production in hadronic collisions at forward rapidities in the color-dipole $S$-matrix framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12675v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The cross-section for the associated production of a jet with an electroweak gauge boson ($G = W^{\pm}, Z^0, \gamma$) at forward rapidities in $pp$ and $pA$ collisions is derived within the color - dipole $S$ - matrix framework. We present the full expressions for the differential cross-section of the $q p \rightarrow G q X$ process in the transverse momentum space, considering the longitudinal and transverse polarizations of the gauge boson. We demonstrate that the final formulae can be expressed in terms of the unintegrated gluon distribution and reproduce previous results for the associated jet + $\gamma$ and jet + $Z^0$ production, derived using other frameworks. Moreover, we derive the back - to - back correlation limit of the spectra and show that it can be expressed in terms of the unpolarized and linearly polarized transverse momentum gluon distributions. Our results improve the description of the inclusive jet plus color neutral particle production at forward rapidities, not far from the proton fragmentation region, in $pp$ or $pA$ collisions, and are the main ingredient to study the impact of nonlinear QCD effects in two - particle correlations.</description>

      <title>Masquerading hybrid stars with dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05207v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of dark matter on hybrid stars. Using a two-fluid approach, where normal and dark matter components interact only gravitationally, we explore how dark matter can trigger the appearance of quark matter in neutron stars for unprecedented low masses. Our findings reveal that dark matter increases the central pressure of neutron stars, potentially leading to the formation of hybrid stars with quark cores even at very low compact star masses. The critical mass for the appearance of quark matter decreases with increasing dark matter content. We introduce the concept of "masquerading hybrid stars", where dark matter admixed stars exhibit similar mass-radius relations to purely hadronic stars, making it challenging to distinguish between them based solely on these parameters. Additionally, we identify a unique class of objects termed "dark oysters", characterized by a large dark matter halo and a small normal matter core, highlighting the diverse structural possibilities for compact stars influenced by dark matter.</description>

      <title>Chiral symmetry restoration in QC_2D from effective model using the functional renormalization group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10134v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The order of the chiral phase transition in two-color and two-flavor QC$_2$D is investigated using the functional renormalization group (FRG) technique in an effective model setting. We calculate the $\beta$ function of all couplings in the dimensionally reduced Ginzburg-Landau free energy functional with Pauli-G\"ursey SU(4) symmetry. We compare results of the perturbative $\epsilon$ expansion approach with those obtained via the FRG, evaluated directly in $d=3$ dimensions. The perturbative results suggest that the fixed-point structure is more intricate than that of three-color QCD, a conclusion further supported by the FRG analysis. Both methods display an infrared stable $O(6)$ fixed point at infinite axial anomaly; however, the FRG approach also reveals the existence of $U_A(1)$ anomaly-free fixed points, which can become infrared stable if the anomaly in the underlying theory vanishes at the critical temperature. These findings imply that the phase transition can be of second order, consistent with earlier findings for three colors.</description>
