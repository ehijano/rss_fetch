      <title>Coherent matter wave emission from an atomtronic transistor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The atomtronic matter-wave triple-well transistor is theoretically predicted to exhibit current gain and act as a coherent matter-wave emitter. In this work, we investigate the dynamics of an atomtronic transistor composed of a triple-well potential -- source, gate, and drain -- modeled by the time-dependent Gross-Pitaevskii equation. We systematically explore the dependence of the drain population and the current on the source bias potential and the strength of the interatomic interaction. Our simulations reveal signatures of resonant tunneling when the source chemical potential aligns with discrete energy levels in the gate well, leading to coherent matter-wave emission in the drain. Contrary to previous many-body studies that predicted interaction-induced current gain via coupling to gate well modes, our results suggest that coherence in the drain is primarily governed by single-particle resonances, with no evident broadening from nonlinear coupling.</description>

      <title>Roton-mediated soliton bound states in binary dipolar condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the formation of bound states between dark-antidark solitary waves in two-component dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates. The excitation spectrum contains density and spin branches, and a rotonic feature of the spin branch enables long-range soliton interactions, giving rise to multiple bound states for a single pair, each with a distinct separation. We show that these bound states originate from periodic modulations of the inter-soliton potential, while individual solitons are surrounded by spatial spin-density oscillations. Both features provide direct signatures of the spin roton. Collisions between unbound solitons probe this potential, with dipolar interactions enforcing universal bouncing at low velocities, independent of soliton sign, whereas nondipolar solitons may either transmit or bounce. This distinct behavior offers a realistic path to confirming spin rotons experimentally.</description>

      <title>Right-eigenstate-based approach to non-Hermitian superfluidity with two-body loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically explore a non-Hermitian superfluid model with complex-valued interaction, inspired by two-body loss stemming from inelastic scattering observed in ultracold atomic experiments. Utilizing both the right-eigenstate-based mean-field theory and its biorthogonal counterpart, we study the properties of the system. Notably, the right-eigenstate-based framework produces smooth and continuous solutions, in stark contrast to the absence of nontrivial solutions and the abrupt discontinuities observed in the biorthogonal-eigenstate-based framework under moderate dissipation. In addition, the lower condensation energy obtained in the former framework suggests its superior suitability for describing this system. Furthermore, we explore the impact of backscattering, a crucial factor in realistic systems. Our analysis reveals that, facilitated by two-body loss, even moderate backscattering destabilizes the superfluid state. Sufficiently strong backscattering completely destroys it, highlighting a key mechanism for the fragility of this non-Hermitian quantum phase.</description>

      <title>Symmetry of Dipolar Molecular Gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experiments with degenerate molecular gases dressed by elliptically polarized microwave fields have opened new avenues for engineering dipolar interactions. We identify a set of symmetries of the interaction potential, which generate degeneracies among the interaction parameters, and use these to classify the resulting spatial symmetries and equilibrium shapes of the gases. Exploiting these symmetries we analyze solutions including beyond-meanfield quantum fluctuations, and develop complementary variational results. We then map out the phase diagram of self-bound droplets and characterize their key properties.</description>

      <title>A century of the Bose-Einstein condensation concept and half a century of the JINR experiments for observation of condensate in the superfluid 4He (He II)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This short review is devoted to celebration of two major events in quantum physics. The first one is the birth of the concept of Bose-Einstein condensation (1925) and the second is the experimental proof that it does exist and appears in the liquid 4He simultaneously with superfluidity below the $\lambda$-point (1975). The both of these events are tightly related to the Bogoliubov theory of superfluidity (1947). The existence of condensate in the system of interacting bosons is the key ansatz of this theory. Therefore, the experiments started in JINR in 1975 confirmed this prediction of the Bogoliubov theory that superfluidity of the liquid 4He (He II) should emerge at the same time as the Bose-Einstein condensation.</description>

      <title>Turning Down the Noise: Power-Law Decay and Temporal Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We determine the late-time dynamics of a generic spin ensemble with inhomogeneous broadening - equivalently, qubits with arbitrary Zeeman splittings - coupled to a dissipative environment with strength decreasing as $1/t$. The approach to the steady state follows a power law, reflecting the interplay between Hamiltonian dynamics and vanishing dissipation. The decay exponents vary non-analytically with the ramp rate, exhibiting a cusp singularity, and $n$-point correlation functions factorize into one- and two-point contributions. Our exact solution anchors a universality class of open quantum systems with explicitly time-dependent dissipation.</description>

      <title>Higher symmetry breaking and non-reciprocity in a driven-dissipative Dicke model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Higher symmetries in interacting many-body systems often give rise to new phases and unexpected dynamical behavior. Here, we theoretically investigate a variant of the Dicke model with higher-order discrete symmetry, resulting from complex-valued coupling coefficients between quantum emitters and a bosonic mode. We propose a driven-dissipative realization of this model focusing on optomechanical response of a driven atom tweezer array comprised of $n$ sub-ensembles and placed within an optical cavity, with the phase of the driving field advancing stepwise between sub-ensembles. Examining stationary points and their dynamical stability, we identify a phase diagram for $n\geq 3$ with three distinctive features: a $\mathbb{Z}_n$ ($\mathbb{Z}_{2n}$) symmetry-breaking superradiant phase for even (odd) $n$, a normal unbroken-symmetry phase that is dynamically unstable due to non-reciprocal forces between emitters, and a first-order phase transition separating these phases. This $n$-phase Dicke model may be equivalently realized in a variety of optomechanical or opto-magnonic settings, where it can serve as a testbed for studying high-order symmetry breaking and non-reciprocal interactions in open systems.</description>

      <title>Atomtronic routing of dipolar bosons in a four-well star potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to precisely control and predict the evolution of quantum states is a fundamental requirement for advancing quantum technologies. Here, we develop tunable atomic routing protocols based on an integrable model of dipolar bosons confined in a four-well potential with a star-shaped configuration. By adjusting the system parameters, we identify a harmonic dynamical regime of the atomic population that can be treated analytically, providing a complete description of the system's behaviour for precise manipulation. We demonstrate three independent modes of control over the atomic population dynamics under the action of an external field: frequency tuning via variation in the field intensity, directional switching via spatial displacement of the field, and amplitude modulation by varying its duration. These modes operate under two distinct configurations: one source and two drains, and, in reverse order, two sources and one drain. These cases emulate an atomic 1:2 demultiplexer and 2:1 multiplexer, respectively. Our results may contribute to the development of control mechanisms in the design of quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Collective modes of two-species Bose-Einstein condensates in a Josephson junction barrier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19135v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ultracold atoms are an ideal platform to implement atomtronics and Josephson junctions analogous to superconducting circuits. The collective modes of a Bose gas split by a potential barrier have been known. However, the role of barriers on the collective excitation spectra of ultracold atomic mixtures has not been examined. Here, we examine the low-lying collective modes of (an)harmonically trapped quasi-one-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensates in a Josephson barrier by employing the variational approach and Bogoliubov theory. We first show that the anharmonicity of the external potential leads to an increase in the critical barrier strength of mode softening in a single-species condensate. The Josephson barrier drives the softening of in-phase and out-of-phase dipole modes of two-species Bose-Einstein condensates, and consequently leads to two additional zero-energy Goldstone modes in the miscible phase, in agreement with the variational approach. Furthermore, the sandwich immiscible state results in an additional Goldstone mode due to the barrier, in contrast to the spatially symmetry-broken side-by-side profile. Our results unveil the distinct collective response of the Josephson barrier in binary mixtures owing to interspecies atomic correlations.</description>

      <title>Chiral supersolid and dissipative time crystal in Rydberg-dressed Bose-Einstein condensates with Raman-induced spin-orbit coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06555v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is one of the crucial factors that affect the chiral symmetry of matter by causing the spatial symmetry breaking of the system. We find that Raman-induced SOC can induce a chiral supersolid phase with a helical antiskyrmion lattice in balanced Rydberg-dressed two-component Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) in a harmonic trap by modulating the Raman coupling strength. This is in stark contrast to the mirror symmetric supersolid phase containing skyrmion-antiskyrmion lattice pair for the case of Rashba SOC. Two ground-state phase diagrams are presented as a function of the Rydberg interaction and the Raman-induced SOC. It is shown that the interplay among Raman-induced SOC, Rydberg interactions, and nonlinear contact interactions favors rich ground-state structures, including half-quantum vortex phase, stripe supersolid phase, toroidal stripe phase with a central Anderson-Toulouse coreless vortex, checkerboard supersolid phase, mirror symmetric supersolid phase, chiral supersolid phase and standing-wave supersolid phase. In addition, the effects of rotation and in-plane quadrupole magnetic field on the ground state of the system are analyzed. In these two cases, the chiral supersolid phase is broken and the ground state tends to form a miscible phase. Furthermore, we demonstrate that when the initial state is a chiral supersolid phase the rotating harmonic trapped system sustains dissipative continuous time crystal by studying the rotational dynamic behaviors of the system.</description>

      <title>Interaction effects on electronic Floquet spectra: Excitonic effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07428v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Floquet engineering of electronic states by light is a central topic in modern experiments. However, the impact of many-body interactions on the single-electron properties remains unclear in this non-equilibrium situation. We propose that interaction effects could be reasonably understood by performing perturbative expansion in both the pump field and the electron-electron interaction when computing physical quantities. As an example, we apply this approach to semiconductors and show analytically that excitonic effects, i.e., effects of electron-hole interaction, lead to dramatic corrections to the single-electron Floquet spectra even when the excitons are only virtually excited by the pump light. We compute these effects in phosphorene and monolayer MoS$_2$ for time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and ultrafast optical experiments.</description>
