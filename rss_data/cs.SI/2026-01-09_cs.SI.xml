      <title>Using Grok to Avoid Personal Attacks While Correcting Misinformation on X</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Correcting misinformation in public online spaces often exposes users to hostility and ad hominem attacks, discouraging participation in corrective discourse. This study presents empirical evidence that invoking Grok, the native large language model on X, rather than directly confronting other users, is associated with different social responses during misinformation correction. Using an observational design, 100 correction replies across five high-conflict misinformation topics were analyzed, with corrections balanced between Grok-mediated and direct human-issued responses. The primary outcome was whether a correction received at least one ad hominem attack within a 24-hour window. Ad hominem attacks occurred in 72 percent of human-issued corrections and in none of the Grok-mediated corrections. A chi-square test confirmed a statistically significant association with a large effect size. These findings suggest that AI-mediated correction may alter the social dynamics of public disagreement by reducing interpersonal hostility during misinformation responses.</description>

      <title>Paper Skygest: Personalized Academic Recommendations on Bluesky</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We build, deploy, and evaluate Paper Skygest, a custom personalized social feed for scientific content posted by a user's network on Bluesky and the AT Protocol. We leverage a new capability on emerging decentralized social media platforms: the ability for anyone to build and deploy feeds for other users, to use just as they would a native platform-built feed. To our knowledge, Paper Skygest is the first and largest such continuously deployed personalized social media feed by academics, with over 50,000 weekly uses by over 1,000 daily active users, all organically acquired. First, we quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate Paper Skygest usage, showing that it has sustained usage and satisfies users; we further show adoption of Paper Skygest increases a user's interactions with posts about research, and how interaction rates change as a function of post order. Second, we share our full code and describe our system architecture, to support other academics in building and deploying such feeds sustainably. Third, we overview the potential of custom feeds such as Paper Skygest for studying algorithm designs, building for user agency, and running recommender system experiments with organic users without partnering with a centralized platform.</description>

      <title>IGA-LWP: An Iterative Gradient-based Adversarial Attack for Link Weight Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Link weight prediction extends classical link prediction by estimating the strength of interactions rather than merely their existence, and it underpins a wide range of applications such as traffic engineering, social recommendation, and scientific collaboration analysis. However, the robustness of link weight prediction against adversarial perturbations remains largely unexplored.In this paper, we formalize the link weight prediction attack problem as an optimization task that aims to maximize the prediction error on a set of target links by adversarially manipulating the weight values of a limited number of links. Based on this formulation, we propose an iterative gradient-based attack framework for link weight prediction, termed IGA-LWP. By employing a self-attention-enhanced graph autoencoder as a surrogate predictor, IGA-LWP leverages backpropagated gradients to iteratively identify and perturb a small subset of links. Extensive experiments on four real-world weighted networks demonstrate that IGA-LWP significantly degrades prediction accuracy on target links compared with baseline methods. Moreover, the adversarial networks generated by IGA-LWP exhibit strong transferability across several representative link weight prediction models. These findings expose a fundamental vulnerability in weighted network inference and highlight the need for developing robust link weight prediction methods.</description>

      <title>Graph Integrated Transformers for Community Detection in Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Community detection is crucial for applications like targeted marketing and recommendation systems. Traditional methods rely on network structure, and embedding-based models integrate semantic information. However, there is a challenge when a model leverages local and global information from complex structures like social networks. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Transformers have shown superior performance in capturing local and global relationships. In this paper, We propose Graph Integrated Transformer for Community Detection (GIT-CD), a hybrid model combining GNNs and Transformer-based attention mechanisms to enhance community detection in social networks. Specifically, the GNN module captures local graph structures, while the Transformer module models long-range dependencies. A self-optimizing clustering module refines community assignments using K-Means, silhouette loss, and KL divergence minimization. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that GIT-CD outperforms state-of-the-art models, making it a robust approach for detecting meaningful communities in complex social networks.</description>

      <title>Graph energy as a measure of community detectability in networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key challenge in network science is the detection of communities, which are sets of nodes in a network that are densely connected internally but sparsely connected to the rest of the network. A fundamental result in community detection is the existence of a nontrivial threshold for community detectability on sparse graphs that are generated by the planted partition model (PPM). Below this so-called ``detectability limit'', no community-detection method can perform better than random chance. Spectral methods for community detection fail before this detectability limit because the eigenvalues corresponding to the eigenvectors that are relevant for community detection can be absorbed by the bulk of the spectrum. One can bypass the detectability problem by using special matrices, like the non-backtracking matrix, but this requires one to consider higher-dimensional matrices. In this paper, we show that the difference in graph energy between a PPM and an Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi (ER) network has a distinct transition at the detectability threshold even for the adjacency matrices of the underlying networks. The graph energy is based on the full spectrum of an adjacency matrix, so our result suggests that standard graph matrices still allow one to separate the parameter regions with detectable and undetectable communities.</description>

      <title>Why Are Some Countries More Politically Fragmented Online Than Others?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online political divisions, such as fragmentation or polarization, are a growing global concern that can foster radicalization and hinder democratic cooperation; however, not all divisions are detrimental, some reflect pluralism and healthy diversity of opinion in a democracy. While prior research has predominantly focused on polarization in the United States, there remains a limited body of research on political divides in multiparty systems, and no universal method for comparing fragmentation across countries. Moreover, cross-country comparison is rare. This study first develops a novel measure of structural political fragmentation built on multi-scale community detection and the effective branching factor. Using a dataset of 18,325 political influencers from Brazil, Spain, and the United States, we assess online fragmentation in their Twitter/X co-following networks. We compare the fragmentation of the three countries, as well as the ideological groups within each. We further investigate factors associated with the level of fragmentation in each country. We find that political fragmentation differs across countries and is asymmetric between ideological groups. Brazil is the most fragmented, with higher fragmentation among the left-wing group, while Spain and the United States exhibit similar overall levels, with the left more fragmented in Spain and the right more fragmented in the United States. Additionally, we find that social identity plays a central role in political fragmentation. A strong alignment between ideological and social identities, with minimal overlap between ideologies, tends to promote greater integration and reduce fragmentation. Our findings provide explanations for cross-national and ideological differences in political fragmentation.</description>

      <title>Ideology as a Problem: Lightweight Logit Steering for Annotator-Specific Alignment in Social Media Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: LLMs internally organize political ideology along low-dimensional structures that are partially, but not fully aligned with human ideological space. This misalignment is systematic, model specific, and measurable. We introduce a lightweight linear probe that both quantifies the misalignment and minimally corrects the output layer. This paper introduces a simple and efficient method for aligning models with specific user opinions. Instead of retraining the model, we calculated a bias score from its internal features and directly adjusted the final output probabilities. This solution is practical and low-cost and preserves the original reasoning power of the model.</description>

      <title>Beyond the "Truth": Investigating Election Rumors on Truth Social During the 2024 Election</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer unprecedented opportunities for analyzing social phenomena at scale. This paper demonstrates the value of LLMs in psychological measurement by (1) compiling the first large-scale dataset of election rumors on a niche alt-tech platform, (2) developing a multistage Rumor Detection Agent that leverages LLMs for high-precision content classification, and (3) quantifying the psychological dynamics of rumor propagation, specifically the "illusory truth effect" in a naturalistic setting. The Rumor Detection Agent combines (i) a synthetic data-augmented, fine-tuned RoBERTa classifier, (ii) precision keyword filtering, and (iii) a two-pass LLM verification pipeline using GPT-4o mini. The findings reveal that sharing probability rises steadily with each additional exposure, providing large-scale empirical evidence for dose-response belief reinforcement in ideologically homogeneous networks. Simulation results further demonstrate rapid contagion effects: nearly one quarter of users become "infected" within just four propagation iterations. Taken together, these results illustrate how LLMs can transform psychological science by enabling the rigorous measurement of belief dynamics and misinformation spread in massive, real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>LGTD: Local-Global Trend Decomposition for Season-Length-Free Time Series Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time series decomposition into trend, seasonal structure, and residual components is a core primitive for downstream analytics such as anomaly detection, change-point detection, and forecasting. However, most existing seasonal-trend decomposition methods rely on user-specified or estimated season lengths and implicitly assume stable periodic structure. These assumptions limit robustness and deployability in large, heterogeneous collections where recurring patterns may drift, appear intermittently, or exist at multiple time scales.
  We propose LGTD (Local-Global Trend Decomposition), a season-length-free decomposition framework that represents a time series as the sum of a smooth global trend, adaptive local trends whose recurrence induces implicit (emergent) seasonal structure, and a residual component. Rather than explicitly modeling seasonality through a fixed or estimated period, LGTD treats seasonal structure as an emergent property arising from repeated local trend regimes. Concretely, LGTD first estimates a global trend capturing long-term evolution, then applies AutoTrend, an adaptive error-driven local linear trend inference module, to segment the detrended signal into short-lived piecewise-linear regimes. Residuals are obtained after removing both global and local trends.
  By eliminating manual season-length specification, LGTD supports automated, low-touch deployment across time series with irregular, drifting, or weakly periodic structure. We analyze computational complexity and show that LGTD scales linearly with series length under mild conditions. Experiments on synthetic benchmarks demonstrate robust and balanced decomposition performance across fixed, transitive, and variable season-length settings, especially where period-based methods degrade.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Information Diffusion Beyond Explicit Social Ties: A Study of Implicit-Link Diffusion on Twitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08354v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Information diffusion on social media platforms is often assumed to occur primarily through explicit social connections, such as follower or friend ties. However, information frequently propagates beyond these observable ties -- through external websites, search engines, or algorithmic recommendations -- creating implicit links. How the presence of implicit links affects the diffusion process remains unclear. In this study, we investigate the characteristics of implicit links on Twitter using four large-scale datasets. Our analysis reveals that users who are farther from the original source in the social network are more likely to engage in diffusion via implicit links. Although implicit links contribute less to the overall diffusion volume than explicit links, they play a distinct role in disseminating content across diverse and topologically distant communities. We further examine the user attributes associated with the formation of implicit links and show that these features are unevenly distributed across the network and exhibit moderate levels of homophily and monophily. Together, these findings demonstrate that implicit links exert a meaningful influence on information diffusion and highlight the importance of incorporating them into models of diffusion and social influence.</description>

Abstract: We revisit the classical friendship paradox which states that on an average ones friends have at least as many friends as oneself and generalize it to a variety of network centrality indices. For a broad class of spectral centralities on connected undirected graphs degree, eigenvector centrality, walk counts, Katz centrality and PageRank, we show that the average centrality of a nodes neighbours always exceeds the global average centrality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17652v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been well-known that many real networks are scale-free (SF) but extremely vulnerable against attacks. We investigate the robustness of connectivity and the lengths of the shortest loops in randomized SF networks with realistic exponents $2.0 &lt; \gamma \leq 4.0$. We show that smaller variance of degree distributions leads to stronger robustness and longer average length of the shortest loops, which means the existing of large holes. These results will provide important insights toward enhancing the robustness by changing degree distributions.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Crowd: LLM-Augmented Community Notes for Governing Health Misinformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11423v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Community Notes, the crowd-sourced misinformation governance system on X (formerly Twitter), allows users to flag misleading posts, attach contextual notes, and rate the notes' helpfulness. However, our empirical analysis of 30.8K health-related notes reveals substantial latency, with a median delay of 17.6 hours before notes receive a helpfulness status. To improve responsiveness during real-world misinformation surges, we propose CrowdNotes+, a unified LLM-based framework that augments Community Notes for faster and more reliable health misinformation governance. CrowdNotes+ integrates two modes: (1) evidence-grounded note augmentation and (2) utility-guided note automation, supported by a hierarchical three-stage evaluation of relevance, correctness, and helpfulness. We instantiate the framework with HealthNotes, a benchmark of 1.2K health notes annotated for helpfulness, and a fine-tuned helpfulness judge. Our analysis first uncovers a key loophole in current crowd-sourced governance: voters frequently conflate stylistic fluency with factual accuracy. Addressing this via our hierarchical evaluation, experiments across 15 representative LLMs demonstrate that CrowdNotes+ significantly outperforms human contributors in note correctness, helpfulness, and evidence utility.</description>

      <title>GRAPHGINI: Fostering Individual and Group Fairness in Graph Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12937v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated impressive performance across various tasks, leading to their increased adoption in high-stakes decision-making systems. However, concerns have arisen about GNNs potentially generating unfair decisions for underprivileged groups or individuals when lacking fairness constraints. This work addresses this issue by introducing GraphGini, a novel approach that incorporates the Gini coefficient to enhance both individual and group fairness within the GNN framework. We rigorously establish that the Gini coefficient offers greater robustness and promotes equal opportunity among GNN outcomes, advantages not afforded by the prevailing Lipschitz constant methodology. Additionally, we employ the Nash social welfare program to ensure our solution yields a Pareto optimal distribution of group fairness. Extensive experimentation on real-world datasets demonstrates GraphGini's efficacy in significantly improving individual fairness compared to state-of-the-art methods while maintaining utility and group fairness.</description>

      <title>Estimation of partial rankings from sparse, noisy comparisons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02505v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ranking items based on pairwise comparisons is common, from using match outcomes to rank sports teams to using purchase or survey data to rank consumer products. Statistical inference-based methods such as the Bradley-Terry model, which extract rankings based on an underlying generative model, have emerged as flexible and powerful tools to tackle ranking in empirical data. In situations with limited and/or noisy comparisons, it is often challenging to confidently distinguish the performance of different items based on the evidence available in the data. However, most inference-based ranking methods choose to assign each item to a unique rank or score, suggesting a meaningful distinction when there is none. Here, we develop a principled nonparametric Bayesian method, adaptable to any statistical ranking method, for learning partial rankings (rankings with ties) that distinguishes among the ranks of different items only when there is sufficient evidence available in the data. We develop a fast agglomerative algorithm to perform Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) inference of partial rankings under our framework and examine the performance of our method on a variety of real and synthetic network datasets, finding that it frequently gives a more parsimonious summary of the data than traditional ranking, particularly when observations are sparse.</description>
