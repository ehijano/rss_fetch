      <title>Seamlessly joining length scales: From atomistic thermal graphs to anisotropic continuum conductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal transport in complex solids is governed by local structure, defects, and anisotropy, yet most continuum models still rely on oversimplified, homogenized conductivities. Here, we bridge atomistic and continuum descriptions by building finite element (FE) models directly from the site-projected thermal conductivity (SPTC), an atomic-level decomposition of the Green-Kubo thermal conductivity. We introduce a new toolkit, the Simulator Collection for Atomic-to-Continuum Scales (SCACS), which uses a graph neural network to predict SPTC on large atomic structures, coarse-grain these fields into anisotropic conductivity tensors, and embeds them into the heat-flow FE equation with a customized, anisotropy-aware adaptive mesh refinement scheme. Applied to silicon nanostructures, the resulting FE models act as representative volume elements, reproduce bulk conductivities, and capture interfacial and defect-driven anisotropy while maintaining thermodynamic consistency. Additionally, SCACS predicts experimental conductance trends and fields. This innovation demonstrates a novel and general route for transferring atomistic transport information into device-scale thermal simulations with physics-based approximations.</description>

      <title>Mimicking the earth core conditions with ultrafast laser materials interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrafast lasers create extreme, non-equilibrium thermodynamic conditions that can transiently reach pressures and temperatures comparable to interior core of the earth. Here we show that femtosecond excitation of amorphous silica-hafnia multilayer dielectrics drives the formation of high-pressure crystalline phases of silica including stishovite, seifertite, and the pyrite-type high density structure, within confined subsurface regions.Using TEM, SAED, and 4D-STEM, we directly map nanoscale phase evolution and identify crystalline motifs embedded inside laser generated blisters.Complementary molecular dynamics simualtions reveal the thermodynamic pathway underlying these transformations, where rapid electronic pressure initiates densification and octahedral coordination, followed by temperature driven crystallization and displacive transitions during ultrafast quenching. The resulting polymorphs reflects a dual-stage pathway inaccessible under equilibrium processing. Our results establish femtosecond laser excitation as a viable route to synthesize and stabilize ultrahigh-density high pressure silica phases under ambient conditions, without a diamond anvil cell, with implications for laser-damage mechanisms, high-energy-density materials, and planetary physics.</description>

      <title>Many-Body effects beyond excitons in second-harmonic generation of monolayer MoS$_{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a quantitative study of many-body effects including the three-particle level on second-harmonic generation in monolayer MoS$_{2}$. Our approach combines many-body perturbation theory with time-dependent current-density-functional theory within an \textit{ab initio} framework in the optical limit. Inclusion of two-particle excitonic effects \textit{via} a dynamical long-range linear exchange-correlation kernel reproduces the qualitative features of the second-harmonic response, but underestimates the experimentally reported magnitudes by nearly a factor of two. By incorporating three-particle (trionic) correlations through a static long-range quadratic exchange-correlation kernel, we achieve significantly improved quantitative agreement with experiment. These findings highlight the role of many-body interactions beyond the excitonic level in accurately describing second-order optical responses in two-dimensional semiconductors.</description>

      <title>The Surface Sensitivity of X-ray Second Harmonic Generation as a Function of Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The surface sensitivity and probe depth in the x-ray regime of diamond for second harmonic generation (SHG) was investigated both analytically and computationally with velocity gauge real-time time-dependent density functional theory (VG-RT-TDDFT), which includes a full multipole expansion. This was accomplished using two different approaches, by changing the number and location of layers that can generate SHG computationally and by exploiting the symmetry of a crystal, a similar pattern emerged. We find that by 1000 eV, well above the ~285 eV of the C $K$-edge, the SHG of diamond is dominated by the bulk, quadrupole response, in agreement with our analytic calculations. The bulk response continues to grow as the energy is increased, becoming overwhelming by 7000 eV. Near the C $K$-edge the measurement is quite surface sensitive, however, this surface sensitivity reduces as the energy increases such that by 1000 eV (and certainly by 3500 eV) SHG is largely bulk sensitive. Moreover, we find that the specific details of the crystal orientation (i.e., comparing a (001)-terminated and (111)-terminated surface) appear to have significant effects on the surface sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Interpretable self-driving sputter epitaxy: from black-box optimization to human-usable growth rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-driving laboratories have emerged as powerful tools for navigating high-dimensional process spaces, yet systems remain black-box optimizers that yield limited transferable process understanding. Here, we demonstrate an interpretable self-driving laboratory framework that transforms autonomous optimization into human-usable growth rules. As a stringent benchmark, we apply this framework to RF magnetron sputtering, addressing a long-standing challenge of achieving high-quality beta-Ga2O3 heteroepitaxy and single-crystalline beta-Ga2O3 homoepitaxy via sputtering. By combining Bayesian optimization with automated optical evaluation of the Urbach energy as a metric of sub-bandgap disorder, the self-driving system efficiently identifies heteroepitaxial growth conditions yielding a minimum Urbach energy of 182 meV, the lowest value for sputtered beta-Ga2O3 films. Importantly, the optimized growth window is transferable, realizing single-crystalline beta-Ga2O3 homoepitaxy without further optimization, corroborated by scanning transmission electron microscopy. To convert the closed-loop dataset into interpretable growth rules, we train a random forest surrogate and distill it into response curves and quantified pairwise interactions across the four-dimensional growth-parameter space. This analysis identifies substrate temperature as the primary control knob, with RF power and gas flows acting largely additively and only a modest temperature-oxygen coupling delineating the narrow window for high-quality growth, establishing a general route from autonomous experimentation to transferable growth rules.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-Protected Minimum of Four Conventional Weyl Points in Nonmagnetic Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Realizing nonmagnetic Weyl semimetals (WSMs) with the minimal number of conventional Weyl points (WPs) and a clean Fermi surface remains a central challenge. Here, combining symmetry analysis with first-principles calculations, we establish the definitive conditions under which a nonmagnetic crystal can host exactly four conventional ($C = \pm 1$) WPs, identifying 76 space groups in the spinless limit and 83 in the spinful case that allow this minimal configuration. Guided by this framework, we predict two previously unknown boron allotropes, P6-B$_{48}$ and TBIN-B$_{48}$, as ideal WSMs. Both exhibits precisely four isolated WPs near the Fermi level, with exceptionally clean electronic structures. Notably, the WPs in P6-B$_{48}$ are pinned to high-symmetry points, while those in TBIN-B$_{48}$ lie along high-symmetry lines, leading to distinct and experimentally accessible surface states, including single and double Fermi arcs. Our work provides a complete symmetry-based foundation and pristine material platforms for minimal Weyl physics.</description>

      <title>Single Pair of Charge-two Weyl Fermions in Chiral Boron Allotropes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The realization of a minimal Weyl semimetal (WSM) hosting a single pair of Weyl points (WPs) has thus far been restricted to magnetic systems, since time-reversal symmetry generally enforces a minimum of four WPs in nonmagnetic materials. Here, combining first-principles calculations with symmetry analysis, we identify two stable boron allotropes, chiral HDSBC-B$_{20}$ and cage-like CR-B$_{12}$, as the first nonmagnetic electronic materials realizing a single pair of WPs in the spinless regime. We show that the interplay between time-reversal symmetry and crystallographic rotation symmetry ($C_4$ or $C_3$) stabilizes exactly one pair of $C=2$ WPs pinned at time-reversal-invariant momenta, thereby circumventing the conventional node-quartet constraint. These double-WPs exhibit linear dispersion along the rotation axis and quadratic dispersion in the perpendicular plane. In HDSBC-B$_{20}$, the sign of the topological charge is directly correlated with structural chirality. Both materials host exceptionally long double Fermi arcs spanning the surface Brillouin zone, providing experimentally accessible signatures. Our findings establish nonmagnetic material platforms for minimal double-Weyl fermions and broaden the landscape of unconventional WSMs.</description>

      <title>LLM-driven discovery for carbon allotropes with bond-network entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of novel carbon allotropes with tailored thermal and mechanical properties is critical for advanced thermal management. However, exploring the vast configurational space of carbon using \textit{ab initio} calculations remains computationally prohibitive. Driven by the rich topological landscape of carbon, where the competition between $sp, sp^2,$ and $sp^3$ hybridization states dictates material performance, we establish a closed-loop AI framework to explore this complex configurational space. We introduce a hybridization entropy descriptor to guide the search beyond conventional forms. Here, we establish a closed-loop AI framework that synergizes a Large Language Model (LLM) for structural generation with a Machine Learning Potential (MLP) for accelerated evaluation. Leveraging CrystaLLM to generate candidates and an iteratively refined MLP for high-fidelity validation, we screened thousands of structures to identify several stable allotropes with exotic properties. Specifically, we report ``yne-diamond C$_{12}$'' and ``yne-hex-diamond C$_{8}$'', which exhibit extreme thermal anisotropy and ultralow in-plane shear stiffness arising from their mixed $sp$-$sp^3$ hybridization. Furthermore, we discovered a complex $sp$-$sp^2$-$sp^3$ hybridized C$_{12}$ phase that combines metallic conductivity with an anomalous negative Poisson's ratio. Notably, we identified a superhard phase (C16_3) possessing a calculated Vickers hardness (103.3 GPa) exceeding that of diamond 96 GPa). Microscopic analysis reveals that thermal transport in these materials is governed by the interplay between rigid frameworks and flexible linkers. This work expands the known carbon phase space and demonstrates the efficacy of coupling generative AI with machine learning potentials for the accelerated inverse design of functional materials.</description>

      <title>Role of the Nephelauxetic Effect in Engineering Mn4+ Luminescence Kinetics for Lifetime-Based Thermometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although the considerable potential of luminescence thermometry based on emission kinetics has been widely demonstrated, reliable tools for the intentional prediction of thermometric performance remain limited. To address this challenge, the present work introduces an approach that enables a theoretical description of the 2E state lifetime of Mn4+ ions, as well as the absolute and relative sensitivities, in terms of the nephelauxetic effect within the group of double perovskites: Sr2InNbO6, Sr2InTaO6, Ba2InTaO6, and Ba2InNbO6. Our results clearly show that, contrary to common assumptions, the Dq/B ratio is not the primary factor governing either the spectroscopic behavior of Mn4+ ions or the thermometric performance of Mn4+-doped phosphors. Instead, the nephelauxetic beta1 parameter plays the dominant role. The empirical analysis carried out in this study led to the development of a predictive model that enables estimation of SAMAX and SRMAX values based exclusively on beta1. This methodology represents a significant step toward the rational design of lifetime-based luminescence thermometers with predefined thermometric characteristics tailored to the requirements of specific applications.</description>

      <title>Anti-Thermal Quenching Phosphors based on Metal Halides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal quenching (TQ) generally occurs in phosphors and is ascribed to the activation of non-radiative transitions at elevated temperatures. This effect limits the use of most phosphors in high-power/high-temperature applications, such as outdoor lighting and laser systems. To achieve anti-TQ properties, structural design of phosphors is required. This usually follows two guidelines: (1) increasing lattice rigidity to minimize thermal expansion; (2) converting thermal energy into radiative transitions to compensate for the non-radiative losses. While metal oxides and metal nitrides dominate the field of commercial anti-TQ phosphors, metal halides - despite their inherently soft lattices - have shown remarkable progress as anti-TQ phosphors in recent years. Here, we review the advances in anti-TQ metal halides (covering the time span from 2017, when first reports have appeared, till today) and discuss their mechanisms and applications. We argue that the low synthesis temperatures of metal halides and their high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) make them promising candidates as anti-TQ phosphors. Furthermore, since the rich optical-physical processes underlying the anti-TQ effect in soft-lattice in metal halides are only now beginning to be unraveled, this creates opportunities for many fundamental investigations.</description>

      <title>Self-foaming, Sintering-resistant Iron-Tungsten Powders Enable High-Cycle Thermochemical Hydrogen Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: H2-H2O redox cycling of iron powder beds at 650-800 {\deg}C offers a compact, safe, economical hydrogen storage method, but sintering-induced capacity loss has stalled its scalability for decades. Here, we show that adding redox-active tungsten to Fe powders solves this problem in static powder beds: Fe-25W (at%) alloyed powder self-foams during redox cycling via W gas-phase transport, increasing porosity and preserving capacity. In a custom automated reactor, a kilogram-scale powder bed reversibly stores 42g H2 and sustains 96+/-3% capacity utilization over 30 redox cycles. Temperature-resolved in-situ X-ray diffraction reveals a chemical-vapor-transport-mediated self-foaming mechanism that redistributes W to refine the microstructure, complemented by a contact-barrier stabilization mechanism during high-temperature holds. Partial-capacity cycling up to 90 cycles further confirms sintering resistance under incomplete redox conditions. These results establish Fe-W powder beds as a robust, scalable, and compact platform for safe, stationary hydrogen storage.</description>

      <title>Substrate induced optimization of the Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER) performances of MoS2 thin film</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) has emerged as a promising, cost-effective catalyst for hydrogen production via water splitting. We investigate the structural and electrocatalytic properties of MoS2 thin films deposited on different substrates (Al2O3, SiC, STO) to study their hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity. In particular, in order to study the substrate influence on the stabilization of different polymorphic MoS2 phases, the films are synthesised using pulsed laser deposition on substrates with different crystal symmetries and lattice parameters. All the deposited samples are characterized by X-Ray Diffraction, Raman Spectroscopy, Linear Sweep Voltammetry and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy analyses. The films grown on Al2O3 substrates exhibit the best HER performance, likely due to the stabilization of the metastable 1T phase through the interfacial interactions between film and substrate. Presence of the 1T phase in the samples grown on Al2O3 improves the charge transfer efficiency and the electrochemically active surface with a better response to the applied potential, demonstrating their enhanced catalytic behaviour for hydrogen evolution.</description>

      <title>A Comparative Study of Structural Representations for 2D Materials: Insights from Dynamic Collision Fingerprint and Matminer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In materials science, the selection of structural descriptors for machine learning protocols strongly influences predictive performance and the degree of physical interpretability that can be achieved from the derived models. Although more complex descriptors may improve numerical accuracy, they often represent extra computational load, also reducing transparency into the underlying structural information. A framework called the Dynamic Collision Fingerprint (DCF) was recently proposed with the goal of producing concise, physically significant representations, generating descriptors via dynamical probing of atomic structures. In this work, we benchmark DCF using a dataset composed of 120 two-dimensional carbon allotropes and compare its performance with the widely considered Matminer library. The analysis employs three regression models, linear regression, decision tree, and XGBoost, evaluated over train and test partitions ranging from 10\% to 90\% and repeated over multiple random seeds in order to characterize statistical variability. The obtained results demonstrate that DCF easily matches Matminer in terms of predicting accuracy across all learning algorithms. However, it accomplishes this using descriptors that are significantly lower dimensional, pointing to manageable computing costs. Moreover, compared to the rather technical Matminer descriptions, the DCF exhibits considerably clearer physical interpretability. These findings suggest that DCF is a significant substitute for high-dimensional descriptor libraries as structural representation since it is both computationally flexible and physically grounded.</description>

      <title>Growth-controlled photochromism in yttrium oxyhydride thin films deposited by HiPIMS and pulsed-DC magnetron sputtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present study investigates photochromic oxygen-containing yttrium hydride (YHO) thin films deposited by reactive high power impulse magnetron sputtering (HiPIMS) and compares their photochromic, optical, and structural properties with those of films synthesized by reactive pulsed direct current magnetron sputtering (pulsed-DCMS). Optical emission spectroscopy reveals that, unlike pulsed-DCMS where Ar$^{+}$ ions dominate, HiPIMS discharges are characterised by strong Y$^{+}$ emission, evidencing high yttrium ionisation and substantial self-sputter recycling. The critical working pressure (P$_c$) required to obtain transparent and photochromic films is higher for HiPIMS (Pc $\approx$ 1.0 Pa) than for pulsed-DCMS (Pc $\approx$ 0.5 Pa). Although films deposited near Pc exhibit similar solar transmittance (~72 %) and lattice parameters (5.38--5.39 \r{A}), the pulsed-DCMS film shows a substantially higher relative photochromic contrast (34 %) and a lower optical band gap (2.70 eV) compared with the HiPIMS film (9 % contrast and 2.94 eV). This difference is partly attributed to a lower oxygen-to-hydrogen atomic ratio in the pulsed-DCMS film. Structurally, HiPIMS films are largely polycrystalline with random out-of-plane crystallographic orientation, whereas pulsed-DCMS films exhibit a pronounced &lt;100&gt; out-of-plane preferred orientation. These results demonstrate that, beyond composition, thin-film growth conditions and microstructure play a crucial role in governing the photochromic performance of YHO.</description>

      <title>Chalcogen Impurity Barriers in 2D Systems via Semi-Empirical/Machine Learning Modeling: A Survey over 4000 Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adequate characterization of two-dimensional materials with low energy barriers for impurity adsorption is key for advancing applications based on catalysis, sensing, and surface functionalization. However, first-principles methods, such as DFT, are often computationally extremely expensive for feasible large-scale screenings. Given such a scenario, we address a data-driven approach which integrates the semi-empirical Extended Huckel Method with machine learning techniques to estimate adsorption energy barriers in the case of three relevant chalcogen impurities, S, Se and Te. With this aim, we consider the 4036 2D materials found in the C2DB. The scheme employs the EHM to compute energy profiles along three in-plane migration paths, from which average barriers can be derived. The equilibrium distance between the impurity and the 2D surface is not calculated from a tie-consuming geometry optimization. Instead, it is estimated from a simple effective phenomenological expression. Physicochemical descriptors are then obtained from the Matminer library for curated features. Four different ML models are tested, with the XGBoost leading to the highest performance. We further use SHAP to verify the resulting predictions, focusing on the $\sim1,500$ materials displaying the lowest barrier values. As it could be anticipated, we establish that the average valence electron count, electronegativity, and atomic number are typically the most relevant attributes to validate the ML model. But we also are able to determine, for the different chalcogen atoms, which other few descriptors likewise considerably influence the adsorption properties. Our results show that when combined with interpretable ML protocols, EHM can produce a scalable framework for choosing 2D structures that exhibit the desired capture/release dynamics pertinent in a variety of utilization.</description>

      <title>Mechanistic Insights into Li+ Transport Enabled by Isolated Sulfur Species in Li3PS4 Glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: All-solid-state lithium-ion batteries have renewed interest in high-performance solid electrolytes. Li3PS4 (Li2S-P2S5) glasses are among the most studied due to their high ionic conductivity, traditionally ascribed to rotational motion of polyhedral units facilitating Li+ migration. Using ab initio molecular dynamics, we investigate Li-ion diffusion in Li3PS4 glass, demonstrating that our structural model reproduces experimental neutron and X-ray diffraction patterns and conductivity measurements. Importantly, we identify a previously unrecognized diffusion mechanism: Li+ ions near isolated sulfur species (Sn with n = 1, 3) display significantly enhanced mobility, with atomic displacements up to 1.7 greater than those associated with bulkier polyhedral units. These results highlight the critical role of free sulfur species in promoting fast ionic transport, providing insights for the rational design of glass compositions with optimized conductivity for solid-state battery applications</description>

      <title>Influence of Hydrogen on Dislocation Relaxation in BCC Iron: Atomistic Mechanisms and Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, the influence of pure dislocation and hydrogen-dislocation interactions on anelastic response or internal friction relaxation peaks in bcc-iron was investigated. These relaxations are primarily governed by thermally activated kink nucleation and kink migration events. An atomistic multiscale framework, coupling molecular dynamics (MD) and kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations, was developed to investigate the underlying atomistic mechanisms behind dislocation-relaxation peaks. MD simulations revealed that the presence of hydrogen atoms near the dislocation core facilitates the kink nucleation process by reducing the nucleation barrier while enhancing the barrier for dislocation migration. The KMC model captured Snoek-Koster peaks arising from the Cottrell atmosphere formed by hydrogen atoms and clusters around the dislocation core, providing insights into the atomistic mechanisms controlling these relaxations. Furthermore, the proposed computational scheme elucidated a unique linear relationship between hydrogen content and the internal friction loss factor, offering a methodology for hydrogen detection and quantification.</description>

      <title>Highly Efficient Second/Third Harmonic Generation in van der Waals Layered Material AgScP2S6 with Anisotropic Polarization and Temperature Dependence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-crystal X-ray diffraction and nonlinear optical measurements, especially second- and third-harmonic generation (SHG/THG) are comprehensively investigated for the van der Waals layered material AgScP2S6 with a non-centrosymmetric P31c (159) space group. Linear optical constants are extracted using spectroscopic ellipsometry and applied in fitting the harmonic generation behavior. Polarization-resolved SHG and THG measurements exhibit pronounced anisotropy, with emission patterns well-described by theoretical models derived from the khi(2) and khi(3) tensor elements. The material demonstrates exceptionally high nonlinear susceptibilities, with khi(2) ~ 10^(-8) m/V and khi(3) ~ 10^(-17) m^2/V^2 which is a few orders of magnitude greater than comparable 2D materials reported in the literature. Temperature-dependent SHG and THG measurements from 300 K to 25 K reveal exponential decay in harmonic signal intensities, attributed to reduced carrier mobility, with no evidence of structural phase transitions, consistent with results from single crystal diffraction and heat capacity measurements. Polarization-resolved SHG and THG measurements also reveal distinct orientation and ellipticity trends, highlighting the anisotropic nonlinear tensor contributions and contrasting polarization selection rules in the material. These results establish AgScP2S6 as a high-performance, thermally stable, and highly anisotropic nonlinear candidate material suitable for compact photonic applications such as ultrafast optical modulators, polarization-sensitive detectors, and wavelength-tunable light sources.</description>

      <title>Tracking the Lithiation State of Li$_x$Si from Machine-Learned XPS Binding Energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) is a powerful technique to probe chemical states and interfacial processes in battery materials, but a quantitative interpretation is often hindered by the complex, heterogeneous microstructures that form during operation and dominate electrochemical cycling. Silicon based anodes represent a paradigmatic example in Li batteries, as (de)lithiation proceeds through the formation of strongly disordered Li$_x$Si phases and crystal-amorphous transformations that are hard to characterize. Here, we introduce a computational framework that combines machine-learning (ML) prediction of core-level binding energies to large-scale atomistic simulations -- Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) complemented with molecular dynamics (MD), driven by a ML potential -- for a systematic sampling of lithiation states and local atomic environments. This approach yields stoichiometry maps that match the characteristic experimental trends observed in operando and ex situ XPS measurements, including the distinctive Si $2p$ spectroscopic signatures associated with the crystal-to-amorphous disordering driving early delithiation.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning for Electron-phonon Interactions From Finite Difference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: First-principles investigations of electron-phonon interactions (EPIs) play a crucial role in understanding a wide range of phenomena in physics and materials science. Among various approaches, the finite difference method offers a direct route to capture higher-order EPIs and is compatible with diverse electronic structure solvers. However, its considerable computational cost limits its broader application. To overcome this bottleneck, we present a machine learning electron-phonon interaction (MLEPI) pipeline that predicts force constants and electronic Hamiltonians for modeling EPIs from finite difference calculations, improving efficiency by orders of magnitude without compromising accuracy. The performance of MLEPI is validated by studying the temperature dependence of the electronic band properties in bilayer graphene, where both first- and second order EPIs are treated on an equal footing. Using a heterogeneous edge network, the pipeline integrates both interlayer and intralayer interactions, making it particularly suitable for studying multilayer materials. With its inherent adaptability and ease of transfer to other applications, our methodology provides a robust tool with a very favorable accuracy/efficiency balance for investigating EPIs in large-scale material systems.</description>

      <title>Landau level spectroscopy in current solid state physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Landau level spectroscopy plays an important role in modern condensed-matter physics. In this technique, electrons in a solid are subjected to quantizing magnetic fields and probed experimentally, often through optical methods. Direct and detailed insights into the electronic properties of crystalline materials are obtained, particularly the properties related to their band structure. Landau level spectroscopy enables the precise extraction of key parameters such as effective mass, carrier density, mobility, and band gap, and serves as a powerful tool for studying interactions between electrons and other quasiparticles in solids. Over its more than seventy-year history, Landau level spectroscopy has been applied mainly to semiconductors and semimetals. Today, its scope also includes graphene-based systems, surface and bulk states in topological materials, and other emergent systems with a narrow or vanishing band gap. In this work, we review the fundamentals of Landau level spectroscopy and illustrate them with selected examples from the literature.</description>

      <title>Engineering in-plane anisotropy in 2D materials via surface-bound ligands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 2D materials exhibiting in-plane anisotropy enable novel functionality in electronic, optoelectronic, and photonic devices, yet their availability is generally limited to naturally-occurring low-symmetry van der Waals compounds. Here, we demonstrate an approach to structural engineering in a family of blue-emitting 2D silver phenylchalcogenide semiconductors based on steric interactions among surface-bound organic molecular ligands. By strategically halogenating specific sites of phenyl ligands, we demonstrate dramatic changes to the inorganic AgSe plane in mithrene (silver phenylselenolate, AgSePh). Density functional theory revealed pronounced in-plane electronic anisotropy for direct-gap fluorinated derivatives, while a chlorinated variant exhibited a direct-to-indirect bandgap transition. Furthermore, some fluorinated variants displayed strongly polarized absorption and luminescence, accompanied by a 10x enhancement in photoluminescence quantum yield. This work establishes a versatile approach for tailoring optoelectronic properties in hybrid semiconductors that is difficult or impossible to achieve in all-inorganic materials alone, offering new opportunities in advanced material design.</description>

      <title>Efficient training of generative models from multireference simulations and its application to the design of Dy complexes with large magnetic anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative machine learning models can potentially provide direct access to novel and relevant portions of the full chemical space, overcoming the cost of systematic sampling. However, the training of these models generally requires a large amount of data, often precluding the use of expensive high-level ab initio simulations for this task. The generation of coordination compounds of Dy with large magnetic anisotropy represents a topical example, where multireference simulations of large molecules are necessary to perform reliable predictions. Here, we show that a semi-supervised chemically-inspired training-by-proxy of generative variational autoencoders can reduce the cost associated with building a training set from multireference simulations by two orders of magnitude. We illustrate the power of this approach by generating 100s of new organic ligands for Dy(III) pentagonal bipyramidal complexes exhibiting record values of magnetic anisotropy, while starting from datasets as small as 1k multireference calculations. This work thus paves the way to the computational generation of molecules as complex coordination compounds with target electronic and magnetic properties.</description>

      <title>Accounting for the length-scale dependence of thermal diffusivity in 3C-SiC measured with transient thermal gratings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pump-probe optical methods like transient grating spectroscopy (TGS) enable rapid, nondestructive thermoelastic property measurements. But, in phonon-dominated ceramics, they can underpredict bulk thermal diffusivity when long mean free path (MFP) phonons do not equilibrate over experimental length scales. We combine in situ TGS with Si4+ ion irradiation of CVD 3C-SiC (300 and 550C, 0.5-1 dpa) and density functional theory informed Boltzmann transport equation solutions to understand the origins of this offset. We show how the discrepancy between laser flash analysis (LFA) and TGS-measured thermal diffusivity varies with grain-boundary density, temperature, and defect concentration. We introduce a dimensionless suppression factor that accounts for this discrepancy and demonstrate its utility by using it to show an agreement between the thermal defect resistance of neutron irradiated 3C-SiC (measured using LFA) and ion irradiated 3C-SiC (measured using TGS). This theory-informed experimental framework enables quantitative, in situ tracking of ion irradiation damage induced thermal transport degradation in ceramics.</description>

      <title>Molecular Beam Epitaxy Growth of Wafer-scale SnSe van der Waals Ultrathin Layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tin selenide (SnSe) is a van der Waals (vdW) layered post-transition metal monochalcogenide compound which is promising for a wide range of device applications when its thickness is reduced to a few layers. Hence, developing a mature synthesis technique to obtain wafer-scale, high-quality ultrathin SnSe layers is crucial. In this work, we present a comprehensive study on the effect of growth parameters on the material quality of ultrathin SnSe thin films grown by molecular beam epitaxy. A growth window including substrate temperature of 210-270{\deg}C and low Se/Sn flux ratio with Se valve position of 10-30 mils has been identified which results in SnSe films with root-mean-square (RMS) roughness as low as 0.6 nm and full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) of 0.1{\deg} in SnSe (400) x-ray diffraction (XRD) rocking curve. Finally, using a three-step growth approach, we demonstrate wafer-scale coalesced ultrathin SnSe layers with thicknesses from 20 nm down to 5 nm, with good crystallinity, structural quality, and surface morphology. This work establishes a growth condition framework for MBE-grown SnSe and presents a viable route for developing wafer-scale single-layer films, unlocking the potential of this highly promising material for advanced device integration.</description>

      <title>Zatom-1: A Multimodal Flow Foundation Model for 3D Molecules and Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: General-purpose 3D chemical modeling encompasses molecules and materials, requiring both generative and predictive capabilities. However, most existing AI approaches are optimized for a single domain (molecules or materials) and a single task (generation or prediction), which limits representation sharing and transfer. We introduce Zatom-1, the first foundation model that unifies generative and predictive learning of 3D molecules and materials. Zatom-1 is a Transformer trained with a multimodal flow matching objective that jointly models discrete atom types and continuous 3D geometries. This approach supports scalable pretraining with predictable gains as model capacity increases, while enabling fast and stable sampling. We use joint generative pretraining as a universal initialization for downstream multi-task prediction of properties, energies, and forces. Empirically, Zatom-1 matches or outperforms specialized baselines on both generative and predictive benchmarks, while reducing the generative inference time by more than an order of magnitude. Our experiments demonstrate positive predictive transfer between chemical domains from joint generative pretraining: modeling materials during pretraining improves molecular property prediction accuracy.</description>

      <title>Phononic enhancement and detection of hidden spin-nematicity and dynamics in quantum magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spin nematic phase, characterized by long-range order of spin quadrupole moments in the absence of dipolar magnetism, presents a significant challenge for conventional experimental detection. We propose a novel method to detect this elusive order in quantum magnets with an illustration in the spin-1 triangular lattice Mott insulator. By integrating out the phonon degrees of freedom, we obtain a phase diagram with substantially enlarged regions for the spin-nematic and spin-nematic-supersolid phases. We then demonstrate that through the spin-lattice coupling, the emergence of spin nematic order imprints a distinctive signature onto the phonon spectra, providing a clear spectroscopic signature for the quadrupolar order accessible via Raman or inelastic X-ray scattering. Our formalism offers a direct and powerful method to uncover the hidden spin nematicity, opening a new pathway for diagnosing multipolar orders in quantum magnets.</description>

      <title>Atomic-Scale Quantum Control of Single Spin Defects in a Two-Dimensional Semiconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Individual spin defects in solids are promising building blocks for quantum technologies, but their deterministic creation, individual addressability, and operation near surfaces remain major challenges. Two-dimensional materials provide an attractive alternative, as their single-layer thickness enables direct atomic-scale access to defect states. Here, we demonstrate single-spin control of solid-state defects in a two-dimensional semiconductor by a combination of scanning tunneling microscopy and electron spin resonance. We create and manipulate individual sulfur vacancies and carbon substitution defects in monolayer molybdenum disulfide and characterize their spin dynamics, including coherent control, at the single-defect level. Using atomic manipulation, we further engineer and probe spin-spin interactions between defect pairs. Our results demonstrate deterministic creation, addressability, coherent manipulation, and controlled coupling of individual spin defects within a single experimental platform. This establishes atomically engineered spin defects in two-dimensional semiconductors as a versatile class of controllable solid-state quantum systems and opens a route towards tailored quantum sensing experiments.</description>

      <title>Inhomogeneous superconductivity in (001), (110) and (111) KTaO$_3$ two-dimensional electronic gas: $T_c$ driven from electronic confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate superconductivity in KTaO$_3$ (KTO)-based two-dimensional electron gases for the (001), (110), and (111) crystallographic orientations within a unified microscopic framework. Using a self-consistent tight-binding slab model, we determine the confinement potential, electronic structure, and orbital composition for each orientation, explicitly including inversion-symmetry-induced orbital Rashba couplings. Using a local spin-singlet s-wave pairing interaction, we find that the pronounced orientation dependence of the superconducting critical temperature primarily originates from differences in the spatial extent of the two-dimensional electron gas and the associated redistribution of the density of states at the Fermi level, rather than from changes in the pairing interaction. Our results provide a microscopic explanation for the experimentally observed orientation dependence of superconductivity at KTO-based interfaces.</description>

      <title>A Reduced Order Model approach for First-Principles Molecular Dynamics Computations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To leverage the redundancy between the electronic structure computed at each step of first-principles molecular dynamics, we present a data-driven modeling framework for Kohn-Sham Density Functional Theory that bypasses the explicit optimization of electronic wavefunctions. We sample a priori representative atomic configurations and construct a low-dimensional basis that efficiently approximates the electronic structure subspace. Subsequently, we employ this reduced basis in a direct solver for the electronic single particle density matrix, thereby enabling the efficient determination of ground state without iterative wavefunction optimization. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in a Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics of a water molecule, showing that the resulting simulations accurately reproduce key structural properties, such as bond lengths and bond angle, obtained from full first-principles molecular dynamics. This work highlights the potential of data-driven approaches to develop efficient electronic structure solvers for first-principles simulations.</description>

      <title>An Information-theoretic Collective Variable for Configurational Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entropy governs molecular self-assembly, phase transitions, and material stability, yet remains challenging to quantify and directly control in molecular systems. Here, we demonstrate that the computable information density (CID), a data compression-based information theoretic metric, provides an instantaneous general measure of configurational entropy in molecular dynamics simulations, reflecting both local and long-range structural organization. We validate the CID across systems of increasing complexity, beginning with single-component Lennard-Jones melting before examining binary phase separation, polymer condensation and dispersion, and assembly of amorphous carbon networks at multiple densities. Unlike conventional order parameters, CID requires no a priori knowledge of relevant structural features and captures entropic signatures across a variety of molecular systems and discretization resolutions. By establishing entropy as a directly accessible structural metric, this framework lays a foundation for future entropy-driven materials design and optimization strategies.</description>

      <title>Moire Engineering of Cooper-Pair Density Modulation States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.22637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cooper-pair density modulation (CPDM) states are superconducting phases in which the order parameter varies periodically in real space without breaking translational symmetry. Recently, moire superlattices in layered materials have emerged as powerful platforms for engineering charge density with tunable lattice symmetry, offering a new route to creating and controlling CPDM states. In this work, we demonstrate moire-induced CPDM states in a bilayer heterostructure formed by epitaxially stacking one quintuple layer (1 QL) of topological insulator Sb2Te3 on a six-unit-cell (6 UC) antiferromagnetic FeTe layer. Scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/S) measurements reveal a moir\'e superlattice formed between the hexagonal Te lattice of Sb2Te3 and the square Te lattice of FeTe, which spatially modulates the two superconducting gaps of the 1 QL Sb2Te3/6 UC FeTe bilayer. Our Josephson STM/S measurements provide direct real-space imaging of the CPDM states with a wavelength corresponding to the periodicity of the moire superlattice. By substituting Sb2Te3 with Bi2Te3, we achieve control over both the periodicity and magnitude of the CPDM states. Our work demonstrates an epitaxial strategy for synthesizing moire superlattices from materials with different crystal symmetries and reveals a new mechanism for engineering CPDM states in designer bilayer heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Phonons reflect dynamic spin-state order in LaCoO$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate lattice dynamics in LaCoO$_3$ using inelastic neutron and x-ray scattering over $T = 2\mbox{-}650\,\mathrm{K}$, spanning the spin-state crossover at $T_{1} \approx 100\,\mathrm{K}$ and the insulator--metal transition at $T_{2} \approx 550\,\mathrm{K}$. Comparison with quasi-harmonic $ab-initio$ lattice-dynamical calculations helps reveal anomalous softening of a $\approx 10\,\mathrm{meV}$ oxygen phonon, confined to the temperature interval $T_{1} \leq T \leq T_{2}$ and localized in momentum space at $\boldsymbol{q}_{\mathrm{SSO}} = \left( \frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2} \right)_{c}$. This wave vector corresponds to the spin-state ordering originally proposed by Goodenough [J. Phys. Chem. Solids 6, 287-297 (1958)]. Our results therefore provide momentum-resolved evidence for dynamic correlations of high-spin and low-spin Co$^{3+}$ states in LaCoO$_{3}$, linking spin-state fluctuations to anomalous phonon renormalization.</description>

      <title>First-principles and tight-binding analysis of thermoelectricity in irradiated WSe$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.22789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electronic and thermoelectric transport in zigzag monolayer WSe$_2$ nanoribbons are studied under monochromatic irradiation. The electronic structure is described within a six-orbital tight-binding framework constructed from the relevant tungsten and selenium orbitals, with atomic spin-orbit coupling included explicitly. Periodic driving is incorporated via the Peierls substitution, and in the high-frequency limit the system is mapped onto an effective static Floquet Hamiltonian with polarization-dependent renormalized hoppings. Coherent transport is evaluated using wave-function matching within the Landauer-B\"{u}ttiker formalism. The lattice thermal conductivity is obtained independently from density functional perturbation theory combined with an iterative solution of the phonon Boltzmann transport equation. Light-induced hopping renormalization reshapes the band dispersion and transmission spectrum near the Fermi level, modifying the Landauer transport integrals that determine electrical and thermal conductances and the Seebeck coefficient. Together with spin-orbit-driven band splitting and reduced lattice thermal conductivity from enhanced anharmonic scattering, this leads to a thermoelectric figure of merit $ZT$ exceeding unity over a broad temperature range.</description>

      <title>Pressure-induced reentrant superconductivity in a misfit layered compound $\mathrm{(SnS)_{1.15}(TaS_2)}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Misfit layered compounds are natural van der Waals heterostructures in which electronically active transition-metal dichalcogenide layers are decoupled by incommensurate blocking layers, enabling bulk realization of quasi-two-dimensional quantum states. Here we investigate the superconducting, transport,and structural properties of the misfit compound $\mathrm{(SnS)_{1.15}(TaS_2)}$ under pressures up to 150 GPa. The low-pressure superconducting phase is gradually suppressed and disappears near 14.7 GPa,accompanied by increasing residual resistance. Remarkably, a distinct superconducting phase reemerges above 80 GPa and persists to the highest pressures achieved. This reentrant superconductivity follows a pressure-induced sign reversal of the Hall coefficient near 60 GPa and a nonmonotonic evolution of the normal-state resistance, indicating an electronic reconstruction. No structural phase transition is detected over the entire pressure range. Our results demonstrate a pressure-driven electronic reconstruction leading to reentrant superconductivity in a misfit layered compound, establishing pressure as an effective route to engineer superconductivity and electronic states in natural van der Waals heterostructures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.23011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the formalism of pseudospin and isospin operators the Hamiltonian of an effective Kugel-Khomskii model with spin-orbit coupling is derived with an exact account of the $t_{2g}$ multiplet splitting by the crystal field. An analytical solution is obtained for an arbitrary relation between the Hubbard repulsion and crystal field splitting, i.e., interpolating the cases of Mott-Hubbard and charge-transfer insulators. A description of orbital orders is given in terms of octupole moments. The ground-state phase diagram is constructed in the parameter space spanned by spin-orbit coupling, Hund's exchange, and Hubbard interaction. We investigate a quantum phase transition between a state exhibiting hidden magnetic and orbital long-range order and a ferromagnetic state with a reduced magnetic moment accompanied by antiferroorbital order. It is shown that the cooperative effect of Hund's and spin-orbit interactions gives rise to an easy-plane-type anisotropy.</description>

      <title>Depth-dependent interplay of dynamical heterogeneity and chain dynamics at the surface of glass-forming polymers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.23106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polymer thin films exhibit pronounced interfacial mobility gradients that modify chain relaxation, yet how these gradients govern chain-scale dynamics across depth remains incompletely understood. Using molecular dynamics simulations of freestanding glass-forming polymer films, we resolve how depth-dependent variations in segmental relaxation shape chain dynamics across a wide range of displacement scales. Near the free surface, accelerated segmental mobility suppresses Rouse-regime scaling exponents to values as low as gamma = 0.4, reflecting transient localization induced by interfacial mobility gradients rather than topological entanglement. In contrast, the film interior exhibits enhanced Rouse scaling exponents consistent with predictions of the Heterogeneous Rouse Model (HRM), indicating that bulk dynamic heterogeneity compresses the Rouse regime. Mapping the minimum scaling exponent gamma_min across depth reveals a linear gradient that separates the bulk-like enhancement regime from the surface-induced suppression regime of chain dynamical scaling. Together, these results demonstrate that bulk and interfacial dynamic heterogeneity modify chain relaxation in opposite ways and establish Rouse scaling as a sensitive, spatially resolved probe of glassy dynamical heterogeneity and interfacial dynamical gradients in polymers.</description>

Abstract: Developing intrinsic homojunctions without chemical heterogeneity remains a key challenge in future two - dimensional devices. Here, we report a geometry - defined metal--semiconductor--metal homojunction in bilayer blue phosphorus (BlueP) created by a localized bubble corrugation, without chemical doping or foreign - material interfaces. First - principles calculations show that enlarging the interlayer separation in the metallic A\(_1\)B\(_1\) - stacked BlueP bilayer opens a band gap, enabling a semiconducting barrier embedded between metallic segments. First - principles quantum - transport simulations reveal a crossover from ballistic to tunneling transport upon bubble formation. In the tunneling regime, transmission decreases exponentially with bubble width while remaining weakly sensitive to bubble height and bulging direction. The junction acts as an orientation - dependent \(k\) - space filter, producing transport anisotropy and momentum selectivity. Orbital - resolved scattering analysis shows that intralayer - bonding channels persist under deformation whereas interlayer - hybridized channels are quenched, and that \sigma - type bonding yields higher conductance than \pi - type bonding. These insights motivate two electromechanical device concepts: a mechanically switchable memory element with ON/OFF ratios up to 30 and a nanoscale sliding rheostat with reproducible exponential resistance tuning for \AA - scale displacement sensing.</description>

Abstract: The R3MBi5 rare-earth intermetallics (R = rare earth, M = Ti, Zr, Sc) provide a versatile platform to explore how Kondo hybridization, RKKY exchange, magnetic frustration, and broken inversion symmetry may cooperate to generate unusual magnetic behavior. We present a comprehensive neutron scattering investigation of the magnetic structure, crystal electric field (CEF), and low-energy excitations in the locally noncentrosymmetric Kondo-lattice compounds Ce3TiBi5 and Ce3ZrBi5. Powder and single-crystal neutron diffraction reveals incommensurate cycloidal antiferromagnetic order in Ce3TiBi5 with propagation vector k = (0, 0, 0.388) and a reduced ordered moment of m = 0.53(3)$\mu_{B}$. Ce3ZrBi5 exhibits a qualitatively similar magnetic diffraction profile, with k $\simeq$ (0, 0, 0.37). Inelastic neutron scattering measurements resolve two clear, well-separated CEF excitations in both compounds with nearly the same profile, confirming a well-isolated Kramers doublet ground state. At low energies, a broad, quasi-elastic magnetic response is observed at T $\simeq$ TN, whose momentum-dependence is inconsistent with that expected from conventional collective excitations of localized moments. This discrepancy, along with a Kondo temperature estimate TK ~ 3--5 K -- comparable to TN -- indicates sizable Kondo hybridization, which accounts for the moment reduction and the spiral magnetic order that appears to involve the magnetic hard direction. Our results place these compounds in a regime where local inversion symmetry breaking, anisotropic CEF effects, and competing Kondo and RKKY interactions collectively give rise to unconventional magnetic order.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.00423v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The realization of magnetic skyrmions in two-dimensional (2D) magnets holds great promise for both fundamental research and device applications. Despite recent progress, two-dimensional skyrmion hosts are still limited, due to the fact that most 2D magnets are centrosymmetric and thus lack Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI). We show here, using a general analysis based on symmetry, that Bloch-type skyrmions can, in fact, be stabilized in 2D magnets, due to the interplay between in-plane component (dx) of second nearest-neighbor DMI and magnetic anisotropy. Its validity is demonstrated in the Cr2Ge2Te6 monolayer, which is also verified by recent experiments. Our work gives a clear direction for experimental studies of 2D magnetic materials to stabilize skyrmions and should greatly enrich the research on magnetic skyrmions in 2D lattices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19372v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An adaptive physics-inspired model design strategy for machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) is proposed. This strategy relies on iterative reconfigurations of composite models from single-term models, followed by a unified training procedure. A model evaluation method based on the Fisher information matrix (FIM) and multiple-property error metrics is also proposed to guide the model reconfiguration and hyperparameter optimization. By combining the reconfiguration and the evaluation subroutines, we provide an adaptive MLIP design strategy that balances flexibility and extensibility. In a case study of designing models against a structurally diverse niobium dataset, we managed to obtain an optimal model configuration with 75 parameters generated by our framework that achieved a force RMSE of 0.172 eV/{\AA} and an energy RMSE of 0.013 eV/atom.</description>

      <title>Floquet-Engineering Weyl Points and Linked Fermi Arcs from Straight Nodal Lines</title>

Abstract: Floquet engineering provides a powerful and flexible method for modifying the band structures of quantum materials. While circularly polarized light has been shown to convert curved nodal lines in three-dimensional semimetals into Weyl points, such a transformation is forbidden for an isolated straight nodal line. In this work, we uncover a dramatic shift in this paradigm when multiple straight nodal lines intersect. We observe that circularly polarized light not only gaps them into Weyl points but also induces unprecedented surface-state Fermi arcs that extend across the entire surface Brillouin zone and form a linked topological structure. These findings advance our fundamental understanding of light-driven transitions in topological semimetals and unveil a unique Weyl semimetal phase defined by linked Fermi arcs. We discuss potential exotic phenomena arising from this phase, applications of our predictions to spin-splitting antiferromagnets, and the extension of this Weyl semimetal phase to classical systems.</description>

      <title>Light-induced odd-parity altermagnets on dimerized lattices</title>

Abstract: Altermagnets are an emerging class of collinear magnets with momentum-dependent spin splitting and zero net magnetization. These materials can be broadly classified into two categories based on the behavior of spin splitting at time-reversal-related momenta: even-parity and odd-parity altermagnets. While even-parity altermagnets have been thoroughly investigated both theoretically and experimentally, the systems capable of hosting odd-parity altermagnetism remain largely unexplored. In this work, we demonstrate that circularly polarized light dynamically converts collinear PT-symmetric antiferromagnets on dimerized lattices into odd parity p-wave altermagnets. Because of the underlying Dirac band structure of the dimerized lattice, we find that the resulting p-wave altermagnets can realize Chern insulators (2D) and Weyl semimetals (3D) under appropriate drive conditions. Our findings demonstrate that collinear antiferromagnets on dimerized lattices provide ideal platforms to investigate the dynamical generation of odd-parity altermagnetism.</description>

      <title>TXL Fusion: A Hybrid Machine Learning Framework Integrating Chemical Heuristics and Large Language Models for Topological Materials Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04068v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological materials--including insulators (TIs) and semimetals (TSMs)--hold immense promise for quantum technologies, yet their discovery remains constrained by the high computational cost of first-principles calculations and the slow, resource-intensive nature of experimental synthesis. Here, we introduce TXL Fusion, a hybrid machine learning framework that integrates chemical heuristics, engineered physical descriptors, and large language model (LLM) embeddings to accelerate the discovery of topological materials. By incorporating features such as space group symmetry, valence electron configurations, and composition-derived metrics, TXL Fusion classifies materials across trivial, TSM, and TI categories with improved accuracy and generalization compared to conventional approaches. The framework successfully identified new candidates, with representative cases further validated through density functional theory (DFT), confirming its predictive robustness. By uniting data-driven learning with chemical intuition, TXL Fusion enables rapid and interpretable exploration of complex materials spaces, establishing a scalable paradigm for the intelligent discovery of next-generation topological and quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Highly controllable switching pathways in multiferroic GdMn$_2$O$_5$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.02939v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Controlling magnetic moments using electric fields remains a central challenge in spintronics. Multiferroics, where magnetic and electric orders coexist, may be a natural platform for such control, but progress has been limited because interactions between these orders are typically too weak to overcome the energy barriers between magnetic states. A recently demonstrated topologically protected switching circumvents this limitation by exploiting reduced barriers at a phase transition. Nevertheless, the conditions enabling this phenomenon remain elusive and electric field control is poorly understood. Here, we experimentally map the energy landscape by tracking transitions in GdMn$_2$O$_5$ under combined electric and magnetic fields. The experiments reveal that the switching pathways can be controlled by the electric field. A minimal theoretical model captures the observed behavior, identifies the parameter space where switching paths are sensitive to small perturbations and reveals design principles for implementing topological switching in other materials.</description>

      <title>Stress-Induced Ferroelectricity in Hafnium Oxide Core-Shell Nanoparticles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.09262v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In contrast to hafnia (HfO2) thin films, where the appearance of switchable ferroelectric polarization can be induced by strain or defect engineering, reliable methods for controlling ferroelectricity are absent in HfO2 nanoparticles. Direct experimental observations of ferroelectric hysteresis and ferroelectric domains in these nanoparticles are also absent. To the best of our knowledge, stress-induced ferroelectric states in the HfO2 nanoparticles have not been explored. In this work, we study the influence of chemical stress on phase diagrams, dielectric and polar properties of spherical HfO2 core-shell nanoparticles using a Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire free energy functional that includes trilinear and biquadratic couplings involving polar, antipolar, and nonpolar order parameters. The ferroelectric phase exhibits reentrant behavior as a function of nanoparticle size, such that the spontaneous polarization exists only within a limited range of core radii R_c, namely R_cr^min&lt;R_c&lt;R_cr^max. The minimal critical radius R_cr^min is primarily determined by the size dependence of the depolarization field and correlation effects; the maximal critical radius R_cr^max is primarily determined by the size dependence of chemical stresses induced by the elastic defects in the shell. Thus, this work identifies a stress-driven mechanism for reentrant ferroelectricity stabilization in nanoscale HfO2 systems, arising from the competition between depolarization field-induced suppression of ferroelectricity and its stabilization by shell-induced chemical stress. We revealed that relatively large compressive chemical strains are necessary to induce the ferroelectric phase in the HfO2 nanoparticles. Successful chemical strain engineering opens the way for significant enhancement of nanoscale HfO2 polar properties for applications in advanced memory cells and logic devices.</description>

      <title>Quadrupole formation and coupling to magnetic and structural degrees of freedom in the $5d^1$ double perovskites Ba$_2$MgReO$_6$ and Ba$_2$NaOsO$_6$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.18257v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the interplay between charge, magnetic, and structural degrees of freedom in the isostructural and isoelectronic $5d^1$ double-perovskites Ba$_2$MgReO$_6$ and Ba$_2$NaOsO$_6$. Using first-principles-based electronic structure calculations, we show that both materials exhibit a tendency toward spontaneous quadrupolar order in the cubic paramagnetic phase, which is slightly weaker in Ba$_2$NaOsO$_6$ than in Ba$_2$MgReO$_6$. Our analysis further reveals an intimate coupling between the local magnetic moments and charge quadrupoles, mediated by the strong spin-orbit interaction, that leads to the unusual canted configuration of magnetic moments observed in these systems. When structural degrees of freedom are included, the two materials exhibit pronounced differences. In Ba$_2$MgReO$_6$ the strong coupling to Jahn-Teller distortions stabilizes the antiferroic $\mathcal{Q}_{x^2-y^2}$ order, yielding excellent agreement with available experimental data. In contrast, the Jahn-Teller coupling is significantly weaker in Ba$_2$NaOsO$_6$ and appears insufficient to stabilize the antiferroic quadrupolar order. While this is consistent with the absence of any measurable long-range structural distortion above the magnetic transition temperature, it contrasts with experimental results indicating a strong canting of the magnetic moments. Our analysis thus successfully describes the mechanisms shaping the properties of the Re-compound while a full quantitative description of the magnetic ground state of Ba$_2$NaOsO$_6$ is still elusive.</description>

      <title>Discovering new photovoltaics using optimal transport theory</title>

Abstract: Searching by chemical and structural analogy is one of the most commonly used and successful approaches to materials discovery. However, formulating this task for algorithmic implementation raises the question of how we define similar materials. Methods have been proposed for searching materials space using vectors based on chemical composition and functional fragments in the material. Descriptors for structural similarity have also been proposed. However, the question of how to incorporate and balance structural and compositional similarity measures in a single metric remains open. Here, we adapt methods developed for calculating distances between undirected graphs and apply them to crystalline materials similarity. The Fused Gromov-Wasserstein (FGW) metric uses optimal transport theory to map between two graphs considering a balance of the graph structure and the information present at the nodes of the graph (atoms in crystals). We apply the method to exploring new photovoltaic materials. We demonstrate that FGW is competitive with embeddings from an equivariant graph neural network, trained on $&gt; 10^6$ materials, despite minimal training. We then apply FGW to a discovery campaign to identify materials from the Materials Project database that have not previously been explored as photovoltaics, but have similarities to known high-efficiency materials. After validating predictions with hybrid density functional theory, we identify seven previously unexplored high-efficiency photovoltaic absorber candidates, including Cs$_5$Sb$_8$, which is found to have a predicted SLME of $&gt; 30\%$ and to be thermodynamically stable. The FGW approach demonstrates the power of strong inductive biases for developing metrics for materials exploration with minimal training data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07464v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Grain boundaries (GBs) strongly influence thermal transport in crystalline solids by disrupting lattice periodicity and scattering phonons. Due to the atomic-level disorder and structural complexity, a fundamental understanding of how specific GB geometries regulate nanoscale phonon behavior and macroscopic thermal conductivity has remained elusive. Here, using emerging atomic-resolution vibrational spectroscopy, we directly correlate GB structure, defect-specific vibrational states, and thermal transport in bicrystal strontium titanate with controlled tilt and twist angles. The phonon characterizations and thermal conductivity data reveal two distinct regimes, where low-angle tilt GBs (2deg, 6deg, 10deg) substantially modulate phonon populations and mode frequencies, resulting in pronounced changes in thermal conductivity, whereas high-angle tilt GBs (22deg, 36deg) exhibit weak conductivity variation due to saturated structural disorder and scattering. In contrast, twist GBs introduce periodic defect motifs that only locally tailor phonon transport. Our results suggest tilt and twist angles as complementary knobs for coarse and fine control of phonon propagation and cross-GB thermal transport, providing a predictive framework for thermal engineering in materials.</description>

      <title>Harnessing natural and mechanical airflows for surface-based atmospheric pollutant removal</title>

Abstract: Removal strategies for atmospheric pollutants are increasingly being considered to mitigate global warming and improve public health. However, the global potential of surface-based removal techniques has not yet been quantified based on limits of pollutant transport and removal rates. We evaluate the atmospheric pollutant transport to surfaces and assess the potential of surface-based removal technologies for global-scale deployment across a variety of configurations, including air interaction with the built environment, mechanical ventilation and convection systems, and over the global transportation fleet Cities provide the highest removal potential, with median annual estimates of 30 GtCO$_2$, 0.06 GtCH$_4$, 0.007 GtNO$_\text{x}$ and 0.0001 GtPM$_{2.5}$ transported to their total surface area. Cities, solar farms, HVAC systems and filters have the potential to exceed 1 GtCO$_2$/yr (1 GtCO$_2$e/yr for CH$_4$, 20-year GWP) of removal when literature-based CO$_2$-sorbent (CH$_4$-catalyst) efficiencies are applied across their total surface area. These values represent theoretical upper bounds and are intended for comparison across applications rather than application-specific deployment. HVAC filters have the potential to achieve materials costs as low as \$600 per tCO$_2$ removed (\$2000 per tCO$_2$e) when CO$_2$-sorption (CH$_4$-catalyst) technologies are incorporated into their fibre sheets and maintained through routine filter replacement, compared with \$3000 per tCO$_2$ (\$10000 per tCO$_2$e) for city surfaces, based on the literature values for these technologies' materials costs. These findings demonstrate that integrating surface-based pollutant removal technologies into infrastructure may offer a pathway to advance climate and health objectives, though further studies are needed to assess their feasibility in application, and application-implementation rates and cost.</description>

      <title>Time-bin encoded quantum key distribution over 120 km with a telecom quantum dot source</title>

Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) with deterministic single photon sources has been demonstrated over intercity fiber and free-space channels. The previous implementations relied mainly on polarization encoding schemes, which are susceptible to birefringence, polarization-mode dispersion and polarization-dependent loss in practical fiber networks. In contrast, time-bin encoding offers inherent robustness and has been widely adopted in mature QKD systems using weak coherent laser pulses. However, its feasibility in conjunction with a deterministic single-photon source has not yet been experimentally demonstrated. In this work, we construct a time-bin encoded QKD system employing a high-brightness quantum dot (QD) single-photon source operating at telecom wavelength. Our proof-of-concept experiment successfully demonstrates the possibility of secure key distribution over fiber link of 120 km, while maintaining extraordinary long-term stability over 6 hours of continuous operation. This work provides the first experimental validation of integrating a quantum dot single-photon source with time-bin encoding in a telecom-band QKD system. In addition, it demonstrates the highest secure key rate among the time-bin QKDs based on single-photon sources. This development signifies a substantial advancement in the establishment of a robust and scalable QKD network based on solid-state single-photon technology</description>

      <title>Giant and robust Josephson diode effect in multiband topological nanowires</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05772v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically predict the giant and robust Josephson diode effect in quasi-one-dimensional topological Majorana nanowires in the regime with multiple subbands, which is expected to be relevant for the real experiment. In the multiband regime, the Majorana bound states and conventional Andreev bound states can naturally coexist, and respectively contribute to the fractional and conventional parts in the Josephson effect, with the former/latter having 4$\pi$/2$\pi$-periodicity. We show that the interplay between the two types of bound modes can produce a robust and giant diode effect in the deep topological phase regime. Notably, we unveil a novel spin parity exchange mechanism, occurring only in the multiband regime, which leads to a robust high efficiency plateau of the giant diode effect. This effect is a nontrivial consequence of the balanced Fermi moment shifts of the multiple subbands in tuning the external magnetic field. Our finding highlights the subband engineering as a powerful tool to optimize the Josephson diode effect realistically and provides a new feasible signature to identify topological phase regime in superconducting nanowires.</description>

Abstract: Altermagnets are a novel class of fully spin-compensated magnetic materials that nevertheless have spin-split electronic bands, offering novel perspectives for spintronics applications. Based on a rigorous analysis of altermagnetic many-body models and their symmetry we establish the important role of two fundamental types of polarizations in altermagnetic insulators: the charge and the spinetic one, where the latter corresponds to a macroscopic spin-displacement field. First principles calculations confirm and quantify their presence in real materials. The two polarizations are directly coupled and emerge in orthogonal directions when inversion symmetry is broken, either by the system developing a spontaneously ferroelectric polarization (in ferroelectric altermagnets), or by a charge displacement induced by an external electric field (for inversion invariant altermagnetic insulators). This presence of large and switchable spin accumulations constitute an attractive fundamental feature of altermagnetic insulators.</description>

      <title>Interface Spin-orbit Coupling Induced Room-temperature Ferromagnetic Insulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.16069v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fabricating room-temperature ferromagnetic insulators, which are crucial candidates for next-generation dissipation-free quantum and spintronic devices, remains a significant challenge. In this Letter, we report on the epitaxial synthesis of novel room-temperature ferromagnetic insulating thin films created through the precise construction of (111)-oriented 3d/5d interfaces. Our analysis indicates that, unlike conventional doping methods, the (111)-oriented SrIrO3/La2/3Sr1/3MnO3 (SIO/LSMO) interfaces exhibit markedly enhanced spin-orbit coupling. This enhanced interfacial spin-orbit coupling strengthens the electron-phonon coupling in LSMO, thereby shortening the electronic mean free path. As a result, the intrinsic metallicity of LSMO is suppressed, giving rise to a new ferromagnetic insulating phase that emerges between the ferromagnetic metal and paramagnetic insulator regimes of the LSMO phase diagram. Furthermore, the temperature window of the ferromagnetic insulating phase can be tuned by precisely controlling the thickness of the LSMO layers. Our Letter reveals a new strategy for developing ferromagnetic insulators by engineering 3d/5d interfaces and orientations, paving a way for the development of novel dissipation-free quantum and spintronic devices.</description>

Abstract: Large-spin two-dimensional magnets are generally expected to develop conventional long-range order once the dominant exchange scale becomes appreciable. The layered spin-$3/2$ maple-leaf compound Na$_2$Mn$_3$O$_7$ defies this expectation: despite sizable antiferromagnetic interactions and no evident disorder, it exhibits no magnetic ordering and displays two well-separated thermodynamic crossover scales. We show that this behavior originates from a crystallography-driven molecularization of the magnetic degrees of freedom. The low-symmetry structure partitions the Mn sublattice into inequivalent exchange pathways, generating a pronounced hierarchy that nearly isolates antiferromagnetic hexagons. Magnetic correlations therefore develop in two stages: first within individual hexagons at a scale set by the dominant exchange, and only at much lower temperatures do frustrated inter-hexagon couplings attempt to establish coherence across the lattice. While isolated hexagons reproduce the two-step thermodynamic structure, the experimentally relevant temperature scales emerge only once the hexagons are embedded in the frustrated two-dimensional network. The resulting quantum ground state is magnetically disordered, characterized by strong intra-hexagon correlations and rapidly decaying inter-hexagon correlations. These results identify crystallographic inequivalence as a materials-level mechanism for stabilizing molecularized and quantum-disordered states even in large-spin two-dimensional magnets.</description>
