      <title>A new contraction principle on the perimeters of triangles and related results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we introduce a new type of mapping contracting perimeters of triangles in a complete metric space and present related fixed point theorem. We study the metric completeness property of the underlying space in terms of fixed point of our newly introduced mapping. In support of our result, we present several examples.</description>

      <title>On Quaternionic Fock Spaces: Kernel-induced Integral Operators, Berezin Transforms and Toeplitz Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study quaternionic Fock spaces and develop an operator-theoretic framework centered around kernel-induced integral operators, Berezin transforms and Toeplitz operators. More precisely, the following results are obtained:
  (i) Global quaternionic Fock structure. We introduce a global Gaussian $L^p$--norm for slice functions on $\mathbb H$ and prove that the resulting global quaternionic Fock space $F_\alpha^p$ coincides with the slice-defined Fock space $\mathfrak F_\alpha^p$, with equivalent norms. In particular, $F_\alpha^2$ becomes a right quaternionic reproducing kernel Hilbert space with an explicit reproducing kernel, yielding a slice-independent Fock projection onto $F_\alpha^2$.
  (ii) Kernel-induced integral operators and Fock--Carleson measures. We investigate kernel-induced integral operators and characterize quaternionic Fock--Carleson measures. These embedding theorems provide the measure-theoretic basis that underlies boundedness and compactness criteria for operators on quaternionic Fock spaces.
  (iii)Berezin transforms and Toeplitz operators. We define the Berezin transform for slice functions and prove its fundamental properties, including semigroup behavior and fixed-point features. Building on the slice-independent projection and the slice product, we introduce Toeplitz operators with slice-function symbols and with measure symbols, and develop their basic algebraic properties. We then obtain complete boundedness and compactness characterizations for Toeplitz operators with two natural symbol classes: positive measures and slice $\mathrm{BMO}^1$ symbols, expressed in terms of Berezin-type transforms and slice/symmetric averaging quantities.</description>

      <title>Nuclear Toeplitz operators between Fock spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Toeplitz operators with measure-valued symbols acting between Fock spaces. Given $1\le p,q\le\infty$ and a Borel measure $\mu$ on $\mathbb C$, we investigate when the associated Toeplitz operator \[ T_\mu : F^p_\alpha \to F^q_\alpha \] belongs to the nuclear class. For positive measures $\mu$ and in the range $1\le q\le p\le\infty$, we obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for the nuclearity of $T_\mu$ in terms of the Berezin transform of $\mu$. As a consequence, nuclearity in this setting exhibits a rigidity property: if $T_\mu$ is nuclear from $F^p_\alpha$ to $F^q_\alpha$ for some $q\le p$, then it is nuclear for all such $q$. In the case $p&lt;q$, we show that the situation is more delicate. We provide separate necessary and sufficient conditions for nuclearity, indicating that the Berezin transform alone does not yield a complete characterization. The proofs rely on tools from Banach space operator theory combined with kernel estimates on Fock spaces. Our results extend naturally to Fock spaces on $\mathbb C^n$.</description>

      <title>Schur--Horn type inequalities for hyperbolic polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a Schur--Horn type inequality for symmetric hyperbolic polynomials. As an immediate consequence, we resolve a conjecture of Nam Q. Le on Hadamard-type inequalities for hyperbolic polynomials. Our argument is based on the Schur--Horn theorem, the Birkhoff theorem, and G{\aa}rding's concavity theorem for hyperbolicity cones. Beyond the eigenvalue level, we develop a symmetrization principle on hyperbolicity cones: if a hyperbolic polynomial is invariant under a finite group action, then its value increases under the associated Reynolds operator (group averaging). Applied to the sign-flip symmetries of linear principal minor polynomials introduced by Blekherman et al., this yields a short proof of the hyperbolic Fischer--Hadamard inequalities for PSD-stable lpm polynomials.</description>

      <title>On Necessary and Sufficient Conditions for Fixed Point Convergence: A Contractive Iteration Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While numerous extensions of Banach's fixed point theorem typically offer only sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of a fixed point and the convergence of iterative sequences, this study introduces a generalization grounded in the iterative contraction principle in complete metric spaces. This generalization establishes both the necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a unique fixed point to which all iterative sequences converge, along with an accurate error estimate. Furthermore, we present and prove an additional theorem that characterizes the convergence of all iterative sequences to fixed points that may not be unique. Several examples are provided to illustrate the practical application of these results, including a case where the traditional and well-known generalizations of Banach's theorem, such as those by Banach, Kannan, Chatterjea, Hardy-Rogers, Meir-Keeler, and Guseman, are inapplicable.</description>

      <title>Unbounded symbols, heat flow, and Toeplitz operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We disprove the natural domain extension of the Berger--Coburn heat-flow conjecture for Toeplitz operators on the Bargmann space and identify the failure mechanism as a gap between pointwise and uniform control of a Gaussian averaging of the squared modulus of the symbol, a gap that is invisible to the linear form $T_g$. We establish that the form-defined operator $T_g$ and the natural-domain operator $U_g$ decouple in the unbounded symbols regime: while $T_g$ is governed by linear averaging, $U_g$ is controlled by the quadratic intensity of $|g|^2$. We construct a smooth, nonnegative radial symbol $g$ satisfying the coherent-state admissibility hypothesis with bounded heat transforms for all time $t&gt;0$; for this symbol, $T_g$ is bounded, yet $U_g$ is unbounded. This is a strictly global phenomenon: under the coherent-state hypothesis, local singularities are insufficient to cause unboundedness, leaving the ``geometry at infinity'' as the sole obstruction. Boundedness of $U_g$ is equivalent to the condition that $|g|^2 d\mu$ is a Fock--Carleson measure, a condition strictly stronger than the linear average $g d\mu$ governing $T_g$. Finally, regarding the gap between the known sub-critical sufficiency condition and the critical heat time, we prove that heat-flow regularity is irreversible in this context and show that bootstrapping strategies cannot resolve the gap between sufficiency and critical time.</description>

      <title>Spectral projections of an anharmonic oscillator with complex polynomial potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a broad class of polynomial potentials $V$, with an important and instructive representative being $V(x) = x^{2a} + i x^b$, $x \in \mathbb R$, $a, b \in \mathbb N$, we show that the system of spectral projections $\{P_n\}_n$ of an anharmonic operator $L = - (\mathrm{d}/ \mathrm{d}x)^2 + V(x)$ does not generate a (Riesz) basis in $L^2(\mathbb R)$ if $a - 1 &lt; b &lt; 2a$. Moreover, for $\sigma = [b - (a - 1)]/(1 + a)$ and $\gamma &gt; 0$ small enough, $\limsup_n \|P_n\|/ \exp(\gamma n^\sigma) = \infty$. Proofs are based on two groups of results which are of great interest on their own: (a) relationship between behavior (growth) of the norms of projections $\|P_n\|$ and of the resolvent $\|(z - L)^{-1}\|$ outside of the spectrum $\sigma(L)$; (b) partial fraction decompositions of special meromorphic functions $1/F$ where $F(w) = \prod_{k=1}^\infty \left( 1 + \frac{w}{a_k} \right)$, $a_{k+1} \geq a_k&gt;0$, $k \in \mathbb N$, and the generalization of the first resolvent identity.</description>

Abstract: We establish a non-commutative version of the Intermediate Factor Theorem for crossed products associated with product lattices. Given an irreducible lattice $\Gamma &lt; G= G_1 \times \dots \times G_d$ in higher rank semisimple algebraic groups and a trace-preserving irreducible action $G \curvearrowright (\mathcal{N}, \tau)$, we show that every intermediate von Neumann algebra between $\mathcal{N}\rtimes\Gamma$ and $(L^\infty(G/P,\nu_P)\overline{\otimes}\mathcal{N})\rtimes\Gamma$ is again a crossed product of the form $(L^\infty(G/Q,\nu_Q)\overline{\otimes}\mathcal{N})\rtimes\Gamma$.</description>

      <title>Hypercyclicity of Toeplitz operators with smooth symbols</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03303v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the study of the dynamics of Toeplitz operators $T_F$ with smooth symbols $F$ on the Hardy spaces of the unit disk $H^p$, $p&gt;1$. Building on a model theory for Toeplitz operators on $H^2$ developed by Yakubovich in the 90's, we carry out an in-depth study of hypercyclicity properties of such operators. Under some rather general smoothness assumptions on the symbol, we provide some necessary/sufficient/necessary and sufficient conditions for $T_F$ to be hypercyclic on $H^p$. In particular, we extend previous results on the subject by Baranov-Lishanskii and Abakumov-Baranov-Charpentier-Lishanskii. We also study some other dynamical properties for this class of operators.</description>

      <title>Matrix convex sets over the Euclidean ball and polar duals of real free spectrahedra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20325v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the free spectrahedron determined by universal anticommuting self-adjoint unitaries is not equal to the minimal matrix convex set over the ball in dimension three or higher. This example, as well as other matrix convex sets over the ball, then provides context for structure results on the extreme points of coordinate projections. In particular, we show that the free polar dual of a real free spectrahedron is rarely the projection of a real free spectrahedron, contrasting a prior result of Helton, Klep, and McCullough over the complexes. We use this to show that spanning results for free spectrahedra that are closed under complex conjugation do not extend to free spectrahedrops that meet the same assumption. These results further clarify the role of the coefficient field.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the stability properties of an abstract class of semi-linear systems. Our main result establishes rational rates of decay for classical solutions assuming a certain non-uniform observability estimate for the linear part and suitable conditions on the non-linearity. We illustrate the strength of our abstract results by applying them to a one-dimensional wave equation with weak non-linear damping and to an Euler-Bernoulli beam with a tip mass subject to non-linear damping.</description>

      <title>Spectral properties of Toeplitz operators with harmonic function symbols on the Bergman space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16952v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the spectral properties of Toeplitz operators on the Bergman space of unit disk. We present an integral representation of $ T^*_{z^m}$, which establishes a connection between the Bergman functions and the solutions of PDE theory. In fact, by leveraging the Poincar\'e theorem in difference equations and the solution forms of differential equations, this paper describes the kernels of certain Toeplitz operators with harmonic polynomial symbols, and further gives the sufficient conditions for the connectedness of the spectra of these Toeplitz operators. The spectral properties of $ T_\varphi$ with $\varphi (z) =\overline{z}^{m} + \alpha z^m + \beta$ are characterized, such as $\sigma(T_\varphi)= \overline{\varphi (\mathbb {D})}$, Fredholm index of $T_\varphi$ can only be one of $m,-m$ and $0$, $T_\varphi$ satisfies Coburn's theorem. These findings offer an illuminating example for the essential projective spectra of non-commuting operators.</description>

      <title>A Unified Spectral Framework for Aging, Heterogeneous, and Distributed Order Systems via Weighted Weyl-Sonine Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05423v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While General Fractional Calculus has successfully expanded the scope of memory operators beyond power-laws, standard formulations remain predominantly restricted to the half-line via Riemann-Liouville or Caputo definitions. This constraint artificially truncates the system's history, limiting the thermodynamic consistency required for modeling processes on unbounded domains. To overcome these barriers, we construct the \textbf{Weighted Weyl-Sonine Framework}, a generalized formalism that extends non-local theory to the entire real line without history truncation.
  Unlike recent algebraic approaches based on conjugation for finite intervals, we develop a rigorous harmonic analysis framework. Our central contribution is the \textbf{Generalized Spectral Mapping Theorem}, which establishes the Weighted Fourier Transform as a unitary diagonalization map for these operators. This result allows us to rigorously classify and solve distinct physical regimes under a single algebraic structure. We explicitly derive exact solutions for \textit{diffusive relaxation} (governed by Complete Bernstein Functions), \textit{inertial wave propagation} (exhibiting oscillatory dynamics), and \textit{retarded aging} (via distributed order), proving that our framework unifies the description of anomalous transport and wave mechanics in complex, time-deformed media.</description>

      <title>A note on the $L_p$-Brunn-Minkowski inequality for intrinsic volumes and the $L_p$-Christoffel-Minkowski problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17896v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The first goal of this paper is to improve some of the results in \cite{BCPR}. Namely, we establish the $L_p$-Brunn-Minkwoski inequality for intrinsic volumes for origin-symmetric convex bodies that are close to the ball in the $C^2$ sense for a certain range of $p&lt;1$ (including negative values) and we prove that this inequality does not hold true in the entire class of origin-symmetric convex bodies for any $p&lt;1$. The second goal is to establish a uniqueness result for the (closely related) $L_p$-Christoffel-Minkowski problem. More specifically, we show uniqueness in the symmetric case when $p\in[0,1)$ and the data function $g$ in the right hand side is sufficiently close to the constant 1. One of the main ingredients of the proof is the existence of upper and lower bounds for the (convex) solution, that depend only $\|\log g\|_{L^\infty}$, a fact that might be of independent interest.</description>

Abstract: This article studies the temporal approximation of hyperbolic semilinear stochastic evolution equations with multiplicative Gaussian noise by Milstein-type schemes. We take the term hyperbolic to mean that the leading operator generates a contractive, not necessarily analytic $C_0$-semigroup. Optimal convergence rates are derived for the pathwise uniform strong error \[
  E_h^\infty := \Big(\mathbb{E}\Big[\max_{1\le j \le M}\|U_{t_j}-u_j\|_X^p\Big]\Big)^{1/p} \] on a Hilbert space $X$ for $p\in [2,\infty)$. Here, $U$ is the mild solution and $u_j$ its Milstein approximation at time $t_j=jh$ with step size $h&gt;0$ and final time $T=Mh&gt;0$. For sufficiently regular nonlinearity and noise, we establish strong convergence of order one, with the error satisfying $E_h^\infty\lesssim h\sqrt{\log(T/h)}$ for rational Milstein schemes and $E_h^\infty \lesssim h$ for exponential Milstein schemes. This extends previous results from parabolic to hyperbolic SPDEs and from exponential to rational Milstein schemes. Moreover, root-mean-square error estimates are strengthened to pathwise uniform estimates. Numerical experiments validate the convergence rates for the stochastic Schr\"odinger equation. Further applications to Maxwell's and transport equations are included.</description>
