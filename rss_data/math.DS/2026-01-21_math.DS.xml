      <title>Qualitative analysis and numerical investigations of time-fractional Zika virus model arising in population dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Epidemic models play a crucial role in population dynamics, offering valuable insights into disease transmission while aiding in epidemic prediction and control. In this paper, we analyze the mathematical model of the time-fractional Zika virus transmission for human and mosquito populations. The fractional derivative is considered in the Caputo sense of order $\alpha\in(0,1).$ We begin by conducting a qualitative analysis using the stability theory of differential equations. The existence and uniqueness of the solution are established, and the model's stability is examined through Hyers-Ulam stability analysis. Furthermore, an efficient difference scheme utilizing the standard L1 technique is developed to simulate the model and analyze the solution's behavior under key parameters. The resulting nonlinear algebraic system is solved using the Newton-Raphson method. Finally, illustrative examples are presented to validate the theoretical findings. Graphical results indicate that the fractional model provides deeper insights and a better understanding of disease dynamics. These findings aid in controlling the virus through contact precautions and recommended therapies while also helping to predict its future spread.</description>

      <title>Classification of dynamics for a two person model of planned behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a dynamical system modeling the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) in which each individual's behavioral intention evolves continuously under an ODE driven by internal attitudes, perceived social norms, and perceived behavioral control. Actions occur as discrete threshold events: when intention reaches a fixed threshold it is reset to 0 and produces a transient "nudge" that jumps to 1 and then decays exponentially. This yields a hybrid ODE-threshold system with psychologically interpretable parameters. We derive a partial classification in the general case of n individuals. Focusing on the two-individual case (n=2), we obtain explicit formulas for trajectories between action events and derive bounds for first-action times. In the mixed setting where one individual is intrinsically increasing and the other is not, we identify a scalar invariant, M, measuring the net effect of one period of excitation. We prove that non-positive M is equivalent to a partial-action state (only the intrinsically active individual acts countable infinitely often), while positive M is equivalent to full action (both individuals act countably infinitely often). Finally, we demonstrate numerically that these analytic boundaries partition the parameter space with near-perfect agreement, and we provide exploratory simulations suggesting analogous structures for three individuals.</description>

      <title>The maximal mean equicontinuous factor via regional mean sensitivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For actions of amenable groups, mean equicontinuity-a natural relaxation of equicontinuity obtained by averaging metrics along orbits-is well known to yield a maximal mean equicontinuous factor. In 2021, Li and Yu introduced the notion of weak sensitivity in the mean for actions of $\mathbb{Z}$ to gain a deeper understanding of this phenomenon, building on earlier work by Qiu and Zhao.
  We demonstrate that this relation is insufficient for actions of non-Abelian groups. To overcome this limitation, we introduce the regional mean sensitive relation, which more precisely captures the dynamical behaviour underlying the maximal mean equicontinuous factor. We discuss its fundamental properties and highlight its advantages in the non-Abelian setting. In particular, we show that mean equicontinuity is equivalent to the nonexistence of non-diagonal regional mean sensitive pairs. For this, we work in the context of actions of $\sigma$-compact and locally compact amenable groups.</description>

      <title>Locating critical points attracted to p-adic attracting cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In complex dynamics, a fundamental result of Fatou and Julia asserts that every attracting cycle of a rational map attracts a critical point. The analogous statement fails in non-Archimedean dynamics. For a non-Archimedean rational map, this paper establishes a sharp condition on the multiplier of an attracting cycle ensuring it attracts a critical point.</description>

      <title>An unbounded number of canard limit cycles in linear regularizations of piecewise linear systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to study the number of limit cycles of canard type in linear regularizations of piecewise linear systems with non-monotonic transition functions. Using the notion of slow divergence integral and elementary breaking mechanisms, we construct systems with an arbitrary finite number of hyperbolic limit cycles. The Hopf breaking mechanism deals with transition functions with precisely one critical point in the interval $(-1,1)$. On the other hand, the jump breaking mechanism produces any number of limit cycles using transition functions with precisely three critical points in $(-1,1)$.</description>

      <title>A new notion of dimension for dynamical systems and shift embeddability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A dynamical system $(X,T)$ is \emph{shift embaddable} if $(X,T)$ embeds continuously and equivariantly in the shift over $[0,1]^d$ for some finite $d$. Refuting a major conjecture in the field, in a recent result of Dranishnikov and Levin it was shown that Gromov's mean dimension and Lebesgue covering dimension of finite orbits are not the only obstructions for shift embaddability.
  We present a new notion of dimension for dynamical systems over any countable group. We show that this new notion of dimension accounts for all known obstructions for shift embaddability.</description>

      <title>Universality of the Basilica</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish universality of the fat Basilica Julia set $J(z^2-\frac34)$ in conformal dynamics in the following sense: $J(z^2-\frac34)$ is quasiconformally equivalent to the fat Basilica Julia set of any polynomial as well as to the limit set of any geometrically finite closed surface Bers boundary group. We thus obtain the first example of a connected rational Julia set, not homeomorphic to the circle or the sphere, that is quasiconformally equivalent to a Kleinian limit set. It follows that any geometrically finite Bers boundary limit set is conformally removable. Other consequences of this universality result include quasi-symmetric uniformization of polynomial fat Basilicas by round Basilicas, and the existence of infinitely many non-commensurable uniformly quasi-symmetric surface subgroups of the Basilica quasi-symmetry group. We apply our techniques to cuspidal Basilica Julia sets arising from Schwarz reflections and cubic polynomials, yielding further universality classes. We also show that the standard Basilica Julia set $J(z^2-1)$ is the archbasilica in the David hierarchy.</description>

      <title>Quasi-periodic Dynamics for Multi-dimensional Quasi-linear Schr\"{o}dinger Equations via Resonant Mode Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the problem of quasi-periodic solutions for multi-dimensional quasi-linear Schr\"odinger equation. To address the challenge of unbounded perturbations caused by quasi-linear terms in the equation, we define the resonant mode set $\mathcal{K}$ to control nonlinear resonant effects. Combining KAM (Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser) ( or Nash-Moser ) theory and Fourier analysis methods, we prove that there are plenty of quasi-periodic solutions of the equation. We also present the Fourier expansion form of the solutions and the estimation of frequency shifts.</description>

      <title>On the Birkhoff Spectrum for Hyperbolic Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the structure of Birkhoff spectra for hyperbolic dynamical systems. For a H\"older observable $f$ on a basic set $\Lambda$, we prove that if the Birkhoff sums take both positive and negative values, then the Birkhoff spectrum $\mathcal{B}(f,\varphi,\Lambda)$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}$. This extends the density result of Gan, Shi, and Xia \cite{Shaobo} from transitive Anosov diffeomorphisms in infranilmanifolds to general basic sets, and yields new density theorems for Axiom~A systems, including Anosov diffeos.\\ Conversely, when the spectrum is not dense, we characterize \emph{concentrated} observables, whose spectrum is confined to one side of zero. For these, we establish two rigidity results: (i) boundedness of the spectrum is equivalent to the function being cohomologous to a zero, which constitutes an extension of the Liv\v sic theorem; (ii) if the spectrum exhibits an arithmetic structure, the function is cohomologous to a constant.
  Finally, we extend the results to continuous time. For Anosov flows$-$ including geodesic flows on Anosov manifolds$-$we obtain analogous density results for Birkhoff integrals along closed orbits. In particular, we generalize a theorem of Dairbekov--Sharafutdinov (\cite{Dairbekov}) by showing that a bounded or ``arithmetically sparse'' spectrum forces a smooth function to vanish or be constant, respectively.</description>

Abstract: The dispersive estimate plays a pivotal role in establishing the long-term behavior of solutions to the nonlinear equation, thereby being crucial for investigating the well-posedness of the equation.In this work we prove that the solutions to Klein-Gordon equation on 1-d lattices follow the dispersive estimate provided that potential is quasi-periodic with Diophantine frequencies and closed to positive constants.</description>

      <title>Eigensets of switching dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reachability sets of linear switching dynamical systems (systems of ODE with time-dependent matrices that take values from a given compact set) are analysed. An eigenset is a non-trivial compact set M that possesses the following property: the closure of the set of points reachable by trajectories starting in M in time t is equal to exp(at)M. This concept introduced in a recent paper of E.Viscovini is an analogue of an eigenvector for compact sets of matrices. We prove the existence of eigensets, analyse their structure and properties, and find ``eigenvalues'' a for an arbitrary system. The question which compact sets, in particular, which convex sets and polyhedra, can be presented as eigensets of suitable systems, is studied.</description>

      <title>Detecting Limit Tori in Non-Smooth Systems: An Analytic Approach with Applications to 3D Piecewise Linear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates a class of non-autonomous $T$-periodic piecewise smooth differential systems and their associated time-$T$ maps. Our main result provides an analytical approach for detecting, within this class of piecewise differential systems, isolated invariant tori associated with normally hyperbolic invariant closed curves of the time-$T$ map. To achieve this, we derive sufficient conditions under which smooth near-identity maps undergo a Neimark--Sacker bifurcation. As an application of our main result, we present a family of 3D piecewise linear differential systems exhibiting attracting and repelling isolated invariant tori which, moreover, persist under small perturbations. To the best of our knowledge, this family provides the first examples in which limit tori are analytically detected in piecewise linear systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.11759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The first purpose of this work is to provide a friendly introduction to the theory of nonautonomous linear systems of ordinary differential equations, the property of exponential dichotomy and its corresponding spectral theory. The second purpose of this work is disseminate the linearization results carried out by the authors in a nonautonomous framework.
  The actual structure of this work is a consequence of several elective courses (2014, 2016, 2019, 2021 and 2023) carried out by the authors for undergraduate and graduated students at the Department of Mathematics of the Universidad de Chile. The monography assumes a good knowledge of multivariate calculus, linear algebra and ordinary differential equations.</description>

      <title>Stability of equilibrium points in modified elliptic restricted three-body problem with various perturbation sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study examines the dynamics of the third body in an elliptic restricted three-body problem (ERTBP) framework, taking into account perturbations from radiation pressure, oblateness, and elongation of the primary bodies, as well as disk-like structures. The objectives are to determine the positions and stability of the equilibrium points, asses how these points shift under the influence of perturbations, and evaluate the dependence of their stability on the orbital eccentricity and perturbation parameters. The ERTBP model is modified to include a radiating, oblate primary body and an elongated secondary body modeled as a finite straight segment, alongside perturbations from a surrounding disk. The system's equations of motion are numerically solved using parameters from perturbed and classical cases. Equilibrium positions are computed over a range of eccentricities and perturbation values, and stability is analyzed using linearized equations and eigenvalue methods. In all cases, we have found three collinear ($L_1$, $L_2$, $L_3$) and two non-collinear ($L_4$, $L_5$) equilibrium points solutions. The inclusion of radiations, oblateness, elongation using a finite straight segment, and disk perturbation systematically displaces each equilibrium point from its classical location, with the magnitude and direction of the displacement varying with the perturbation parameter. Stability analysis confirms that the collinear points remain linearly stable under all tested conditions. Meanwhile, non-collinear points are stable under a specific condition. We investigate the stability boundary of these points as a function of orbital eccentricity and we found there is a critical range of eccentricity values within which stability is preserved.</description>

      <title>Koopman Spectral Computation Beyond The Reflexive Regime: Endpoint Solvability Complexity Index And Type-2 Links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Solvability Complexity Index (SCI) of Koopman operator spectral computation in the information-based framework of towers of algorithms. Given a compact metric space $(\mathcal{X},d)$ with a finite Borel measure $\omega$ on $\mathcal{X}$ and a continuous nonsingular map $F:\mathcal{X}\to \mathcal{X}$, our focus is the Koopman operator $\mathcal{K}_F$ acting on $L^p(\mathcal{X},\omega)$ for $p\in\{1,\infty\}$ for the computational problem \[ \Xi_{\sigma_{\mathrm{ap}}}(F) :=\sigma_{\mathrm{ap}}\!\bigl(\mathcal{K}_F\bigr), \] with input access given by point evaluations of $F\mapsto F(x)$ (and fixed quadrature access to $\omega$).
  We clarify how the $L^1$ case can be brought into the same oracle model as the reflexive regime $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$ by proving a uniform finite-dimensional quadrature compatibility, while highlighting the fundamentally different role played by non-separability at $p=\infty$.
  Beyond Koopman operators, we also construct a prototype family of decision problems $(\Xi_m)_{m\in\mathbb N}$ realizing prescribed finite tower heights, providing a reusable reduction source for future SCI lower bounds. Finally, we place these results deeper in the broader computational landscape of Type-2/Weihrauch theory.</description>

      <title>Streaming Operator Inference for Model Reduction of Large-Scale Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Projection-based model reduction enables efficient simulation of complex dynamical systems by constructing low-dimensional surrogate models from high-dimensional data. The Operator Inference (OpInf) approach learns such reduced surrogate models through a two-step process: constructing a low-dimensional basis via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to compress the data, then solving a linear least-squares (LS) problem to infer reduced operators that govern the dynamics in this compressed space, all without access to the underlying code or full model operators, i.e., non-intrusively. Traditional OpInf operates as a batch learning method, where both the SVD and LS steps process all data simultaneously. This poses a barrier to deployment of the approach on large-scale applications where dataset sizes prevent the loading of all data into memory at once. Additionally, the traditional batch approach does not naturally allow model updates using new data acquired during online computation. To address these limitations, we propose Streaming OpInf, which learns reduced models from sequentially arriving data streams. Our approach employs incremental SVD for adaptive basis construction and recursive LS for streaming operator updates, eliminating the need to store complete data sets while enabling online model adaptation. The approach can flexibly combine different choices of streaming algorithms for numerical linear algebra: we systematically explore the impact of these choices both analytically and numerically to identify effective combinations for accurate reduced model learning. Numerical experiments on benchmark problems and a large-scale turbulent channel flow demonstrate that Streaming OpInf achieves accuracy comparable to batch OpInf while reducing memory requirements by over 99% and enabling dimension reductions exceeding 31,000x, resulting in orders-of-magnitude faster predictions.</description>

      <title>Sets of Ramsey-limit points and IP-limit points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be an uncountable Polish space and let $\mathcal{H}$ be the Hindman ideal, that is, the family of all $S\subseteq \omega$ which are not $IP$-sets. For each sequence $x=(x_n)_{n \in \omega}$ taking values in $X$, let $\Lambda_{x}(FS)$ be the set of $IP$-limit points of $x$. Also, let $\Lambda_{x}(\mathcal{H})$ be the set of $\mathcal{H}$-limit points of $x$, that is, the set of ordinary limits of subsequences $(x_n)_{n \in S}$ with $S\notin \mathcal{H}$. After proving that these two notions do not coincide in general, we show that both families of nonempty sets of the type $\Lambda_{x}(FS)$ and of the type $\Lambda_{x}(\mathcal{H})$ are precisely the class of nonempty analytic subsets of $X$.
  An analogous result holds also for Ramsey convergence. In the proofs, we use the concept of partition regular functions introduced in J. Symb. Log. (2024) [doi:10.1017/jsl.2024.8], which provide a unified approach to these types of convergence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we examine the flow generated by coupled surface and internal small-amplitude water waves in a two-fluid layer model, where we take the upper layer to be rotational (constant vorticity) and the lower layer to be irrotational. The presence of vorticity greatly complicates the underlying analysis, yet it generates a rich array of otherwise unobservable phenomena such as the presence of critical layers, and stagnation points, in the fluid interior. We employ a phase-plane analysis to elucidate the qualitative behaviour of streamlines for a range of different coupled-wave, and vorticity, regimes. Although the water waves considered are linear in the fluid dynamics sense, the dynamical systems which govern their motion are nonlinear.</description>

Abstract: Continued fractions with prescribed structures on sequences of their partial quotients have been intensively studied in the literature. As far as an integer sequence, especially a randomly generated one is concerned, an attractive question is whether it contains arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions. In this paper we study the fractal structure of irrational numbers whose sequences of partial quotients are strictly increasing and contain arbitrarily long, quantified arithmetic progressions.</description>

      <title>Non-Wieferich property of prime ideals and a conjecture of Erd\"os</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a number field with ring of integers $\mathcal{O}$ and $\alpha\in\mathcal{O}$. For any prime ideal $\mathfrak{p}$ of $\mathcal{O}$, we obtain its higher $\alpha$-Wieferich property, which implies a nonexistence theorem for higher Wieferich unramified prime ideals. If $\beta\in\mathcal{O}$ is relatively prime to $\alpha$ and all prime ideal factors of $(\beta)$ are unramified and have residue degree $1$, we apply our higher $\alpha$-Wieferich property to establish the asymptotic equidistribution of digits in $\beta$-adic expansions of $\alpha^n$, which is a generalization of the Dupuy-Weirich theorem. When $(\beta)$ have ramified prime ideal factors, we also obtain a result on the block complexity of $\beta$-adic expansions of $\alpha^n$.</description>

      <title>2-Adic Obstructions to Presburger-Definable Characterizations of Collatz Cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I investigate structural limitations of Presburger-arithmetic-based approaches to the Collatz problem. I show that the Collatz cycle equation admits a unique solution in the $2$-adic integers, which I term a \emph{ghost cycle}. These ghost cycles are shown to be genuine periodic orbits of the $2$-adic Collatz map, satisfying all local parity constraints.
  I prove unconditionally that the divisibility predicate $\mathcal{D}_y = \{(x, C) \in \mathbb{N}^2: (2^x - 3^y) \mid C\}$, which acts as the algebraic necessary condition for integrality, is not semilinear for any fixed number of odd steps $y \ge 1$. This result is established by demonstrating that the fibers of $\mathcal{D}_y$ exhibit unbounded periods, an obstruction to Presburger definability. Consequently, strategies relying solely on Presburger arithmetic or finite automata to define the integrality constraint cannot capture the distinction between ghost cycles and genuine integer cycles. I conclude with a heuristic argument suggesting that because ghost cycles satisfy the algebraic cycle equation, the non-existence of integer cycles cannot be proven solely through algebraic manipulation of the cycle equation itself.</description>

      <title>Dynamical boundaries of affine buildings: C*-simplicity and Poisson boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a class of groups acting on possibly exotic affine buildings $X$ and possessing good proximal properties. Such groups are termed of general type, and their dynamics is analyzed through their flag limit sets in the space of chambers at infinity of $X$. For a group $G$ of general type, we prove C*-simplicity by showing that its flag limit set $\Lambda_{\mathcal F}(G)$ is topologically free, minimal, and strongly proximal. When $\Lambda_{\mathcal F}(G)$ intersects all Schubert cells relative to a limit chamber, then it is a mean proximal space, in the sense that it carries a unique proximal stationary measure for any admissible probability measure on the acting group. Lattices are established as examples of groups of general type, and their Poisson boundaries are identified. The arguments rely on constructing an equivariant barycenter map from triples of chambers in generic position to the affine building.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biological neural networks self-organize according to local synaptic modifications to produce stable computations. How modifications at the synaptic level give rise to such computations at the network level remains an open question. Pehlevan et al. [Neur. Comp. 27 (2015), 1461--1495] proposed a model of a self-organizing neural network with Hebbian and anti-Hebbian synaptic updates that implements an algorithm for principal subspace analysis; however, global stability of the nonlinear synaptic dynamics has not been established. Here, for the case that the feedforward and recurrent weights evolve at the same timescale, we prove global stability of the continuum limit of the synaptic dynamics and show that the dynamics evolve in two phases. In the first phase, the synaptic weights converge to an invariant manifold where the `neural filters' are orthonormal. In the second phase, the synaptic dynamics follow the gradient flow of a non-convex potential function whose minima correspond to neural filters that span the principal subspace of the input data.</description>

Abstract: This paper studies the categorical entropy of autoequivalences of derived categories of Hilbert schemes of points on surfaces and hyperk\"ahler manifolds. One of the central questions about categorical entropy is whether it satisfies a Gromov-Yomdin type formula $h_{\mathrm{cat}}(\Phi) = \log\rho(\Phi)$. We say that $X$ has the Gromov-Yomdin (GY) property if this formula holds. We prove that if a surface $S$ fails to satisfy the (GY) property (e.g., K3 surfaces), then so does $\mathrm{Hilb}^n(S)$. Moreover, we show that no hyperk\"ahler or Enriques manifold satisfies the (GY) property by constructing an explicit autoequivalence with positive categorical entropy but unipotent action on the cohomology ring.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Parallel Schemes with Lyapunov Exponents and kNN-LLE Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inverse parallel schemes remain indispensable tools for computing the roots of nonlinear systems, yet their dynamical behavior can be unexpectedly rich, ranging from strong contraction to oscillatory or chaotic transients depending on the choice of algorithmic parameters and initial states. A unified analytical-data-driven methodology for identifying, measuring, and reducing such instabilities in a family of uni-parametric inverse parallel solvers is presented in this study. On the theoretical side, we derive stability and bifurcation characterizations of the underlying iterative maps, identifying parameter regions associated with periodic or chaotic behavior. On the computational side, we introduce a micro-series pipeline based on kNN-driven estimation of the local largest Lyapunov exponent (LLE), applied to scalar time series derived from solver trajectories. The resulting sliding-window Lyapunov profiles provide fine-grained, real-time diagnostics of contractive or unstable phases and reveal transient behaviors not captured by coarse linearized analysis. Leveraging this correspondence, we introduce a Lyapunov-informed parameter selection strategy that identifies solver settings associated with stable behavior, particularly when the estimated LLE indicates persistent instability. Comprehensive experiments on ensembles of perturbed initial guesses demonstrate close agreement between the theoretical stability diagrams and empirical Lyapunov profiles, and show that the proposed adaptive mechanism significantly improves robustness. The study establishes micro-series Lyapunov analysis as a practical, interpretable tool for constructing self-stabilizing root-finding schemes and opens avenues for extending such diagnostics to higher-dimensional or noise-contaminated problems.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient computation of all distinct solutions of nonlinear problems is essential in many scientific and engineering applications. Although high-order parallel iterative schemes offer fast convergence, their practical performance is often limited by sensitivity to internal parameters and the lack of reproducible tuning procedures. Classical parameter selection tools based on analytical conditions and dynamical-system diagnostics can be problem-dependent and computationally demanding, which motivates lightweight data-driven alternatives.
  In this study, we propose a parameterized single-step bi-parametric parallel Weierstrass-type scheme with third-order convergence together with a training-free tuning framework based on Direct finite-time contraction (step-log) profiling. The approach extracts Lyapunov-like finite-time contraction information directly from solver trajectories via step norms and step-log ratios, aggregates the resulting profiles over micro-launch ensembles, and ranks parameter candidates using two compact scores: the stability minimum S_min and the stability moment S_mom. Numerical results demonstrate consistent improvements in convergence rate, stability, and robustness across diverse nonlinear test problems, establishing the proposed profiling-based strategy as an efficient and reproducible alternative to classical parameter tuning methods.</description>

Abstract: This letter presents a data-driven framework for the design of stabilizing controllers from input-output data in the continuous-time, linear, and time-invariant domain. Rather than relying on measurements or reliable estimates of input and output time derivatives, the proposed approach uses filters to derive a parameterization of the system dynamics. This parameterization is amenable to the application of linear matrix inequalities enabling the design of stabilizing output feedback controllers from input-output data and the knowledge of the order of the system.</description>

Abstract: Let $X=G/\Gamma$ be the quotient of a semisimple Lie group $G$ by its non-cocompact arithmetic lattice. Let $H$ be a reductive algebraic subgroup of $G$ acting on $X$. We give several equivalent algebraic conditions on $H$ for the existence of a fixed compact set in $X$ intersecting \textit{every} $H$-orbit. This generalizes previous results concerning certain special reductive group action on $X$ in this setting.
  When $G$ is of real rank one, $\Gamma$ is a non-cocompact lattice of $G$ and $H&lt;G$ is an algebraic group, we also obtain an algebraic condition on $H$ which is equivalent to the return of \textit{every} $H$-orbit to a single compact set in $X$. This complements our results in the case of arithmetic lattice.</description>

Abstract: We consider linear cocycles taking values in $\textup{SL}_d(\mathbb{R})$ driven by homeomorphic transformations of a smooth manifold, in discrete and continuous time. We show that any discrete-time cocycle can be extended to a continuous-time cocycle, while preserving its characteristic properties. We provide a necessary and sufficient condition under which this extension is canonical in the sense that the base is extended to an associated suspension flow and that the discrete-time cocycle is recovered as the time-1 map of the continuous-time cocycle. Further, we refine our general result for the case of (quasi-)periodic driving. We use our findings to construct a non-uniformly hyperbolic continuous-time cocycle in $\SL{2}$ over a uniquely ergodic driving.</description>

Abstract: The local dimension spectrum provides a framework for quantifying the fractal properties of a measure, and it is well understood for non-overlapping self-similar measures. In this article, we study the local dimension spectrum for dominated self-affine measures. By analyzing exact dimensionality, we obtain deterministic results that extend the scope of the local dimension spectrum beyond the almost-sure setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14807v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a theory for multivariate extreme value analysis of dynamical systems. Namely, we provide conditions adapted to the dynamical setting which enable the study of dependence between extreme values of the components of $\R^d$-valued observables evaluated along the orbits of the systems. We study this cross-sectional dependence, which results from the combination of a spatial and a temporal dependence structures. We give several illustrative applications, where concrete systems and dependence sources are introduced and analysed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11054v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When a dynamical system is subject to a periodic perturbation, the averaging method can be applied to obtain an autonomous leading order "guiding system", placing the time dependence at higher orders. Recent research focused on investigating invariant structures in non-autonomous differential systems arising from hyperbolic structures in the guiding system, such as periodic orbits and invariant tori. Complementarily, the effect that bifurcations in the guiding system have on the original non-autonomous one has also been recently explored, albeit less frequently. This paper extends this study by providing a broader description of the dynamics that can emerge from non-hyperbolic structures of the guiding system. Specifically, we prove here that $\mathcal{K}$-universal bifurcations in the guiding system `persist' in the original non-autonomous one, while non-versal bifurcations, such as the transcritical and pitchfork, do not. We illustrate the results on examples of a fold, a transcritical, a pitchfork, and a saddle-focus.</description>

      <title>Finite type as fundamental objects even non-single-valued and non-continuous</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11675v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, inspired by the elegant work of Good and Meddaugh \cite{GM} and the graph models for zero-dimensional systems developed by several authors, like Gambaudo and Martens \cite{GM06}, Shimomura \cite{Sh14}. We try to discover a connection among some objects, such as finite directed graph, shift of finite type and shadowing property by employing the Closed Graph Theorem for multivalued maps. From the perspective of structure theorems, we demonstrate that every closed relation (multivalued map) on a compact, totally disconnected space is represented as an inverse limit of finite directed graph homomorphisms satisfying the Mittag-Leffler condition. Moreover, from dichotomy-theorem point of view, we prove that an inverse limit of finite directed graph homomorphisms possesses the shadowing property if and only if its induced space of infinite graph walks (as a shift of finite type) satisfies the Mittag-Leffler condition. As an application, a question raised by Boro\'nski, Bruin and Kucharski \cite{BBK} is also concerned. Furthermore, we show that under a multivalued dynamical system, the resulting dynamical behaviors exhibit greater diversity and counterintuitively compared to those observed in single-valued continuous systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12803v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the statistics of collisions among locally confined gas particles poses a major challenge. In this work we investigate $\mathbb Z^d$-map lattices coupled by collision with simplified local dynamics that offer significant insights for the above challenging problem. We obtain a first order approximation for the first collision rate at a site $\textbf{p}^*\in \mathbb Z^d$ and we prove a distributional convergence for the first collision time to an exponential, with sharp error term. Moreover, we prove that the number of collisions at site $\textbf{p}^*$ converge in distribution to a compound Poisson distributed random variable. Key to our analysis in this infinite dimensional setting is the use of transfer operators associated with the decoupled map lattice at site $\textbf{p}^*$.</description>

      <title>Dynamics, data and reconstruction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19734v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The goal of data-driven learning of dynamical systems is to interpret time series as a continuous observation of an underlying dynamical system. This task is not well-posed for a variety of reasons - such as multiple co-existing sub-systems, topologically inter-weaving of these sub-systems; and more importantly, the non-injectivity of the correspondence between dynamical systems and time series. We show how these ambiguities are circumvented if one considers dynamical systems and measurement maps collectively. Dynamical systems, observed dynamical systems, and time series data - each of these three collections have an extensive network of relations within them, which gives them the mathematical structure of a category. One of the new concepts proposed is a rigorous definition of time series data as a chain of measurement sequences with decreasing information content. This definition subsumes the familiar notions of sequences, time series and even subshifts. Using these notions it is shown that the entire process of converting an observed dynamical systems into a time series object is functorial, and passes through a number of phases each bearing its own categorical structure. This discovery sheds new light on the nature of reconstruction algorithms. Under mild conditions of consistency, reconstruction itself is shown to be functorial operation. This provides a new category theoretic perspective on the nature and limits of reconstruction.</description>

      <title>On the ergodicity of anti-symmetric skew products with singularities and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21067v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel method for proving ergodicity for skew products of interval exchange transformations (IETs) with piecewise smooth cocycles having singularities at the ends of exchanged intervals. This approach is inspired by Borel-Cantelli-type arguments from Fayad and Lema\'nczyk (2006). The key innovation of our method lies in its applicability to singularities beyond the logarithmic type, whereas previous techniques were restricted to logarithmic singularities. Our approach is particularly effective for proving the ergodicity of skew products for symmetric IETs and antisymmetric cocycles. Moreover, its most significant advantage is its ability to study the equidistribution of error terms in the spectral decomposition of Birkhoff integrals for locally Hamiltonian flows on compact surfaces, applicable not only when all saddles are perfect (harmonic) but also in the case of some non-perfect saddles.</description>

Abstract: The airplane, the basilica and the Douady rabbit (and, more generally, rabbits with more than two ears) are well-known Julia sets of complex quadratic polynomials.
  In this paper we study the groups of all homeomorphisms of such fractals and of all automorphisms of their laminations.
  In particular, we identify them with some kaleidoscopic group or universal groups and thus realize them as Polish permutation groups.
  From these identifications, we deduce algebraic, topological and geometric properties of these groups.</description>

Abstract: We consider heavy-tailed observables maximised on a dynamically defined Cantor set and prove convergence of the associated point processes as well as functional limit theorems. The Cantor structure, and its connection to the dynamics, causes clustering of large observations: this is captured in the `decorations' on our point processes and functional limits, an application of the theory developed in a paper by the latter three authors.</description>

      <title>Locating Extremal Periodic Orbits for the Planar Circular Restricted Three Body Problem using Polynomial Sum-of-Squares Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23430v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With an increasing interest in the design of long and complex space missions, the search for orbits that require the least amount of fuel is of fundamental interest. This paper develops existing computational models for locating Unstable Periodic Orbits (UPOs) in polynomial dynamical systems using Sum-of-Squares (SOS) optimization technique and proposes a numerical framework to converge UPOs for the Planar Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem (PCR3BP) in astrodynamics. This is done by developing the polynomial SOS optimization technique with extension to systems with non-polynomial and Hamiltonian dynamics. First, we demonstrate and exploit the dependency of convergence of tight bounds on an observable of interest with varying scaling factors for large polynomial degrees. SOS optimization is then used to compute nonnegative polynomials, the minimization sublevel sets of which, approximately localise parts of the corresponding UPO. Improvements in current non-linear optimization techniques are suggested to compute a large number of points inside the relevant sublevel sets. Such points provide good initial conditions for UPO computations with existing algorithms. The distinguishing feature of such UPOs is that they optimize the long-time average of an input observable of interest which is a function of state variables. For the PCR3BP this means that such orbits in space can be traversed indefinitely in time without continuous fuel expenditure. As practical applications to space mission designs, we converge UPOs that minimise transmitted power required by satellites for the Earth-Moon system in a communication relay problem by minimizing the infinite-time average of sum of squares of distances of a satellite from Earth and the Moon.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15091v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a framework, which, from the trajectories detailing the spatiotemporal dynamics of a population, simultaneously reconstructs a transport map as well as the Fokker-Planck equation governing the coarse-grained probability distribution. Leveraging the Knothe-Rosenblatt rearrangement, we model the transport map from a fixed reference distribution to the target distribution, and derive the velocity fields of the flows from the trajectory of transport maps. Exploiting the velocity fields, we circumvent spatial gradients to infer the Fokker-Planck equation's potential and diffusivity. The sparsity of trajectories injects uncertainty, which we treat in a Bayesian setting using variational inference. The approach is applied to inferring the Fokker-Planck dynamics in spaces of up to five dimensions, demonstrating both accurate identification of the system and efficiency with respect to data size.</description>

      <title>Coordinate-independent model reductions of chemical reaction networks based on geometric singular perturbation theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03304v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quasi-steady-state approximation (QSSA) is a standard technique for reducing the complexity of chemical reaction networks (CRNs). The validity of any QSSA-based model is restricted to specific parameter regimes. Selecting the appropriate reduction is not always straightforward. At times, QSSAs are misused outside of their validity regions and, even when a particular QSSA is considered valid in a given parameter regime, other QSSAs may be simultaneously valid, creating ambiguity.
  Here, we employ a more powerful alternative: a constructive model reduction framework based on coordinate-independent geometric singular perturbation theory (ci-GSPT) and the parametrization method. A key advantage of this approach is its ability to derive reduced models independent of a clear timescale separation in the variables for a specific parameter configuration.
  We demonstrate our approach on two benchmark systems. For the Michaelis-Menten (MM) reaction, we show that the framework provides a systematic approach by exploring parameter configurations across three orders of magnitude: asymptotically large, small, and `order one'. A consequence of this systematic analysis is a geometric classification that categorizes the resulting model reductions and provides a point of comparison between our approach and common QSSA variants in the literature. For the more complex Kim-Forger model, we show that this approach successfully produces a reduction without the need for a coordinate transformation, showcasing its applicability to larger systems.</description>

      <title>Threshold graphs are globally synchronizing</title>

Abstract: The Kuramoto model describes phase oscillators on the unit circle whose interactions are encoded by a graph. Each edge acts like a spring that pulls adjacent oscillators toward each other whenever their phases differ. A central question is to determine which graphs are globally synchronizing, meaning that trajectories of the Kuramoto dynamics converge to the fully synchronized state from almost all initial conditions. This property is tightly linked to the benign nonconvexity of the model's energy landscape. Existing guarantees for global synchronization typically require every node to connect to sufficiently many neighbors, which in turn enforces rather homogeneous degree sequences and highly dense graphs. In this work, we identify threshold graphs as a class of graphs that lie outside this regime yet nevertheless exhibit global synchronization. More precisely, connected threshold graphs realize all admissible edge densities ranging from \(2/n\) to \(1\), and their degree sequences are maximally left-skewed among all graphs with the same edge density, when ordered in nonincreasing order. Our proof relies on a phasor-geometric analysis of the stationary points of the associated energy landscape.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13443v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $f:\mathbb{A}^N\to\mathbb{A}^N$ be a regular endomorphism of algebraic degree $d\geq2$ (i.e., $f$ extends to an endomorphism on $\mathbb{P}^N$ of algebraic degree $d$) defined over a number field. We prove that if the set of cyclotomic $f$-preperiodic points is Zariski-dense in $\mathbb{A}^N$, then some iterate $f^{\circ l}$ ($l\geq1$) is a quotient of a surjective algebraic group endomorphism $g:\mathbb{G}_m^N\to\mathbb{G}_m^N$, over $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$. This result generalizes a theorem of Dvornicich and Zannier on cyclotomic preperiodic points of one-variable polynomials to higher dimensions. In fact, we prove a much more general rigidity result for dominant endomorphisms $f$ on an affine variety $X$ defined over a number field, concerning "almost $f$-invariant" Zariski-dense subsets of cyclotomic integral points. We apply our results to backward orbits of regular endomorphisms on $\mathbb{A}^N$ of algebraic degree $d\geq2$, and to periodic points of automorphisms of H\'enon type on $\mathbb{A}^N$.</description>

      <title>Empirical Laws for Iterated Correlation Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15421v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the discrete dynamical system obtained by repeatedly applying the Pearson correlation operator to a real matrix. Each step centers every row, normalizes each centered row to unit Euclidean norm, and forms the Gram matrix of the resulting rows. This produces a nonlinear map that underlies the classical CONCOR and GAP procedures. Despite its simple formulation and long history, the global behavior of this iteration has remained analytically unresolved.
  We present a geometric formulation that separates directions associated with changes in row means and row norms from directions that preserve them. This formulation clarifies why local analysis does not extend to a global convergence theorem: the iteration is nonlinear, the structure of its fixed-point set is not fully characterized, and standard uniform contractive or Fejer-type techniques do not directly apply.
  Empirically, the iteration stabilizes at a block plus or minus one pattern, exhibits finite total variation, and displays rapid decay once trajectories enter a neighborhood of a fixed pattern. We develop a dimension-uniform experimental framework and perform a large-scale numerical study over dimensions from 3 to 2000 with thousands of random initializations. Using the Frobenius step size, the entrywise step size, and the one-step ratio, we identify four universal empirical laws that persist uniformly across all tested dimensions. These observations provide a quantitative, dimension-uniform description of the iteration and formulate a precise target for future global analysis.</description>

      <title>Quantization Dimension of $1$-variable Random Self-Similar Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19628v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantization problem for random fractals presents unique challenges due to the lack of uniform geometric scaling inherent in deterministic systems. In this article, we establish the almost sure quantization dimension for a class of $1$-variable (homogeneously) random self-similar measures. Unlike the deterministic setting, where the dimension is derived from a fixed pressure function, we prove that in the random case, the quantization dimension $\kappa_{r}$ is the unique zero of the expectation of the topological pressure. We rigorously justify this by exploiting the ergodicity of the shift map on the symbolic space to control distortion errors across non-uniform scales. Our results highlight the thermodynamic formalism underlying the quantization of random dynamical systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08359v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a criterion for determining the winner in two-player win-lose alternating-move games on trees, in terms of the Hausdorff dimension of the target set. We focus our study on special cases, including the Gale-Stewart game on the complete binary tree and a family of Schmidt games. Building on the Hausdorff dimension games originally introduced by Das, Fishman, Simmons, and Urba\'nski, which provide a game-theoretic approach for computing Hausdorff dimensions, we employ a generalized family of these games, and show that they are useful for analyzing sets underlying the win-lose games we study.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08814v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study random dynamical systems generated by volume-preserving piecewise $C^{1}$ maps. For this class of systems, we establish an invariance principle stating that if all Lyapunov exponents vanish, then there exists a measurable family of probability measures on the projective bundle that is invariant under the projective cocycle induced by the derivative. We apply this principle to two classes of random systems. First, we consider random additive perturbations of the billiard map associated with a strictly convex planar table on a surface of constant curvature. In this setting, we show that the Lyapunov exponents vanish almost everywhere if and only if the billiard table is a geodesic disk. Second, we study random additive perturbations of a standard map and prove that the Lyapunov exponents vanish almost everywhere if and only if the map is integrable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.12880v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a complete classification of degree-$2$ foliations on $\mathbb{P}^n$ in any dimension, assuming they are not algebraically integrable. If $\mathcal{F}$ is such a foliation, then either $\mathcal{F}$ is the linear pull-back of a degree-$2$ foliation by curves on $\mathbb{P}^{n-k+1}$, or a logarithmic foliation of type $(1^{n-k+1},2)$, or a logarithmic foliation of type $(1^{n-k+3})$, or the linear pull-back of a degree-$2$ foliation of dimension $2$ on $\mathbb{P}^{n-k+2}$ tangent to an action of the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{aff}(\mathbb{C})$. Meanwhile, we prove that any $2$-dimensional foliation tangent to a global vector field must satisfy that its tangent sheaf is either not locally free or has a direct summand isomorphic to $\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^{n}}(a)$, with $a\in\{0,1\}$. As a byproduct of our classification, we describe the geometry of Poisson structures on $\mathbb{P}^{4}$ with generic rank two.</description>

      <title>Expander graphs are globally synchronizing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.12788v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Kuramoto model is fundamental to the study of synchronization. It consists of a collection of oscillators with interactions given by a network, which we identify respectively with vertices and edges of a graph. In this paper, we show that a graph with sufficient expansion must be globally synchronizing, meaning that a homogeneous Kuramoto model of identical oscillators on such a graph will converge to the fully synchronized state with all the oscillators having the same phase, for every initial state up to a set of measure zero. In particular, we show that for any $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ and $p \geq (1 + \varepsilon) (\log n) / n$, the homogeneous Kuramoto model on the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph $G(n, p)$ is globally synchronizing with probability tending to one as $n$ goes to infinity. This improves on a previous result of Kassabov, Strogatz, and Townsend and solves a conjecture of Ling, Xu, and Bandeira. We also show that the model is globally synchronizing on any $d$-regular Ramanujan graph, and on typical $d$-regular graphs, for large enough degree $d$.</description>

      <title>An Adaptive Online Smoother with Closed-Form Solutions and Information-Theoretic Lag Selection for Conditional Gaussian Nonlinear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05870v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data assimilation (DA) combines partial observations with dynamical models to improve state estimation. Filter-based DA uses only past and present data and is the prerequisite for real-time forecasts. Smoother-based DA exploits both past and future observations. It aims to fill in missing data, provide more accurate estimations, and develop high-quality datasets. However, the standard smoothing procedure requires using all historical state estimations, which is storage-demanding, especially for high-dimensional systems. This paper develops an adaptive-lag online smoother for a large class of complex dynamical systems with strong nonlinear and non-Gaussian features, which has important applications to many real-world problems. The adaptive lag allows the utilization of observations only within a nearby window, thus reducing computational complexity and storage needs. Online lag adjustment is essential for tackling turbulent systems, where temporal autocorrelation varies significantly over time due to intermittency, extreme events, and nonlinearity. Based on the uncertainty reduction in the estimated state, an information criterion is developed to systematically determine the adaptive lag. Notably, the mathematical structure of these systems facilitates the use of closed analytic formulae to calculate the online smoother and adaptive lag, avoiding empirical tunings as in ensemble-based DA methods. The adaptive online smoother is applied to studying three important scientific problems. First, it helps detect online causal relationships between state variables. Second, the advantage of reduced computational storage expenditure is illustrated via Lagrangian DA, a high-dimensional nonlinear problem. Finally, the adaptive smoother advances online parameter estimation with partial observations, emphasizing the role of the observed extreme events in accelerating convergence.</description>

      <title>Rigidity of the escaping set of certain H\'enon maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19358v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $H$ be a H\'enon map of the form $H(x,y)=(y,p(y)-ax)$. We prove that the escaping set $U^+$ (or equivalently, the non-escaping set $K^+$), of $H$ is rigid under the actions of automorphisms of $\mathbb{C}^2$ if the degree of $H=d\le |a|$. Specifically, every automorphism of $\mathbb{C}^2$ that preserves $U^+$, essentially takes the form $C \circ H^s$ where $s \in \mathbb{Z}$, and $C(x,y)=(\eta x, \eta^d y)$ with $\eta$ some $(d^2-1)$-root of unity.
  Consequently, we show that the automorphisms of the short $\mathbb{C}^2$'s, obtained as the sub-level sets of the (positive) Green's function corresponding to the H\'enon map $H$ for strictly positive values, are essentially linear maps of $\mathbb{C}^2$ preserving the escaping set $U^+$. Hence, the automorphism groups of these short $\mathbb{C}^2$'s are the same, finite, and form a subgroup of $\mathbb{Z}_{d^2-1}$.</description>

      <title>The prime number theorem over integers of power-free polynomial values</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00804v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $f(x)\in \mathbb{Z}[x]$ be an irreducible polynomial of degree $d\ge 1$. Let $k\ge2$ be an integer. The number of integers $n$ such that $f(n)$ is $k$-free is widely studied in the literature. In principle, one expects that $f(n)$ is $k$-free infinitely often, if $f$ has no fixed $k$-th power divisor. In 2022, Bergelson and Richter established a new dynamical generalization of the prime number theorem (PNT). Inspired by their work, one may expect that this generalization of the PNT also holds over integers of power-free polynomial values. In this note, we establish such variants of Bergelson and Richter's theorem for several polynomials studied by Estermann, Hooley, Heath-Brown, Booker and Browning.</description>

      <title>Efficient Parametric SVD of Koopman Operator for Stochastic Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07222v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Koopman operator provides a principled framework for analyzing nonlinear dynamical systems through linear operator theory. Recent advances in dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) have shown that trajectory data can be used to identify dominant modes of a system in a data-driven manner. Building on this idea, deep learning methods such as VAMPnet and DPNet have been proposed to learn the leading singular subspaces of the Koopman operator. However, these methods require backpropagation through potentially numerically unstable operations on empirical second moment matrices, such as singular value decomposition and matrix inversion, during objective computation, which can introduce biased gradient estimates and hinder scalability to large systems. In this work, we propose a scalable and conceptually simple method for learning the top-$k$ singular functions of the Koopman operator for stochastic dynamical systems based on the idea of low-rank approximation. Our approach eliminates the need for unstable linear-algebraic operations and integrates easily into modern deep learning pipelines. Empirical results demonstrate that the learned singular subspaces are both reliable and effective for downstream tasks such as eigen-analysis and multi-step prediction.</description>

      <title>A dimensional mass transference principle from balls to open sets and applications to dynamical Diophantine approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03359v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The mass transference principle of Beresnevich and Velani is a powerful mechanism for determining the Hausdorff dimension/measure of $\limsup$ sets that arise naturally in Diophantine approximation. However, in the setting of dynamical Diophantine approximation, this principle often fails to apply effectively, as the radii of the balls defining the dynamical $\limsup$ sets generally depend on the orbit of the point $x$ itself.
  In this paper, we develop a dimensional mass transference principle that enables us to recover and extend classical results on shrinking target problems, particularly for the $\beta$-transformation and the Gauss map. Moreover, our result shows that the corresponding $\limsup$ sets have large intersection properties. A potentially interesting feature of our method is that, in many cases, shrinking target problems are closely related to finding an appropriate Gibbs measure, which may reveal new aspects of the link between thermodynamic formalism and dynamical Diophantine approximation.</description>

Abstract: We prove the holding of chaos in the sense of Li-Yorke for a family of four-dimensional discrete dynamical systems that are naturally associated to ODEs systems describing coupled oscillators subject to an external non-conservative force, also giving an example of a discrete map that is Li-Yorke chaotic but not topologically transitive. Analytical results are generalized to a modular definition of the problem and to a system of nonlinear oscillators described by polynomial potentials in one coordinate. We perform numerical simulations looking for a strange attractor of the system; furthermore, we perform a bifurcation analysis of the system presenting 1D and 2D bifurcation diagrams, together with spectra of Lyapunov exponents and basins of attraction.</description>

      <title>On oscillator death in the Winfree model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01203v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that for the standard sinusoidal Winfree model, a coupling strength exceeding twice the maximal magnitude of the intrinsic frequencies guarantees the convergence of the system for Lebesgue almost every initial data. This is proven by first showing, via an order parameter bootstrapping argument, that the pathwise critical coupling strength is upper bounded by a function of the order parameter, and then showing by a volumetric argument that for Lebesgue almost every data the order parameter cannot stay below and be bounded away from 1 for all time; this is a Winfree model counterpart of the analysis of Ha and the author (2020) performed for the Kuramoto model. Using concentration of measure and the aforementioned volumetric argument, we show that, except possibly on a set of very small measure, oscillator death is observed in finite time; this rigorously demonstrates the existence of the oscillator death regime numerically observed by Ariaratnam and Strogatz (2001). These results are robust under many other choices of interaction functions often considered for the Winfree model. We demonstrate that the asymptotic dynamics described in this paper are sharp by analyzing the equilibria of the Winfree model, and we bound the total number of equilibria using a polynomial description.</description>

      <title>Fast Surrogate Models for Adaptive Aircraft Trajectory Prediction in En route Airspace</title>

Abstract: Trajectory prediction (TP) is crucial for ensuring safety and efficiency in modern air traffic management systems. It is, for example, a core component of conflict detection and resolution tools, arrival sequencing algorithms, capacity planning, as well as several future concepts. However, TP accuracy within operational systems is hampered by a range of epistemic uncertainties such as the mass and performance settings of aircraft and the effect of meteorological conditions on aircraft performance. It can also require considerable computational resources.
  This paper proposes a method for adaptive TP that has two components: first, a fast surrogate TP model based on linear state space models (LSSM)s with an execution time that was 6.7 times lower on average than an implementation of the Base of Aircraft Data (BADA) in Python. It is demonstrated that such models can effectively emulate the BADA aircraft performance model, which is based on the numerical solution of a partial differential equation (PDE), and that the LSSMs can be fitted to trajectories in a dataset of historic flight data. Secondly, the paper proposes an algorithm to assimilate radar observations using particle filtering to adaptively refine TP accuracy. Comparison with baselines using BADA and Kalman filtering demonstrate that the proposed framework improves system identification and state estimation for both climb and descent phases, with 46.3% and 64.7% better estimates for time to top of climb and bottom of descent compared to the best performing benchmark model. In particular, the particle filtering approach provides the flexibility to capture non-linear performance effects including the CAS-Mach transition.</description>

      <title>On difference sets of dense subsets of $\mathbb{Z}^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03797</link>

Abstract: In this article, we study the structure of the difference set $E - E$ for subsets $E \subseteq \mathbb{Z}^2$ of positive upper Banach density. Fish asked in [Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. 146 (2018), 3449-3453] whether, for every such set $E$, there exists a nonzero integer $k$ such that $k \cdot \mathbb{Z} \subseteq \{\, xy : (x,y) \in E - E \,\}.$ Although this question remains open, we establish a relatively weaker form of this conjecture. Specifically, we prove that if $\langle a_j\rangle_{j=1}^m$ is any finite sequence in $\mathbb{N},$ then there exist infinitely many integers $k \in \mathbb{Z}$ and a sequence $\langle x_n \rangle_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ in $\mathbb{Z}$ such that $k \cdot MT\left(\langle a_j \rangle_{j=1}^m, \langle x_n\rangle_{n}\right) \subseteq \{\, xy : (x,y) \in E - E \,\},$ where $MT\left(\langle a_j \rangle_{j=1}^m, \langle x_n\rangle_{n}\right)$ denotes the milliken-Taylor configuration generated by the sequences $\langle a_j\rangle_{j=1}^m$ and $\langle x_n \rangle_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$.</description>
