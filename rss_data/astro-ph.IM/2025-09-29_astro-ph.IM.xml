      <title>Advanced stereoscopy applied to CTAO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) is an international observatory currently under construction, which will consist of two sites (one in the Northern Hemisphere and one in the Southern Hemisphere). It will eventually be the largest and most sensitive ground-based gamma-ray observatory. In the meantime, a small subarray composed of four Large-Sized Telescopes (LSTs) at the Northern site will begin collecting data in the coming year. In preparation, we present a stereoscopic event reconstruction using graph neural networks (GNNs) to combine information from several telescopes of this subarray. In our previous work, we explored the use of GNNs for the stereoscopic reconstruction of gamma-ray events on simulated data from the Prod5 sample and showed that GNNs provide a better stereoscopic reconstruction. We now compare this approach to the currently foreseen method that analytically combines the output of monoscopic random forests, and explore how GNNs can be used in fusion with the Random forest algorithm in order to provide a more sensitive stereoscopic system.</description>

      <title>Debris disks and their properties with the Habitable Worlds Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of the last stages of planet formation, also known as debris disks, is fundamental to place constrains on the formation of planetary sized bodies. Debris disks are composed of dust and occasionally small amounts of gas, both released through dynamical interactions of small rocky bodies and dust particles, such as collisions and evaporation. The distribution of the dust can reveal the presence of forming planets and its composition can directly trace that of comets, asteroids and even planets. While we have been observing debris disks for 40 years now, most observations so far have been restricted to the cold outer regions of the system, and therefore information of the terrestrial zone is still missing. The improved spatial resolution, inner working angle and sensitivity that the Habitable Worlds Observatory will provide will enable a much closer look into the structure and composition of debris disks (particularly of its inner region) and enable the search for the forming rocky planets within the disk.</description>

      <title>First Light for the GRAVITY+ Adaptive Optics: Extreme Adaptive Optics for the Very Large Telescope Interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GRAVITY+ improves by orders of magnitude the sensitivity, sky-coverage and contrast of the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI). A central part of this project is the development of Gravity Plus Adaptive Optics (GPAO), a dedicated high-order and laser-guide star Adaptive Optics (AO) system for VLTI. GPAO consists of four state-of-the-art AO systems equipping all 8m-class Unit Telescopes (UTs) for the wavefront correction of the VLTI instruments. It offers both visible and infrared Natural Guide Star (NGS) and Laser Guide Star (LGS) operations. The paper presents the design, operations and performances of GPAO. We illustrate the improvement brought by GPAO with interferometric observations obtained during the commissioning of the NGS mode end-2024. These science results include the first optical interferometry observations of a redshift $z\sim4$ quasar, the spectroscopy of a cool brown-dwarf with magnitude $K\sim 21.0$, the first observations of a Class I young star with GRAVITY, and the first sub-micro arcsecond differential astrometry in the optical. Together with the entire GRAVITY+ project, the implementation of GPAO is a true paradigm shift for observing the optical Universe at very high angular resolution.</description>

      <title>Performance characterization of a new Structural and Thermal Architecture for a future spaceborne Closed-Cycle Dilution Refrigerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Structural and Thermal Model (STM) has been developed to support the new spaceborne Closed-Cycle Dilution Refrigerator (CCDR), which aims to provide continuous cooling at 100~mK for long-duration astrophysical missions. The STM is based on a hexapod architecture that ensures both thermal decoupling and mechanical robustness during launch. In this paper, we present the characterization of its thermal and mechanical performances. A dedicated experimental setup was used to investigate the thermal behavior of the STM across a broad temperature range. The study reveals limitations of the collar design, with incomplete power interception from thermal boundary resistances and vibration test failure traced to defective strut gluing. These results guide the next STM iteration with optimized collar and strut assembly for reliable CCDR operation in space.</description>

      <title>FITrig: A High-Performance Detection Technique for Efficient Ultra-Long-Period Pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-long-period (ULP) pulsars, a newly identified class of celestial transients, offer unique insights into astrophysics, though very few have been detected to date. In radio astronomy, most time-domain detection methods cannot find these pulsars, and current image-based detection approaches still face challenges, including low sensitivity, high false positive rate, and low computational efficiency. In this article, we develop Fast Imaging Trigger (FITrig), a GPU-accelerated, statistics-based method for ULP pulsar detection and localisation. FITrig includes two complementary approaches -- an image domain and an image-frequency domain strategy. FITrig offers advantages by increasing sensitivity to faint pulsars, suppressing false positives (from noise, processing artefacts, or steady sources), and improving search efficiency in large-scale wide-field images. Compared to the state-of-the-art source finder SOFIA 2, FITrig increases the detection speed by 4.3 times for large images (50K x 50K pixels) and reduces false positives by up to 858.8 times (at 6$\sigma$ significance) for the image domain branch, while the image-frequency domain branch suppresses false positives even further. FITrig maintains the capability to detect pulsars that are 20 times fainter than surrounding steady features, even under critical Nyquist sampling conditions. In this article, the performance of FITrig is demonstrated using both real-world data (MeerKAT observations of PSR J0901-4046) and simulated datasets based on MeerKAT and SKA AA2 telescope configurations. With its real-time processing capabilities and scalability, FITrig is a promising tool for next-generation telescopes, such as the SKA, with the potential to uncover hidden ULP pulsars.</description>

      <title>Optimization procedure of the baffle of the GroundBIRD Telescope to mitigate stray light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We presented the optimization procedures of the baffle mounted on the GroundBIRD telescope for measuring the polarization of the Cosmic Microwave Background~(CMB). The telescope employs dual mirror reflective telescopes installed in a cryostat. The primary objectives were to minimize stray light contamination, maintain the integrity of the main beam, and ensure that thermal loading from the baffle remains significantly below that from the atmosphere. Using quasi-optical simulations, we have optimized the baffle's aperture angle to suppress stray light without degrading the main beam quality. We confirmed through Moon observations that the optimized baffle design works to eliminate the contamination of the stray light as expected. Furthermore, no measurable degradation in the noise equivalent temperature~(NET) was detected, indicating minimal thermal impact. These results show that our baffle optimization strategy effectively reduces systematic errors while maintaining observational sensitivity, providing valuable insights for future CMB experiments with similar optical architectures.</description>

      <title>Next-day observation processing for the LST-1 and MAGIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The MAGIC and LST-1 telescopes, located at the Roque de los Muchachos Observatory on La Palma, operate dedicated On-Site Analysis (OSA) pipelines that provide rapid, automated processing of observational data. These systems produce high-level data products just a few hours after observations are completed, enabling quick-look analyses, next-day data quality assessments, and rapid-response science such as flare detection and Target of Opportunity follow-ups. OSA pipelines have been in continuous operation since 2012 for MAGIC and since 2021 for LST-1, automatically processing nightly data using the standard analysis chain. The experience gained from both systems provides essential lessons for the development of Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory's (CTAO's) on-site analysis, demonstrating the practical and scientific benefits of fast data processing in Cherenkov telescopes.</description>

      <title>N+2 Mapmaking for Polarized CMB Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce N+2 mapmaking as a novel approach to constructing maps in both intensity and polarization for multi-detector CMB data. The motivation behind this method is two-fold: Firstly, it provides individual temperature detector maps from a multi-detector set, which may be useful for component separation purposes, in particular for line emission reconstruction. Secondly, it simultaneously outputs coadded polarization maps with minimal temperature-to-polarization leakage sensitivity. Algorithmically speaking, the N+2 mapmaker is closely related to the `spurious mapmaking' algorithm pioneered by the WMAP team, but rather than solving for a spurious S map together with the three normal Stokes IQU parameters, we solve for N temperature maps and two Stokes (Q and U) parameters per pixel. The result is a statistically coherent set of physically meaningful per-detector temperature maps, each with slightly different bandpasses as defined by each detector, combined with coadded polarization maps. We test this approach on Planck Low Frequency Instrument (LFI) 30 GHz data, and find that the Planck scanning strategy is too poorly cross-linked to allow for a clean separation between temperature and polarization. However, noting that pairs of detectors within a single horn are strongly anti-correlated, we anticipate that solving for horn maps, as opposed to individual detector maps, may provide an optimal compromise between noise and temperature-to-polarization leakage minimization. When applied to simulated data with a rotating half-wave plate, for which the polarization angle coverage is greatly improved, the algorithm performs as expected.</description>

      <title>The Simons Observatory: Characterization of the 220/280 GHz TES Detector Modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Simons Observatory (SO) is a new suite of cosmic microwave background telescopes in the Chilean Atacama Desert with an extensive science program spanning cosmology, Galactic and extragalactic astrophysics, and particle physics. SO will survey the millimeter-wave sky over a wide range of angular scales using six spectral bands across three types of dichroic, polarization-sensitive transition-edge sensor (TES) detector modules: Low-Frequency (LF) modules with bandpasses centered near 30 and 40 GHz, Mid-Frequency (MF) modules near 90 and 150 GHz, and Ultra-High-Frequency (UHF) modules near 220 and 280 GHz. Twenty-five UHF detector modules, each containing 1720 optically-coupled TESs connected to microwave SQUID multiplexing readout, have now been produced. This work summarizes the pre-deployment characterization of these detector modules in laboratory cryostats. Across all UHF modules, we find an average operable TES yield of 83%, equating to over 36,000 devices tested. The distributions of (220, 280) GHz saturation powers have medians of (24, 26) pW, near the centers of their target ranges. For both bands, the median optical efficiency is 0.6, the median effective time constant is 0.4 ms, and the median dark noise-equivalent power (NEP) is ~40 aW/rtHz. The expected photon NEPs at (220, 280) GHz are (64, 99) aW/rtHz, indicating these detectors will achieve background-limited performance on the sky. Thirty-nine UHF and MF detector modules are currently operating in fielded SO instruments, which are transitioning from the commissioning stage to full science observations.</description>

      <title>Hyper-py: HYbrid Photometry and Extraction Routine in PYthon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Hyper-Py, a fully restructured and extended Python implementation of HYPER (HYbrid Photometry and Extraction Routine, Traficante et al. 2015). HYPER was originally implemented in IDL, aiming to deliver robust and reproducible photometry of compact sources in FIR/sub-mm/mm maps. HYPER combines source detection via high-pass filtering, background estimation through local polynomial fitting, and source modeling with 2D elliptical Gaussians, simultaneously fitting multiple Gaussians to deblend overlapping sources. Hyper-Py preserves the original logic while offering improvements in performance, configurability, and background modeling capabilities, making it a flexible modern tool for source extraction and photometry across diverse datasets. Notably, Hyper-Py enables background estimation and subtraction across individual slices of 3D datacubes, allowing consistent background modeling along the spectral axis for line or continuum studies in spectrally resolved observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark matter halos are fundamental structures in cosmology, forming the gravitational potential wells hosting galaxies and clusters of galaxies. Their properties and statistical distribution (including the halo mass function) are invaluable tools to infer the fundamental properties of the Universe. The \texttt{halox} package is a JAX-powered Python library enabling differentiable and accelerated computations of key properties of dark matter halos, and of the halo mass function. The automatic differentiation capabilities of \texttt{halox} enable its usage in gradient-based workflows, e.g. in efficient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling or machine learning applications.</description>

      <title>Forecasting Seismic Waveforms: A Deep Learning Approach for Einstein Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce \textit{SeismoGPT}, a transformer-based model for forecasting three-component seismic waveforms in the context of future gravitational wave detectors like the Einstein Telescope. The model is trained in an autoregressive setting and can operate on both single-station and array-based inputs. By learning temporal and spatial dependencies directly from waveform data, SeismoGPT captures realistic ground motion patterns and provides accurate short-term forecasts. Our results show that the model performs well within the immediate prediction window and gradually degrades further ahead, as expected in autoregressive systems. This approach lays the groundwork for data-driven seismic forecasting that could support Newtonian noise mitigation and real-time observatory control.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.21467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An international conference Radio Stars in the Era of New Observatories was held at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Haystack Observatory on 2024 April 17-19. The conference brought together more than 60 researchers from around the world, united by an interest in using radio wavelength observations to explore the physical processes that operate in stars (including the Sun), how stars evolve and interact with their environments, and the role of radio stars as probes of our Galaxy. Topics discussed at the meeting included radio emission from cool and ultracool dwarfs, extrasolar space weather, stellar masers, thermal radio emission from evolved stars, circumstellar chemistry, low frequency observations of the Sun, radio emission from hot stars, applications of very long baseline interferometry techniques to stellar astrophysics, stellar explosive events, the detection of radio stars in the latest generation of widefield sky surveys, the importance of radio stars for understanding the structure and evolution of the Milky Way, and the anticipated applications for stellar astrophysics of future radio observatories on the ground and in space. This article summarizes research topics and results featured at the conference, along with some background and contextual information. It also highlights key outstanding questions in stellar astrophysics where new insights are anticipated from the next generation of observational facilities operating at meter through submillimeter wavelengths.</description>

      <title>Automating Sensor Characterization with Bayesian Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of novel instrumentation requires an iterative cycle with three stages: design, prototyping, and testing. Recent advancements in simulation and nanofabrication techniques have significantly accelerated the design and prototyping phases. Nonetheless, detector characterization continues to be a major bottleneck in device development. During the testing phase, a significant time investment is required to characterize the device in different operating conditions and find optimal operating parameters. The total effort spent on characterization and parameter optimization can occupy a year or more of an expert's time. In this work, we present a novel technique for automated sensor calibration that aims to accelerate the testing stage of the development cycle. This technique leverages closed-loop Bayesian optimization (BO), using real-time measurements to guide parameter selection and identify optimal operating states. We demonstrate the method with a novel low-noise CCD, showing that the machine learning-driven tool can efficiently characterize and optimize operation of the sensor in a couple of days without supervision of a device expert.</description>

      <title>Baseline-Aware Dependence fitting for DAmping Timescales (BADDAT): A Nearly Unbiased Approach to Constraining Optical Variability Dependence on Physical Properties of Active Galactic Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) exhibit stochastic optical variability, commonly characterized by a damped random walk. The damping timescale is of particular interest because it is related to fundamental properties of the central black hole, such as its mass and accretion rate. However, the systematic underestimation of damping timescales caused by limited observational baselines makes it difficult to exhaustively utilize all available data. Many previous efforts have relied on strict selection criteria to avoid biased measurements, and such criteria inevitably constrain the range of AGN physical parameter space and therefore hinder robust inference of the underlying dependencies of damping timescale on AGN properties. In contrast, we introduce a novel forward modeling approach, Baseline-Aware Dependence fitting for DAmping Timescales (BADDAT), which explicitly accounts for these biases and leverages the information contained in underestimated timescale measurements. Rather than attempting to correct individual timescale measurements, BADDAT robustly constrains the population-level dependence of damping timescale on AGN physical properties. We demonstrate its effectiveness using mock light curves and show that it successfully reconciles previous inconsistent results based on two independent AGN samples. Our BADDAT method will have broad applications in AGN variability studies during the era of time-domain astronomy.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Early Universe with Deep Learning</title>

Abstract: Hydrogen is the most abundant element in our Universe. The first generation of stars and galaxies produced photons that ionized hydrogen gas, driving a cosmological event known as the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). The upcoming Square Kilometre Array Observatory (SKAO) will map the distribution of neutral hydrogen during this era, aiding in the study of the properties of these first-generation objects. Extracting astrophysical information will be challenging, as SKAO will produce a tremendous amount of data where the hydrogen signal will be contaminated with undesired foreground contamination and instrumental systematics. To address this, we develop the latest deep learning techniques to extract information from the 2D power spectra of the hydrogen signal expected from SKAO. We apply a series of neural network models to these measurements and quantify their ability to predict the history of cosmic hydrogen reionization, which is connected to the increasing number and efficiency of early photon sources. We show that the study of the early Universe benefits from modern deep learning technology. In particular, we demonstrate that dedicated machine learning algorithms can achieve more than a $0.95$ $R^2$ score on average in recovering the reionization history. This enables accurate and precise cosmological and astrophysical inference of structure formation in the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Background stability and annual modulation test using PICOLON ultra-pure NaI(Tl) detector</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dark matter observation claimed by the DAMA/LIBRA experiment has been a long-standing puzzle within the particle physics community. NaI(Tl) crystals with radiopurity comparable to DAMA/LIBRA's are essential for adequate verification. Existing experiments using NaI(Tl) target have been hampered by the high radioactivity concentration of NaI(Tl) crystals. PICOLON experiment conducts an independent search for Weakly Interacting Massive Particles using highest purity NaI(Tl) crystals. In 2020, the NaI(Tl) crystal (Ingot#85) reached the same purity level as DAMA/LIBRA crystals. The DAMA/LIBRA group has stressed that verifying their signal requires high-purity NaI(Tl) crystals with long-term stability. Based on a six-month measurement, we have confirmed the long-term stability of its radiopurity. This stability provides a significant advantage for future efforts to adequately verify the DAMA/LIBRA result using NaI(Tl) crystal. In this paper, we present the background stability of purity in the Ingot#94 NaI(Tl) detector, which was produced using the Ingot#85 purification method, along with the first annual modulation search conducted by the PICOLON experiment.</description>

      <title>Galaxy Zoo: Cosmic Dawn -- morphological classifications for over 41,000 galaxies in the Euclid Deep Field North from the Hawaii Two-0 Cosmic Dawn survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present morphological classifications of over 41,000 galaxies out to $z_{\rm phot}\sim2.5$ across six square degrees of the Euclid Deep Field North (EDFN) from the Hawaii Twenty Square Degree (H20) survey, a part of the wider Cosmic Dawn survey. Galaxy Zoo citizen scientists play a crucial role in the examination of large astronomical data sets through crowdsourced data mining of extragalactic imaging. This iteration, Galaxy Zoo: Cosmic Dawn (GZCD), saw tens of thousands of volunteers and the deep learning foundation model Zoobot collectively classify objects in ultra-deep multiband Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) imaging down to a depth of $m_{HSC-i} = 21.5$. Here, we present the details and general analysis of this iteration, including the use of Zoobot in an active learning cycle to improve both model performance and volunteer experience, as well as the discovery of 51 new gravitational lenses in the EDFN. We also announce the public data release of the classifications for over 45,000 subjects, including more than 41,000 galaxies (median $z_{\rm phot}$ of $0.42\pm0.23$), along with their associated image cutouts. This data set provides a valuable opportunity for follow-up imaging of objects in the EDFN as well as acting as a truth set for training deep learning models for application to ground-based surveys like that of the newly operational Vera C. Rubin Observatory.</description>

      <title>Engaging and Educating Eclipse Observers Through Workshops, Media, Planetarium shows and Citizen Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Heliophysics Big Year was an extended year where major solar events engaged the public. It included two eclipses (annular on October 14, 2023 and total on April 8, 2024), plus solar max and the Parker Solar Probe perihelion December 24, 2024. After the eclipse of 2017, many millions more Americans planned to view the solar corona. We expanded our eclipse website with activities, citizen science projects, resources, training videos, equipment, and external links. We were the Southwest Regional Coordinator for Citizen CATE 2024 project, training the state coordinators and their teams with the equipment and procedures. We trained teachers at local, regional, national, and international workshops, providing eclipse viewing cards, lenses to make solar cup projectors, a safe viewing screen pattern, and access to the training materials. We made presentations to the media and hosted public events to demonstrate safe eclipse viewing techniques. HMNS hosted live viewing for the annular and total plus solstice and equinox events, reaching tens of thousands of people. HMNS also secured a grant to provide 100 eclipse viewing cards for every public school (8,800+) in Texas. We distributed another 57,000 eclipse viewers to teachers and the public. We appeared in media both in advance of the eclipses and as live commentators. The most lasting and impactful product was our planetarium show Totality, which was given away free and shown in various formats (flatscreen, fisheye, or prewarped). Over 180,000 views of the show and its animations have been documented. We continued to improve our space weather forecasting site, which correctly predicted the major solar storms of May 10-11 and October 8-10, 2024. In total, we reached nearly two million learners.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rapid and reliable detection and dissemination of source parameter estimation data products from gravitational-wave events, especially sky localization, is critical for maximizing the potential of multi-messenger astronomy. Machine learning based detection and parameter estimation algorithms are emerging as production ready alternatives to traditional approaches. Here, we report validation studies of AMPLFI, a likelihood-free inference solution to low-latency parameter estimation of binary black holes. We use simulated signals added into data from the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA's (LVK's) third observing run (O3) to compare sky localization performance with BAYESTAR, the algorithm currently in production for rapid sky localization of candidates from matched-filter pipelines. We demonstrate sky localization performance, measured by searched area and volume, to be equivalent with BAYESTAR. We show accurate reconstruction of source parameters with uncertainties for use distributing low-latency coarse-grained chirp mass information. In addition, we analyze several candidate events reported by the LVK in the third gravitational-wave transient catalog (GWTC-3) and show consistency with the LVK's analysis. Altogether, we demonstrate AMPLFI's ability to produce data products for low-latency public alerts.</description>

      <title>Outer Solar System spacecraft to probe the $\mu$Hz gravitational wave frontier</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15072v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The microhertz frequency band of gravitational waves probes the merger of supermassive black holes as well as many other gravitational wave phenomena. However, space-interferometry methods that use test masses would require further development of test-mass isolation systems to detect anticipated astrophysical events. We propose an approach that avoids onboard inertial test masses by situating spacecraft in the low-acceleration environment of the outer Solar System. We show that for Earth-spacecraft and inter-spacecraft distances of $\gtrsim 10$ AU, the accelerations on the spacecraft would be sufficiently small to potentially achieve gravitational wave sensitivities determined by stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds. We further argue, for arm lengths of $10-30$ AU and $\sim 10$ Watt transmissions, that stable phase locks could be achieved with 20 cm mirrors or 5 m radio dishes. We discuss designs that send both laser beams and radio waves between the spacecraft, finding that, despite the $\sim10^4\times$ longer wavelengths, even a design with radio transmissions could reach stochastic background-limited sensitivities at $\lesssim 0.3\times 10^{-4}$ Hz. Operating in the radio significantly reduces many spacecraft design tolerances. Our baseline concepts require two arms to do interferometry. However, if one spacecraft carries a clock with Allan deviations at $10^4$ seconds of $10^{-17}$, a comparable sensitivity could be achieved with a single arm. Finally, we discuss the feasibility of achieving similar gravitational wave sensitivities in a `Doppler tracking' configuration where the single arm is anchored to Earth.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.21034v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we detail recent and current work that is being carried out to fabricate and advance novel SiC UV instrumentation that is aimed at enabling more sensitive measurements across numerous disciplines, with a short discussion of the promise such detectors may hold for the Habitable Worlds Observatory. We discuss SiC instrument development progress that is being carried out under multiple NASA grants, including several PICASSO and SBIR grants, as well as an ECI grant. Testing of pixel design, properties and layout as well as maturation of the integration scheme developed through these efforts provide key technology and engineering advancement for potential HWO detectors. Achieving desired noise characteristics, responsivity, and validating operation of SiC detectors using standard read out techniques offers a compelling platform for operation of denser and higher dimensionality SiC photodiode arrays of interest for use in potential HWO Coronagraph, Spectrograph, and High Resolution Imaging Instruments. We incorporate these SiC detector properties into a simulation of potential NUV exoplanet observations by HWO using SiC detectors and also discuss potential application to HWO.</description>

      <title>CWT-LSTM Autoencoder: A Novel Approach for Gravitational Wave Detection in LIGO Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10505v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational wave detection requires sophisticated signal processing to identify weak astrophysical signals buried in instrumental noise. Traditional matched filtering approaches face computational challenges with diverse signal morphologies and non-stationary noise. This work presents a deep learning methodology integrating Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) preprocessing with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) autoencoder architecture for gravitational wave detection. The CWT provides optimal time-frequency decomposition capturing chirp evolution and transient characteristics essential for compact binary coalescence identification. We first develop the model using synthetic datasets incorporating binary black hole merger signals with masses ranging from 10 to 80 solar masses. These signals are then embedded in colored Gaussian noise representative of Advanced LIGO sensitivity. The trained model demonstrates strong performance metrics. We then apply the CWT-LSTM model to gravitational wave data from multiple LIGO observing runs. We use 418 clean noise samples for training the anomaly detection model, while the test dataset contained a mix of 24 confirmed gravitational wave events and 161 noise samples. The model demonstrates strong performance with an AUC of 0.979 and Average Precision (AP) of 0.932, achieving a precision of 1.0 at the optimal threshold with a recall of 0.83. The reconstruction error distribution shows clear separation between noise and gravitational wave signals, with noise samples clustering around 0.45 and signals around 0.65. This unsupervised approach enables discovery of signals with unknown morphologies that could provide complementary "blind search" capability for detecting exotic astrophysical sources and novel physics beyond current theoretical models.</description>

      <title>Attention U-Net for all-sky continuous gravitational wave searches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19838v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Detecting continuous gravitational waves is challenging due to the high computational cost of template-based searches across large parameter spaces, particularly for all-sky searches. Machine learning offers a promising solution to perform these searches with reasonable computational resources. In this study, we trained an attention U-Net, a convolutional neural network, on $\approx$ 10.67 days of simulated data with Gaussian noise for all-sky searches at different frequencies within the 20-1000 Hz band. Our model trained at 20 Hz achieves the best sensitivity, with a 90% detection efficiency sensitivity depth $D^{90\%} = 29.97 \pm 0.24\,\mathrm{Hz}^{-1/2}$ with a 1% false alarm rate per 50 mHz, while the model trained on the entire 20-1000 Hz band yields $D^{90\%} = 18.63 \pm 0.24\,\mathrm{Hz}^{-1/2}$. The sensitivities achieved are comparable to state-of-the-art results using deep learning approaches, with less than 50% of the training time and data. We find that sensitivity scales as $T^{0.28 \pm 0.01}$ with total observation time for the attention U-Net trained at 20 Hz, similar to semi-coherent search methods. The neural network demonstrates robustness on datasets with time gaps, with sensitivity dependence on duty factor analyzed. We also investigated the sensitivity dependence of the trained attention U-Net models on sky location. Our findings show that attention U-Net is a scalable and effective approach for all-sky continuous gravitational wave searches.</description>

      <title>An Educational Guide for 2D Stellar Structure Calculations of Rapidly Rotating Stars using the ESTER code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20264v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Evolution STEllaire en Rotation (ESTER) code is the first 2D stellar structure code to be made open-source and freely available to the astronomy and astrophysics community. An important and novel advancement of this code is that it can reproduce the distorted shape and observable signatures (e.g., gravity darkening) of rapidly rotating stars. ESTER also calculates the steady-state large-scale flows within the star, namely their differential rotation and associated meridional circulation. In this report, we explore and document the physics implemented within version 1.1.0rc2 of the ESTER code, in a way that complements published descriptions. We illustrate this physics by plotting how stellar structure parameters vary through stellar interiors at a range of latitudes and at different angular velocities. We investigate how the thin convective envelopes of intermediate mass stars vary with latitude when rapidly rotating, becoming deeper and thicker near the equator. Simple comparisons of ESTER model predictions (e.g., central temperature and density, luminosity) with the output from the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) code [Paxton et al., 2010] shows generally good agreement. Additional comparisons provide important benchmarking and verification for ESTER as a comparatively young code. Finally, we provide a guide for installing and running the code on our local university cluster, aimed at helping students to begin work.</description>

      <title>Regression of Suspension Violin Modes in KAGRA O3GK Data with Kalman Filters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20658v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Suspension thermal modes in interferometric gravitational-wave detectors produce narrow, high-Q spectral lines that can contaminate gravitational searches and bias parameter estimation. In KAGRA, cryogenic mirrors are held by thick suspension fibers, designed to sustain such low-temperature environment, which may further affects inharmonicity modes, fiber dimensions, and mechanical behavior compared to typical interferometers. Remaining a prominent source of narrowband contamination, we implement a Kalman filter to model and track violin lines, building on the methodology introduced in [1], and apply subtraction to KAGRA O3GK data. Using gravitational-wave template injections, we validate that the subtraction preserves matched-filter SNR while effectively suppressing line power. Comparisons of power spectral densities and residual analyses confirm that the method removes deterministic line contributions without introducing waveform distortions. This approach provides a cleaner strain channel for searches and parameter estimation and will become increasingly important for future low-temperature detectors with higher-Q suspensions, such as the Einstein Telescope.</description>
