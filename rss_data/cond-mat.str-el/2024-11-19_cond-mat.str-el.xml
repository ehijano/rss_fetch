      <title>Nonresonant nonlinear magnonics in an antiferromagnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antiferromagnets exhibit rapid spin dynamics in a net zero magnetic background which enables novel spintronic applications and interrogation of many-body quantum phenomena. The layered antiferromagnet Sr$_2$IrO$_4$ hosts an exotic spin one-half Mott insulating state with an electronic gap arising from on-site Coulomb repulsion and strong spin-orbit coupling. This makes Sr$_2$IrO$_4$ an interesting candidate to interrogate dynamical attributes of the magnetic order using ultrafast laser pulses. We investigate the magnetization dynamics of Sr$_2$IrO$_4$ following circularly-polarized photoexcitation with below-gap mid-infrared (mid-IR -- 9 $\mu m$) and above-gap near-infrared (near-IR -- 1.3 $\mu m$) pulses. In both cases, we observe excitation of a zone-center coherent magnon mode featuring a 0.5 THz oscillation in the pump-induced Kerr-rotation signal. However, only below-gap excitation exhibits a helicity dependent response and linear (quadratic) scaling of the coherent magnon amplitude with excitation fluence (electric field). Moreover, below-gap excitation has a magnon generation efficiency that is at least two orders of magnitude greater in comparison to above-gap excitation. Our analysis indicates that the helicity dependence and enhanced generation efficiency arises from a unique one-photon two-magnon coupling mechanism for magnon generation. Thus, preferential spin-photon coupling without photoexcitation of electrons permits extremely efficient magnon generation. Our results reveal new possibilities for ultrafast control of antiferromagnets.</description>

      <title>Renormalization of the optical band gap in massive Dirac-like systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the mass renormalization for massive Dirac-like systems in (2+1)D due to the electron-phonon interaction at finite temperatures within the large-$N$ expansion. Our model combines the low-energy limit of charge carriers in a buckled honeycomb lattice with the low-energy approximation for phonons and the electron-phonon interaction in a two-dimensional material. Hence, we obtain a massive Dirac-like field interacting with a two-component vector field $\mathcal{A}_i$, describing the phonon field. This provides a one-loop electron self-energy at finite temperature and, from this, we calculate the renormalized band gap $m_R$. Thereafter, our effective model is applied for describing the renormalized optical band gap in monolayers of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), such as MoS$_2$, MoSe$_2$, WS$_2$, and WSe$_2$, where a good agreement is found for reasonable values of our ultraviolet cutoff $\Lambda\approx 1$ eV. The main result establishes that, at low temperatures, $m_R$ is almost constant while for higher temperatures it is a decreasing linear function of the temperature $T$. We obtain that $m_R$ decreases about $\approx [0.1,0.2]$ eV whenever we increase the temperature from $\approx 4$ K to $500$ K, which is consistent with recent experimental measurements. We also estimate the temperature at which we should observe the transition to the linear regime and obtain typical values in the interval $\approx[110,150]$ K from the four materials we have considered.</description>

      <title>Observation of the Yamaji effect in a cuprate superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pseudogap state of high-$T_{\rm c}$ cuprates, known for its partial gapping of the Fermi surface above the superconducting transition temperature $T_{\rm c}$, is believed to hold the key to understanding the origin of Planckian relaxation and quantum criticality. However, the nature of the Fermi surface in the pseudogap state has remained a fundamental open question. Here, we report the observation of the Yamaji effect above $T_{\rm c}$ in the single layer cuprate HgBa$_2$CuO$_{4+\delta}$. This observation is direct evidence of closed Fermi surface pockets in the normal state of the pseudogap phase. The small size of the pockets determined from the Yamaji effect (occupying approximately $1.3\%$ of the Brillouin zone area) is all the more surprising given the absence of evidence for long-range broken translational symmetry that can reconstruct the Fermi-surface.</description>

      <title>Stability frontiers in the AM$_6$X$_6$ kagome metals; The LnNb$_6$Sn$_6$ (Ln:Ce-Lu,Y) family and density-wave transition in LuNb$_6$Sn$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The kagome motif is a versatile platform for condensed matter physics, hosting rich interactions between magnetic, electronic, and structural degrees of freedom. In recent years, the discovery of a charge density wave (CDW) in the AV$_3$Sb$_5$ superconductors and structurally-derived bond density waves in FeGe and ScV$_6$Sn$_6$ have stoked the search for new kagome platforms broadly exhibiting density wave (DW) transitions. In this work, we evaluate the known AM$_6$X$_6$ chemistries and construct a stability diagram that summarizes the structural relationships between the $\approx$125 member family. Subsequently we introduce our discovery of the broader LnNb$_6$Sn$_6$ (Ln:Ce-Nd,Sm,Gd-Tm,Lu,Y) family of kagome metals and an analogous DW transition in LuNb$_6$Sn$_6$. Our X-ray scattering measurements clearly indicate a (1/3, 1/3, 1/3) ordering wave vector ($\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}\times3$ superlattice) and diffuse scattering on half-integer $L$-planes. Our analysis of the structural data supports the ``rattling mode'' DW model proposed for ScV$_6$Sn$_6$ and paints a detailed picture of the steric interactions between the rare-earth filler element and the host Nb-Sn kagome scaffolding. We also provide a broad survey of the magnetic properties within the HfFe$_6$Ge$_6$-type LnNb$_6$Sn$_6$ members, revealing a number of complex antiferromagnetic and metamagnetic transitions throughout the family. This work integrates our new LnNb$_6$Sn$_6$ series of compounds into the broader AM$_6$X$_6$ family, providing new material platforms and forging a new route forward at the frontier of kagome metal research.</description>

      <title>Light-Induced Subpicosecond Topological Phase Transition by Tuning Magnetic Order in Antiferromagnetic Dirac Semimetal EuAgAs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the observation of a light-induced subpicosecond topological phase transition in the antiferromagnetic Dirac semimetal EuAgAs, achieved through precise manipulation of its magnetic configuration. Using ultrafast optical spectroscopy, we probe the nonequilibrium carrier dynamics and reveal a magnetic-order-driven transition between distinct topological states. Our results demonstrate that EuAgAs, with its highly tunable magnetic structure, offers a unique platform for exploring topological phase transitions, distinct from conventional methods like Floquet engineering, coherent-phonon excitation, and lattice structural modifications. These results underscore the potential of ultrashort optical pulses as powerful tools for real-time control of topological phases, opening pathways for advances in spintronics, quantum computing, and energy-efficient information technologies.</description>

      <title>Temperature dependence of charge transport in the half-filled 1D Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of hydrodynamic transport theory seems to indicate that the charge diffusion constant D of the one-dimensional (1D) half-filled Hubbard model, whose Drude weight vanishes, diverges for temperature T&gt;0, which would imply anomalous superdiffusive charge transport. Here the leading term of that constant is derived for low finite temperatures much smaller than the the Mott-Hubbard gap. It only diverges in the temperature infinite limit, being finite and decreasing upon increasing T within the low-temperature regime. Our exact results both provide valuable physical information ona complex quantum problem and bring about the interesting unsolved issue of how charge transport evolves from normal diffusive for low temperatures to anomalous superdiffusive in the infinite temperature limit.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium THz-phonon spin coupling in CrI3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Manipulating magnetism at the THz timescale in atomically thin ferromagnets by exploiting the interactions of spins with optical phonon modes presents an innovative idea for THz spintronics. Spin-phonon coupling raises an important question about the flow of spin angular momentum possibly to chiral phonons. We use femtosecond optical pulses to generate bound electron-hole pairs (excitons) in the 2D ferromagnet CrI3, and probe the subsequent charge and spin dynamics. The observed change in the optical signal during temporal pump-probe overlap represents the buildup of the exciton population. This is accompanied by the excitation of coherent optical phonon modes with 2.4 and 3.9 THz frequencies, corresponding to the bending and stretching of the Cr-I bonds. We observe both modes in the magnetism channel which agrees with first-principles calculations that identify changes in the exchange coupling due to the lattice displacements for both phonon modes.</description>

      <title>Competing phases in kagome magnet FeGe from functional renormalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of a charge density wave in FeGe extends the discussion of the nature of charge order in kagome metals to a magnetic compound. Motivated by this observation, we combine density functional theory (DFT) and functional-renormalization-group calculations to study interaction-induced Fermi-surface instabilities of the magnetic state of FeGe. We argue that the leading intra-band contribution to electronic correlations are approximately 2D and come from Van Hove points at the projected $M$~points. By varying parameters around DFT values, we determine a phase diagram for the quasi-2D scenario as function of on-site and nearest-neighbor interactions. We discuss universal aspects in the electronic mechanisms for the resulting phases, as well as the role of SU(2) symmetry breaking. We find FeGe to be in a regime of strong competition between $p$-wave charge density wave, $f$-wave pairing, and $d$-wave spin Pomeranchuk instabilities. This interplay can be influenced in favor of superconducting pairing for slightly increased nearest-neighbor interaction, suggesting a potential to induce superconductivity in FeGe.</description>

      <title>A New Era of Excitonic Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fundamental idea of the excitonic insulator (EI) driven by electron-hole correlations in narrow-gap semiconductors or semimetals was originally proposed in the 1960s, and only theoretical studies had been advanced for a long time. However, the rise of new candidate materials and recent developments in measurement techniques have enabled us to discuss the possibilities of EI states in real materials experimentally. In this article, we review recent progress in the research of EIs. We start with an introduction to the theoretical background of the EI and the mechanism of the order formation including its relation to the physics of the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) - Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) crossover. We also review the EI states studied in the context of strongly correlated electron systems. Then, we introduce the candidate materials for the EI and the issues raised by recent experiments. For example, the phase transitions in several candidate materials are accompanied by lattice distortions, and the contributions from electron-lattice coupling hinder the identification of the excitonic entity. We also review the profiles of the collective modes to discuss the dynamical signatures of the EI.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetic Perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnet is a class of antiferromagnets, which shows a staggered spin ordering with wave vector ${\bm q}=0$, while its net magnetization is canceled out in the limit of zero relativistic spin-orbit coupling. The simplest case is when the up and down spins are ordered on two crystallographically equivalent sublattice sites within the unit cell that are not connected by translation, and consequently, the system breaks the macroscopic time-reversal symmetry. Accordingly, it exhibits non-relativistic spin splitting in the energy band and characteristic cross-correlation phenomena between spin, charge, and lattice (orbital) degrees of freedom. This is in contrast to conventional N\'{e}el-type antiferromagnets with ${\bm q} \neq 0$ conserving the macroscopic time-reversal symmetry, where the time-reversal operation flipping of spins combined with translation can make the system identical to the original state. Altermagneticsm is universally latent in various magnetic materials that have been considered as simple collinear-type antiferromagnets. In this article, we focus on perovskites with chemical formula {\it ABX}$_3$, which are typical playgrounds for strongly correlated electron systems, and overview their altermagnetic aspects that have been overlooked in the past researches, based on microscopic model studies revealing the mechanisms of their properties. We display that a combination of a variety of antiferromagnetic ordering and the commonly-seen lattice distortions in perovskites gives rise to a non-relativistic spin splitting whose mechanism does not rely on the spin-orbit coupling and its consequent spin current generation, and the anomalous Hall effect in the presence of the spin-orbit coupling.</description>

      <title>Thermal Activation Signatures of the Anderson Insulator and the Wigner Solid forming near $\nu=1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When interactions overcome disorder, integer quantum Hall plateaus support topological phases with different bulk insulators. In the center of the $\nu=1$ plateau the bulk is an Anderson-type insulator, while in the flanks of the plateau the bulk is the integer quantum Hall Wigner solid. We find that the activation energy along the $\nu=1$ plateau exhibits a very dramatic non-monotonic dependence on the magnetic field, a dependence that is strongly correlated with the stability regions of the two phases. Furthermore, the activation energy has an unexpected minimum at the boundary between the Anderson insulator and the Wigner solid. Our findings constrain the theory of the integer quantum Hall Wigner solid, determine its thermodynamic properties, and reveal novel behavior at the boundary between the Anderson insulator and the Wigner solid.</description>

      <title>Conformally invariant charge fluctuations in a strange metal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The strange metal is a peculiar phase of matter in which the electron scattering rate, $\tau^{-1} \sim k_B T/\hbar$, which determines the electrical resistance, is universal across a wide family of materials and determined only by fundamental constants. In 1989, theorists hypothesized that this universality would manifest as scale-invariant behavior in the dynamic charge susceptibility, $\chi''(q,\omega)$. Here, we present momentum-resolved inelastic electron scattering measurements of the strange metal Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$ showing that the susceptibility has the scale-invariant form $\chi''(q,\omega) = T^{-\nu} f(\omega/T)$, with exponent $\nu = 0.93$. We find the response is consistent with conformal invariance, meaning the dynamics may be thought of as occurring on a circle of radius $1/T$ in imaginary time, characterized by conformal dimension $\Delta = 0.05$. Our study indicates that the strange metal is a universal phenomenon whose properties are not determined by microscopic properties of a particular material.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We performed inelastic neutron scattering experiments on single-crystal samples of the honeycomb lattice magnet, ilmenite NiTiO3. Below the Neel temperature of 22 K, spin wave excitations with a band energy of 3.7 meV were observed. The neutron energy spectra were well-reproduced by modeling the system as a ferromagnetic honeycomb lattice with antiferromagnetic interlayer coupling, using linear spin wave theory. Similar to another ilmenite CoTiO3, a crossing structure was observed at the K point, suggesting the resence of Dirac magnons in NiTiO3. Further calculations suggested the formation of Dirac nodal line.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the crystal structures, magnetic and thermodynamic properties of two magnetically frustrated $A$'$A$"$M_2$F$_7$-type antiferromagnets, NaCdNi$_2$F$_7$ and NaCdMn$_2$F$_7$. While NaCdNi$_2$F$_7$ forms a stable pyrochlore structure (SG: $Fd \overline{3} m$, #227) with magnetic $S$ = 1 Ni$^{2+}$ ions on the frustrated pyrochlore 16$c$ site and fully disordered non-magnetic Na$^+$/Cd$^{2+}$ ions on the pyrochlore 16$d$ site, NaCdMn$_2$F$_7$ favors the defect-fluorite structure (SG: $Fm \overline{3} m$, #225) with magnetic $S$ = 5/2 Mn$^{2+}$ and non-magnetic Na$^+$ and Cd$^{2+}$ ions fully disordered on the fluorite 4$a$ site. This is a result of the Mn$^{2+}$ ionic radius being too close to the average Na$^+$/Cd$^{2+}$ ionic radius, hindering the cationic site ordering towards the stable pyrochlore structure. In both cases, dominant antiferromagnetic interactions $\theta_{CW,Ni}$ = -91.2(5) K and $\theta_{CW,Mn}$ = -42.4(4) K are noted, with no magnetic transition until $T_{f,Ni}$ = 3.2 K and $T_{f,Mn}$ = 2.0 K, implying substantial frustration, with frustration indices $f_{Ni}$ = 28.5 and $f_{Mn}$ = 21. AC susceptibility measurements and bifurcation of ZFC/FC low-field magnetization indicate a glassy ground-state, precipitated by the magnetic-bond-disorder stemming from the inherent structural disorder.</description>

      <title>Single-boson exchange formulation of the Schwinger-Dyson equation and its application to the functional renormalization group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the recently introduced single-boson exchange formulation to the computation of the self-energy from the Schwinger-Dyson equation (SDE). In particular, we derive its expression both in diagrammatic and in physical channels. The simple form of the single-boson exchange SDE, involving only the bosonic propagator and the fermion-boson vertex, but not the rest function, allows for an efficient numerical implementation. We furthermore discuss its implications in a truncated unity solver, where a restricted number of form factors introduces an information loss in the projection of the momentum dependence that in general affects the equivalence between the different channel representations. In the application to the functional renormalization group, we find that the pseudogap opening in the two-dimensional Hubbard model at weak coupling is captured only in the magnetic channel representation of the SDE, while its expressions in terms of the density and superconducting channels fail to correctly account for the driving antiferromagnetic fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Disorder-induced spin-cluster ferrimagnetism in a doped kagome spin liquid candidate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The search for new quantum spin liquid materials relies on systems with strong frustration such as spins on the kagome lattice. This allows lattice imperfections to have substantial effects which are not well understood. In recent work the 2D kagome system YCu$_3$(OH)$_6$[(Cl$_x$Br$_{(1-x)}$)$_{3-y}$(OH)$_y$] has emerged as a leading candidate hosting a Dirac spin liquid which appears to survive at least for x&lt;0.4, associated with alternating-bond hexagon (ABH) disorder. Here in samples with x=0.58 we report an unusual coexistence of anti-ferromagnetic (AFM) and ferromagnetic (FM) order, and propose a semi-microscopic model to account for this order. Combined with a phenomenological model the results suggest growth of large FM clusters at intermediate temperatures which order eventually at lower temperatures. Generating these FM clusters relies on two ingredients: ABH disorder, and local-AFM FM-canting generated by small Kitaev interactions which can arise on the kagome lattice. The combination of experimental observation and theory suggests that Kitaev interactions and ABH disorder are necessary for describing the magnetic fluctuations in this family of materials, with potential implications for the proposed proximate spin liquid phase.</description>

      <title>Layer thickness and substrate effects on superconductivity in epitaxial FeSe films on BLG/SiC(0001)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The layered nature and simple structure of FeSe reveal this iron-based superconductor as a unique building block for the design of artificial heterostructure materials. While superconductivity develops in ultrathin films of FeSe on SrTiO3 substrates, it remains unclear whether it can be developed on more chemically inert, layered materials such as graphene. Here, we report on the characterization of the structural, chemical and electronic properties of few-layer FeSe on bilayer graphene grown on SiC(0001) using low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). STM imaging of our FeSe films with thicknesses up to three layers exhibit the tetragonal crystal structure of bulk FeSe, which is supported by XPS spectra consistent with the FeSe bulk counterpart. While our STS measurements at 340 mK reveal a metallic character for few-layer FeSe on BLG/SiC(0001), they show an absence of superconductivity, as the low-lying electronic structure exhibits a spatially anisotropic dip-like feature robust against magnetic fields. Superconductivity in FeSe/BLG/SiC(0001), however, emerges for thicker films with a transition temperature of 6 K. Our results underscore the significance of the substrate as key factor driving the suppression superconductivity in FeSe in the 2D limit.</description>

      <title>Spin-lattice relaxation for point-node-like s-wave superconductivity in f-electron systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we examined the temperature dependence of the spin-lattice relaxation using an f-d-p model, which is an effective model of UTe2. Solving the linearized Eliashberg equation in the f-d-p model based on third-order perturbation theory, we obtain a point-node-like s-wave pairing state. Our result shows that the Hebel-Slichter peak in the point-node-like s-wave pairing state is smaller than that in the isotropic s-wave pairing state. However, the Hebel-Slichter peak remains robust even in the point-node-like s-wave pairing state, and the point-node-like s-wave state is inconsistent with the results of nuclear magnetic resonance measurements.</description>

      <title>Three-body Fermi liquid corrections for an infinite-$U$ SU($N$) Anderson impurity model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the three-body Fermi liquid effects in the SU($N$) Anderson impurity model in the strong interaction limit where the occupation number $N_d^{}$ of the impurity levels varies over the range of $0&lt;N_d^{}&lt;1$. The three-body correlation of impurity electrons contributes to the next-to-leading order terms of transport coefficients at low energies when the electron-hole symmetry, the time-reversal symmetries, or both are broken by external fields or potentials. Using the numerical renormalization group approach, we calculate the differential conductance and the nonlinear current noise through quantum dots, as well as the thermal conductivity of both quantum dots and magnetic alloys. Specifically, we focus on the SU(2) and SU(4) cases and demonstrate how the three-body contributions evolve in the limit of $U\to\infty$, across the $1/N$-filling Kondo regime and the valence fluctuation regime. Our results clarify how the three-body correlation affects low-energy transport, with a crucial dependence on the occupation number $N_d^{}$. We also show that the three-body correlation strongly couples with asymmetries in the tunnel couplings between quantum dots and reservoirs; in particular it significantly affects the nonlinear current through the quarter-filling Kondo state for $N=4$.</description>

      <title>Strongly Anisotropic Charge Dynamics in La3Ni2O7 with Coherent-to-Incoherent Crossover of Interlayer Charge Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report an optical spectroscopy study of the charge-dynamics anisotropy in the La3Ni2O7 single crystals with the electric field of the incident light parallel to the crystalline c-axis and ab-plane respectively. The evolution of the low-energy part of its c-axis optical conductivity spectra ({\sigma}1c({\omega})) from a Drude component to a finite-energy peak, together with the change in the c-axis electron mean-free-path which is distinctly longer than the c-axis lattice constant at 10 K but is shorter than the c-axis lattice constant at 300 K, demonstrates a crossover from coherent to incoherent interlayer charge dynamics in La3Ni2O7, which is associated with the variation from weak to strong dissipation within its ab-plane. In contrast, the Drude component robust in its {\sigma}1ab({\omega}) and the long ab-plane electron mean-free-path greater than the a-axis and b-axis unit-cell lengths manifest the persistence of coherent in-plane charge dynamics from 10 to 300 K. Thus, the charge dynamics in La3Ni2O7 shows a remarkable anisotropy at high temperatures. At low temperatures, the large values of the ratio between the ab-plane and c-axis Drude weights and the ratio {\sigma}1ab({\omega} -&gt; 0)/{\sigma}1c({\omega} -&gt; 0) indicate a strong anisotropy of the low-temperature charge dynamics in La3Ni2O7.</description>

      <title>Observation of giant nonlinear Hall conductivity in Bernal bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a system of two-dimensional electrons, a combination of broken symmetry, interactions, and nontrivial topology can conspire to give rise to a nonlinear transport regime, where electric current density scales as the square of electric field. This regime has become a venue for exciting discoveries such as the nonlinear Hall effect and diode-like nonreciprocal transport. However, interpretation of experimental data is challenging in the nonlinear regime as DC transport is described by a rank-3 conductivity tensor with 6 free parameters. Here, we resolve this challenge by analytically solving for the nonlinear potential distribution across the disk sample for an arbitrary linear and nonlinear conductivity tensors. This allows us to unambiguously extract all components of the nonlinear tensor from experimental measurement. Using this novel tool, we identify giant nonlinear Hall effect in Bernal bilayer graphene. Our methodology provides the first systematic framework for interpreting nonlinear transport and uncovers a new route towards understanding quasi-2D materials.</description>

      <title>Thickness-dependent Topological Phases and Flat Bands in Rhombohedral Multilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rhombohedral multilayer graphene has emerged as an extraordinary platform for investigating exotic quantum states, such as superconductivity and fractional quantum anomalous Hall effects, mainly due to the existence of topological surface flatbands. Despite extensive research efforts, a systematic spectroscopic investigation on the evolution of its electronic structure from thin layers to bulk remains elusive. Using state-of-the-art angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with submicron spatial resolution, we directly probe and trace the thickness evolution of the topological electronic structures of rhombohedral multilayer graphene. As the layer number increases, the gapped subbands transform into the 3D Dirac nodes that spirals in the momentum space; while the flatbands are constantly observed around Fermi level, and eventually evolve into the topological drumhead surface states. This unique thickness-dependent topological phase transition can be well captured by the 3D generalization of 1D Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain in thin layers, to the topological Dirac nodal spiral semimetal in the bulk limit. Our findings establish a solid foundation for exploring the exotic quantum phases with nontrivial topology and correlation effects in rhombohedral multilayer graphene.</description>

      <title>Anomalous charge transport in the sine-Gordon model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We conduct a comprehensive study of anomalous charge transport in the quantum sine--Gordon model. Employing the framework of Generalized Hydrodynamics, we compute Drude weights and Onsager matrices across a wide range of coupling strengths to quantify ballistic and diffusive transport, respectively. We find that charge transport is predominantly diffusive at accessible timescales, indicated by the corresponding Onsager matrix significantly exceeding the Drude weight -- contrary to most integrable models where transport is primarily ballistic. Reducing the Onsager matrix to a few key two-particle scattering processes enables us to efficiently examine transport in both low- and high-temperature limits. The charge transport is dictated by non-diagonal scattering of the internal charge degree of freedom: At particular values of the coupling strength with diagonal, diffusive effects amount to merely subleading corrections. However, at couplings approaching these points, the charge Onsager matrix and corresponding diffusive time-scale diverge. Our findings relate to similar transport anomalies in XXZ spin chains, offering insights through their shared Bethe Ansatz structures.</description>

      <title>Giant Heat Flux Effect in Non-Chiral Transmission Lines</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a theory of heat transport in non-chiral transmission lines (TLs) of quantum Hall edge channels coupled to Ohmic contacts (OCs), where heat transport is driven by charge fluctuations in the heat Coulomb blockade regime. This framework challenges conventional paradigms by revealing a giant heat flux effect-a significant amplification in heat transport arising from non-trivial fluctuation-dissipation relations. Through a Langevin-based approach, we derive the effective noise power in the chiral currents, which underlies this enhanced heat flux. Our findings predict clear experimental signatures unique to non-chiral TLs as well as providing insights into finite-frequency effects, showing crossovers to more conventional diffusive behavior. This work offers a perspective on feedback mechanisms in quasi-1D heat transport with implications for dissipation control in low-dimensional quantum systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how entanglement can be reduced through simple operations is crucial for both classical and quantum algorithms. We investigate the entanglement properties of lattice models hosting conformal field theories cooled via local Clifford operations, a procedure we refer to as stabilizer disentangling. We uncover two distinct regimes: a constant gain regime, where disentangling is volume-independent, and a log-gain regime, where disentanglement increases with volume, characterized by a reduced effective central charge. In both cases, disentangling efficiency correlates with the target state magic, with larger magic leading to more effective cooling. The dichotomy between the two cases stems from mutual stabilizer Renyi entropy, which influences the entanglement cooling process. We provide an analytical understanding of such effect in the context of cluster Ising models, that feature disentangling global Clifford operations. Our findings indicate that matrix product states possess subclasses based on the relationship between entanglement and magic, and clarifying the potential of new classes of variational states embedding Clifford dynamics within matrix product states.</description>

Abstract: Although it is long believed that vanishing of chiral central charges of a 2d conformal field theory (CFT) implies the existence of conformal boundary conditions, there are yet higher obstructions. In this paper, we focus on 2d rational CFTs, for which we identify a series of obstructions, known as higher central charges. We also discuss its implication for lattice realizations and the generalization with global symmetries.</description>

      <title>Buckyballs directly probe inter-valley coherence and intra-valley pairing in moire heterostructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.04170v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Moire materials like twisted bilayer graphene have emerged as a rich playground of strongly correlated physics, where the effect of interactions can be drastically enhanced by tuning the non-interacting density of states via twist angle. A key feature of bilayer graphene at small twist angles is that the two valleys of graphene are effectively decoupled at the non-interacting level, leading to an emergent U(1) symmetry corresponding to the conservation of valley-charge. Theoretical studies invariably find that short-ranged interactions tend to break this symmetry, leading to inter-valley coherence (IVC). Here, I propose an experimental signature of IVC order by coupling with a closely related system where valley-mixing is guaranteed - the pentagonal disclinations of graphene. Such disclinations are naturally found in fullerenes. The tunneling current between twisted bilayer graphene and an appropriately oriented large buckyball has a sharp signature of the onset of IVC order. Successfully integrating these fullerenes in a scanning tunneling microscope would allow spatial resolution of the IVC order parameter on a sub-moire scale. Experimentally constraining the broken symmetries and order parameters in the multitude of emerging correlated insulators is a crucial first step to understanding the superconductivity that develops on doping these exotic `normal' states.</description>

Abstract: Two legged skewed spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ ladders are frustrated and exhibit exotic quantum phases in ground state due to strong quantum fluctuations and competing spin exchanges. Here, we study ground state properties of a spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ Heisenberg model on 3/4, 3/5 and 5/5 skewed ladders in the presence of a Zeeman magnetic field, $B$, using exact diagonalization and the density matrix renormalization group method. We note the existence of plateaus at $m =$ 1/3 and 2/3 for 3/4 skewed ladder, at $m =$ 1/4, 1/2, and 3/4 for 3/5 skewed ladder, and at $m =$ 0, 1/3, and 2/3 for 5/5 skewed ladder, where $m$ is the ratio of the observed magnetization ($M$) to the saturated magnetization (${M_\mathrm{max}}$). The plateau state is always a gapped state and the plateau width depends on the gap in the system. Surprisingly, the 3/4 and 5/5 skewed ladders show interesting quadrupolar or n-type spin nematic phases below the 1/3$^{rd}$ plateau, i.e, at very low magnetic fields. These two systems are unique as they host both a plateau and a quadrupolar phase at low magnetic fields. The linear variation of pitch angle of the spin with magnetization and behavior of binding energy of magnon pairs as function of magnetic field are also calculated in both the systems. We also study the contribution of the binding energy to two magnon condensate.</description>

      <title>Linear Magnetoresistance from Glassy Orders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16850v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Several strongly correlated metals display B-linear magnetoresistance (LMR) with a universal slope, in sharp contrast to the $B^2$ scaling predicted by Fermi liquid theory. We provide a unifying explanation of the origin of LMR by focusing on a common feature in their phase diagrams -- proximity to symmetry-breaking orders. Specifically, we demonstrate via two microscopic models that LMR with a universal slope arises ubiquitously near ordered phases, provided the order parameter either (i) has a finite wave-vector, or (ii) has nodes on the Fermi surface. We elucidate the distinct physical mechanisms at play in these two scenarions, and derive upper and lower bounds on the field range for which LMR is observed. Finally, we discuss possible extensions of our picture to strange metal physics at higher temperatures, and argue that our theory provides an understanding of recent experimental results on thin film cuprates and moir\'e materials.</description>

      <title>Magnon spectrum of altermagnets beyond linear spin wave theory: Magnon-magnon interactions via time-dependent matrix product states vs. atomistic spin dynamics</title>

Abstract: The energy-momentum dispersion of magnons, as collective low-energy excitations of magnetic material, is computed from an effective quantum spin Hamiltonian but simplified via linearized Holstein-Primakoff transformations to describe noninteracting magnons. The dispersion produced by such linear spin wave theory (LSWT) is then plotted as ``sharp bands'' of infinitely long-lived quasiparticles. However, magnons are prone to many-body interactions with other quasiparticles -- such as electrons, phonons or other magnons -- which can lead to shifting (i.e., band renormalization) and broadening of ``sharp bands'' as the signature of finite quasiparticle lifetime. The magnon-magnon interactions can be particularly important in antiferromagnets (AFs), and, therefore, possibly in newly classified altermagnets sharing many features of collinear AFs. Here, we employ nonperturbative quantum many-body calculations, via time-dependent matrix product states (TDMPS), to obtain magnon spectral function for RuO$_2$ altermagnet whose effective quantum spin Hamiltonian is put onto 4-leg cylinder. Its upper band is shifted away from upper ``sharp band'' of LSWT, as well as broadened, which is explained as the consequence of {\em hybridization} of the latter with three-magnon continuum. This implies that two-magnon Raman scattering spectra {\em cannot} be computed from LSWT bands, which offers a litmus test for the relevance of magnon-magnon interactions. Finally, we employ atomistic spin dynamics (ASD) simulations, based on classical Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation, to obtain magnon spectrum at finite temperature and/or at a fraction of the cost of TDMPS calculations. Despite including magnon-magnon interactions via nonlinearity of LLG equation, ASD simulations {\em cannot} match the TDMPS-computed magnon spectrum, thereby signaling {\em nonclassical} effects harbored by AFs and altermagnets.</description>

Abstract: The Kondo lattice, describing a grid of the local magnetic moments coupling to itinerant electrons, is a fertile ground of strongly correlated states in condensed matter physics. While the Kagome lattice has long been predicted to host Kondo physics with exotic magnetism and nontrivial topology, no experimental realization has been achieved. Here, we report the discovery of CsCr6Sb6, a van der Waals-like Kagome Kondo lattice featuring extremely flat, isolated bands at the Fermi level (EF) that composed entirely of Cr-3d electrons. We observe heavy fermions with the effective mass over 100 times greater than those of its vanadium counterpart. We also observe Kondo insulating behavior in an ultra-low carrier density of 1019 cm-3 and dimensionality-induced Kondo breakdown. More interestingly, the frustrated magnetism observed in the bulk give way to a hidden A-type antiferromagnetic ordering in few layers, in sharp contrast to the common sense of weakened magnetism with thinning. The realization of Kondo physics in Kagome lattice opens avenues for exploring diverse quantum criticalities in a strongly-correlated frustrated system.</description>

      <title>Unconventional Scalings of Quantum Entropies in Long-Range Heisenberg Chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02685v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, building on state-of-the-art quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we perform systematic finite-size scaling of both entanglement and participation entropies for long-range Heisenberg chain with unfrustrated power-law decaying interactions. We find distinctive scaling behaviors for both quantum entropies in the various regimes explored by tuning the decay exponent $\alpha$, thus capturing non-trivial features through logarithmic terms, beyond the case of linear Nambu-Goldstone modes. Our systematic analysis reveals that the quantum entanglement information, hidden in the scaling of the two studied entropies, can be obtained to the same level of order parameters and other usual finite-size observables of quantum many-body lattice models. The analysis and results obtained here can readily apply to more quantum criticalities in 1D and 2D systems.</description>

      <title>Single Crystal Diffuse Neutron Scattering Study of the Dipole-Octupole Quantum Spin Ice Candidate Ce$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$: No Apparent Octupolar Correlations Above $T = 0.05$ K</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07640v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The insulating magnetic pyrochlore Ce$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ has gained attention as a quantum spin ice candidate with dipole-octupole character that arises from the crystal electric field ground state doublet for the Ce$^{3+}$ Kramers ion. This permits both spin ice phases based on magnetic dipoles and those based on more-exotic octupoles. This work reports low-temperature neutron diffraction measurements on single crystal Ce$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ with $Q$-coverage both at low $Q$ where the magnetic form factor for dipoles is near maximal and at high $Q$ covering the region where the magnetic form factor for Ce$^{3+}$ octupoles is near maximal. This study was motivated by recent powder neutron diffraction studies of other Ce-based dipole-octupole pyrochlores, Ce$_2$Sn$_2$O$_7$ and Ce$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$, which each showed temperature-dependent diffuse diffraction at high $Q$ that was interpreted as arising from octupolar correlations. Our measurements use an optimized single crystal diffuse scattering instrument that allows us to screen against strong Bragg scattering from Ce$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$. The temperature-difference neutron diffraction reveals a low-$Q$ peak consistent with dipolar spin ice correlations reported in previous work, and an alternation between positive and negative net intensity at higher $Q$. These features are consistent with our numerical-linked-cluster calculations using pseudospin interaction parameters previously reported for Ce$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$, Ce$_2$Sn$_2$O$_7$, and Ce$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$. Importantly, neither the measured data nor any of the NLC calculations show evidence for increased scattering at high $Q$ resulting from octupolar correlations. We conclude that at the lowest attainable temperatures for our measurement ($T = 0.05$ K), octupolar correlations are not present in Ce$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ on the level of our observation threshold of $\sim$ 0.1$\%$ of the low-$Q$ dipole scattering.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01421v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interacting SSH model provides an ideal ground to study the interplay between topologically insulating phases and electron-electron interactions. We study the polarization density as a topological invariant and provide an analytic treatment of its behavior in the low-energy sector of the one-dimensional interacting SSH model. By formulating the topological invariant in terms of Green's functions, we use the low-energy field theory of the Thirring model to derive the behavior of the polarization density. We show that the polarization density in the continuum theory describes the usual topological insulating phases. Still, it contains an extra factor from the fields' scaling dimensions in the low-energy quantum field theory. We interpret this as a measure of the modified charge of the new excitations in the system. We find two distinct contributions: a renormalization of the electronic charge $e$ of a Fermi liquid because of quasiparticle smearing and an additional contribution coming from the topological charge of the soliton arising in the bosonized version of the Thirring model, the sine-Gordon model.</description>

      <title>Helical edge modes in a triangular Heisenberg antiferromagnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10062v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of helical edge modes in a Heisenberg antiferromagnet on a triangular lattice, driven by a topological mechanism similar to that proposed by Dong et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 206701 (2023)] for chiral spin waves in ferromagnets. The spin-frame field theory of a three-sublattice antiferromagnet allows for a topological term in the energy that modifies the boundary conditions for certain polarizations of spin waves and gives rise to edge modes. These edge modes are helical: modes with left and right circular polarizations propagate in opposite directions along the boundary in a way reminiscent of the electron edge modes in two-dimensional topological insulators. The field-theoretic arguments are verified in a realistic lattice model of a Heisenberg antiferromagnet with superexchange interactions that exhibits helical edge modes. The strength of the topological term is proportional to the disparity between two inequivalent superexchange paths. These findings suggest potential avenues for realizing magnonic edge states in frustrated antiferromagnets without requiring Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions or nontrivial magnon band topology.</description>

      <title>UOTe: Kondo-interacting topological antiferromagnet in a van der Waals lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08816v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since the initial discovery of two-dimensional van der Waals (vdW) materials, significant effort has been made to incorporate the three properties of magnetism, band structure topology, and strong electron correlations $-$ to leverage emergent quantum phenomena and expand their potential applications. However, the discovery of a single vdW material that intrinsically hosts all three ingredients has remained an outstanding challenge. Here we report the discovery of a Kondo-interacting topological antiferromagnet in the vdW 5$f$ electron system UOTe. It has a high antiferromagnetic (AFM) transition temperature of 150 K, with a unique AFM configuration that breaks the combined parity and time reversal ($PT$) symmetry in an even number of layers while maintaining zero net magnetic moment. Our angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements reveal Dirac bands near the Fermi level, which combined with our theoretical calculations demonstrate UOTe as an AFM Dirac semimetal. Within the AFM order, we observed the presence of the Kondo interaction, as evidenced by the emergence of a 5$f$ flat band near the Fermi level below 100 K and hybridization between the Kondo band and the Dirac band. Our density functional theory calculations in its bilayer form predict UOTe as a rare example of a fully-compensated AFM Chern insulator.</description>

      <title>Role of bias and tunneling asymmetries in nonlinear Fermi-liquid transport through an SU($N$) quantum dot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.01162v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study how bias and tunneling asymmetries affect nonlinear current through a quantum dot with $N$ discrete levels in the Fermi liquid regime, using an exact low-energy expansion of the current derived up to terms of order $V^3$ with respect to the bias voltage. The expansion coefficients are described in terms of the phase shift, the linear susceptibilities, and the three-body correlation functions, defined with respect to the equilibrium ground state of the Anderson impurity model. In particular, the three-body correlations play an essential role in the order $V^3$ term, and their coupling to the nonlinear current depends crucially on the bias and tunnel asymmetries. The number of independent components of the three-body correlation functions increases with $N$ the internal degrees of the quantum dots, and it gives a variety in the low-energy transport. We calculate the correlation functions over a wide range of electron fillings of the Anderson impurity model with the SU($N$) internal symmetry, using the numerical renormalization group. We find that the order $V^3$ nonlinear current through the SU($N$) Kondo state, which occurs at electron fillings of $1$ and $N-1$ for strong Coulomb interactions, significantly varies with the three-body contributions as tunnel asymmetries increase. Furthermore, in the valence fluctuation regime toward the empty or fully occupied impurity state, a sharp peak emerges in the coefficient of $V^3$ current in the case at which bias and tunneling asymmetries cooperatively enhance the charge transfer from one of the electrodes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.10757v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We unveil a novel mechanism for quasicondensation of hard-core bosons in the presence of quasiperiodicity-induced multifractal single-particle states. The new critical state, here dubbed fractal quasicondensate, is characterized by natural orbitals with multifractal properties and by an occupancy of the lowest natural orbital, {\lambda}0 ~ L{\gamma}, which grows with system size but with a nonuniversal scaling exponent, {\gamma} &lt; 1/2. In contrast to fractal quasicondensates obtained when the chemical potential lies in a region of multifractal single-particle states, placing the chemical potential in regions of localized or delocalized states yields, respectively, no condensation or the usual 1D quasicondensation with {\gamma} = 1/2. Our findings are established by studying one-dimensional hardcore bosons subjected to various quasiperiodic potentials, including the well-known Aubry-Andre model, employing a mapping to non-interacting fermionics that allows for numerically exact results. We discuss how to test our findings in state-of-the-art ultracold atom experiments.</description>

      <title>Elastic Softening in Synthetic Diamonds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03377v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study reveals a novel phenomenon demonstrating the elastic softening of synthetic diamonds when cooled to very low temperatures below 1 K. We present the results of ultrasonic measurements of single-crystalline synthetic diamonds without irradiation, namely type-IIa (colorless) and Ib (yellow) diamonds grown by high-pressure-high-temperature synthesis as well as type-IIa diamond grown by chemical vapor deposition. We observed a divergent decrease of the elastic stiffness constant $C_{44}$ in all samples at low temperatures down to 20 mK. We argue for the existence of electric quadrupolar degrees of freedom with irreducible representation $T_2$ in diamond as the origin of this elastic softening. Although, understanding of the microscopic mechanism behind the observed softening is still an open question, present analysis strongly suggest sub-ppb level of neutral single-atomic vacancies or other unspecified non-magnetic vacancy concentrations in all investigated diamonds. Our findings also open new avenues for the quantitative determination of non-magnetic vacancies in diamonds, an important information needed for their potential application as a substrate for quantum computers and next-generation semiconductor devices.</description>

      <title>Strong-to-Weak Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking in Mixed Quantum States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03639v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symmetry in mixed quantum states can manifest in two distinct forms: strong symmetry, where each individual pure state in the quantum ensemble is symmetric with the same charge, and weak symmetry, which applies only to the entire ensemble. This paper explores a novel type of spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) where a strong symmetry is broken to a weak one. While the SSB of a weak symmetry is measured by the long-ranged two-point correlation function, the strong-to-weak SSB (SW-SSB) is measured by the fidelity correlator. We prove that SW-SSB is a universal property of mixed-state quantum phases, in the sense that the phenomenon of SW-SSB is robust against symmetric low-depth local quantum channels. We also show that the symmetry breaking is "spontaneous" in the sense that the effect of a local symmetry-breaking measurement cannot be recovered locally. We argue that a thermal state at a nonzero temperature in the canonical ensemble (with fixed symmetry charge) should have spontaneously broken strong symmetry. Additionally, we study non-thermal scenarios where decoherence induces SW-SSB, leading to phase transitions described by classical statistical models with bond randomness. In particular, the SW-SSB transition of a decohered Ising model can be viewed as the "ungauged" version of the celebrated toric code decodability transition. We confirm that, in the decohered Ising model, the SW-SSB transition defined by the fidelity correlator is the only physical transition in terms of channel recoverability. We also comment on other (inequivalent) definitions of SW-SSB, through correlation functions with higher Renyi indices.</description>

      <title>Frustrated superconductivity and intrinsic reduction of $T_c$ in trilayer nickelate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04340v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Identifying the key factors controlling the magnitude of $T_c$ is of critical importance in the pursuit of high-temperature superconductivity. In cuprates, $T_c$ reaches its maximal value in trilayer structure, leading to the belief that interlayer coupling may help promote the pairing. In contrast, for the recently discovered nickelate superconductors under high pressure, the maximum $T_c$ is reduced from about 80 K in the bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ to 30 K in the trilayer La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$. Motivated by this opposite trend, we propose an interlayer pairing scenario for the superconductivity of La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$. Our theory reveals intrinsic frustration in the spin-singlet pairing that the inner layer tends to form with both of the two outer layers respectively, leading to strong superconducting fluctuations between layers. This explains the reduction of its maximum $T_c$ compared to that of the bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$. Our findings support a fundamental distinction between multilayer nickelate and cuprate superconductors, and ascribe it to their different (interlayer versus intralayer) pairing mechanisms. Furthermore, our theory predicts extended $s^\pm$-wave gap structures in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$, with varying signs and possible nodes on different Fermi pockets. We also find an intrinsic Josephson coupling with potentially interesting consequences that may be examined in future experiments. Our work reveals the possibility of rich novel physics in multilayer superconductors with interlayer pairing.</description>

      <title>C*-framework for higher-order bulk-boundary correspondences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04226v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A typical crystal is a finite piece of a material which may be invariant under some point symmetry group. If it is a so-called intrinsic higher-order topological insulator or superconductor, then it displays boundary modes at hinges or corners protected by the crystalline symmetry and the bulk topology. We explain the mechanism behind such phenomena using operator K-theory. Specifically, we derive a groupoid C*-algebra that 1) encodes the dynamics of the electrons in the infinite size limit of a crystal; 2) remembers the boundary conditions at the crystal's boundaries, and 3) admits a natural action by the point symmetries of the atomic lattice. The filtrations of the groupoid's unit space by closed subsets that are invariant under the groupoid and point group actions supply equivariant cofiltrations of the groupoid C*-algebra. We show that specific derivations of the induced spectral sequences in twisted equivariant K-theories enumerate all non-trivial higher-order bulk-boundary correspondences.</description>

      <title>Crystal-field effects in the formation of Wigner-molecule supercrystals in moir\'e TMD superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02527v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For moir\'e bilayer TMD superlattices, full-configuration-interaction (FCI) calculations are presented that take into account both the intra-moir\'e-quantum-dot (MQD) charge-carrier Coulombic interactions, as well as the crystal-field effect from the surrounding moir\'e pockets (inter-moir\'e-QD interactions). The effective computational embedding strategy introduced here allows for an FCI methodogy that enables the complete interpretation of the counterintuitive experimental observations reported recently in the context of moir\'e TMD superlattices at integer fillings $\nu=2$ and 4. Two novel states of matter are reported: (i) a genuinely quantum-mechanical supercrystal of $sliding$ Wigner molecules (WMs) for unstrained moir\'e TMD materials (when the crystal field is commensurate with the trilobal symmetry of the confining potential in each embedded MQD) and (ii) a supercrystal of $pinned$ Wigner molecules when the crystal field is incommensurate with the trilobal symmetry or straining of the whole material is involved. The case of $\nu=3$ is an exception, in that even the unstrained case is associated with a supercrystal of pinned WMs, which is due to the congruence of intrinsic (that of the WM) and external (that of the confining potential of the MQD) $C_3$ point-group symmetries. Furthermore, it is shown that the unrestricted Hartree-Fock approach fails to describe the supercrystal of sliding WMs in the unstrained case, providing a qualitative agreement only in the case of a supercrystal of pinned WMs</description>

      <title>Quantum sensing in Kerr parametric oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14590v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum metrology and quantum sensing aim to use quantum properties to enhance measurement precision beyond what could be classically achieved. Here, we demonstrate how the analysis of the phase space structure of the classical limit of Kerr parametric oscillators can be used for determining control parameters values that lead to the squeezing of the uncertainty in position and the amplification of the quantum Fisher information. We also explore how quantum sensing can benefit from excited-state quantum phase transitions, even in the absence of a conventional quantum phase transition. The system that we consider models exciton-polariton condensates and superconducting circuits, making our study relevant for potential experimental applications.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Noise of Driven Controlled Field Using the Central Spin Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01375v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the coherence dynamics of a central spin coupled to a spin chain with a time-dependent noisy magnetic field, focusing on how noise influences the system's decoherence. Our results show that decoherency due to the nonequilibrium critical dynamics of the environment is amplified in the presence of uncorrelated and correlated Gaussian noise. We demonstrate that decoherence factor consistently signals the critical points, and exhibits exponential scaling with the system size, the square of noise intensity, and the noise correlation time at the critical points. We find that strong coupling between the qubit and the environment allows partial revivals of coherence, which diminish with increasing noise intensity or decreasing noise correlation time. In contrast, weak coupling leads to monotonic enhanced decoherence. The numerical results illustrate that, the revivals decay and scale exponentially with noise intensity. Moreover, the revivals increase and indicate linear or power law scaling with noise correlation time depends on how the correlated noise is fast or slow. Additionally, we explore the non-Markovianity of the dynamics, finding that it decays in the presence of noise but increases as the noise correlation time grows. Our findings have potential applications in the noise spectroscopy of external signals.</description>

      <title>Operator algebra and algorithmic construction of boundaries and defects in (2+1)D topological Pauli stabilizer codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11942v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a computational algorithm for constructing all boundaries and defects of topological generalized Pauli stabilizer codes in two spatial dimensions. Utilizing the operator algebra formalism, we establish a one-to-one correspondence between the topological data-such as anyon types, fusion rules, topological spins, and braiding statistics-of (2+1)D bulk stabilizer codes and (1+1)D boundary anomalous subsystem codes. To make the operator algebra computationally accessible, we adapt Laurent polynomials and convert the tasks into matrix operations, e.g., the Hermite normal form for obtaining boundary anyons and the Smith normal form for determining fusion rules. This approach enables computers to automatically generate all possible gapped boundaries and defects for topological Pauli stabilizer codes through boundary anyon condensation and topological order completion. This streamlines the analysis of surface codes and associated logical operations for fault-tolerant quantum computation. Our algorithm applies to $Z_d$ qudits, including both prime and nonprime $d$, thus enabling the exploration of topological quantum codes beyond toric codes. We have applied the algorithm and explicitly demonstrated the lattice constructions of 2 boundaries and 6 defects in the $Z_2$ toric code, 3 boundaries and 22 defects in the $Z_4$ toric code, 1 boundary and 2 defects in the double semion code, 1 boundary and 22 defects in the six-semion code, 6 boundaries and 270 defects in the color code, and 6 defects in the anomalous three-fermion code. In addition, we investigate the boundaries of two specific bivariate bicycle codes within a family of low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. We demonstrate that their topological orders are equivalent to 8 and 10 copies of $Z_2$ toric codes, with anyons restricted to move by 12 and 1023 lattice sites in the square lattice, respectively.</description>
