      <title>Dual-type dual-element atom arrays for quantum information processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutral-atom arrays are a leading platform for quantum technologies, offering a promising route toward large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computing. We propose a novel quantum processing architecture based on dual-type, dual-element atom arrays, where individually trapped atoms serve as data qubits, and small atomic ensembles enable ancillary operations. By leveraging the selective initialization, coherent control, and collective optical response of atomic ensembles, we demonstrate ensemble-assisted quantum operations that enable reconfigurable, high-speed control of individual data qubits and rapid mid-circuit readout, including both projective single-qubit and joint multi-qubit measurements. The hybrid approach of this architecture combines the long coherence times of single-atom qubits with the enhanced controllability of atomic ensembles, achieving high-fidelity state manipulation and detection with minimal crosstalk. Numerical simulations indicate that our scheme supports individually addressable single- and multi-qubit operations with fidelities of 99.5% and 99.9%, respectively, as well as fast single- and multi-qubit state readout with fidelities exceeding 99% within tens of microseconds. These capabilities open new pathways toward scalable, fault-tolerant quantum computation, enabling repetitive error syndrome detection and efficient generation of long-range entangled many-body states, thereby expanding the quantum information toolbox beyond existing platforms.</description>

      <title>Towards full understanding the physics of heavy ion induced inner shell ionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The complex physics of inner shell ionization of target atoms by heavy ion impact has remained only partially solved for decades. Recently, agreement between theory and experiment has been achieved by considering inner shell ionization of target atoms due to projectile electron capture in addition to direct Coulomb ionization including multiple ionization effects. A thorough investigation exhibits such a picture only if the atomic parameters of the target atoms are correct. In fact, the theoretical approach is found to be right, but the problem arises with the faulty atomic parameters. Furthermore, we show that fluorescence yields play a major role among the atomic parameters. We explore such a powerful method that enables us to measure the correct and accurate fluorescence yields for almost every element in the periodic table. As per our present knowledge, this in turn not only solves the said complex issue fully but also makes the PIXE analysis more reliable and accurate using both light and heavy ions.</description>

      <title>Recoil-induced errors and their correction in photon-mediated entanglement between atom qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photonically-interconnected matter qubit systems have wide-ranging applications across quantum science and technology, with entanglement between distant qubits serving as a universal resource. While state-of-the-art heralded entanglement generation performance thus far has been achieved in trapped atomic systems modelled as stationary emitters, the improvements to fidelities and generation rates demanded by large-scale applications require taking into account their motional degrees of freedom. Here, we derive the effects of atomic motion on spontaneous emission coupled into arbitrary optical modes, and study the implications for commonly-used atom-atom entanglement protocols. We arrive at a coherent physical picture in the form of "kick operators" associated with each instant in the photonic wavepackets, which also suggests a method to mitigate motional errors by disentangling qubit and motion post-herald. This proposed correction technique removes overheads associated with the thermal motion of atoms, and may greatly increase entanglement rates in long-distance quantum network links by allowing single-photon-based protocols to be used in the high-fidelity regime.</description>

      <title>Topological order in symmetric blockade structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The bottom-up design of strongly interacting quantum materials with prescribed ground state properties is a highly nontrivial task, especially if only simple constituents with realistic two-body interactions are available on the microscopic level. Here we study two- and three-dimensional structures of two-level systems that interact via a simple blockade potential in the presence of a coherent coupling between the two states. For such strongly interacting quantum many-body systems, we introduce the concept of blockade graph automorphisms to construct symmetric blockade structures with strong quantum fluctuations that lead to equal-weight superpositions of tailored states. Drawing from these results, we design a quasi-two-dimensional periodic quantum system that - as we show rigorously - features a topological $\mathbb{Z}_2$ spin liquid as its ground state. Our construction is based on the implementation of a local symmetry on the microscopic level in a system with only two-body interactions.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopy of electric dipole and quadrupole transitions in $^{224}$Ra$^+$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09873v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on spectroscopy of the low-lying electronic transitions in $^{224}$Ra$^+$. The ion's low charge to mass ratio and convenient wavelengths make $^{224}$Ra$^+$ a promising optical clock candidate. We measured the frequencies of the the $^2{S}_{1/2} \ $$\leftrightarrow$$\ ^2{P}_{1/2}$ cooling transition, the $^2{S}_{1/2}\ $$\leftrightarrow$$\ ^2{D}_{5/2}$ clock transition, the $^2{D}_{3/2} \ $$\leftrightarrow$$\ ^2{P}_{3/2}$ electric dipole transition, and the $^2{D}_{5/2} \ $$\leftrightarrow$$\ ^2{P}_{3/2}$ cleanout transition. From these measurements we calculate the frequencies of the $^2{D}_{3/2}\ $$\leftrightarrow$$\ ^2{P}_{1/2}$ repump transition, the $^2{S}_{1/2} \ $$\leftrightarrow$$\ ^2{D}_{3/2}$ electric quadrupole transition, and the $^2{S}_{1/2} \ $$\leftrightarrow$$\ ^2{P}_{3/2}$ electric dipole transition.</description>

      <title>Vacuum polarization corrections to hyperfine structure in many-electron atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17979v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a theoretical study of vacuum polarization corrections to the hyperfine structure in many-electron atoms. Calculations are performed for systems of interest for precision atomic tests of fundamental physics belonging to the alkali-metal atoms and singly-ionized alkaline earths. The vacuum polarization is considered in the Uehling approximation, and we study the many-body effects core relaxation, core polarization, and valence-core correlations in the relativistic framework. We find that for s states, the relative vacuum polarization correction may be well-approximated by that for hydrogenlike ions, though for all other states account of many-body effects -- in particular, the polarization of the core -- is needed to obtain the correct sign and magnitude of the correction.</description>

      <title>Quantum States Imaging of Magnetic Field Contours based on Autler-Townes Effect in Yb Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14426v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An inter-combination transition in Yb enables a novel approach for rapidly imaging magnetic field variations with excellent spatial and temporal resolution and accuracy. This quantum imaging magnetometer reveals "dark stripes" that are contours of constant magnetic field visible by eye or capturable by standard cameras. These dark lines result from a combination of Autler-Townes splitting and the spatial Hanle effect in the $^{1}S_{0} - ^{3}P_{1}$ transition of Yb when driven by multiple strong coherent laser fields (carrier and AM/FM modulation sidebands of a single-mode 556 nm laser). We show good agreement between experimental data and our theoretical model for the closed, 4-level Zeeman shifted V-system and demonstrate scalar and vector magnetic fields measurements at video frame rates over spatial dimensions of 5 cm with 0.1 mm resolution. Additionally, the $^{1}S_{0} - ^{3}P_{1}$ transition allows for $\sim\mu$s response time and a large dynamic range (from microtesla to many tesla).</description>

      <title>Field-free, Quasi-continuous Operation of Optical Nanofiber Interface with Two-dimensional Ferromagnetic Trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20734v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A soft ferromagnetic foil uniformizes Tesla-level magnetic fields generated by attached permanent magnets, producing a uniform and electronically tunable surface field on the opposite side. By arranging $n$ precisely fabricated rectangular foils, a nearly ideal magnetic quadrupole field with a substantial gradient can be created at center. This robust and tunable field configuration is useful for 2-dimensional magneto-optical trapping (2D-MOT) and magnetic guiding of cold atoms. In this work, by aligning an optical nanofiber (ONF) to the zero-field line of a 2-foil-based planar 2D-MOT, we demonstrate field-free operation of the quantum optical interface in a quasi-continuous manner, without switching off the magnetic field. Transient transmission spectroscopy is performed with a measurement repetition rate as high as 250~kHz. An anomalous line broadening is observed, which is not fully understood, but is partly explained by a small residual field along the zero-field line. Through additional field measurements and simulations, we clarify that this residual field can be eliminated in an $n$=4 assembly, resulting in an ultra-straight 2D trap to support efficient sub-Doppler cooling and uniform light-atom interaction over exceptionally long field-free distances $l$. With the strong field gradient to support atom guiding, the ferromagnetic device may also enable new quantum optical scenarios featuring interactions between co-guided atoms and photons.</description>

      <title>Observation of the acoustic Purcell effect with a color-center and a nanomechanical resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09946v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The radiative properties of atoms are inherently linked to their surrounding environment. Placing an electromagnetic resonator around atoms can enhance spontaneous emission, as shown by Purcell in the 1940s. This approach is now routinely used in quantum computing and communication to channel photons emitted by atoms into well-defined modes and control atom-photon interactions. For solid-state artificial atoms, such as color-centers, the host lattice introduces an acoustic environment, allowing excited atoms to relax by emitting phonons. Here we observe the acoustic Purcell effect by constructing a specially engineered, microwave-frequency nanomechanical resonator around a color-center spin qubit in diamond. Using a co-localized optical mode of the structure that strongly couples to the color-center's excited state, we perform single-photon-level laser spectroscopy at milliKelvin temperatures and observe ten-fold faster spin relaxation when the spin qubit is tuned into resonance with a 12 GHz acoustic mode. Additionally, we use the color-center as an atomic-scale probe to measure the broadband phonon spectrum of the nanostructure up to a frequency of 28 GHz. Our work establishes a new regime of control for quantum defects in solids and paves the way for interconnects between atomic-scale quantum memories and qubits encoded in acoustic and superconducting devices.</description>
