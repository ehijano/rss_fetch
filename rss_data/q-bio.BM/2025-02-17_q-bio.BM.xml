      <title>Gradient GA: Gradient Genetic Algorithm for Drug Molecular Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular discovery has brought great benefits to the chemical industry. Various molecule design techniques are developed to identify molecules with desirable properties. Traditional optimization methods, such as genetic algorithms, continue to achieve state-of-the-art results across multiple molecular design benchmarks. However, these techniques rely solely on random walk exploration, which hinders both the quality of the final solution and the convergence speed. To address this limitation, we propose a novel approach called Gradient Genetic Algorithm (Gradient GA), which incorporates gradient information from the objective function into genetic algorithms. Instead of random exploration, each proposed sample iteratively progresses toward an optimal solution by following the gradient direction. We achieve this by designing a differentiable objective function parameterized by a neural network and utilizing the Discrete Langevin Proposal to enable gradient guidance in discrete molecular spaces. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves both convergence speed and solution quality, outperforming cutting-edge techniques. For example, it achieves up to a 25% improvement in the top-10 score over the vanilla genetic algorithm. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/debadyuti23/GradientGA.</description>

      <title>Fluorescence Phasor Analysis: Basic Principles and Biophysical Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluorescence is one of the most widely used techniques in biological sciences. Its exceptional sensitivity and versatility make it a tool of first choice for quantitative studies in biophysics. The concept of phasors, originally introduced by Charles Steinmetz in the late 19th century for analyzing alternating current circuits, has since found applications across diverse disciplines, including fluorescence spectroscopy. The main idea behind fluorescence phasors was posited by Gregorio Weber in 1981. By analyzing the complementary nature of pulse and phase fluorometry data, he shows that two magnitudes -denoted as G and S- derived from the frequency-domain fluorescence measurements correspond to the real and imaginary part of the Fourier transform of the fluorescence intensity in the time domain. This review provides a historical perspective on how the concept of phasors originates and how it integrates into fluorescence spectroscopy. We discuss their fundamental algebraic properties, which enable intuitive model-free analysis of fluorescence data despite the complexity of the underlying phenomena. Some applications in biophysics illustrate the power of this approach in studying diverse phenomena, including protein folding, protein interactions, phase transitions in lipid mixtures and formation of high-order structures in nucleic acids.</description>

      <title>Agentic End-to-End De Novo Protein Design for Tailored Dynamics Using a Language Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proteins are dynamic molecular machines whose biological functions, spanning enzymatic catalysis, signal transduction, and structural adaptation, are intrinsically linked to their motions. Designing proteins with targeted dynamic properties, however, remains a challenge due to the complex, degenerate relationships between sequence, structure, and molecular motion. Here, we introduce VibeGen, a generative AI framework that enables end-to-end de novo protein design conditioned on normal mode vibrations. VibeGen employs an agentic dual-model architecture, comprising a protein designer that generates sequence candidates based on specified vibrational modes and a protein predictor that evaluates their dynamic accuracy. This approach synergizes diversity, accuracy, and novelty during the design process. Via full-atom molecular simulations as direct validation, we demonstrate that the designed proteins accurately reproduce the prescribed normal mode amplitudes across the backbone while adopting various stable, functionally relevant structures. Notably, generated sequences are de novo, exhibiting no significant similarity to natural proteins, thereby expanding the accessible protein space beyond evolutionary constraints. Our work integrates protein dynamics into generative protein design, and establishes a direct, bidirectional link between sequence and vibrational behavior, unlocking new pathways for engineering biomolecules with tailored dynamical and functional properties. This framework holds broad implications for the rational design of flexible enzymes, dynamic scaffolds, and biomaterials, paving the way toward dynamics-informed AI-driven protein engineering.</description>

      <title>CellFlow: Simulating Cellular Morphology Changes via Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building a virtual cell capable of accurately simulating cellular behaviors in silico has long been a dream in computational biology. We introduce CellFlow, an image-generative model that simulates cellular morphology changes induced by chemical and genetic perturbations using flow matching. Unlike prior methods, CellFlow models distribution-wise transformations from unperturbed to perturbed cell states, effectively distinguishing actual perturbation effects from experimental artifacts such as batch effects -- a major challenge in biological data. Evaluated on chemical (BBBC021), genetic (RxRx1), and combined perturbation (JUMP) datasets, CellFlow generates biologically meaningful cell images that faithfully capture perturbation-specific morphological changes, achieving a 35% improvement in FID scores and a 12% increase in mode-of-action prediction accuracy over existing methods. Additionally, CellFlow enables continuous interpolation between cellular states, providing a potential tool for studying perturbation dynamics. These capabilities mark a significant step toward realizing virtual cell modeling for biomedical research.</description>

      <title>The allosteric lever: towards a principle of specific allosteric response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12025v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Allostery, the phenomenon by which the perturbation of a molecule at one site alters its behavior at a remote functional site, enables control over biomolecular function. Allosteric modulation is a promising avenue for drug discovery and is employed in the design of mechanical metamaterials. However, a general principle of allostery, i.e. a set of quantitative and transferable "ground rules", remains elusive. It is neither a set of structural motifs nor intrinsic motions. Focusing on elastic network models, we here show that an allosteric lever -- a mode-coupling pattern induced by the perturbation -- governs the directional, source-to-target, allosteric communication: a structural perturbation of an allosteric site couples the excitation of localized hard elastic modes with concerted long range soft-mode relaxation. Perturbations of non-allosteric sites instead couple hard and soft modes uniformly. The allosteric response is shown to be generally non-linear and non-reciprocal, and allows for minimal structural distortions to be efficiently transmitted to specific changes at distant sites. Allosteric levers exist in proteins and "pseudoproteins" -- networks designed to display an allosteric response. Interestingly, protein sequences that constitute allosteric transmission channels are shown to be evolutionarily conserved. To illustrate how the results may be applied in drug design, we use them to successfully predict known allosteric sites in proteins.</description>
