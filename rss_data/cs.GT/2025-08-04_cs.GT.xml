      <title>Computation of Approximately Stable Committees in Approval-based Elections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Approval-based committee selection is a model of significant interest in social choice theory. In this model, we have a set of voters $\mathcal{V}$, a set of candidates $\mathcal{C}$, and each voter has a set $A_v \subset \mathcal{C}$ of approved candidates. For any committee size $K$, the goal is to choose $K$ candidates to represent the voters' preferences. We study a criterion known as \emph{approximate stability}, where a committee is $\lambda$-approximately-stable if there is no other committee $T$ preferred by at least $\frac{\lambda|T|}{k} |\mathcal{V}| $ voters. We prove that a $3.65$-approximately stable committee always exists and can be computed algorithmically in this setting. Our approach is based on finding a Lindahl equilibrium and sampling from a strongly Rayleigh distribution associated with it.</description>

      <title>On the Equivalence of the Graph-Structural and Optimization-Based Characterizations of Popular Matchings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Popular matchings provide a model of matching under preferences in which a solution corresponds to a Condorcet winner in voting systems. In a bipartite graph in which the vertices have preferences over their neighbours, a matching is defined to be popular if it does not lose in a majority vote against any matching. In this paper, we study the following three primary problems: only the vertices on one side have preferences; a generalization of this problem allowing ties in the preferences; and the vertices on both sides have preferences. A principal issue in the algorithmic aspects of popular matchings is how to determine the popularity of a matching, because it requires exponential time if the definition is simply applied. In the literature, we have the following two types of characterizations: a graph-structural characterization; and an optimization-based characterization described by maximum-weight matchings. The graph-structural characterizations are specifically designed for each problem and provide a combinatorial structure of the popular matchings. The optimization-based characterizations work in the same manner for all problems, while they do not reveal the structure of the popular matchings. A main contribution of this paper is to provide a direct connection of the above two types of characterizations for all of the three problems. Specifically, we prove that each characterization can be derived from the other, without relying on the fact that they characterize popular matchings. Our proofs offer a comprehensive understanding of the equivalence of the two types of characterizations, and suggest a new interpretation of the graph-structural characterization in terms of the dual optimal solution for the maximum-weight matching problem.</description>

      <title>Justified Representation: From Hare to Droop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of proportionality in multiwinner voting with approval ballots has received much attention in recent years. Typically, proportionality is captured by variants of the Justified Representation axiom, which say that cohesive groups of at least $\ell\cdot\frac{n}{k}$ voters (where $n$ is the total number of voters and $k$ is the desired number of winners) deserve $\ell$ representatives. The quantity $\frac{n}{k}$ is known as the Hare quota in the social choice literature. Another -- more demanding -- choice of quota is the Droop quota, defined as $\lfloor\frac{n}{k+1}\rfloor+1$. This quota is often used in multiwinner voting with ranked ballots: in algorithms such as Single Transferable Voting, and in proportionality axioms, such as Droop's Proportionality Criterion. A few authors have considered it in the context of approval ballots, but the existing analysis is far from comprehensive. The contribution of our work is a systematic study of JR-style axioms (and voting rules that satisfy them) defined using the Droop quota instead of the Hare quota. For each of the standard JR axioms (namely, JR, PJR, EJR, FPJR, FJR, PJR+ and EJR+), we identify a voting rule that satisfies the Droop version of this axiom. In some cases, it suffices to consider known rules (modifying the corresponding Hare proof, sometimes quite substantially), and in other cases it is necessary to modify the rules from prior work. Each axiom is more difficult to satisfy when defined using the Droop quota, so our results expand the frontier of satisfiable proportionality axioms. We complement our theoretical results with an experimental study, showing that for many probabilistic models of voter approvals, Droop JR/EJR+ are considerably more demanding than standard (Hare) JR/EJR+.</description>

      <title>Ordinal Folding Index: A Computable Metric for Self-Referential Semantics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Ordinal Folding Index (OFI) is a new, fully computable yard-stick that measures how many rounds of self-reference a statement, protocol or position must unfold before its truth or outcome stabilises. By turning this abstract 'fold-back' depth into a single ordinal number, OFI forges a direct link between areas that are usually studied in isolation: the closure stages of fixed-point logics, the time-to-win values of infinite parity games, and the ordinal progressions that calibrate the strength of formal theories. We prove that OFI refines all classical game-theoretic and logical metrics while remaining algorithmically enumerable, supply a polynomial-time approximation scheme on finite arenas, and show how the index coincides exactly with the length of the shortest winning strategy in the associated evaluation game. Alongside the theory we outline five open problems from the completeness of the computable-ordinal spectrum to the possibility of 'compressing' deep self-reference that chart a research programme at the intersection of computer-aided logic, algorithmic game theory and ordinal analysis. OFI thus invites game theorists and logicians alike to view infinite play, transfinite induction and reflective reasoning through a single, intuitive lens, opening common ground for techniques.</description>

      <title>Optimal Messaging Strategy for Incentivizing Agents in Dynamic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a finite-horizon discrete-time dynamic system jointly controlled by a designer and one or more agents, where the designer can influence the agents' actions through selective information disclosure. At each time step, the designer sends a message to the agent(s) from a prespecified message space. The designer may also take an action that directly influences system dynamics and rewards. Each agent uses its received message (and its own information) to choose its action. We are interested in the setting where the designer would like to incentivize each agent to play a specific strategy. We consider a notion of incentive compatibility that is based on sequential rationality at each realization of the common information between the designer and the agent(s). Our objective is to find a messaging and action strategy for the designer that maximizes its total expected reward while incentivizing each agent to follow a prespecified strategy. Under certain assumptions on the information structure of the problem, we show that an optimal designer strategy can be computed using a backward inductive algorithm that solves a family of linear programs.</description>

      <title>The Power of Two in Token Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12414v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In economies without monetary transfers, token systems serve as an alternative to sustain cooperation, alleviate free riding, and increase efficiency. This paper studies whether a token-based economy can be effective in marketplaces with thin exogenous supply. We consider a marketplace in which at each time period one agent requests a service, one agent provides the service, and one token (artificial currency) is used to pay for service provision. The number of tokens each agent has represents the difference between the amount of service provisions and service requests by the agent. We are interested in the behavior of this economy when very few agents are available to provide the requested service. Since balancing the number of tokens across agents is key to sustain cooperation, the agent with the minimum amount of tokens is selected to provide service among the available agents. When exactly one random agent is available to provide service, we show that the token distribution is unstable. However, already when just two random agents are available to provide service, the token distribution is stable, in the sense that agents' token balance is unlikely to deviate much from their initial endowment, and agents return to their initial endowment in finite expected time. Our results mirror the power of two choices paradigm in load balancing problems. Supported by numerical simulations using kidney exchange data, our findings suggest that token systems may generate efficient outcomes in kidney exchange marketplaces by sustaining cooperation between hospitals.</description>

      <title>Dominated Actions in Imperfect-Information Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09716v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dominance is a fundamental concept in game theory. In strategic-form games dominated strategies can be identified in polynomial time. As a consequence, iterative removal of dominated strategies can be performed efficiently as a preprocessing step for reducing the size of a game before computing a Nash equilibrium. For imperfect-information games in extensive form, we could convert the game to strategic form and then iteratively remove dominated strategies in the same way; however, this conversion may cause an exponential blowup in game size. In this paper we define and study the concept of dominated actions in imperfect-information games. Our main result is a polynomial-time algorithm for determining whether an action is dominated (strictly or weakly) by any mixed strategy in n-player games, which can be extended to an algorithm for iteratively removing dominated actions. This allows us to efficiently reduce the size of the game tree as a preprocessing step for Nash equilibrium computation. We explore the role of dominated actions empirically in the "All In or Fold" No-Limit Texas Hold'em poker variant.</description>

      <title>Verification Cost Asymmetry in Cognitive Warfare: A Complexity-Theoretic Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21258v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Human verification under adversarial information flow operates as a cost-bounded decision procedure constrained by working memory limits and cognitive biases. We introduce the Verification Cost Asymmetry (VCA) coefficient, formalizing it as the ratio of expected verification work between populations under identical claim distributions. Drawing on probabilistically checkable proofs (PCP) and parameterized complexity theory, we construct dissemination protocols that reduce verification for trusted audiences to constant human effort while imposing superlinear costs on adversarial populations lacking cryptographic infrastructure. We prove theoretical guarantees for this asymmetry, validate the framework through controlled user studies measuring verification effort with and without spot-checkable provenance, and demonstrate practical encoding of real-world information campaigns. The results establish complexity-theoretic foundations for engineering democratic advantage in cognitive warfare, with immediate applications to content authentication, platform governance, and information operations doctrine.</description>
