      <title>Artificial Intelligence Powered Identification of Potential Antidiabetic Compounds in Ficus religiosa</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diabetes mellitus is a chronic metabolic disorder that necessitates novel therapeutic innovations due to its gradual progression and the onset of various metabolic complications. Research indicates that Ficus religiosa is a conventional medicinal plant that generates bioactive phytochemicals with potential antidiabetic properties. The investigation employs ecosystem-based computational approaches utilizing artificial intelligence to investigate and evaluate compounds derived from Ficus religiosa that exhibit antidiabetic properties. A comprehensive computational procedure incorporated machine learning methodologies, molecular docking techniques, and ADMET prediction systems to assess phytochemical efficacy against the significant antidiabetic enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4). DeepBindGCN and the AutoDock software facilitated the investigation of binding interactions via deep learning technology. Flavonoids and alkaloids have emerged as attractive phytochemicals due to their strong binding interactions and advantageous pharmacological effects, as indicated by the study. The introduction of AI accelerated screening procedures and enhanced accuracy rates, demonstrating its efficacy in researching plant-based antidiabetic agents. The scientific foundation now facilitates future experimental validation of natural product therapies tailored for diabetic management.</description>

      <title>Transforming Multi-Omics Integration with GANs: Applications in Alzheimer's and Cancer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-omics data integration is crucial for understanding complex diseases, yet limited sample sizes, noise, and heterogeneity often reduce predictive power. To address these challenges, we introduce Omics-GAN, a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based framework designed to generate high-quality synthetic multi-omics profiles while preserving biological relationships. We evaluated Omics-GAN on three omics types (mRNA, miRNA, and DNA methylation) using the ROSMAP cohort for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and TCGA datasets for colon and liver cancer. A support vector machine (SVM) classifier with repeated 5-fold cross-validation demonstrated that synthetic datasets consistently improved prediction accuracy compared to original omics profiles. The AUC of SVM for mRNA improved from 0.72 to 0.74 in AD, and from 0.68 to 0.72 in liver cancer. Synthetic miRNA enhanced classification in colon cancer from 0.59 to 0.69, while synthetic methylation data improved performance in liver cancer from 0.64 to 0.71. Boxplot analyses confirmed that synthetic data preserved statistical distributions while reducing noise and outliers. Feature selection identified significant genes overlapping with original datasets and revealed additional candidates validated by GO and KEGG enrichment analyses. Finally, molecular docking highlighted potential drug repurposing candidates, including Nilotinib for AD, Atovaquone for liver cancer, and Tecovirimat for colon cancer. Omics-GAN enhances disease prediction, preserves biological fidelity, and accelerates biomarker and drug discovery, offering a scalable strategy for precision medicine applications.</description>

      <title>Advancing Drug Development Through Strategic Cell Line and Compound Selection Using Drug Response Profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Early identification of sensitive cancer cell lines is essential for accelerating biomarker discovery and elucidating drug mechanism of action. Given the efficiency and low cost of small-scale drug screens relative to extensive omics profiling, we compared drug-response panel (DRP) descriptors against omics features for predictive capacity using gradient boosting tree models across the GDSC and CCLE drug response datasets. DRP descriptors consistently outperformed omics data across key performance metrics, with variable performance across different drugs. Using complementary explainability approaches, we confirmed known MAPK-inhibitor sensitivity signatures, and identified novel potential biomarker candidates for MEK1/2 and BTK/MNK inhibitors. Lastly, to demonstrate the utility of this approach in distinguishing phenotypes, we applied our models to the breast cancer line MCF7 versus the non-tumorigenic MCF10A, and successfully identified compounds that selectively inhibit MCF7 while sparing the non-tumorigenic MCF10A. This methodology, developed using focused drug and cell line panels, supports early-stage drug development by facilitating rational cell line selection and compound prioritisation, enabling more efficient biomarker identification and candidate assessment.</description>

      <title>Compressing Biology: Evaluating the Stable Diffusion VAE for Phenotypic Drug Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-throughput phenotypic screens generate vast microscopy image datasets that push the limits of generative models due to their large dimensionality. Despite the growing popularity of general-purpose models trained on natural images for microscopy data analysis, their suitability in this domain has not been quantitatively demonstrated. We present the first systematic evaluation of Stable Diffusion's variational autoencoder (SD-VAE) for reconstructing Cell Painting images, assessing performance across a large dataset with diverse molecular perturbations and cell types. We find that SD-VAE reconstructions preserve phenotypic signals with minimal loss, supporting its use in microscopy workflows. To benchmark reconstruction quality, we compare pixel-level, embedding-based, latent-space, and retrieval-based metrics for a biologically informed evaluation. We show that general-purpose feature extractors like InceptionV3 match or surpass publicly available bespoke models in retrieval tasks, simplifying future pipelines. Our findings offer practical guidelines for evaluating generative models on microscopy data and support the use of off-the-shelf models in phenotypic drug discovery.</description>

      <title>Drug-disease networks and drug repurposing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Repurposing existing drugs to treat new diseases is a cost-effective alternative to de novo drug development, but there are millions of potential drug-disease combinations to be considered with only a small fraction being viable. In silico predictions of drug-disease associations can be invaluable for reducing the size of the search space. In this work we present a novel network of drugs and the diseases they treat, compiled using a combination of existing textual and machine-readable databases, natural-language processing tools, and hand curation, and analyze it using network-based link prediction methods to identify potential drug-disease combinations. We measure the efficacy of these methods using cross-validation tests and find that several methods, particularly those based on graph embedding and network model fitting, achieve impressive prediction performance, significantly better than previous approaches, with area under the ROC curve above 0.95 and average precision almost a thousand times better than chance.</description>

      <title>Predicting Protein-Nucleic Acid Flexibility Using Persistent Sheaf Laplacians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the flexibility of protein-nucleic acid complexes, often characterized by atomic B-factors, is essential for elucidating their structure, dynamics, and functions, such as reactivity and allosteric pathways. Traditional models such as Gaussian Network Models (GNM) and Elastic Network Models (ENM) often fall short in capturing multiscale interactions, especially in large or complex biomolecular systems. In this work, we apply the Persistent Sheaf Laplacian (PSL) framework for the B-factor prediction of protein-nucleic acid complexes. The PSL model integrates multiscale analysis, algebraic topology, combinatoric Laplacians, and sheaf theory for data representation. It reveals topological invariants in its harmonic spectra and captures the homotopic shape evolution of data with its non-harmonic spectra. Its localization enables accurate B-factor predictions. We benchmark our method on three diverse datasets, including protein-RNA and nucleic-acid-only structures, and demonstrate that PSL consistently outperforms existing models such as GNM and multiscale FRI (mFRI), achieving up to a 21% improvement in Pearson correlation coefficient for B-factor prediction. These results highlight the robustness and adaptability of PSL in modeling complex biomolecular interactions and suggest its potential utility in broader applications such as mutation impact analysis and drug design.</description>

      <title>Generative diffusion model surrogates for mechanistic agent-based biological models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09630v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mechanistic, multicellular, agent-based models are commonly used to investigate tissue, organ, and organism-scale biology at single-cell resolution. The Cellular-Potts Model (CPM) is a powerful and popular framework for developing and interrogating these models. CPMs become computationally expensive at large space- and time- scales making application and investigation of developed models difficult. Surrogate models may allow for the accelerated evaluation of CPMs of complex biological systems. However, the stochastic nature of these models means each set of parameters may give rise to different model configurations, complicating surrogate model development. In this work, we leverage denoising diffusion probabilistic models to train a generative AI surrogate of a CPM used to investigate in vitro vasculogenesis. We describe the use of an image classifier to learn the characteristics that define unique areas of a 2-dimensional parameter space. We then apply this classifier to aid in surrogate model selection and verification. Our CPM model surrogate generates model configurations 20,000 timesteps ahead of a reference configuration and demonstrates approximately a 22x reduction in computational time as compared to native code execution. Our work represents a step towards the implementation of DDPMs to develop digital twins of stochastic biological systems.</description>

      <title>A novel attention mechanism for noise-adaptive and robust segmentation of microtubules in microscopy images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07800v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Segmenting cytoskeletal filaments in microscopy images is essential for understanding their cellular roles but remains challenging, especially in dense, complex networks and under noisy or low-contrast image conditions. While deep learning has advanced image segmentation, performance often degrades in these adverse scenarios. Additional challenges include the difficulty of obtaining accurate annotations and managing severe class imbalance. We proposed a novel noise-adaptive attention mechanism, extending the Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) module, to dynamically adjust to varying noise levels. This Adaptive SE (ASE) mechanism is integrated into a U-Net decoder, with residual encoder blocks, forming a lightweight yet powerful model: ASE_Res_U-Net. We also developed a synthetic-dataset strategy and employed tailored loss functions and evaluation metrics to mitigate class imbalance and ensure fair assessment. ASE_Res_U-Net effectively segmented microtubules in both synthetic and real noisy images, outperforming its ablated variants and state-of-the-art curvilinear-structure segmentation methods. It achieved this while using fewer parameters, making it suitable for resource-constrained environments. Importantly, ASE_Res_U-Net generalised well to other curvilinear structures (blood vessels and nerves) under diverse imaging conditions. Availability and implementation: Original microtubule datasets (synthetic and real noisy images) are available on Zenodo (DOIs: 10.5281/zenodo.14696279 and 10.5281/zenodo.15852660). ASE_Res_UNet model will be shared upon publication.</description>

      <title>Aligning Transformers with Continuous Feedback via Energy Rank Alignment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12961v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Searching through chemical space is an exceptionally challenging problem because the number of possible molecules grows combinatorially with the number of atoms. Large, autoregressive models trained on databases of chemical compounds have yielded powerful generators, but we still lack robust strategies for generating molecules with desired properties. This molecular search problem closely resembles the "alignment" problem for large language models, though for many chemical tasks we have a specific and easily evaluable reward function. Here, we introduce an algorithm called energy rank alignment (ERA) that leverages an explicit reward function to produce a gradient-based objective that we use to optimize autoregressive policies. We show theoretically that this algorithm is closely related to proximal policy optimization (PPO) and direct preference optimization (DPO), but has a minimizer that converges to an ideal Gibbs-Boltzmann distribution with the reward playing the role of an energy function. Furthermore, this algorithm is highly scalable, does not require reinforcement learning, and performs well relative to DPO when the number of preference observations per pairing is small. We deploy this approach to align molecular transformers and protein language models to generate molecules and protein sequences, respectively, with externally specified properties and find that it does so robustly, searching through diverse parts of chemical space.</description>

      <title>The Global Diffusion Limit for the Space Dependent Variable-Order Time-Fractional Diffusion Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18787v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The diffusion equation and its time-fractional counterpart can be obtained via the diffusion limit of continuous-time random walks with exponential and heavy-tailed waiting time distributions. The space dependent variable-order time-fractional diffusion equation is a generalization of the time-fractional diffusion equation with a fractional exponent that varies over space, modelling systems with spatial heterogeneity. However, there has been limited work on defining a global diffusion limit and an underlying random walk for this macroscopic governing equation, which is needed to make meaningful interpretations of the parameters for applications. Here, we introduce continuous time and discrete time random walk models that limit to the variable-order fractional diffusion equation via a global diffusion limit and space- and time- continuum limits. From this, we show how the master equation of the discrete time random walk can be used to provide a numerical method for solving the variable-order fractional diffusion equation. The results in this work provide underlying random walks and an improved understanding of the diffusion limit for the variable-order fractional diffusion equation, which is critical for the development, calibration and validation of models for diffusion in spatially inhomogeneous media with traps and obstacles.</description>

      <title>A Selective Review of Modern Stochastic Modeling: SDE/SPDE Numerics, Data-Driven Identification, and Generative Methods with Applications in Biomathematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11004v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This review maps developments in stochastic modeling, highlighting non-standard approaches and their applications to biology and epidemiology. It brings together four strands: (1) core models for systems that evolve with randomness; (2) learning key parts of those models directly from data; (3) methods that can generate realistic synthetic data in continuous time; and (4) numerical techniques that keep simulations stable, accurate, and faithful over long runs. The objective is practical: help researchers quickly see what is new, how the pieces fit together, and where important gaps remain. We summarize tools for estimating changing infection or reaction rates under noisy and incomplete observations, modeling spatial spread, accounting for sudden jumps and heavy tails, and reporting uncertainty in a way that is useful for decisions. We also highlight open problems that deserve near-term attention: separating true dynamics from noise when data are irregular; learning spatial dynamics under random influences with guarantees of stability; aligning training with the numerical method used in applications; preserving positivity and conservation in all simulations; reducing cost while controlling error for large studies; estimating rare but important events; and adopting clear, comparable reporting standards. By organizing the field around these aims, the review offers a concise guide to current methods, their practical use, and the most promising directions for future work in biology and epidemiology.s.</description>
