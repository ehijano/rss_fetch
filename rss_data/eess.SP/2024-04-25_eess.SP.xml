      <title>Comparative Analysis of Information Theoretic and Statistical Methods for Line Parameter Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies indicate that the noise characteristics of phasor measurement units (PMUs) can be more accurately described by non-Gaussian distributions. Consequently, estimation techniques based on Gaussian noise assumptions may produce poor results with PMU data. This paper considers the PMU based line parameter estimation (LPE) problem, and investigates the performance of four state-of-the-art techniques in solving this problem in presence of non-Gaussian measurement noise. The rigorous comparative analysis highlights the merits and demerits of each technique w.r.t. the LPE problem, and identifies conditions under which they are expected to give good results.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Automotive Radar Interference using Onboard Intelligent Reflective Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of automotive radars is gaining popularity as a means to enhance a vehicle's sensing capabilities. However, these radars can suffer from interference caused by transmissions from other radars mounted on nearby vehicles. To address this issue, we investigate the use of an onboard intelligent reflective surface (IRS) to artificially increase a vehicle's effective radar cross section (RCS), or its "electromagnetic visibility." Our proposed method utilizes the IRS's ability to form a coherent reflection of the incident radar waveform back towards the source radar, thereby improving radar performance under interference. We evaluated both passive and active IRS options. Passive IRS, which does not support reflection amplification, was found to be counter-productive and actually decreased the vehicle's effective RCS instead of enhancing it. In contrast, active IRS, which can amplify the reflection power of individual elements, effectively combats all types of automotive radar interference when the reflective elements are configured with a 15-35 dB reflection gain.</description>

      <title>A Novel Channel Coding Scheme for Digital Multiple Access Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the ChannelComp framework, which facilitates the computation of desired functions by multiple transmitters over a common receiver using digital modulations across a multiple access channel. While ChannelComp currently offers a broad framework for computation by designing digital constellations for over-the-air computation and employing symbol-level encoding, encoding the repeated transmissions of the same symbol and using the corresponding received sequence may significantly improve the computation performance and reduce the encoding complexity. In this paper, we propose an enhancement involving the encoding of the repetitive transmission of the same symbol at each transmitter over multiple time slots and the design of constellation diagrams, with the aim of minimizing computational errors. We frame this enhancement as an optimization problem, which jointly identifies the constellation diagram and the channel code for repetition, which we call ReChCompCode. To manage the computational complexity of the optimization, we divide it into two tractable subproblems. Through numerical experiments, we evaluate the performance of ReChCompCode. The simulation results reveal that ReChCompCode can reduce the computation error by approximately up to 30 dB compared to standard ChannelComp, particularly for product functions.</description>

      <title>Secret Key Generation Rates for Line of Sight Multipath Channels in the Presence of Eavesdroppers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the feasibility of implementing a lightweight key distribution scheme using physical layer security for secret key generation (SKG) is explored. Specifically, we focus on examining SKG with the received signal strength (RSS) serving as the primary source of shared randomness. Our investigation centers on a frequency-selective line-of-sight (LoS) multipath channel, with a particular emphasis on assessing SKG rates derived from the distributions of RSS. We derive the received signal distributions based on how the multipath components resolve at the receiver. The mutual information (MI) is evaluated based on LoS 3GPP channel models using a numerical estimator. We study how the bandwidth, delay spread, and Rician K-factor impact the estimated MI. This MI then serves as a benchmark setting bounds for the SKG rates in our exploration.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Design Framework for UE-side and BS-Side RIS Deployments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrating reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) in emerging communication systems is a fast-growing research field that has recently earned much attention. While implementing RISs near the base station (BS), i.e., BS-side RIS, or user equipment (UE), i.e., UE-side RIS, exhibits optimum performance, understanding the differences between these two deployments in terms of the system design perspective needs to be clarified. Critical design parameters, such as RIS size, phase shift adjustment, control link, and element type (passive/active), require greater clarity across these scenarios. Overlooking the intricacies of such critical design parameters in light of 6G demands endangers practical implementation, widening the gap between theoretical insights and practical applications. In this regard, our study investigates the impact of each RIS deployment strategy on the anticipated 6G requirements and offers tailored RIS design recommendations to fulfill these forward-looking requirements. Through this, we clarify the practical distinctions and propose a comprehensive framework for differentiating between BS-side and UE-side RIS scenarios in terms of their design parameters. Highlighting the unique needs of each and the potential challenges ahead, we aim to fuse the theoretical underpinnings of RIS with tangible implementation considerations, propelling progress in both the academic sphere and the industry.</description>

      <title>Exploring the limitations of blood pressure estimation using the photoplethysmography signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hypertension, a leading contributor to cardiovascular morbidity, underscores the need for accurate and continuous blood pressure (BP) monitoring. Photoplethysmography (PPG) presents a promising approach to this end. However, the precision of BP estimates derived from PPG signals has been the subject of ongoing debate, necessitating a comprehensive evaluation of their effectiveness and constraints. We developed a calibration-based Siamese ResNet model for BP estimation, using a signal input paired with a reference BP reading. We compared the use of normalized PPG (N-PPG) against the normalized Invasive Arterial Blood Pressure (N-IABP) signals as input. The N-IABP signals do not directly present systolic and diastolic values but theoretically provide a more accurate BP measure than PPG signals since it is a direct pressure sensor inside the body. Our strategy establishes a critical benchmark for PPG performance, realistically calibrating expectations for PPG's BP estimation capabilities. Nonetheless, we compared the performance of our models using different signal-filtering conditions to evaluate the impact of filtering on the results. We evaluated our method using the AAMI and the BHS standards employing the VitalDB dataset. The N-IABP signals meet with AAMI standards for both Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) and Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP), with errors of 1.29+-6.33mmHg for systolic pressure and 1.17+-5.78mmHg for systolic and diastolic pressure respectively for the raw N-IABP signal. In contrast, N-PPG signals, in their best setup, exhibited inferior performance than N-IABP, presenting 1.49+-11.82mmHg and 0.89+-7.27mmHg for systolic and diastolic pressure respectively. Our findings highlight the potential and limitations of employing PPG for BP estimation, showing that these signals contain information correlated to BP but may not be sufficient for predicting it accurately.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The VR industry is one of the most promising industries for the near future, as it can provide a more immersive connection between people and the virtual world. Currently, VR devices interact with people using inconvenient controllers or cameras that perform poorly in dark environments. Interaction through millimeter-wave wearable devices has the potential to conveniently track human behavior regardless of the lighting conditions. In this study, a millimeter-wave wearable antenna was developed, opening up the possibility for more immersive interaction with VR devices. The antenna features a low loss tangent polyester fabric to minimize dielectric losses and a smooth coating to reduce losses due to rough surfaces. The antenna operates in the 24GHz ISM band, with an S11 value of -29dB at 24.15GHz.</description>

      <title>Learned Pulse Shaping Design for PAPR Reduction in DFT-s-OFDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) is one of the main factors limiting cell coverage for cellular systems, especially in the uplink direction. Discrete Fourier transform spread orthogonal frequency-domain multiplexing (DFT-s-OFDM) with spectrally-extended frequency-domain spectrum shaping (FDSS) is one of the efficient techniques deployed to lower the PAPR of the uplink waveforms. In this work, we propose a machine learning-based framework to determine the FDSS filter, optimizing a tradeoff between the symbol error rate (SER), the PAPR, and the spectral flatness requirements. Our end-to-end optimization framework considers multiple important design constraints, including the Nyquist zero-ISI (inter-symbol interference) condition. The numerical results show that learned FDSS filters lower the PAPR compared to conventional baselines, with minimal SER degradation. Tuning the parameters of the optimization also helps us understand the fundamental limitations and characteristics of the FDSS filters for PAPR reduction.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Grant-Free Protocol in mMTC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper revisits the identity detection problem under the current grant-free protocol in massive machine-type communications (mMTC) by asking the following question: for stable identity detection performance, is it enough to permit active devices to transmit preambles without any handshaking with the base station (BS)? Specifically, in the current grant-free protocol, the BS blindly allocates a fixed length of preamble to devices for identity detection as it lacks the prior information on the number of active devices $K$. However, in practice, $K$ varies dynamically over time, resulting in degraded identity detection performance especially when $K$ is large. Consequently, the current grant-free protocol fails to ensure stable identity detection performance. To address this issue, we propose a two-stage communication protocol which consists of estimation of $K$ in Phase I and detection of identities of active devices in Phase II. The preamble length for identity detection in Phase II is dynamically allocated based on the estimated $K$ in Phase I through a table lookup manner such that the identity detection performance could always be better than a predefined threshold. In addition, we design an algorithm for estimating $K$ in Phase I, and exploit the estimated $K$ to reduce the computational complexity of the identity detector in Phase II. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed two-stage communication protocol and algorithms.</description>

      <title>Deep Joint CSI Feedback and Multiuser Precoding for MIMO OFDM Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The design of precoding plays a crucial role in achieving a high downlink sum-rate in multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. In this correspondence, we propose a deep learning based joint CSI feedback and multiuser precoding method in frequency division duplex systems, aiming at maximizing the downlink sum-rate performance in an end-to-end manner. Specifically, the eigenvectors of the CSI matrix are compressed using deep joint source-channel coding techniques. This compression method enhances the resilience of the feedback CSI information against degradation in the feedback channel. A joint multiuser precoding module and a power allocation module are designed to adjust the precoding direction and the precoding power for users based on the feedback CSI information. Experimental results demonstrate that the downlink sum-rate can be significantly improved by using the proposed method, especially in scenarios with low signal-to-noise ratio and low feedback overhead.</description>

      <title>Improved impedance inversion by deep learning and iterated graph Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning techniques have shown significant potential in many applications through recent years. The achieved results often outperform traditional techniques. However, the quality of a neural network highly depends on the used training data. Noisy, insufficient, or biased training data leads to suboptimal results.
  We present a hybrid method that combines deep learning with iterated graph Laplacian and show its application in acoustic impedance inversion which is a routine procedure in seismic explorations. A neural network is used to obtain a first approximation of the underlying acoustic impedance and construct a graph Laplacian matrix from this approximation. Afterwards, we use a Tikhonov-like variational method to solve the impedance inversion problem where the regularizer is based on the constructed graph Laplacian. The obtained solution can be shown to be more accurate and stable with respect to noise than the initial guess obtained by the neural network. This process can be iterated several times, each time constructing a new graph Laplacian matrix from the most recent reconstruction. The method converges after only a few iterations returning a much more accurate reconstruction.
  We demonstrate the potential of our method on two different datasets and under various levels of noise. We use two different neural networks that have been introduced in previous works. The experiments show that our approach improves the reconstruction quality in the presence of noise.</description>

      <title>Generalized Step-Chirp Sequences With Flexible Bandwidth</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sequences with low aperiodic autocorrelation sidelobes have been extensively researched in literatures. With sufficiently low integrated sidelobe level (ISL), their power spectrums are asymptotically flat over the whole frequency domain. However, for the beam sweeping in the massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) broadcast channels, the flat spectrum should be constrained in a passband with tunable bandwidth to achieve the flexible tradeoffs between the beamforming gain and the beam sweeping time. Motivated by this application, we construct a family of sequences termed the generalized step-chirp (GSC) sequence with a closed-form expression, where some parameters can be tuned to adjust the bandwidth flexibly. In addition to the application in beam sweeping, some GSC sequences are closely connected with Mow's unified construction of sequences with perfect periodic autocorrelations, and may have a coarser phase resolution than the Mow sequence while their ISLs are comparable.</description>

      <title>STAR-RIS-Assisted Communication Radar Coexistence: Analysis and Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is expected to play a prominent role among emerging technologies in future wireless communications. In particular, a communication radar coexistence system is degraded significantly by mutual interference. In this work, given the advantages of promising reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), we propose a simultaneously transmitting and reflecting RIS (STAR-RIS)-assisted radar coexistence system where a STAR-RIS is introduced to improve the communication performance while suppressing the mutual interference and providing full space coverage. Based on the realistic conditions of correlated fading, and the presence of multiple user equipments (UEs) at both sides of the RIS, we derive the achievable rates at the radar and the communication receiver side in closed forms in terms of statistical channel state information (CSI). Next, we perform alternating optimization (AO) for optimizing the STAR-RIS and the radar beamforming. Regarding the former, we optimize the amplitudes and phase shifts of the STAR-RIS through a projected gradient ascent algorithm (PGAM) simultaneously with respect to the amplitudes and phase shifts of the surface for both energy splitting (ES) and mode switching (MS) operation protocols. The proposed optimization saves enough overhead since it can be performed every several coherence intervals. This property is particularly beneficial compared to reflecting-only RIS because a STAR-RIS includes the double number of variables, which require increased overhead. Finally, simulation results illustrate how the proposed architecture outperforms the conventional RIS counterpart, and show how the various parameters affect the performance. Moreover, a benchmark full instantaneous CSI (I-CSI) based design is provided and shown to result in higher sum-rate but also in large overhead associated with complexity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been a significant expansion in the Internet of Things (IoT), with a growing number of devices being connected to the internet. This has led to an increase in data collection and analysis as well as the development of new technologies and applications. The rise of IoT has also brought about new challenges, such as security concerns and energy efficiency. This study investigates a layered IoT architecture that combines fog and cloud computing, aiming to assess the impact of service placement on energy efficiency. Through simulations, we analyse energy use across Access Fog, Metro Fog, and Cloud Data Centre layers for different IoT request volumes. Findings indicate that Access Fog is optimal for single requests, while Metro Fog efficiently manages higher demands from multiple devices. The study emphasizes the need for adaptive service deployment, responsive to network load variations, to improve energy efficiency. Hence, we propose the implementation of dynamic service placement strategies within Internet of Things (IoT) environments.</description>

      <title>Towards Symbiotic SAGIN Through Inter-operator Resource and Service Sharing: Joint Orchestration of User Association and Radio Resources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN) is a pivotal architecture to support ubiquitous connectivity in the upcoming 6G era. Inter-operator resource and service sharing is a promising way to realize such a huge network, utilizing resources efficiently and reducing construction costs. Given the rationality of operators, the configuration of resources and services in SAGIN should focus on both the overall system performance and individual benefits of operators. Motivated by emerging symbiotic communication facilitating mutual benefits across different radio systems, we investigate the resource and service sharing in SAGIN from a symbiotic communication perspective in this paper. In particular, we consider a SAGIN consisting of a ground network operator (GNO) and a satellite network operator (SNO). Specifically, we aim to maximize the weighted sum rate (WSR) of the whole SAGIN by jointly optimizing the user association, resource allocation, and beamforming. Besides, we introduce a sharing coefficient to characterize the revenue of operators. Operators may suffer revenue loss when only focusing on maximizing the WSR. In pursuit of mutual benefits, we propose a mutual benefit constraint (MBC) to ensure that each operator obtains revenue gains. Then, we develop a centralized algorithm based on the successive convex approximation (SCA) method. Considering that the centralized algorithm is difficult to implement, we propose a distributed algorithm based on Lagrangian dual decomposition and the consensus alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Finally, we provide extensive numerical simulations to demonstrate the effectiveness of the two proposed algorithms, and the distributed optimization algorithm can approach the performance of the centralized one.</description>

      <title>A Sample-Deficient Analysis of the Leading Generalized Eigenvalue for the Detection of Signals in Colored Gaussian Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.11214v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the signal detection problem in colored Gaussian noise with an unknown covariance matrix. To be specific, we consider a sample deficient scenario in which the number of signal bearing samples ($n$) is strictly smaller than the dimensionality of the signal space ($m$). Our test statistic is the leading generalized eigenvalue of the whitened sample covariance matrix (a.k.a. $F$-matrix) which is constructed by whitening the signal bearing sample covariance matrix with noise-only sample covariance matrix. The whitening operation along with the observation model induces a single spiked covariance structure on the $F$-matrix. Moreover, the sample deficiency (i.e., $m&gt;n$) in turn makes this $F$-matrix rank deficient, thereby {\it singular}. Therefore, a simple exact statistical characterization of the leading generalized eigenvalue (l.g.e.) of a complex correlated {\it singular} $F$-matrix with a single spiked associated covariance is of paramount importance to assess the performance of the detector (i.e., the receiver operating characteristics (ROC)). To this end, we adopt the powerful orthogonal polynomial technique in random matrix theory to derive a new finite dimensional c.d.f. expression for the l.g.e. of this particular $F$-matrix. It turns out that when the noise only sample covariance matrix is nearly rank deficient and the signal-to-noise ratio is $O(m)$, the ROC profile converges to a remarkably simple limiting profile.</description>

      <title>LuViRA Dataset Validation and Discussion: Comparing Vision, Radio, and Audio Sensors for Indoor Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.02961v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a unique comparative analysis, and evaluation of vision, radio, and audio based localization algorithms. We create the first baseline for the aforementioned sensors using the recently published Lund University Vision, Radio, and Audio (LuViRA) dataset, where all the sensors are synchronized and measured in the same environment. Some of the challenges of using each specific sensor for indoor localization tasks are highlighted. Each sensor is paired with a current state-of-the-art localization algorithm and evaluated for different aspects: localization accuracy, reliability and sensitivity to environment changes, calibration requirements, and potential system complexity. Specifically, the evaluation covers the ORB-SLAM3 algorithm for vision-based localization with an RGB-D camera, a machine-learning algorithm for radio-based localization with massive MIMO technology, and the SFS2 algorithm for audio-based localization with distributed microphones. The results can serve as a guideline and basis for further development of robust and high-precision multi-sensory localization systems, e.g., through sensor fusion, context, and environment-aware adaptation.</description>

      <title>Integrated Distributed Semantic Communication and Over-the-air Computation for Cooperative Spectrum Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04791v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cooperative spectrum sensing (CSS) is a promising approach to improve the detection of primary users (PUs) using multiple sensors. However, there are several challenges for existing combination methods, i.e., performance degradation and ceiling effect for hard-decision fusion (HDF), as well as significant uploading latency and non-robustness to noise in the reporting channel for soft-data fusion (SDF). To address these issues, an integrated communication and computation (ICC) framework is proposed in this paper. Specifically, distributed semantic communication (DSC) jointly optimizes multiple sensors and the fusion center to minimize the transmitted data without degrading detection performance. Moreover, over-the-air computation (AirComp) is utilized to further reduce spectrum occupation in reporting channel, taking advantage of characteristics of wireless channel to enable data aggregation. Under the ICC framework, a particular system, namely ICC-CSS, is designed and implemented, which is theoretically proved to be equivalent to the optimal estimator-correlator (E-C) detector with equal gain SDF when the PU signal samples are independent and identically distributed. Extensive simulations verify the superiority of ICC-CSS compared with various conventional CSS schemes in terms of detection performance, robustness to SNR variations in both sensing and reporting channels, as well as scalability with respect to the number of samples and sensors.</description>

      <title>Channel Estimation for RIS-Aided mmWave MU-MIMO Systems with Hybrid Beamforming Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06966v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Channel estimation is one of the key challenges for the deployment of extremely large-scale reconfigurable intelligent surface (XL-RIS) assisted multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. In this paper, we study the channel estimation problem for XL-RIS assisted multi-user XL-MIMO systems with hybrid beamforming structures. For this system, we propose an {\em unified} channel estimation method that yields a notable estimation accuracy in the near-field BS-RIS and near-field RIS-User channels (in short, near-near field channels), far-near field channels, and far-far field channels. Our key idea is that the effective (or cascaded) channels to be estimated can be each factorized as the product of low-rank matrices (i.e., the product of the common (or user-independent) matrix and the user-specific coefficient matrix). The common matrix whose columns are the basis of the column space of the BS-RIS channel matrix is efficiently estimated via a {\em collaborative} low-rank approximation (CLRA). Leveraging the hybrid beamforming structures, we develop an efficient iterative algorithm that jointly optimizes the user-specific coefficient matrices. Via experiments and complexity analysis, we verify the effectiveness of the proposed channel estimation method (named CLRA-JO) in the aforementioned three classes of wireless channels.</description>

      <title>OFDM Reference Signal Pattern Design Criteria for Integrated Communication and Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09643v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ambiguity performance, which indicates the maximum detectable region for target parameter estimation, is critical to radar sensor design. Driven by ambiguity performance requirements of bi-static sensing, we propose design criteria for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) reference signal (RS) patterns. The design not only reduces ambiguities in both time delay and Doppler shift domains under different types of sensing algorithms, but also reduces resource overhead for integrated comunication and sensing. With minimal modifications of post-FFT processing for current RS patterns, guard interval is extended beyond conventional cyclic prefix (CP), while maintaining inter-symbol-interference-(ISI)-free delay estimation. For standard-resolution sensing algorithms, a staggering offset of a linear slope that is relatively prime to the RS comb size is suggested. As for high-resolution sensing algorithms, necessary and sufficient conditions of comb RS staggering offsets, plus new patterns synthesized therefrom, are derived for the corresponding achievable ambiguity performance. Furthermore, we generalize the RS pattern design criterion for high-resolution sensing algorithms to irregular forms, which minimizes number of resource elements (REs) for associated algorithms to eliminate all side peaks. Starting from staggered comb pattern in current positioning RS, our generalized design eventually removes any regular form for ultimate flexibility. Overall, the proposed techniques are promising to extend the ISI- and ambiguity-free range of distance and speed estimates for radar sensing.</description>

Abstract: Ambiguity performance is a critical criterion in radar sensor design, which indicates the ambiguities arising from multiple target estimation and detection. We considered a requirement-driven selection of OFDM reference signal (RS) patterns based on ambiguity performances for bi-static sensing in integrated communication and sensing with minimal modifications of current RSs. An RS pattern with a staggering offset of a linear slope that is relatively prime to the RS comb size is suggested for standard-resolution sensing algorithms to obtain the best ambiguity performances. Moreover, an extended guard interval design is proposed to increase the maximum time delay, that is inter-symbol interference (ISI) free using post-FFT sensing algorithms. The proposed techniques are promising to extend the distance and speed without ambiguities and ISI for sensing.</description>

      <title>Forecasting Electricity Market Signals via Generative AI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05743v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a generative artificial intelligence approach to probabilistic forecasting of electricity market signals, such as real-time locational marginal prices and area control error signals. Inspired by the Wiener-Kallianpur innovation representation of nonparametric time series, we propose a weak innovation autoencoder architecture and a novel deep learning algorithm that extracts the canonical independent and identically distributed innovation sequence of the time series, from which future time series samples are generated. The validity of the proposed approach is established by proving that, under ideal training conditions, the generated samples have the same conditional probability distribution as that of the ground truth. Three applications involving highly dynamic and volatile time series in real-time market operations are considered: (i) locational marginal price forecasting for self-scheduled resources such as battery storage participants, (ii) interregional price spread forecasting for virtual bidders in interchange markets, and (iii) area control error forecasting for frequency regulations. Numerical studies based on market data from multiple independent system operators demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed generative forecaster over leading classical and modern machine learning techniques under both probabilistic and point forecasting metrics.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically Near-Optimal Hybrid Beamforming for mmWave IRS-Aided MIMO Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09083v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hybrid beamforming is an emerging technology for massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems due to the advantages of lower complexity, cost, and power consumption. Recently, intelligent reflection surface (IRS) has been proposed as the cost-effective technique for robust millimeter-wave (mmWave) MIMO systems. Thus, it is required to jointly optimize a reflection vector and hybrid beamforming matrices for IRS-aided mmWave MIMO systems. Due to the lack of RF chain in the IRS, it is unavailable to acquire the TX-IRS and IRS-RX channels separately. Instead, there are efficient methods to estimate the so-called effective (or cascaded) channel in literature. We for the first time derive the near-optimal solution of the aforementioned joint optimization only using the effective channel. Based on our theoretical analysis, we develop the practical reflection vector and hybrid beamforming matrices by projecting the asymptotic solution into the modulus constraint. Via simulations, it is demonstrated that the proposed construction can outperform the state-of-the-art (SOTA) method, where the latter even requires the knowledge of the TX-IRS and IRS-RX channels separately. Furthermore, our construction can provide robustness for channel estimation errors, which is inevitable for practical massive MIMO systems.</description>

      <title>An Empirical Study of Large-Scale Data-Driven Full Waveform Inversion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.15388v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of big data on deep learning models to help solve the full waveform inversion (FWI) problem. While it is well known that big data can boost the performance of deep learning models in many tasks, its effectiveness has not been validated for FWI. To address this gap, we present an empirical study that investigates how deep learning models in FWI behave when trained on OpenFWI, a collection of large-scale, multi-structural, synthetic datasets published recently. In particular, we train and evaluate the FWI models on a combination of 10 2D subsets in OpenFWI that contain 470K pairs of seismic data and velocity maps in total. Our experiments demonstrate that training on the combined dataset yields an average improvement of 13.03% in MAE, 7.19% in MSE and 1.87% in SSIM compared to each split dataset, and an average improvement of 28.60%, 21.55% and 8.22% in the leave-one-out generalization test. We further demonstrate that model capacity needs to scale in accordance with data size for optimal improvement, where our largest model yields an average improvement of 20.06%, 13.39% and 0.72% compared to the smallest one.</description>
