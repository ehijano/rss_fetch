      <title>BiRNe: Symbolic bifurcation analysis of reaction networks with Python</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computer algebra methods for analyzing reaction networks often rely on the assumption of mass-action kinetics, which transform the governing ODEs into polynomial systems amenable to techniques such as Gr\"obner basis computation and related algebraic tools. However, these methods face significant computational complexity, limiting their applicability to relatively small networks involving only a handful of species. In contrast, building on recent theoretical advances, we introduce here \textsc{BiRNe} (BIfurcations in Reaction NEtworks) Python module, which relies on a symbolic approach designed to detect bifurcations in larger reaction networks (up to 10-20 species, depending on the network's connectivity) equipped with parameter-rich kinetics. This class includes enzymatic kinetics such as Michaelis--Menten, ligand-binding kinetics like Hill functions, and generalized mass-action kinetics. For a given network, the current algorithm identifies all minimal autocatalytic subnetworks and fully characterizes the presence of bifurcations associated with zero eigenvalues, thus determining whether the network admits multistationarity. It also detects oscillatory bifurcations arising from positive-feedback structures, capturing a significant class of possible oscillations.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic Graph Embeddings Reveal the Host-Pathogen Interactome</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Infections depend on interactions between pathogen and host proteins, but comprehensively mapping these interactions is challenging and labor intensive. Many biological networks have hierarchical, scale-free structure, so we developed a deep learning framework, ApexPPI, that represents protein networks in hyperbolic Riemannian space to capture these features. Our model integrates multimodal biological data (protein sequences, gene perturbation experiments, and complementary interaction networks) to predict likely interactions between pathogen and host proteins through multi-task hyperbolic graph neural networks. Mapping protein features into hyperbolic space led to much higher accuracy than previous methods in predicting host-pathogen interactions. From tens of millions of possible protein pairs, our model identified thousands of high-confidence interactions, including many involving human G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). We validated dozens of these predicted complexes using AlphaFold 3 structural modeling, supporting the accuracy of our predictions. This comprehensive map of host-pathogen protein interactions provides a resource for discovering new treatments and illustrates how advanced AI can unravel complex biological systems.</description>
