      <title>KoMbine: Propagating Statistical and Systematic Errors to Kaplan--Meier Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kaplan--Meier curves are widely used in medical research to evaluate the performance of biomarkers and predict patient outcomes. These curves are often shown without error bands, and even when error bands are provided, they typically only account for the statistical uncertainty resulting from the finite number of patients in the study. In reality, other sources of uncertainty affect the measurements as well. As datasets grow, the statistical uncertainty on the number of patients no longer dominates the overall uncertainty, and other uncertainties are increasingly important to model. The KoMbine package, developed based on procedures used in particle physics, provides the first method to propagate both statistical and systematic uncertainties through the Kaplan--Meier curve estimation processes.</description>

      <title>Random Matrix Theory-guided sparse PCA for single-cell RNA-seq data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-cell RNA-seq provides detailed molecular snapshots of individual cells but is notoriously noisy. Variability stems from biological differences, PCR amplification bias, limited sequencing depth, and low capture efficiency, making it challenging to adapt computational pipelines to heterogeneous datasets or evolving technologies. As a result, most studies still rely on principal component analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, valued for its interpretability and robustness. Here, we improve upon PCA with a Random Matrix Theory (RMT)-based approach that guides the inference of sparse principal components using existing sparse PCA algorithms. We first introduce a novel biwhitening method, inspired by the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm, that simultaneously stabilizes variance across genes and cells. This enables the use of an RMT-based criterion to automatically select the sparsity level, rendering sparse PCA nearly parameter-free. Our mathematically grounded approach retains the interpretability of PCA while enabling robust, hands-off inference of sparse principal components. Across seven single-cell RNA-seq technologies and four sparse PCA algorithms, we show that this method systematically improves the reconstruction of the principal subspace and consistently outperforms PCA-, autoencoder-, and diffusion-based methods in cell-type classification tasks.</description>

      <title>siDPT: siRNA Efficacy Prediction via Debiased Preference-Pair Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Small interfering RNA (siRNA) is a short double-stranded RNA molecule (about 21-23 nucleotides) with the potential to cure diseases by silencing the function of target genes. Due to its well-understood mechanism, many siRNA-based drugs have been evaluated in clinical trials. However, selecting effective binding regions and designing siRNA sequences requires extensive experimentation, making the process costly. As genomic resources and publicly available siRNA datasets continue to grow, data-driven models can be leveraged to better understand siRNA-mRNA interactions. To fully exploit such data, curating high-quality siRNA datasets is essential to minimize experimental errors and noise. We propose siDPT: siRNA efficacy Prediction via Debiased Preference-Pair Transformer, a framework that constructs a preference-pair dataset and designs an siRNA-mRNA interactive transformer with debiased ranking objectives to improve siRNA inhibition prediction and generalization. We evaluate our approach using two public datasets and one newly collected patent dataset. Our model demonstrates substantial improvement in Pearson correlation and strong performance across other metrics.</description>

      <title>A Hypothesis-First Framework for Mechanistic Model Evaluation and Selection in Neuroimaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neuroimaging provides rich measurements of brain structure and neural activity, but turning these data into mechanistic insight remains difficult. Statistical models quantify associations without much considerations for how they arise, whereas bio-realistic models directly embody candidate mechanisms but remain hard to deploy rigorously without specialized training. We present a framework that recasts modeling choices as testable mechanistic hypotheses and supplies a simple protocol for rejecting inappropriate model specifications, such as under-/over-parameterization or invalid simplifying assumptions, based on predefined criteria before any parameter inference. The key idea is expected model behavior under feature generalization constraints: instead of judging a model solely by how well it fits a specific target feature of interest Y at an optimal parameter set, we evaluate the model's expected Y output when the model is constrained to reproduce a broader, or distinct, feature Z over the entire parameter space. We then assess whether a mirror statistical model, derived from the model's expected Y outputs, to the empirical statistical model using standard statistics. In synthetic experiments with known ground truth (Wilson Cowan dynamics), the framework correctly rejects mis-specified hypotheses, penalizes unnecessary degrees of freedom, and preserves valid specifications. This provides a practical, hypothesis-first route to using mechanistic models for neuroimaging without requiring expert-level methodology.</description>

      <title>Lateral oscillation and body compliance help snakes and snake robots stably traverse large, smooth obstacles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.13733</link>

Abstract: Snakes can move through almost any terrain. Similarly, snake robots hold the promise as a versatile platform to traverse complex environments like earthquake rubble. Unlike snake locomotion on flat surfaces which is inherently stable, when snakes traverse complex terrain by deforming their body out of plane, it becomes challenging to maintain stability. Here, we review our recent progress in understanding how snakes and snake robots traverse large, smooth obstacles that lack anchor points for gripping or bracing. First, we discovered that the generalist variable kingsnake combines lateral oscillation and cantilevering. Regardless of step height and surface friction, the overall gait is preserved. Next, to quantify static stability of the snake, we developed a method to interpolate continuous body in three dimensions (both position and orientation) between discrete tracked markers. By analyzing the base of support using the interpolated continuous body 3-D kinematics, we discovered that the snake maintained perfect stability during traversal, even on the most challenging low friction, high step. Finally, we applied this gait to a snake robot and systematically tested its performance traversing large steps with variable heights to further understand stability principles. The robot rapidly and stably traversed steps nearly as high as a third of its body length. As step height increased, the robot rolled more frequently to the extent of flipping over, reducing traversal probability. The absence of such failure in the snake with a compliant body inspired us to add body compliance to the robot. With better surface contact, the compliant body robot suffered less roll instability and traversed high steps at higher probability, without sacrificing traversal speed. Our robot traversed large step-like obstacles more rapidly than most previous snake robots, approaching that of the animal.</description>

      <title>An energy landscape approach to locomotor transitions in complex 3D terrain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.12717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2006.12717v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Effective locomotion in nature happens by transitioning across multiple modes (e.g., walk, run, climb). Despite this, far more mechanistic understanding of terrestrial locomotion has been on how to generate and stabilize around near-steady-state movement in a single mode. We still know little about how locomotor transitions emerge from physical interaction with complex terrain. Consequently, robots largely rely on geometric maps to avoid obstacles, not traverse them. Recent studies revealed that locomotor transitions in complex 3-D terrain occur probabilistically via multiple pathways. Here, we show that an energy landscape approach elucidates the underlying physical principles. We discovered that locomotor transitions of animals and robots self-propelled through complex 3-D terrain correspond to barrier-crossing transitions on a potential energy landscape. Locomotor modes are attracted to landscape basins separated by potential energy barriers. Kinetic energy fluctuation from oscillatory self-propulsion helps the system stochastically escape from one basin and reach another to make transitions. Escape is more likely towards lower barrier direction. These principles are surprisingly similar to those of near-equilibrium, microscopic systems. Analogous to free energy landscapes for multi-pathway protein folding transitions, our energy landscape approach from first principles is the beginning of a statistical physics theory of multi-pathway locomotor transitions in complex terrain. This will not only help understand how the organization of animal behavior emerges from multi-scale interactions between their neural and mechanical systems and the physical environment, but also guide robot design, control, and planning over the large, intractable locomotor-terrain parameter space to generate robust locomotor transitions through the real world.</description>

      <title>Coordinated appendages accumulate more energy to self-right on the ground</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.08981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2008.08981v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Animals and robots must right themselves after flipping over on the ground. The discoid cockroach pushes its wings against the ground in an attempt to dynamically self-right by a somersault. However, because this maneuver is strenuous, the animal often fails to overcome the potential energy barrier and makes continual attempts. In this process, the animal flails its legs, whose lateral perturbation eventually leads it to roll to the side to self-right. Our previous work developed a cockroach-inspired robot capable of leg-assisted, winged self-righting, and a robot simulation study revealed that the outcome of this strategy depends sensitively on wing-leg coordination (measured by the phase between their motions). Here, we further elucidate why this is the case by developing a template to model the complex hybrid dynamics resulting from discontinuous contact and actuation. We used the template to calculate the potential energy barrier that the body must overcome to self-right, mechanical energy contribution by wing pushing and leg flailing, and mechanical energy dissipation due to wing-ground collision. The template revealed that wing-leg coordination (phase) strongly affects self-righting outcome by changing mechanical energy budget. Well-coordinated appendage motions (good phase) accumulate more mechanical energy than poorly-coordinated motions (bad phase), thereby better overcoming the potential energy barrier to self-right more successfully. Finally, we demonstrated practical use of the template for predicting a new control strategy to further increase self-righting performance and informing robot design.</description>

      <title>Single-Trajectory Bayesian Modeling Reveals Multi-State Diffusion of the MSH Sliding Clamp</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21943v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: DNA mismatch repair (MMR) is the essential mechanism for preserving genomic integrity in various living organisms. In this process, MutS homologs (MSH) play crucial roles in identifying mismatched basepairs and recruiting downstream MMR proteins. The MSH protein exhibits distinct functions and diffusion dynamics before and after the recognition of mismatches while traversing along DNA. An ADP-bound MSH, known as the MSH searching clamp, scans DNA sequences via rotational diffusion along the DNA backbone. Upon recognizing a mismatch, the MSH combines with ATP molecules, forming a stable sliding clamp. Recent experimental evidence challenges the conventional view that the sliding clamp performs a simple Brownian motion. In this study, we explore the diffusion dynamics of the ATP-bound MSH sliding clamp through single-particle tracking experiments and introduce a Bayesian single-trajectory modeling framework to analyze its motion. Our quantitative analysis reveals that the diffusion characteristics defy explanation by a single-state diffusion mechanism. Instead, our in-depth model inference uncovers three distinct diffusion states, each characterized by specific diffusion coefficients. These states alternate over time, with cross-state transitions predominantly involving one intermediate state, and direct transitions between the slowest and the fastest states being scarce. We propose that these multi-state dynamics reflect underlying conformational changes in the MSH sliding clamp, highlighting a more intricate diffusion mechanism than previously appreciated.</description>

      <title>Multi-modal Adaptive Estimation for Temporal Respiratory Disease Outbreak</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08578v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Timely and robust influenza incidence forecasting is critical for public health decision-making. This paper presents MAESTRO (Multi-modal Adaptive Estimation for Temporal Respiratory Disease Outbreak), a novel, unified framework that synergistically integrates advanced spectro-temporal modeling with multi-modal data fusion, including surveillance, web search trends, and meteorological data. By adaptively weighting heterogeneous data sources and decomposing complex time series patterns, the model achieves robust and accurate forecasts. Evaluated on over 11 years of Hong Kong influenza data (excluding the COVID-19 period), MAESTRO demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, achieving a superior model fit with an R-square of 0.956. Extensive ablations confirm the significant contributions of its multi-modal and spectro-temporal components. The modular and reproducible pipeline is made publicly available to facilitate deployment and extension to other regions and pathogens, presenting a powerful tool for epidemiological forecasting.</description>
