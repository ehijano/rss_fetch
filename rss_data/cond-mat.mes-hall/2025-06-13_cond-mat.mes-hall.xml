      <title>Electron-magnon coupling at the interface of a "twin-twisted" antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify a "twin-twist" angle in orthorhombic two-dimensional magnets that maximizes interlayer orbital overlap and enables strong interfacial coupling. Focusing on the van der Waals antiferromagnet CrSBr, we show that this twist angle, near 72 deg, aligns diagonal lattice vectors across the layers, enhancing the interlayer hopping that is spin-forbidden in pristine systems and orbital-forbidden in 90-deg-twisted samples. The enhanced hopping modifies the electronic structure and activates a novel mechanism for excitation of interfacial magnons. Using optical probes we discover that excitons on one side of the interface selectively excite magnons localized on the opposite side. We show that this cross-coupling phenomenon can be understood as a consequence of the spin-transfer torque as that arises as electrons tunnel across the twin-twisted interface. Our findings demonstrate that large-angle twisting in anisotropic 2D materials offers a powerful tool for engineering spin and charge transport through controlled interlayer hybridization, opening new avenues for twisted magnetism and strongly correlated moir\'e physics.</description>

      <title>Kardar--Parisi--Zhang universality in optically induced lattices of exciton--polariton condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate space-time coherence in one-dimensional lattices of exciton-polariton condensates formed by fully reconfigurable non-resonant optical pumping. Starting from an open-dissipative Gross-Pitaevskii equation with deterministic reservoir kinetics and stochastic condensate noise, we derive a discrete complex-field model that incorporates coherent tunnelling, reservoir-mediated dissipative coupling and gain-saturation non-linearity. Adiabatic elimination of fast density fluctuations reveals a wedge-shaped region in the complex hopping plane where the coarse-grained phase dynamics reduces to the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation. By computing high-resolution phase diagrams of the temporal and spatial scaling exponents we pinpoint the boundaries separating the KPZ domain from the Edwards-Wilkinson (EW) regime. Large-scale graphics processing unit (GPU) simulations of chains containing up to $N=2000$ condensates confirm these predictions: inside the wedge the exponents converge to $\beta_{N}=\textbf{0.329}(3)\!\approx\!1/3$ and $\chi_{N}=\textbf{0.504}(4)\!\approx\!1/2$, whereas outside it the dynamics moves away from KPZ and ultimately flows toward the EW fixed point, although finite system size and finite observation time may yield intermediate effective exponents. These results pave the way to the implementation of ultrafast KPZ-simulators based on one-dimensional arrays of exciton-polariton condensates.</description>

      <title>Theory of bound magnetic polarons in cubic and uniaxial antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by a recent debate about the origin of remanent magnetization and the corresponding anomalous Hall effect in antiferromagnets and their subclass, altermagnets, a theory of bound magnetic polarons (BMPs) in anisotropic antiferromagnetic semiconductors is developed. The theory describes quantitatively the experimentally observed magnitude of excess magnetization and its dependence on the magnetic field in cubic antiferromagnetic EuTe. In contrast to the cubic case, our theory predicts the presence of magnetization hysteresis below N\'eel temperature in antiferromagnets with uniaxial anisotropy. We show, employing material parameters implied by experimental and ab initio results, that the magnitudes of remanent magnetization and the coercive field are in accord with recent experimental observations for altermagnetic hexagonal MnTe. While the altermagnets have an intrinsic contribution to the remanent magnetization and the anomalous Hall effect, our theory explains the origin of an extrinsic contribution. Our findings address, therefore, a question about the relative contribution to the remanent magnetization of bound magnetic polarons and weak ferromagnetism driven by the antisymmetric exchange interaction, the latter weakened by the formation of antiferromagnetic domains. Furthermore, we provide the theory of BMP spontaneous spin splitting, which can be probed optically.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous emission and Purcell effect: some aspects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This chapter, part of the Proceedings of the III International Workshop on Quantum Nonstationary Systems (eds. Alexandre Dodonov and Lucas Chibebe Celeri), held in Brasilia in August 2024, offers a comprehensive overview of spontaneous emission (SE) and the Purcell effect within the broader context of quantum electrodynamics (QED) and vacuum fluctuations. It begins with a historical and theoretical review, tracing the development of classical and quantum electromagnetic theories. The chapter then examines how the SE rate of a quantum emitter is fundamentally influenced by its electromagnetic environment, the so-called Purcell effect, through canonical examples, such as emitters near perfectly conducting plates and inside cavities, as well as more advanced scenarios. Special attention is given to modern strategies for tailoring SE using engineered environments, including plasmonic cloaks, composite media near percolation thresholds, metal-insulator phase transitions, and strain-induced modulation in phosphorene. Analytical techniques, such as mode summation and Green's function formalism, are employed to describe how surrounding materials and boundary conditions affect local field modes and the local density of states. The findings underscore both the theoretical depth and experimental relevance of SE modulation, paving the way for innovations in nano-optics, quantum technologies, and advanced material design.</description>

      <title>Slip electron flow in GaAs microscale constrictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrodynamic electron transport in solids, governed by momentum-conserving electron-electron collisions, offers a unique framework to explore collective phenomena. Within this framework, correlated electron motion is modeled as viscous fluid flow, with viscosity serving as the interaction parameter. Advances in electron hydrodynamics remain constrained by two unresolved issues: the questionable existence of perfect boundary slip$\unicode{x2013}$a hallmark of frictionless transport$\unicode{x2013}$in electron fluids, and the lack of quantitative experimental confirmation of the theoretical relation linking the viscosity to electron-electron scattering length. Here, we resolve this through independent measurements of these quantities in the same electron system in GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure. Our experiments provide direct evidence of perfect boundary slip in microscale constrictions$\unicode{x2013}$unprecedented phenomenon for electron liquid that parallels ultrafast water transport in carbon nanotubes. These findings bridge the fields of electron hydrodynamics and nanofluidics, highlighting the transformative potential of hydrodynamic engineering across condensed matter and fluidic technologies.</description>

      <title>Poor Man's Majoranon in Two Quantum Dots Dressed by Superconducting Quasi-Excitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a hybrid system consisting of two quantum dots (QDs) coupled to a superconductor (SC), zero-bias peaks in the differential conductance spectrum have been reported as potential signatures of Majorana fermions (MFs). However, such signatures typically appear only at specific parameter values of the QDs--so-called `sweet spots'--and are referred to as the Poor Man's Majorana (PMM). To investigate whether these signatures can be conclusively attributed to genuine MFs emerging over a continuous parameter range, we present an alternative approach that microscopically incorporates the superconducting effects into the QDs, rather than simply attribute them into two phenomenological parameters of QDs. This forms the dressed Majorana fermions (DMFs), which can be viewed as superpositions of quasi-excitations from both the QDs and the SC. We show that DMFs can localize at one end of a one-dimensional SC and persist across a continuous parameter range, thereby enhancing the feasibility of experimental detection. Our results provide a more accurate description of the PMM in such hybrid systems and offer practical guidance for observing end-localized PMM modes in continuous one-dimensional SC.</description>

      <title>Method of analysis of the spectra obtained by microfocused Brillouin light scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brillouin Light Scattering is a powerful technique to measure the microwave excitations present in a magnetic system. In microfocused mode, the light is focused on the sample using a microscope objective. This accelerates substantially the measurement but results in mixing the response of all microwave excitations into a single spectrum, such that modeling is required to disentangle the contribution of each spin wave. By assuming that a spectrum collected in microfocused mode can be approximated by the sum of all back-scattering spectra that can be collected by the microscope objective, we develop a simple and direct way of interpreting spectra. The model is compared to experimental data collected on a 50 nm thick CoFeB magnetic film. The model allows the understanding of the influence of the optical properties of a sample, of the dispersion relation of the spin wave eigenexcitations and of their thickness profiles, as well as of their populations onto the magnitudes and the lineshapes of the characteristic features of a spectrum</description>

      <title>Optical absorption in hexagonal-diamond Si and Ge nanowires: insights from STEM-EELS experiments and ab initio theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hexagonal-diamond (2H) group IV nanowires are key for advancing group IV-based lasers, quantum electronics, and photonics. Understanding their dielectric response is crucial for performance optimization, but their optical absorption properties remain unexplored. We present the first comprehensive study of optical absorption in 2H-Si and 2H-Ge nanowires, combining high-resolution STEM, monochromated EELS, and ab initio simulations. The nanowires, grown in situ in a TEM as nanobranches on GaAs stems, show excellent structural quality: single crystalline, strain-free, minimal defects, no substrate contamination, enabling access to intrinsic dielectric response. 2H-Si exhibits enhanced absorption in the visible range compared to cubic Si, with a marked onset above 2.5 eV. 2H-Ge shows absorption near 1 eV but no clear features at the direct bandgap, as predicted by ab initio simulations. A peak around 2 eV in aloof-beam spectra is attributed to a thin 3C-Ge shell. These findings clarify structure-optical response relationships in 2H materials.</description>

      <title>Light-induced Floquet spin-triplet Cooper pairs in unconventional magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recently predicted unconventional magnets offer a new ground for exploring the formation of nontrivial spin states due to their inherent nonrelativistic momentum-dependent spin splitting. In this work, we consider unconventional magnets with $d$- and $p$-wave parities and investigate the effect of time-periodic light drives for inducing the formation of spin-triplet phases in the normal and superconducting states. In particular, we consider unconventional magnets without and with conventional superconductivity under linearly and circularly polarized light drives and treat the time-dependent problem within Floquet formalism, which naturally unveils photon processes and Floquet bands determining the emergent phenomena Using Floquet formalism, we reveal multiple spin-degenerate nodes in the Floquet spin density, which can be dissected into single- and double-photon processes, and connected to spin-triplet Cooper pairs. Notably, both odd- and even-frequency spin-triplet pairs can be generated by the interplay between the driving field and the unconventional magnetism. Moreover, the intrinsic spatial asymmetry of the unconventional magnet allows linearly polarized light to control magnetic and polarization directions. By tuning the driving amplitude, frequency, and polarization, Floquet spin density and pairing amplitude can be dynamically controlled, offering promising applications in Floquet engineering spintronic and superconducting devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic media with artificial periodic modulation-magnonic crystals (MCs) - enable tunable spin-wave dynamics and band structure engineering. Nanoscaling enhances these capabilities, making magnonic nanocrystals promising for both fundamental studies and applications. Here, we report on the design, fabrication, and characterization of one-dimensional YIG MCs with nanoholes ($d \approx $ 150 nm) spaced $a \approx 1 \mu$m apart. Micro-focused Brillouin light scattering and propagating spin-wave spectroscopy, supported by TetraX and MuMax$^3$ simulations, reveal spin-wave transmission over 5 $\mu$m in the Damon-Eshbach configuration, and the formation of pronounced band gaps with rejection levels up to 26 dB. Detailed analysis of the spin-wave dispersion uncovered complex mode interactions, including two prominent anticrossings at 3.1 and 18.7 rad/$\mu$m, between which the spin-wave energy is predominantly carried by the $n$ = 2 mode, enabling efficient transmission. The results advance the development of functional MCs and open pathways toward 2D magnonic nanoarrays and magnonic RF nanodevices.</description>

      <title>A Taylor Series Approximation Model for Characterizing the Output Resistance of a GFET</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mobility-degradation-based model for the drain-to-source or output resistance of a graphene field-effect-transistor is linearized here using a Taylor series approximation. This simplification is shown to be valid from magnitudes of the gate voltage not significantly higher than the Dirac voltage, and it enables the analytical determination of the transconductance parameter, the voltage related to residual charges, and a bias-independent series resistance of the GFET. Furthermore, a continuous representation of the device's static response is achieved when substituting the extracted parameters into the model, regardless the transfer characteristic symmetry with respect to the Dirac voltage.</description>

      <title>Electric field control of third-order nonlinear Hall effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The third-order nonlinear Hall effect (NLHE) serves as a sensitive probe of energy band geometric property, providing a new paradigm for revealing the Berry curvature distribution and topological response of quantum materials. In the Weyl semimetal TaIrTe4, we report for the first time that the sign of the third-order NLHE reverses with decreasing temperature. Through scaling law analysis, we think that the third-order NLHE at high (T &gt; 23 K) and low (T &lt; 23 K) temperatures is dominated by Berry-connection polarizability (BCP) and impurity scattering, respectively. The third-order NLHE response strength can be effectively modulated by an additional applied in-plane constant electric field. At the high temperature region, the BCP reduction induced by the electric field leads to a decrease in the third-order NLHE response strength, while at the low temperature region, the electric field cause both BCP and impurity scattering effects to weaken, resulting in a more significant modulation of the third-order NLHE response strength. At 4 K and an electric field strength of 0.3 kV/cm, the modulated relative response strength could reach up to 65.3%. This work provides a new means to explore the third-order NLHE and a valuable reference for the development of novel electronic devices.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theoretical framework to investigate quantum magnetotransport in monolayer jacutingaite, focusing on its response to external electric fields and off-resonant circularly polarized laser irradiation. Our analysis reveals a sequence of topological phase transitions triggered by tuning these external parameters. We find that the zeroth LL exhibits spin- and valley-polarized splitting, leading to four distinct peaks in the DOSs for the $K$ and $K'$ valleys. Using the Kubo formalism, we calculate both longitudinal and Hall magneto-optical conductivities based on the Kane-Mele model. Our results demonstrate that external electric, magnetic, and off-resonant optical fields can control these conductivities. These findings highlight monolayer jacutingaite as a highly tunable platform with strong potential for future applications in photonics, optoelectronics, and topological quantum devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum manipulation of molecular radical spins provides a crucial platform for exploring emergent phenomena in many-body systems. Here, we combine surface-confined synthesis with scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) tip-induced dehydrogenation to achieve atom-precise engineering of quasi-one-dimensional porphyrin-based Kondo chains (1-7 units) on Au(111). Key design innovations leverage large-sized porphyrins to suppress intrachain antiferromagnetic coupling, while ${Zn}^{2+}$ chelation at porphyrin cores enhances molecule-substrate interactions to amplify Kondo effect. High-resolution STS measurements and low-energy effective modeling collectively demonstrate that ${\pi}$-radicals at each fused-porphyrin unit form Kondo singlets screened by conduction electrons. Adjacent singlets develop direct coherent coupling via quantum-state-overlap-enabled electron tunneling. Crucially, chiral symmetry in the effective model governs zero-mode distribution-present in odd-length chains yet absent in even-length chains-which dictates pronounced odd-even quantum effects in STS spectra of finite chains. Furthermore, geometric control emerges through conformational distortions modulated by chain fusion width. This enables directional tuning of the competition between Kondo screening and magnetic exchange. Tilted single/fused-triple-porphyrin chains weaken spin exchange through enhanced Kondo coupling, while parallel fused-double-porphyrin chains suppress Kondo screening via increased spin exchange. This opposing modulation of Kondo versus exchange interactions establishes an inverse control paradigm. This work simultaneously resolves the dimensional dependence of many-body correlations in confined quantum systems and pioneers approaches for quantum-critical manipulation in molecular spin architectures.</description>

      <title>Dirac edge states of two-dimensional altermagnetic topological crystalline insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) metallic altermagnets present exciting opportunities for both fundamental research and practical innovations. Their ability to enhance tunneling magnetoresistance in magnetic tunnel junctions, combined with the direct control of spin currents via electric fields, makes them highly promising for spintronic devices. Moreover, the rich electronic structure of altermagnets can host nontrivial topological phases. In particular, topological crystalline insulators are compounds where the topological states are protected by both crystalline and time-reversal symmetries. Furthermore, manipulating the state of a system between topological and trivial phases through external parameters unlocks new possibilities for quantum materials and advanced electronics. We show the edge states of a 2D altermagnetic topological crystalline insulator, using as a representative example Cr$_2$BAl, a 2D MBene metallic altermagnet with a d$_{x^2-y^2}$ altermagnetic ordering. We find that the system can host an altermagnetic phase with extremely large ``weak ferrimagnetism" which is sizeable also with light atoms, only with an in-plane component of the N\'eel vector. The electronic structure of Cr$_2$BAl presents multiple crossings and anti-crossings in the vicinity of the Fermi level along [100] and [010] directions. When the spin-orbit coupling interaction is included, with the N\'eel vector along [001] direction, energy gaps open at the band crossing points, resulting in a pronounced peak in the spin Hall conductivity. The simulated Cr-B terminated [100] edge-projected band structure reveals Dirac dispersions at the bulk crossings and anti-crossings, which are absent in Cr-Al terminations.</description>

      <title>Comment on "Electric conductivity of graphene: Kubo model versus a nonlocal quantum field theory model (arXiv:2403.02279v3)"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Rodriguez-Lopez, Wang, and Antezza [arXiv:2403.02279v3; Phys. Rev. B v.111, 115428 (2025)] compared the theoretical descriptions of electric conductivity of graphene given by the Kubo model and quantum field theory in terms of the polarizationtensor. According to these authors, in the spatially nonlocal case, the quantum field theoretical description contains ``hard inconsistencies". To bring the predictions of quantum field theory in agreement with those following from the Kubo model, the modified expression was used which relates the conductivity and the polarization tensor. Here, it is shown that this modification violates the the requirement of gauge invariance and, thus, is unacceptable. By comparing both theoretical approaches, we demonstrate that all the results obtained within quantum field theory are physically well justified whereas an application of the modified expression for the conductivity of graphene leads to the consequences of nonphysical character.</description>

      <title>Automated All-RF Tuning for Spin Qubit Readout and Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient tuning of spin qubits remains a major bottleneck in scaling semiconductor quantum dot-based quantum processors. A key challenge is the rapid identification of gate voltage regimes suitable for qubit initialisation, control, and readout. Here, we leverage radio-frequency charge sensing to automate spin qubit tuning, achieving a median tuning time of approximately 15 minutes. In a single continuous run, our routine identifies spin qubits at 12 distinct charge transitions in under 17 hours. Beyond tuning, our routine autonomously acquires data revealing the gate-voltage dependence of the exchange interaction, dephasing time, and quality factor -- quantities that vary substantially between charge configurations. These results represent a step change in high-throughput spin qubit tuning and provide a foundation for a systematic and automated exploration of semiconductor quantum circuits.</description>

      <title>Photonic chiral bulk transports manipulated by boundary freedom in three-dimensional meta-crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In topological physics, one of the most intriguing phenomena is the presence of topological boundary states, accurately predicted by the well-established bulk-edge correspondence. For example, in three-dimensional Weyl semimetals, Fermi arcs emerge to connect projected Weyl points on the surface due to inheriting the bulk-edge correspondence from the integer quantum Hall effect. However, limited attention has been paid to exploring the reverse mechanism in topological crystals. In this study, we propose that boundaries can serve as an alternative degree of freedom to manipulate topological bulk transports. We analytically and experimentally validate our concept using a finite-thickness photonic meta-crystal that supports bulk nodal lines, with its zeroth modes exhibiting opposite chiral bulk transports under different boundary conditions. Notably, the mirror symmetry remains preserved across both configurations. These findings are applicable to other topological systems, providing new insights into systems with varied boundary conditions and offering the potential for the design of more compact and spatially efficient topological photonic devices.</description>

      <title>Interacting Electronic Topology of Nonlocal Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlocal crystals are systems with translational symmetry but arbitrary range couplings or interactions between degrees of freedom. We argue that the notion of topology in such systems does not collapse to that in zero dimensions, as one may naively expect in view of the infinite interaction range. At the same time, we show that the range of available topological phases can be enriched in comparison to the case with local interactions. This is demonstrated by constructing an example of a fermionic symmetry-protected phase in one dimension in symmetry class AII with inversion symmetry, using a Hatsugai-Kohmoto-type model. The new phase exists only in a nonlocal crystal with electron-electron interactions and can be identified from symmetry eigenvalues. We construct an associated topological charge pump as a physical manifestation of its topology.</description>

      <title>Entangled Interlocked Diamond-like (Diamondiynes) Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diamondynes, a new class of diamond-like carbon allotropes composed of carbon with sp$^2$/sp$^3$-hybridized carbon networks, exhibit unique structural motifs that have not been previously reported in carbon materials. These architectures feature sublattices that are both interlocked and capable of relative movement. Using ab initio simulations, we have conducted an extensive investigation into the structural and electronic properties of five diamondyne structures. Our results show that diamondiynes are thermodynamically stable and exhibit wide electronic band gaps, from 2.2 eV to 4.0 eV. They are flexible yet highly resistant compared to other diamond-like structures. They have relatively small cohesive energy values, consistent with the fact that one diamondyne structure (2f-unsym) has already been experimentally realized. Our results provide new physical insights into diamond-like carbon networks and suggest promising directions for the development of porous, tunable frameworks with potential applications in energy storage and conversion.</description>

      <title>Exploring Topological and Localization Phenomena in SSH Chains under Generalized AAH Modulation: A Computational Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model serves as a canonical example of a one-dimensional topological insulator, yet its behavior under more complex, realistic conditions remains a fertile ground for research. This paper presents a comprehensive computational investigation into generalized SSH models, exploring the interplay between topology, quasi-periodic disorder, non-Hermiticity, and time-dependent driving. Using exact diagonalization and specialized numerical solvers, we map the system's phase space through its spectral properties and localization characteristics, quantified by the Inverse Participation Ratio (IPR). We demonstrate that while the standard SSH model exhibits topologically protected edge states, these are destroyed by a localization transition induced by strong Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper (AAH) modulation. Further, we employ unsupervised machine learning (PCA) to autonomously classify the system's phases, revealing that strong localization can obscure underlying topological signatures. Extending the model beyond Hermiticity, we uncover the non-Hermitian skin effect, a dramatic localization of all bulk states at a boundary. Finally, we apply a periodic Floquet drive to a topologically trivial chain, successfully engineering a Floquet topological insulator characterized by the emergence of anomalous edge states at the boundaries of the quasi-energy zone. These findings collectively provide a multi-faceted view of the rich phenomena hosted in generalized 1D topological systems.</description>

      <title>Tracking and controlling monolayer water in gold nanogaps using extreme plasmonic spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nanogaps are ubiquitous across science, confining molecules and thus changing chemistries which influence many areas such as catalysis, corrosion, photochemistry, and sensing. However in ambient conditions, it is unclear how water solvates nanogaps and even if nominally dry, what water structure persists. Despite its low Raman cross-section, surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) enables study of water at coinage metal surfaces. Using multi-layer aggregates of close-packed gold nanoparticles with sub-nanometre gaps precisely defined by organic spacer molecules, we achieve consistent and large SERS enhancements, enabling systematic study of water within these confined spaces. Ostensibly dry facets in air evidence water monolayer coatings, with hydrogen-bonding only reappearing upon immersion in solution. Under negative applied potentials, surface water is seen to re-orient at the metal facets with distinct spectral shifts among the quartet of vibrational peaks which correspond to those expected from water dimers. Comparing nanogaps in deuterated water also reveals how individual water molecules bind onto organic spacer molecules in such nanogaps. Realistic models of water dressing will enable better understanding of catalytic and contact chemistries.</description>

      <title>Van der Waals waveguide quantum electrodynamics probed by infrared nano-photoluminescence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atomically layered van der Waals (vdW) materials exhibit remarkable properties, including highly-confined infrared waveguide modes and the capacity for infrared emission in the monolayer limit. Here, we engineered structures that leverage both of these nano-optical functionalities. Specifically, we encased a photoluminescing atomic sheet of MoTe2 within two bulk crystals of WSe2, forming a vdW waveguide for the embedded light-emitting monolayer. The modified electromagnetic environment offered by the WSe2 waveguide alters MoTe2 spontaneous emission, a phenomenon we directly image with our interferometric nano-photoluminescence technique. We captured spatially-oscillating nanoscale patterns prompted by spontaneous emission from MoTe2 into waveguide modes of WSe2 slabs. We quantify the resulting Purcell-enhanced emission rate within the framework of a waveguide quantum electrodynamics (QED) model, relating the MoTe2 spontaneous emission rate to the measured waveguide dispersion. Our work marks a significant advance in the implementation of all-vdW QED waveguides.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear N\'eel Spin-Orbit Torque in Centrosymmetric Antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electric control of N\'eel vector is a central task of antiferromagnetic (AFM) spintronics. The major scheme so far relies on the linear N\'eel torque, which however is restricted to AFMs with broken inversion symmetry. Here, we propose a nonlinear N\'eel spin-orbit torque, uniquely enabling electric control in the vast class of centrosymmetric AFMs, where the existing scheme fails. Importantly, its intrinsic component, rooted in sublattice-resolved band quantum geometry, offers two additional advantages: It operates also in $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric AFM insulators, where linear torque is forbidden; and it has anti-damping character, making it more efficient in driving magnetic dynamics. Combined with first-principles calculations, we predict large effect in MnRh and MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$, which can be readily detected in experiment. Our work unveils a new fundamental effect, offers a new strategy of electric control in AFM systems beyond the existing paradigm, and opens the door to the field of nonlinear AFM spintronics.</description>

      <title>Deterministic Switching of the N\'{e}el Vector by Asymmetric Spin Torque</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: N\'{e}el vector, the order parameter of collinear antiferromagnets, serves as a state variable in associated antiferromagnetic (AFM) spintronic devices to encode information. A deterministic switching of N\'{e}el vector is crucial for the write-in operation, which, however, remains a challenging problem in AFM spintronics. Here we demonstrate, based on analytical derivation and macro-spin simulations, that N\'{e}el vector switching can be generally achieved via a current-induced spin torque, provided the spin accumulations responsible for this torque are non-identical between opposite sublattices. This condition occurs widely in AFM films, as symmetry equivalence between sublattice-dependent spin accumulations is usually absent, allowing unequal spin accumulations induced by Edelstein effect or a spin current. The consequent asymmetric spin torque leads to N\'{e}el vector dynamics fundamentally different from previous expectations. The switching conditions derived analytically agree well with simulation results and suggest various directions for further optimization. Our work establishes a general mechanism for current-induced N\'{e}el vector switching, which is in principle feasible for all collinear antiferromagnets, and thus paves the route to realize efficient writing in antiferromagnetic spintronics.</description>

      <title>From stripes to hexagons: strain-induced 2D Pb phases confined between graphene and SiC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The intercalation of metals beneath graphene offers a powerful route to stabilizing and protecting novel two-dimensional (2D) phases. The epitaxial growth of Pb monolayers on SiC(0001), combined with the relatively large spacing of the suspended graphene, makes this system particularly distinctive. Using low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) and various microscopy techniques -- including scanning electron microscopy (SEM), scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), and low-energy electron microscopy (LEEM) -- we have investigated the intercalation process across multiple length scales. Our analysis reveals the formation of different 2D Pb monolayer phases, such as stripes and hexagons, which emerge due to the interplay between substrate pinning and strain within the Pb layer, depending on local coverage. These findings provide new insights into the strain-driven stabilization of intercalated metal layers and highlight the potential of graphene as a versatile platform for engineering low-dimensional materials.</description>

Abstract: Inspired by parallel developments in coarse geometry in mathematics and exact macroscopic quantization in physics, we present a family of general trace formulae which are universally quantized and depend only on large-scale geometric features of the input data. They generalize, to arbitrary dimensions, formulae found by Roe in his partitioned manifold index theorem, as well as the Kubo and Kitaev formulae for 2D Hall conductance used in physics.</description>

      <title>Apparent inconsistency between Streda formula and Hall conductivity in reentrant integer quantum anomalous Hall effect in twisted MoTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent experiments in twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ (tMoTe$_2$) have uncovered a rich landscape of correlated phases. In this work, we investigate the reentrant integer quantum anomalous Hall (RIQAH) states reported in F. Xu, et. al., arXiv:2504.06972 which displays a notable mismatch between the Hall conductivity measured via transport and that inferred from the Streda formula. We argue that this discrepancy can be explained if the RIQAH state is a quantum Hall bubble phase, analogous to similar well-established phenomena in 2D GaAs quantum wells. While this explains the RIQAH state at a filling $\nu = -0.63$, the other RIQAH state at $\nu = -0.7$ has a smaller slope necessitating a different interpretation. We propose that this discrepancy arises due to a nearby resistive peak masking the true slope. Furthermore, we identify this resistive peak as a signature of a magnetic phase transition near $\nu = -0.75$, possibly driven by a Van Hove singularity. The anomalous Hall response and Landau fan evolution across this transition suggest a change in Fermi surface topology and a phase with zero Chern number, potentially corresponding to an inter-valley coherent state. These observations offer new insights into the nature of the RIQAH states and raise the possibility that the nearby superconducting phase may have an inter-valley coherent normal state.</description>

      <title>Layer Coherence Origin of Planar Hall Effect: from Charge to Multipole and Valley</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17166v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We uncover a new origin of the planar Hall effect - as an intrinsic property of layer coherent electrons - that exists even in bilayer and trilayer atomically thin limit. It reforms the existing theories requiring three-dimensional orbital motion, or strong spin-orbit coupling of certain forms, which are absent in van der Waals thin films. We exemplify that the effect can be triggered by strain and interlayer sliding in twisted structures with rich tunability and strong magnitudes. Furthermore, this layer coherence mechanism broadens the conceptual framework to include planar multipole Hall effect, and valley Hall effect induced by in-plane pseudo-magnetic field, outreaching the existing mechanisms. The layer mechanism also provides a new route towards quantized Hall response upon a topological phase transition induced by in-plane magnetic field. These results unveil the unexplored potential of quantum layertronics and moir\'e flat band for planar transport in 2D materials.</description>

      <title>High-fidelity single-spin shuttling in silicon</title>

Abstract: The computational power and fault-tolerance of future large-scale quantum processors derive in large part from the connectivity between the qubits. One approach to increase connectivity is to engineer qubit-qubit interactions at a distance. Alternatively, the connectivity can be increased by physically displacing the qubits. This has been explored in trapped-ion experiments and using neutral atoms trapped with optical tweezers. For semiconductor spin qubits, several studies have investigated spin coherent shuttling of individual electrons, but high-fidelity transport over extended distances remains to be demonstrated. Here we report shuttling of an electron inside an isotopically purified Si/SiGe heterostructure using electric gate potentials. First, we form static quantum dots, and study how spin coherence decays as we repeatedly move a single electron between up to five dots. Next, we create a traveling wave potential to transport an electron in a moving quantum dot. This second method shows substantially better spin coherence than the first. It allows us to displace an electron over an effective distance of 10 $\mu$m in under 200 ns with an average fidelity of 99.5%. These results will guide future efforts to realize large-scale semiconductor quantum processors, making use of electron shuttling both within and between qubit arrays.</description>

      <title>Tailoring the Electronic Configurations of YPc$_2$ on Cu(111): Decoupling Strategies for Molecular Spin Qubits Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15539v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Among the potential spin qubit candidates, yttrium phthalocyanine double-decker (YPc$_2$) features a diamagnetic metal ion core that stabilizes the molecular structure, while its magnetic properties arise primarily from an unpaired electron (S=1/2) delocalized over the two phthalocyanine (Pc) ligands. Understanding its properties in the proximity of metal electrodes is crucial to assess its potential use in molecular spin qubits architectures. Here, we investigated the morphology and electronic structure of this molecule adsorbed on Cu(111) surface using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). On Cu(111), YPc$_2$ adsorbs flat, with isolated molecules showing a preferred orientation along the &lt;111&gt; crystal axes. Moreover, we observed two different types of self-assembly molecular packing when growing molecular patches. For YPc$_2$ in direct contact with Cu(111), STM revealed a widely separated highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (HOMO/LUMO), suggesting the quenching of the unpaired spin. Conversely, when YPc$_2$ is separated from the metal substrate by a few-layer thick diamagnetic zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc) layer, we found the HOMO to split into singly occupied and singly unoccupied molecular orbitals (SOMO/SUMO). We observed that more than 2 layers of ZnPc are needed to avoid intermixing between the two molecules and spin quenching in YPc2. Density functional theory (DFT) reveals the spin quenching is due to the hybridization between YPc$_2$ and Cu(111) states, confirming the importance of using suitable decoupling layers to preserve the unpaired molecular spin. Our results suggest the potential of YPc$_2$/ZnPc heterostructures as a stable and effective molecular spin qubit platform and validate the possibility of integrating this molecular spin qubit candidate in future quantum logic devices.</description>

      <title>Scattering near-field optical microscopy at 1-nm resolution using ultralow tip oscillation amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18455v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscopy (s-SNOM) allows for the observation of the optical response of material surfaces with a resolution far below the diffraction limit. Based on amplitude-modulation atomic force microscopy (AFM) with typical tapping amplitudes of tens of nanometers, a spatial resolution of 10-100 nm is routinely achieved in s-SNOM. However, optical imaging and spectroscopy of atomic-scale structures remain a substantial challenge. Here, we developed ultralow tip oscillation amplitude s-SNOM (ULA-SNOM), where the ultra-confined field localized at a 1-nm-scale gap between a plasmonic tip and sample is combined with frequency-modulation (non-contact) AFM in a stable cryogenic ultrahigh vacuum environment. Using a silver tip under visible laser illumination with a constant 1-nm amplitude oscillation, we obtain a material-contrast image of silicon islands on a silver surface with 1-nm lateral resolution, which surpasses the conventional limits of s-SNOM. ULA-SNOM paves the way for the acquisition of optical information from atomic-scale structures, such as single photo-active defects and molecules.</description>

      <title>Shape and Size-Dependent Surface Plasmonic Resonances of Liquid Metal Alloy (EGaIn) Nanoparticles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22022v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Liquid metals (LM) are emerging plasmonic nanomaterials with transformable surface plasmon resonances (SPR) due to their liquid-like deformability. This study delves into the plasmonic properties of LM nanoparticles, with a focus on EGaIn (eutectic gallium-indium)-based materials. Leveraging Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) simulations and experimental validations for spherical liquid metal nanoparticles plasmonic properties, we explored the localized SPR (LSPR) effects of EGaIn nanoparticles with various shapes, including nanospheres, dimers, nanorods, nanodisks, nanoellipses, nanocubes, and nanocuboids, in the broad range of ultraviolet (UV)-visible-near infrared (NIR) spectrum. While EGaIn is conventionally known as a UV-active metal alloy, this study reveals unique LSPR features of EGaIn (e.g., higher order resonances, polar and quadrupolar modes) in the broader visible and NIR wavelength ranges, providing a comprehensive map of LSPR properties for different shapes of EGaIn nanoparticles. These findings offer new insights into the dependence of the optical properties of EGaIn nanoparticles on their geometries for diverse applications, ranging from biosensing, nanoelectronics, to optomechanical systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09360v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By decoupling the geometric from the dynamical contributions in the scattering dynamics, we develop a method to compute the scattering matrix of electrons in a one-dimensional coherent conductor connected to two electrodes. In particular, we demonstrate that, in the high-energy regime, the transmission matrix converges to the Berry operator of the system. We showcase the method through several examples featuring different in-plane magnetic field profiles. Notably, our results reveal the possibility of achieving near-perfect spin-flip transmission, highlighting potential applications in spintronics.</description>

      <title>Interaction of dopants with the I$_3$-type basal stacking fault in hexagonal-diamond Si</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15531v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently synthesized hexagonal-diamond silicon, germanium, and silicon-germanium nanowires exhibit remarkable optical and electronic properties when compared to cubic-diamond polytypes. Because of the metastability of the hexagonal-diamond phase, I$_3$-type basal stacking faults are frequently observed in these materials. Understanding and modulating the interaction between these extended defects and dopants are essential for advancing the design and performance of these novel semiconductors. In the present study, we employ density functional theory calculations to investigate the interaction of extrinsic dopants (group III, IV, and V elements) with the I$_3$-type basal stacking fault in hexagonal-diamond silicon. Contrary to the behavior observed in cubic-diamond silicon with intrinsic stacking faults, we demonstrate that neutral and negatively charged $p$-type impurities exhibit a marked tendency to occupy lattice sites far from the I$_3$-type basal stacking fault. The interaction of acceptors with the planar defect reduces their energetic stability. However, this effect is much less pronounced for neutral or positively charged $n$-type dopants and isovalent impurities. The thermodynamic energy barrier to segregation for these dopants is small and may even become negative, indicating a tendency to segregate into the fault. Through a detailed analysis of structural modifications, ionization effects, and impurity-level charge density distribution, we show that the origin of this behavior can be attributed to variations in the impurity's steric effects and its wave function character. Finally, all these results are validated by considering the extreme case of an abrupt hexagonal/cubic silicon interface, where acceptor segregation from the cubic to the hexagonal region is demonstrated, confirming the behavior observed for $p$-type dopants near the I$_3$-type defect.</description>

      <title>Active Quantum Reservoir Engineering: Using a Qubit to Manipulate its Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16898v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum reservoir engineering leverages dissipative processes to achieve desired behavior, with applications ranging from entanglement generation to quantum error correction. Therein, a structured environment acts as an entropy sink for the system and no time-dependent control over the system is required. We develop a theoretical framework for active reservoir engineering, where time-dependent control over a quantum system is used to manipulate its environment. In this case, the system may act as an entropy sink for the environment. Our framwork captures the dynamical interplay between system and environment, and provides an intuitive picture of how finite-size effects and system-environment correlations allow for manipulating the environment by repeated initialization of the quantum system. We illustrate our results with two examples: a superconducting qubit coupled to an environment of two-level systems and a semiconducting quantum dot coupled to nuclear spins. In both scenarios, we find qualitative agreement with previous experimental results, illustrating how active control can unlock new functionalities in open quantum systems.</description>
