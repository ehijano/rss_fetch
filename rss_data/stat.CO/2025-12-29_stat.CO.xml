      <title>Quantum Nondecimated Wavelet Transform: Theory, Circuits, and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nondecimated or translation-invariant wavelet transform (NDWT) is a central tool in classical multiscale signal analysis, valued for its stability, redundancy, and shift invariance. This paper develops two complementary quantum formulations of the NDWT that embed these classical properties coherently into quantum computation. The first formulation is based on the epsilon-decimated interpretation of the NDWT and realizes all circularly shifted wavelet transforms simultaneously by promoting the shift index to a quantum register and applying controlled circular shifts followed by a wavelet analysis unitary. The resulting construction yields an explicit, fully unitary quantum representation of redundant wavelet coefficients and supports coherent postprocessing, including quantum shrinkage via ancilla-driven completely positive trace preserving maps. The second formulation is based on the Hadamard test and uses diagonal phase operators to probe scale-shift wavelet structure through interference, providing direct access to shift-invariant energy scalograms and multiscale spectra without explicit coefficient reconstruction. Together, these two approaches demonstrate that redundancy and translation invariance can be exploited rather than avoided in the quantum setting. Applications to denoising, feature extraction, and spectral scaling illustrate how quantum NDWTs provide a flexible and physically meaningful foundation for multiscale quantum signal processing.</description>

      <title>Inference in the $p_0$ model for directed networks under local differential privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the edge-flipping mechanism, a type of input perturbation, to release the directed graph under edge-local differential privacy. By using the noisy bi-degree sequence from the output graph, we construct the moment equations to estimate the unknown parameters in the $p_0$ model, which is an exponential family distribution with the bi-degree sequence as the natural sufficient statistic. We show that the resulting private estimator is asymptotically consistent and normally distributed under some conditions. In addition, we compare the performance of input and output perturbation mechanisms for releasing bi-degree sequences in terms of parameter estimation accuracy and privacy protection. Numerical studies demonstrate our theoretical findings and compare the performance of the private estimates obtained by different types of perturbation methods. We apply the proposed method to analyze the UC Irvine message network.</description>

      <title>Phylogenetics in a warm place: computational aspects of the Tropical Grassmannian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phylogenetic trees provide a fundamental representation of evolutionary relationships, yet the combinatorial explosion of possible tree topologies renders inference computationally challenging. Classical approaches to characterizing tree space, such as the Billera-Holmes-Vogtmann (BHV) space, offer elegant geometric structure but suffer from statistical and computational limitations. An alternative perspective arises from tropical geometry, the tropical Grassmannian tropGr(2,n), introduced by Speyer and Sturmfels, which coincides with phylogenetic tree space. In this paper, we review the structure of the tropical Grassmannian and present algorithmic methods for its computational study, including procedures for sampling from the tropical Grassmannian. Our aim is to make these concepts accessible to evolutionary biologists and computational scientists, and to motivate new research directions at the interface of algebraic geometry and phylogenetic inference.</description>

      <title>Exact inference via quasi-conjugacy in two-parameter Poisson-Dirichlet hidden Markov models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a nonparametric model for time-evolving, unobserved probability distributions from discrete-time data consisting of unlabelled partitions. The latent process is a two-parameter Poisson-Dirichlet diffusion, and observations arise via exchangeable sampling. Applications include social and genetic data where only aggregate clustering summaries are observed. To address the intractable likelihood, we develop a tractable inferential framework that avoids label enumeration and direct simulation of the latent state. We exploit a duality between the diffusion and a pure-death process on partitions, together with coagulation operators that encode the effect of new data. These yield closed-form, recursive updates for forward and backward inference. We compute exact posterior distributions of the latent state at arbitrary times and predictive distributions of future or interpolated partitions. This enables online and offline inference and forecasting with full uncertainty quantification, bypassing MCMC and sequential Monte Carlo. Compared to particle filtering, our method achieves higher accuracy, lower variance, and substantial computational gains. We illustrate the methodology with synthetic experiments and a social network application, recovering interpretable patterns in time-varying heterozygosity.</description>

      <title>Index-Tracking Portfolio Construction and Rebalancing under Bayesian Sparse Modelling and Uncertainty Quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the construction and rebalancing of sparse index-tracking portfolios from an operational research perspective, with explicit emphasis on uncertainty quantification and implementability. The decision variables are portfolio weights constrained to sum to one; the aims are to track a reference index closely while controlling the number of names and the turnover induced by rebalancing. We cast index tracking as a high-dimensional linear regression of index returns on constituent returns, and employ a sparsity-inducing Laplace prior on the weights. A single global shrinkage parameter controls the trade-off between tracking error and sparsity, and is calibrated by an empirical-Bayes stochastic approximation scheme. Conditional on this calibration, we approximate the posterior distribution of the portfolio weights using proximal Langevin-type Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms tailored to the budget constraint. This yields posterior uncertainty on tracking error, portfolio composition and prospective rebalancing moves. Building on these posterior samples, we propose rules for rebalancing that gate trades through magnitude-based thresholds and posterior activation probabilities, thereby trading off expected tracking error against turnover and portfolio size. A case study on tracking the S&amp;P~500 index is carried out to showcase how our tools shape the decision process from portfolio construction to rebalancing.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Inference for Spatial-Temporal Non-Gaussian Data Using Predictive Stacking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04655v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Analysing non-Gaussian spatial-temporal data requires introducing spatial as well as temporal dependence in generalised linear models through the link function of an exponential family distribution. Unlike in Gaussian likelihoods, inference is considerably encumbered by the inability to analytically integrate out the random effects and reduce the dimension of the parameter space. Iterative estimation algorithms struggle to converge due to the presence of weakly identified parameters. We devise Bayesian inference using predictive stacking that assimilates inference from analytically tractable conditional posterior distributions. We achieve this by expanding upon the Diaconis-Ylvisaker family of conjugate priors and exploiting generalised conjugate multivariate (GCM) distribution theory for exponential families, which enables exact sampling from analytically available posterior distributions conditional upon some process parameters. Subsequently, we assimilate inference over a range of values of these parameters using Bayesian predictive stacking. We evaluate inferential performance on simulated data, compare with full Bayesian inference using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and apply our method to analyse spatially-temporally referenced avian count data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey database.</description>

      <title>Branching Fixed Effects: A Proposal for Communicating Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08101v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Economists often rely on estimates of linear fixed effects models produced by other teams of researchers. Assessing the uncertainty in these estimates can be challenging. I propose a form of sample splitting for networks that partitions the data into statistically independent branches, each of which can be used to compute an unbiased estimate of the parameters of interest in two-way fixed effects models. These branches facilitate uncertainty quantification, moment estimation, and shrinkage. Drawing on results from the graph theory literature on tree packing, I develop algorithms to efficiently extract branches from large networks. I illustrate these techniques using a benchmark dataset from Veneto, Italy that has been widely used to study firm wage effects.</description>
