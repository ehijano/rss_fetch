      <title>Double Poisson brackets on low dimensional algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we describe double Poisson brackets in the sense of M. Van den Bergh on certain finite-dimensional algebras. In particular we prove that all possible double Poisson brackets on matrix algebras are "inner", i.e. given by some commutators in bimodules. As a corollary of this result, we see that all possible double Poisson brackets in any finite-dimensional semisimple algebras over algebraically closed fields are also given by inner derivations. We further give a description of all double Poisson brackets on the algebra of 2x2 upper triangular matrices. We further discuss Poisson structures induced from the double Poisson brackets in its representation spaces of rank two and three. In the appendix, we describe modified double Poisson brackets (in the sense of S. Arthamonov) on this algebra.</description>

      <title>A Real-Space Formulation of the Zak Phase via Weyl m-Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a new, real-space formula for the Zak phase for one dimensional periodic Jacobi operators in terms of the Weyl $m_+$-function that does not rely on Floquet-Bloch theory. This novel representation highlights the dependence of the Zak phase on boundary terms. Moreover, we show how to recover the classical quantisation of the Zak phase for periodic Jacobi operators with inversion symmetric fundamental cells.</description>

      <title>Quadratic-Phase Fourier--Bessel Transform: definitions, properties and uncertainty principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we introduce the quadratic--phase Fourier--Bessel transform and develop its foundational properties, including continuity, the Riemann--Lebesgue lemma, reversibility, and Parseval's identity. We define the associated translation operator and convolution product, establishing their main properties within this framework. As an application, we prove a Donoho-Stark-type uncertainty principle for the quadratic-phase Fourier--Bessel transform, extending classical uncertainty results to this generalized setting.</description>

      <title>An alternative approach to the Painlev\'e paradox through constitutive characterization of constraints in impulsive Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We frame the Painlev\`e mechanical system, which has been extensively studied because of the paradox it generates, within the class of Regular Geometric Impulsive Mechanical Systems (RGIMS), by modeling it as a mechanical system subject to a rough unilateral positional constraint $\cal{S}$, where friction is represented by an instantaneous kinetic constraint $\cal{B}$, internal to $\cal{S}$ and of impulsive nature. The evolution of the system is therefore determined by the choice of a constitutive characterization for these constraints, a choice that restores mechanical determinism and eliminates any paradoxical aspects of the system's behavior, in agreement with experimental evidence. It is shown that, similarly to what occurs in general non ideal impulsive systems, the choice of a constitutive characterization of the constraint system depends on the determination of two numerical coefficients $\sigma$ and $\beta$, which depend on the kinematic and mass-related data of the system, and possibly also on physical quantities not strictly of a mechanical nature, such as material properties. The simplicity of the model also allows for a straightforward experimental analysis of the system's behavior and for the experimental determination of the values of these coefficients.</description>

      <title>Majorization between symplectic spectra of positive semidefinite matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given $2n \times 2n$ real symmetric positive semidefinite matrix $A$ with symplectic kernel, there exists a real $2n \times 2n$ \emph{symplectic matrix} $M$ such that $M^TAM= D \oplus D$, where $D$ is an $n \times n$ non-negative diagonal matrix which is unique up to permutation of its diagonal entries.
  The diagonal entries of $D$ are called the \emph{symplectic eigenvalues} or symplectic spectrum of $A$.
  In this work, we investigate some majorization and weak supermajorization relations between the symplectic spectra of two positive semidefinite matrices.
  More explicitly, suppose $A$ and $B$ are $2n \times 2n$ real symmetric positive semidefinite matrices with symplectic kernels.
  We show that if the symplectic spectrum of $A$ is majorized by the symplectic spectrum of $B$, then $A$ lies in the convex hull of the symplectic orbit of $B$.
  We also establish that only a weak converse of this statement holds; i.e., if $A$ lies in the convex hull of the symplectic orbit of $B$ then the symplectic spectrum of $A$ is \emph{weakly supermajorized} by the symplectic spectrum of $B$.
  Several consequences of our results are also presented.
  Our methods make use of well-known connections between the theory of majorization, doubly stochastic, doubly superstochastic, and symplectic matrices.</description>

      <title>Paraxial diffusion-field retrieval. II. Fokker-Planck generalization of the transport-of-intensity equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transport-of-intensity equation (TIE) has been very widely employed for phase retrieval. In particular, the TIE is an elliptic second-order partial differential equation which may be solved for the phase of a coherent paraxial field such as a monochromatic scalar optical beam, given the intensity and longitudinal intensity derivative in a plane perpendicular to the optical axis. We show how the coherent flow associated with the TIE may be augmented by a diffusive flow associated with a scalar or tensor diffusion field. Such diffusive flow can arise via scattering from unresolved spatially random microstructure within an illuminated sample, the blurring effects of an extended chaotic source that illuminates the sample, the resolution-reducing effect of shot noise in detected intensity images of the sample, and the sharpening effect (negative diffusion) associated with scattering from sharp sample edges. Augmenting the TIE's modeling of coherent flow with a diffuse-flow channel leads to a Fokker-Planck extension to this equation. Two different TIE augmentations are obtained, using three different derivations. The inverse problems of phase retrieval and diffusion-field retrieval are then studied, for both defocus-based imaging and mask-based imaging (structured-illumination imaging). When symmetric overfocus and underfocus images are employed for the purposes of phase retrieval, the diffusive term drops out and our Fokker-Planck formalism implies that any ensuing TIE-based phase-retrieval method needs no modification in light of our formalism. However, the same focal-series dataset -- which is typically an infocus image, a weakly overfocused image, and a weakly underfocused image -- may also be employed to access the additional channel of information associated with the Fokker-Planck diffusion field. Our formalism is applicable to visible light, x-rays, electrons, and neutrons.</description>

      <title>The role of angular momentum in general relativity: heuristic and covariant interpretations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the role of angular momentum in general relativity from both heuristic and fully covariant perspectives, with the aim of clarifying conceptual ambiguities that arise when Newtonian intuition is extrapolated into the relativistic regime. Focusing on free--fall dynamics in the Schwarzschild and Kerr spacetimes in the test--particle limit, we employ an effective--potential heuristic approach to isolate the roles of the specific energy $E$, specific angular momentum $L$, and black--hole spin $a$. Within this framework, we identify well--defined regions of parameter space in which the Kerr spacetime leads to stronger or weaker local radial infall than the Schwarzschild case at the same radius. By analysing the kinematics of infalling geodesic congruences, we show how these local regimes combine along complete trajectories to either enhance or reduce gravitational focusing. We then interpret these results within a covariant 1+3 description of general relativity, in terms of the expansion, shear and Raychaudhuri evolution of timelike congruences. We demonstrate that black--hole rotation systematically modifies the shear of infalling irrotational flows, even when the magnitude of the local expansion is reduced, and that this shear modulation governs the overall rate of focusing. Our work complements previous studies of relativistic infall by providing a unified energetic and geometric interpretation of how angular momentum and rotation can strengthen or weaken gravitational collapse relative to the non--rotating case.</description>

      <title>Helmholtz transmission problem and intrinsic impedance scattering problem on extension domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a transmission problem for the Helmholtz equation across the boundary of an extension domain. A such boundary can be Lipschitz, fractal, or of varying Hausdorff dimension for instance. We generalise the notions of layer potential and Neumann-Poincar{\'e} operators, and of Calder{\'o}n projectors in that context. Those boundary operators allow to connect the transmission problem (on the whole space) to one-sided problems -- notably, scattering problems -- with Dirichlet, Neumann and Robin boundary conditions. Since an extension domain needs no specific boundary measure, the Robin (impedance) condition is not understood in a boundary L^2-type space, rather by duality on the trace space itself. We discuss the well-posedness of the impedance scattering problem in that framework and compare to the classical L^2 setting. Our analysis allows to generalise optimisation results for acoustic scattering when the obstacle is an extension domain in any dimension.</description>

      <title>Bispectral rational functions and Leonard trios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well-known that Leonard pairs have a close connection with bispectral orthogonal polynomials of the Askey scheme. In this paper, we introduce the notion of a Leonard trio $(V,\oV,Z)$, an algebraic structure extending Leonard pairs, for which the overlap coefficients of eigenfunctions of $V$ and $\oV$ are biorthogonal rational functions satisfying generalized eigenvalue problems. We introduce and start the classification of irreducible Leonard trios by using its connection with Leonard pairs and Heun operators. In particular, we show that Wilson's rational functions appear as overlap coefficients, prove its difference, recurrence and biorthogonality relations, and obtain a summation formula expressing them as a finite sum of products of two $q$-Racah polynomials. We also begin to investigate reduced Leonard trios, for which the general eigenvalue problem simplifies to a $R_I$-type recurrence relation. As an illustration, we present an example of this in which the rational functions appearing as overlap coefficients can be expressed as a ${}_{4}\phi_3$ and are associated with a Leonard pair of dual $q$-Hahn type.</description>

      <title>Finite de Finetti for convex bodies and Polynomial Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Leveraging a recently proposed notion of relative entropy in general probabilistic theories (GPT), we prove a finite de Finetti representation theorem for general convex bodies. We apply this result to address a fundamental question in polynomial optimization: the existence of a convergent outer hierarchy for problems with inequality constraints and analytical convergence guarantees. Our strategy generalizes a quantitative monogamy-of-entanglement argument from quantum theory to arbitrary convex bodies, establishing a uniform upper bound on mutual information in multipartite extensions. This leads to a finite de Finetti theorem and, subsequently, a convergent conic hierarchy for a wide class of polynomial optimization problems subject to both equality and inequality constraints. We further provide a constructive rounding scheme that yields certified interior points with controlled approximation error. As an application, we express the optimal GPT value of a two-player non-local game as a polynomial optimization problem, allowing our techniques to produce approximation schemes with finite convergence guarantees.</description>

      <title>Enhanced posterior sampling via diffusion models for efficient metasurfaces inverse design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The inverse design of metasurfaces faces inherent challenges due to the nonlinear and highly complex relationship between geometric configurations and their electromagnetic behavior. Traditional optimization approaches often suffer from excessive computational demands and a tendency to converge to suboptimal solutions. This study presents a diffusion-based generative framework that incorporates a dedicated consistency constraint and advanced posterior sampling methods to ensure adherence to desired electromagnetic specifications. Through rigorous validation on small-scale metasurface configurations, the proposed approach demonstrates marked enhancements in both accuracy and reliability of the generated designs.Furthermore, we introduce a scalable methodology that extends inverse design capabilities to large-scale metasurfaces, validated for configurations of up to $98 \times 98$ nanopillars. Notably, this approach enables rapid design generation completed in minute by leveraging models trained on substantially smaller arrays ($23 \times 23$). These innovations establish a robust and efficient framework for high-precision metasurface inverse design.</description>

      <title>Exact general solutions for cosmological scalar field evolution in a vacuum-energy dominated expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive exact general solutions (as opposed to attractor particular solutions) for the evolution of a scalar field $\phi$ in a universe dominated by a background fluid with equation of state parameter $w_B = -1$, extending earlier work on exact solutions with $w_B &gt; -1$. Straightfoward exact solutions exist when the evolution is described by a linear differential equation, corresponding to constant, linear, and quadratic potentials. In the nonlinear case, exact solutions are derived for $V = V_0\ln \phi$, $V = V_0 \phi^{1/2}$ and $V = V_0/\phi$, and the logarithmic potential also yields an exact first integral. These complicated parametric solutions are considerably less useful than those derived previously for a universe dominated by a barotropic fluid such as matter or radiation with $w_B &gt; -1$. However, we generalize the slow-roll approximation and show that it applies to all sufficiently flat potentials in the case of a vacuum-dominated expansion, while it never applies when the universe is dominated by a background fluid with $w_B &gt; -1$.</description>

Abstract: We prove the existence of non-hydrodynamic solutions to the linear density-dependent BGK equation in $d$ dimensions. Specifically, we show the existence of an initial condition for any Knudsen number $\tau$ for which the dissipation rate of the macroscopic mass density diverges $\sim 1/\tau$. Our results rely on a detailed spectral analysis of the linear BGK operator, an explicit solution formula for the time-dependent problem using a combination of Fourier series with the Laplace transform and subsequent contour integration arguments from complex analysis.</description>

      <title>Uniform-in-temperature locality estimates for weakly interacting quantum systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15907v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The locality of thermal quantum states has emerged as a key input for applications to thermalization, response theory, and efficient simulability. Locality is either captured by the decay of correlations or by local indistinguishability, which allows to approximate local expectation values by those of local thermal states. Most techniques for deriving locality bounds deteriorate at small temperature, a physically highly relevant regime and so it is of interest to identify conditions for uniform-in-temperature bounds. Here we prove that a class of weakly interacting quantum Hamiltonians satisfies exponential decay of correlations and local indistinguishability uniformly in the temperature. The proof uses a low-temperature cluster expansion and a quantum version of a probabilistic swapping trick developed by the first author and Cao (Ann. Probab. 53, 2025) in the context of lattice gauge theories.</description>

Abstract: Let $\Delta+V$ be the discrete Schr\"odinger operator, where $\Delta$ is the discrete Laplacian on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ and potential $V:\mathbb{Z}^d\to \mathbb{C}$ is $\Gamma$-periodic with $\Gamma=q_1\mathbb{Z}\oplus q_2 \mathbb{Z}\oplus\cdots\oplus q_d\mathbb{Z}$. In this study, we establish a comprehensive characterization of complex-valued $\Gamma$-periodic functions such that the Bloch variety of $\Delta+V$ contains a graph of an entire function, in particular, we show that there are exactly $q_1q_2\cdots q_d$ such functions (up to Floquet isospectrality and translation). Moreover, by applying this understanding to real-valued functions $V$, we prove that $V$ is constant if and only if the Bloch variety of $\Delta+V$ contains a graph of an entire function, which confirms the conjecture concerning the geometric version of Borg's theorem in arbitrary dimensions.</description>

      <title>Quantization of causal diamonds in (2+1)-dimensional gravity -- Part I: Classical reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.11741v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop the non-perturbative reduced phase space quantization of causal diamonds in (2+1)-dimensional gravity with a nonpositive cosmological constant. In this Part I we focus on the classical reduction process, and the description of the reduced phase space, while in Part II we discuss the quantization of the phase space and quantum aspects of the causal diamonds. The system is defined as the domain of dependence of a spacelike topological disk with fixed boundary metric. By solving the constraints in a constant-mean-curvature time gauge and removing all the spatial gauge redundancy, we find that the phase space is the cotangent bundle of Diff^+(S^1)/PSL(2,R), i.e., the group of orientation-preserving diffeomorphisms of the circle modulo the projective special linear subgroup. Classically, the states correspond to causal diamonds embedded in AdS_3 (or Mink_3 if $\Lambda = 0$), with fixed corner length, and whose Cauchy surfaces have the topology of a disc.</description>

      <title>On orthogonal decompositions of hermitian Higgs bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19062v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A hermitian Higgs bundle is a triple $({\mathfrak E},h) = (E,\Phi, h)$, where ${\mathfrak E}=(E,\Phi)$ is a Higgs bundle and $(E,h)$ is a holomorphic hermitian vector bundle. It is well-known that several results on holomorphic vector bundles extend to the Higgs bundles setting, although this is not always the case. In this article we show that some classical propositions, involving orthogonal decompositions of holomorphic hermitian vector bundles and the second fundamental form of its holomorphic subbundles, can be extended to hermitian Higgs bundles. The extended propositions concerning orthogonal decompositions have immediate applications in Higgs bundles, and we mention some of these throughout the article. Moreover, the extended propositions concerning the second fundamental form are generalizations of previously known results on Higgs bundles. In particular, here we include alternative proofs of these extended propositions without using local computations. Finally, as an application of the above results and due to the lack of a certain parallelism condition, we show that a classical theorem concerning the Kobayashi functional for holomorphic vector bundles does not admit a straightforward extension to Higgs bundles.</description>

      <title>Equivalence of Sobolev norms for Kolmogorov operators with scaling-critical drift</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00191v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the ordinary or fractional Laplacian plus a homogeneous, scaling-critical drift term. This operator is non-symmetric but homogeneous, and generates scales of $L^p$-Sobolev spaces which we compare with the ordinary homogeneous Sobolev spaces. Unlike in previous studies concerning Hardy operators, i.e., ordinary or fractional Laplacians plus scaling-critical scalar perturbations, handling the drift term requires an additional, possibly technical, restriction on the range of comparable Sobolev spaces, which is related to the unavailability of gradient bounds for the associated semigroup.</description>

      <title>Exactly solvable models for fermionic symmetry-enriched topological phases and fermionic 't Hooft anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19126v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interplay between symmetry and topological properties plays a very important role in modern physics. In the past decade, the concept of symmetry-enriched topological (SET) phases was proposed and their classifications have been systematically studied for bosonic systems. Very recently, the concept of SET phases has been generalized into fermionic systems and their corresponding classification schemes are also proposed. Nevertheless, how to realize all these fermionic SET (fSET) phases in lattice models remains to be a difficult open problem. In this paper, we first construct exactly solvable models for non-anomalous non-chiral 2+1D fSET phases, namely, the symmetry-enriched fermionic string-net models, which are described by commuting-projector Hamiltonians whose ground states are the fixed-point wavefunctions of each fSET phase. Mathematically, we provide a partial definition to $G$-graded super fusion category, which is the input data of a symmetry-enriched fermionic string-net model. Next, we construct exactly solvable models for non-chiral 2+1D fSET phases with 't Hooft anomaly, especially the $H^3(G,\mathbb{Z}_2)$ fermionic 't Hooft anomaly which is different from the well known bosonic $H^4(G,U(1)_T)$ anomaly. In our construction, this $H^3(G,\mathbb{Z}_2)$ fermionic 't Hooft anomaly is characterized by a violation of fermion-parity conservation in some of the surface ${F}$-moves (a kind of renormalization moves for the ground state wavefunctions of surface SET phases), and also by a new fermionic obstruction $\Theta$ in the surface pentagon equation. We demonstrate this construction in a concrete example that the surface topological order is a $\mathbb{Z}_4$ gauge theory embedded into a fermion system and the total symmetry $G^f=\mathbb{Z}_2^f\times\mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_4$.</description>

      <title>Optimal decay of eigenvector overlap for non-Hermitian random matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16572v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the standard overlap $\mathcal{O}_{ij}: =\langle \mathbf{r}_j, \mathbf{r}_i\rangle\langle \mathbf{l}_j, \mathbf{l}_i\rangle$ of any bi-orthogonal family of left and right eigenvectors of a large random matrix $X$ with centred i.i.d. entries and we prove that it decays as an inverse second power of the distance between the corresponding eigenvalues. This extends similar results for the complex Gaussian ensemble from Bourgade and Dubach [arXiv:1801.01219], as well as Benaych-Georges and Zeitouni [arXiv:1806.06806], to any i.i.d. matrix ensemble in both symmetry classes. As a main tool, we prove a two-resolvent local law for the Hermitisation of $X$ uniformly in the spectrum with optimal decay rate and optimal dependence on the density near the spectral edge.</description>

      <title>On photonic band gaps in two-dimensional photonic crystal fibres. Analysis in the vicinity of the low-dielectric light line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10536v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider `off-axis' electromagnetic wave propagation down the homogeneous direction of a low-loss two-dimensional periodic dielectric (or photonic crystal fibre) near the light line of the low-dielectric material constituent. Numerous physical and numerical experiments demonstrate the presence of photonic band gaps in the vicinity of this `critical' light line. We mathematically analyse the existence of photonic band gaps near the line and characterise them in terms of frequency gaps in the spectrum of the Maxwell equations restricted to the line. We apply the results to both one-dimensional photonic crystal fibres, and a genuinely two-dimensional photonic crystal fibres with `thin' inclusions, namely ``ARROW'' fibres. In the case of ARROW fibres, by an asymptotic analysis, in terms of the small inclusion parameter, we demonstrate the existence of low frequency photonic band gaps. It is important to note that our analysis does not assume any specific ratio between the dielectric contrasts; as a result, moderate or even low contrast models are fully encompassed. Similarly, no limiting assumptions are imposed on the wave propagation constant along the fibre.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04010v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A method for solving an inverse spectral problem for the one-dimensional Dirac equation is developed. The method is based on the Gelfand-Levitan equation and the Fourier-Legendre series expansion of the transmutation kernel. A linear algebraic system of equations is obtained, which can be solved numerically. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first practical method for the solution of the inverse problem for the one-dimensional Dirac equation on a finite interval.</description>

      <title>Explicit construction of states in orbifolds of products of $N=2$ Superconformal ADE Minimal models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21992v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We generalize the explicit construction of fields in orbifolds of products of $N=(2,2)$ minimal models, developed by A. Belavin, V. Belavin and S. Parkhomenko to include minimal models with D and E-type modular invariants. It is shown that spectral flow twisting by the elements of admissible group $G_{\text{adm}}$, which is used in the construction of the orbifold, is consistent with the nondiagonal pairing of D and E-type minimal models. We obtain the complete set of fields of the orbifold from the mutual locality and other requirements of the conformal bootstrap. The collection of mutually local primary fields is labeled by the elements of dual group $G^{*}_{\text{adm}}$. The permutation of $G_{\text{adm}}$ and $G^*_{\text{adm}}$ is given by the mirror spectral flow construction of the fields and maps the space of states of the original $G_{\text{adm}}$ orbifold onto the space of states of $G^*_{\text{adm}}$ orbifold. We show that this transformation is by construction a mirror isomorphism of spaces of states. Thus, mirror isomorphism of states is built into the construction. We illustrate our approach for the orbifolds of $\textbf{A}_{2}\textbf{E}_7^{3}$ model.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear projection-based model order reduction with machine learning regression for closure error modeling in the latent space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00634v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A significant advancement in nonlinear projection-based model order reduction (PMOR) is presented through a highly effective methodology. This methodology employs Gaussian process regression (GPR) and radial basis function (RBF) interpolation for closure error modeling in the latent space, offering notable gains in efficiency and expanding the scope of PMOR. Moving beyond the limitations of deep artificial neural networks (ANNs), previously used for this task, this approach provides crucial advantages in terms of interpretability and a reduced demand for extensive training data. The capabilities of GPR and RBFs are showcased in two demanding applications: a two-dimensional parametric inviscid Burgers problem, featuring propagating shocks across the entire computational domain, and a complex three-dimensional turbulent flow simulation around an Ahmed body. The results demonstrate that this innovative approach preserves accuracy and achieves substantial improvements in efficiency and interpretability when contrasted with traditional PMOR and ANN-based closure modeling.</description>

      <title>SO(n) Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki states as conformal boundary states of integrable SU(n) spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13114v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a class of conformal boundary states in the $\mathrm{SU}(n)_1$ Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) conformal field theory (CFT) using the symmetry embedding $\mathrm{Spin}(n)_2 \subset \mathrm{SU}(n)_1$. These boundary states are beyond the standard Cardy construction and possess $\mathrm{SO}(n)$ symmetry. The $\mathrm{SU}(n)$ Uimin-Lai-Sutherland (ULS) spin chains, which realize the $\mathrm{SU}(n)_1$ WZW model on the lattice, allow us to identify these boundary states as the ground states of the $\mathrm{SO}(n)$ Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki spin chains. Using the integrability of the $\mathrm{SU}(n)$ ULS model, we analytically compute the corresponding Affleck-Ludwig boundary entropy using exact overlap formulas. Our results unveil intriguing connections between exotic boundary states in CFT and integrable lattice models, thus providing deep insights into the interplay of symmetry, integrability, and boundary critical phenomena.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19902v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that every fusion category containing a non-invertible, self-dual object $a$ gives rise to an integrable anyonic chain whose Hamiltonian density satisfies the Temperley-Lieb algebra. This spin chain arises by considering the projection onto the identity channel in the fusion process $a\otimes a$. We relate these models to Pasquier's construction of ADE lattice models. We then exploit the underlying Temperley-Lieb structure to discuss the spectrum of these models and argue that these models are gapped when the quantum dimension of $a$ is greater than 2. We show that for fusion categories where the dimension is close to 2, such as the Fib$\times$Fib and Haagerup fusion categories, the finite size effects are large and they can obscure the numerical analysis of the gap.</description>

      <title>Conundrum of regular black holes with nonlinear electromagnetic fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23711v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The search for regular black holes with nonlinear electromagnetic fields has sprouted numerous candidates, each exhibiting certain virtues but often accompanied by significant drawbacks. We demonstrate that Komar mass, electric charge and magnetic charge are mutually dependent in regular black holes with nonlinear electromagnetic fields, defined by a Lagrangian which is a function of both electromagnetic invariants, $F_{ab} F^{ab}$ and $F_{ab}{\star F}^{ab}$, regardless of the specific weak field limit of the theory. Also, we generalize one of the key no-go theorems by showing that static, spherically symmetric, electrically charged black holes in a theory respecting the relaxed Maxwellian weak field limit do not admit a bounded Kretschmann scalar. Finally, we address one of the long-standing niche questions, whether regular black hole solutions can exist when both electric and magnetic charges are present, by constructing an exotic family of regular dyonic black holes with nonlinear electromagnetic fields in theories respecting the Maxwellian weak field limit. Mounting evidence suggests that regularizing black holes through simplistic nonlinear extensions of Maxwell's electromagnetism entails a high cost in the form of unorthodox theoretical assumptions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24692v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define two new indecomposable (not fully reducible) ${\cal N}=8$, $d=1$ off-shell multiplets and consider the corresponding models of ${\cal N}=8$ supersymmetric mechanics with spin variables. Each multiplet is described off shell by a scalar superfield which is a nonlinear deformation of the standard scalar superfield $X$ carrying the $d=1$ multiplet ${\bf (1,8,7)}$. Deformed systems involve, as invariant subsets, two different off-shell versions of the irreducible multiplet ${\bf (8,8,0)}$. For both systems we present the manifestly ${\cal N}=8$ supersymmetric superfield constraints, as well as the component off- and on-shell invariant actions, which for one version exactly match those given in arXiv:2402.00539 [hep-th]. The two models differ off shell, but prove to be equivalent to each other on shell, with the spin variables sitting in the adjoint representation of the maximal $R$-symmetry group ${\rm SO}(8)$.</description>

      <title>Direct and Indirect Loop Equations in Lattice Yang-Mills Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04316v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of Wilson loops are governed by an infinite set of Schwinger-Dyson equations and trace relations. In the context of the lattice positivity bootstrap, a central challenge is determining a dynamically independent basis of these operators within a truncated space. We present a systematic framework to address this problem, utilizing a geometric plaquette-cut and subloop-cut strategy to efficiently generate all (local) direct equations. Furthermore, we identify and analyze "indirect equations", which arise from the elimination of higher-length intermediate loops. We elucidate the origin of these subtle relations and propose a vertex-filtering strategy to construct them. Applying the above framework to SU(2) lattice Yang-Mills theory, we provide explicit counts of independent canonical loops and equations in 2, 3, and 4 dimensions, along with a statistical analysis of their asymptotic growth.</description>

      <title>Global Existence for General Systems of Isentropic Gas Dynamics via a Weighted Pressure Perturbation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08157v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish the global existence of weak entropy solutions for 1D isentropic gas dynamics with general pressure laws ($\gamma &gt; 1$). To address vacuum degeneracy, we introduce a novel structural regularization via a "Synchronized Dual Translation" strategy. This approach offers a distinct advantage over the flux-modification method of Lu (2007): while Lu's method induces a structural mismatch requiring restrictive constraints on $P'''$ to control regularization artifacts, our construction preserves structural isomorphism with the standard Euler equations. Consequently, the approximate entropies satisfy a homogeneous Generalized Euler-Poisson-Darboux equation. This allows us to prove strong convergence under natural asymptotic assumptions, effectively eliminating the need for the technical higher-order derivative constraints required in prior works.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.11511v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the abelian sub-C*-algebra of the CAR algebra generated by the start and face opertors of Kitaev's toric code. We show that it is a C*-diagonal equivalent to the canonical diagonal of the CAR algebra.</description>

      <title>Weyl Mutations in Quiver Yangians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11736v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The problem of solving non-linear equations would be considerably simplified by a possibility to convert known solutions into the new ones. This could seem an element of art, but in the context of ADHM-like equations describing quiver varieties there is a systematic approach. In this note we study moduli spaces and dualities of quiver gauge theories associated to effective dynamics of D-branes compactified on Calabi-Yau resolutions. We concentrate on a subfamily of quivers $\mathfrak{Q}_{\mathfrak{g}}$ covering Dynkin diagrams for simple Lie algebras $\mathfrak{g}$, where the respective BPS algebra is expected to be the Yangian algebra $Y(\mathfrak{g})$. For Yangians labeled by quivers their representations are described by solutions of ADHM-like equations. As quivers substitute Dynkin diagrams a generalization of the Weyl group $\mathcal{W}_{\mathfrak{g}}$ acts on the ADHM solutions. Here we work with the case $\mathfrak{g}=\mathfrak{sl}_{n+1}$ and treat this group as a group of electro-magnetic Seiberg-like dualities (we call them Weyl mutations) on the respective quiver gauge theories. We lift it to the case of higher representations associated to rectangular Young diagrams. An action of Weyl mutations on the BPS Yangian algebra is also discussed.</description>
