      <title>Autopolar conic bodies and polyhedra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An antinorm is a concave analogue of a norm. In contrast to norms, antinorms are not defined on the entire space $R^d$ but on a cone $K\subset R^d$. They are applied in the matrix analysis, optimal control, and dynamical systems. Their level sets are called conic bodies and (in case of piecewise-linear antinorms) conic polyhedra. The basic facts and notions of the "concave analysis" of antinorms such as separation theorems, duality, polars, Minkowski functionals, etc., are similar to those from the standard convex analysis. There are, however, some significant differences. One of them is the existence of many self-dual objects. We prove that there are infinitely many families of autopolar conic bodies and polyhedra in the cone $K=R^d_+$. For $d=2$, this gives a complete classification of self-dual antinorms, while for $d\ge 3$, there are counterexamples.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolicity of the sub-Riemannian affine-additive group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the affine-additive group as a metric measure space with a canonical left-invariant measure and a left-invariant sub-Riemannian metric. We prove that this metric measure space is locally 4-Ahlfors regular and it is hyperbolic, meaning that it has a non-vanishing 4-capacity at infinity. This implies that the affine-additive group is not quasiconformally equivalent to the Heisenberg group or to the roto-translation group in contrast to the fact that both of these groups are globally contactomorphic to the affine-additive group. Moreover, each quasiregular map, from the Heisenberg group to the affine-additive group must be constant.</description>

      <title>Deep sections of the hypercube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a non-negative number $t$ and a hyperplane $H$ of $\mathbb{R}^d$ whose distance to the center of the hypercube $[0,1]^d$ is $t$. If $t$ is equal to $0$ and $H$ is orthogonal to a diagonal of $[0,1]^d$, it is known that the $(d-1)$-dimensional volume of $H\cap[0,1]^d$ is a strictly increasing function of $d$ when $d$ is at least $3$. The study of the monotonicity of this volume is extended for $t$ up to above $1/2$ and, when $d$ is large enough, for every non-negative $t$. In particular, a range for $t$ is identified such that this volume is a strictly decreasing function of $d$ over the positive integers. The local extremality of the $(d-1)$-dimensional volume of $H\cap[0,1]^d$ when $H$ is orthogonal to a diagonal of either $[0,1]^d$ or a lower dimensional face is also determined for the same values of $t$. It is shown for instance that when $t$ is above an explicit constant and $d$ is large enough, this volume is always strictly locally maximal when $H$ is orthogonal to a diagonal of $[0,1]^d$. A precise estimate for the convergence rate of the Eulerian numbers to their limit Gaussian behavior is provided along the way.</description>

      <title>On a generalized hexagonal dart board problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Jung's theorem says that planar sets of diameter $1$ can be covered by a closed circular disc of radius $\frac 1{\sqrt3}$. In this paper we will restrict ourselves to finite point sets and consider a fractional Jung-type problem. Let $\mathcal{P}_n$ be the family of all finite sets of $n$ points of diameter $1$. Let the function value $N_n(r)$ ($0 &lt; r \leq 1$) be the largest integer $k$ so that for every point set $P \in \mathcal{P}_n$ there is a circle of radius $r$ which covers at least $k$ points of $P$. We give many lower and upper bounds for $N_n(r)$ and determine intervals of $(0,1]$ where exact values of $N_n(r)$ can be determined. Among others we show the $n\leq N_{3n}(\frac{1}{2}) \leq n+1$ and $N_n(\frac{1}{4}) = \lceil \frac{n}{7} \rceil$ for all $n\neq 7$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ponzi schemes, defined by Block-Weinberger(1992) and Roe(2003), give a characterization of amenability from the viewpoint of coarse geometry. We consider measures in coarse spaces, and propose a reformulation of Ponzi schemes with measures.</description>

      <title>Flat sub-Lorentzian structures on Martinet distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two flat sub-Lorentzian problems on the Martinet distribution are studied. For the first one, the attainable set has a nontrivial intersection with the Martinet plane, but for the second one it does not. Attainable sets, optimal trajectories, sub-Lorentzian distances and spheres are described.</description>

      <title>Collinearity of points on Poincar\'e unit disk and Riemann sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.09037v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study certain points significant for the hyperbolic geometry of the unit disk. We give explicit formulas for the intersection points of the Euclidean lines and the stereographic projections of great circles of the Riemann sphere passing through these points. We prove several results related to collinearity of these intersection points, offer new ways to find the hyperbolic midpoint, and represent a formula for the chordal midpoint. The proofs utilize Gr\"obner bases from computer algebra for the solution of polynomial equations.</description>

      <title>Many equiprojective polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.11366v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A $3$-dimensional polytope $P$ is $k$-equiprojective when the projection of $P$ along any line that is not parallel to a facet of $P$ is a polygon with $k$ vertices. In 1968, Geoffrey Shephard asked for a description of all equiprojective polytopes. It has been shown recently that the number of combinatorial types of $k$-equiprojective polytopes is at least linear as a function of $k$. Here, it is shown that there are at least $k^{3k/2+o(k)}$ such combinatorial types as $k$ goes to infinity. This relies on the Goodman--Pollack lower bound on the number of order types and on new constructions of equiprojective polytopes via Minkowski sums.</description>

      <title>An aperiodic monotile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.10798v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A longstanding open problem asks for an aperiodic monotile, also known as an "einstein": a shape that admits tilings of the plane, but never periodic tilings. We answer this problem for topological disk tiles by exhibiting a continuum of combinatorially equivalent aperiodic polygons. We first show that a representative example, the "hat" polykite, can form clusters called "metatiles", for which substitution rules can be defined. Because the metatiles admit tilings of the plane, so too does the hat. We then prove that generic members of our continuum of polygons are aperiodic, through a new kind of geometric incommensurability argument. Separately, we give a combinatorial, computer-assisted proof that the hat must form hierarchical -- and hence aperiodic -- tilings.</description>
