      <title>Viral mutation spread controlled by inter-host network dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increase in the connectivity between hosts in recent times has facilitated the emergence of more aggressive mutant viral strains, making their containment and eradication significantly more challenging compared to the original variants. We focus on the evolution of a new more aggressive mutant strain that appears in the system and competes with a previous version. The role of host interaction network topology in the emergence and spatial diffusion of these highly contagious strains is analyzed, as well as how network-based interventions can help mitigate their spread. To address these issues, we present simplified mathematical models that qualitatively describe the occurrence, propagation, and impact of such mutations within host-interaction networks. By incorporating the topology of the host network into the analysis, a more advanced framework is proposed to curb the growth of mutant strains. Extensive numerical simulations of these models offer insights into the mechanisms driving viral evolution, the dynamics of contagion, and the topological influence of host networks on viral spread and containment strategies.</description>

      <title>Sustainable intensification of small-scale aquaculture systems depends on the local context and characteristics of producers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aquaculture has been the fastest growing food production sector globally due to its potential to improve food security, stimulate economic growth, and reduce poverty. Its rapid development has been linked to sustainability challenges, many of which are still unresolved and poorly understood. Small-scale producers account for an increasing fraction of aquacultural output. At the same time, many of these producers experience poverty, food insecurity, and rely on unimproved production practices. We develop a stylized mathematical model to explore the effects of ecological, social, and economic factors on the dynamics of a small-scale pond aquaculture system. Using analytical and numerical methods, we explore the stability, asymptotic dynamics, and bifurcations of the model. Depending on the characteristics of the system, the model exhibits one of three distinct configurations: monostability with a global poverty trap in a nutrient-dominated or fish-dominated system; bistability with poverty trap and well-being attractors; multistability with poverty trap and two well-being attractors with different characteristics. The model results show that intensification can be sustainable only if it takes into account the local social-ecological context. In addition, the heterogeneity of small-scale aquaculture producers matters, as the effects of intensification can be unevenly distributed among them. Finally, more is not always better because too high nutrient input or productivity can lead to a suboptimal attractor or system collapse.</description>

      <title>Lagrangians and Newtonian analogues for Biological Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the potential for biological systems to be governed by a variational principle, suggesting that such systems may evolve to minimize or optimize specific quantities. To explore this idea, we focus on identifying Lagrange functions that can effectively model the dynamics of selected population systems. These functions provide a deeper understanding of population evolution by framing their behavior in terms of energy-like variables. We present an algorithm for generating Lagrangian functions applicable to a family of population dynamics models and demonstrate the equivalence between two-dimensional population models and a one-dimensional Newtonian mechanical analog. Furthermore, we explore the existence of conservation laws for these models, utilizing Noether's theorems to investigate their implications.</description>

      <title>The effect of environmental factors in biofilm and phage interactions in Agent Based Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As antibiotic resistance continues to pose a significant threat to public health, alternative treatments are urgently needed. Phage therapy, which utilizes bacteriophages to specifically target bacterial pathogens, has emerged as a promising solution. Given that bacteria often exist in biofilms -complex micro-communities that complicate treatment strategies, there is a clear need for models that account for spatial dynamics. This study aims to employ mathematical and statistical methodologies to identify optimal treatment strategies involving phage-antibiotic combinations. We developed an agent-based model to analyze how environmental factors (e.g. temperature, pH, and resource availability) influence bacteria-phage interactions during therapy, focusing on both healthy and immunocompromised patients. Utilizing \textit{Escherichia coli} as a case study, we observed that bacterial cells exhibit mutations that enhance their adaptability to varying environmental conditions and treatment approaches. Our findings suggest that the effectiveness of therapies targeting pathogenic and mutated bacterial cells can be significantly improved through strategic control of application timing and dosing. Additionally, we investigated the impact of biofilm structure on the efficacy of phage therapy, underscoring its importance in developing targeted treatment strategies.</description>

      <title>2064 global population crisis scenario predicted by the most general dynamic model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19063v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is currently no consensus on how the global population will evolve in the next decades and in the next century. The reason for this uncertainty is the absence of reliable population dynamic models. In this paper, we remedy to this situation by reporting on a population dynamic model, a single nonlinear differential equation adapted from the physics of disordered systems, which is able to mathematically describe all the various regimes encountered in the global population recorded as a function of time, over the past 12000 years until now. Regimes of simple exponential growth (Malthus), logistic (Verhulst) plateaus as well as stretched-exponential and compressed-exponential growth regimes are all reliably described by this mathematical equation in its various limits. Besides showing that this is, indeed, the most general population dynamic model, we use it to explore its solutions projected into the future. In particular, two different scenarios are predicted. In one of them, which assumes that the future evolution would continue along a similar pattern as the past decades (hence without any major global ecological crisis affecting the resource exploitation), a von Foerster-type doomsday scenario with a sudden rise of the global population to unsustainable levels could appear as early as 2078. In the opposite scenario, if a global ecological crisis were to set in today, affecting the ability to exploit resources, given the current estimates of the Earth's carrying capacity, the global population is forecasted to reduce by half by 2064. Furthermore, the proposed dynamic model provides with a new aggregated parameter (K, in the model) that can be monitored and controlled so as to avoid the doomsday scenarios.</description>

      <title>Optimal COVID-19 vaccine prioritization by age depends critically on inter-group contacts and vaccination rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The limited availability of COVID-19 vaccines has prompted extensive research on optimal vaccination strategies. Previous studies have considered various non-pharmaceutical interventions, vaccine efficacy, and distribution strategies. In this work, we address the combined effects of inter-group contacts and vaccination rates under contact reduction, analyzing the Spanish population's demographic and age group contact patterns and incorporating reinfection dynamics. We conduct an exhaustive analysis, evaluating 362,880 permutations of 9 age groups across 6 vaccination rates and two distinct, empirically quantified scenarios for social contacts. Our results show that at intermediate-to-high vaccination rates with unrestricted social contacts, optimal age-based vaccination strategies only slightly deviate from older-to-younger prioritization, yielding marginal reductions in deaths and infections. However, when significant reductions in social contacts are enforced -similar to the lockdowns in 2020-, there are substantial improvements, particularly at moderate vaccination rates. These restrictions lead to a transition where infection propagation is halted, a scenario that became achievable during the pandemic with the observed vaccination rates. Our findings emphasize the importance of combining appropriate social contact reductions with vaccination to optimize age-based vaccination strategies, underscoring the complex, nonlinear dynamics involved in pandemic dynamics and the necessity for tailored, context-specific interventions.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Inference of Reproduction Number from Epidemiological and Genetic Data Using Particle MCMC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09838v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inference of the reproduction number through time is of vital importance during an epidemic outbreak. Typically, epidemiologists tackle this using observed prevalence or incidence data. However, prevalence and incidence data alone is often noisy or partial. Models can also have identifiability issues with determining whether a large amount of a small epidemic or a small amount of a large epidemic has been observed. Sequencing data however is becoming more abundant, so approaches which can incorporate genetic data are an active area of research. We propose using particle MCMC methods to infer the time-varying reproduction number from a combination of prevalence data reported at a set of discrete times and a dated phylogeny reconstructed from sequences. We validate our approach on simulated epidemics with a variety of scenarios. We then apply the method to real data sets of HIV-1 in North Carolina, USA and tuberculosis in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The models and algorithms are implemented in an open source R package called EpiSky which is available at https://github.com/alicia-gill/EpiSky.</description>
