      <title>Detection of Low-Energy Electrons with Transition-Edge Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first detection of electrons with kinetic energy in the 100 eV range with transition-edge sensors (TESs). This has been achieved with a (100 x 100) $\mu$m$^2$ Ti-Au bilayer TES, with a critical temperature of about 84 mK. The electrons are produced directly in the cryostat by a cold-cathode source based on field emission from vertically-aligned multiwall carbon nanotubes. We obtain a Gaussian energy resolution between 0.8 and 1.8 eV for fully-absorbed electrons in the (95-105) eV energy range, which is found to be compatible with the resolution of this same device for photons in the same energy range. This measurement opens new possibilities in the field of electron detection.</description>

      <title>Development of Cryogenic Scintillation Detectors for the Search of New Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CryoCsI, the proposed prototype, is a cryogenic undoped CsI scintillating detector, which has a much lower energy threshold potentially down to 0.5 keV$_{nr}$ compared to the doped CsI. This enhanced sensitivity of CryoCsI allows for the observation of more Coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering events. Precise measurements of CEvNS can not only validate the predictions of the Standard Model but also explore new physics. In conjunction with other COHERENT detectors, CryoCsI has the potential to achieve world-leading sensitivities in a broad range of physics topics within and beyond the SM. The sensitivities of CryoCsI to hidden-sector dark matter, non-standard neutrino interactions, and neutron radius are explored.
  This thesis delves into the construction of CryoCsI and efforts to enhance its light yield from 20 to $50 \pm 2$ photoelectrons per keV electron-equivalent (keV$_{ee}$). It will address challenges with cryogenic SiPMs, including inferior energy resolution, optical cross-talk, and potential limitations on detecting rare events. Understanding the light yield of scintillating detectors for nuclear recoils is crucial, as explored through alpha-particle and neutron quenching factor measurements. A QF of approximately 15\% was measured using a neutron beam at the Triangle Universities Nuclear Lab. Proposed solutions to challenges like the overshoot effect observed in PMTs will be discussed. Additionally, the thesis will explore design considerations for minimizing background noise and optimizing the CsI crystal's shape through optical simulations.</description>

      <title>Performance of large-scale 6Li-doped pulse-shape discriminating plastic scintillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A $^6$Li-doped plastic scintillator with pulse-shape discrimination capabilities, commercially identified as EJ-299-50, has been developed and produced at the kilogram-scale. A total of 44 kg-scale bars of dimensions 5.5 cm $\times$ 5.5 cm $\times$ 50 cm of this material have been characterized. Optical properties like light output and effective attenuation length have been found to be comparable to $^6$Li-doped liquid scintillators. The scintillator EJ-299-50 shows good neutron detection capabilities with an effective efficiency for capture on $^6$Li of approximately 85%. Stability tests performed on two formulation variations showed no intrinsic degradation in the material or optical properties during several months of observations.</description>

      <title>Refractive index in the JUNO liquid scintillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the field of rare event physics, it is common to have huge masses of organic liquid scintillator as detection medium. In particular, they are widely used to study neutrino properties or astrophysical neutrinos. Thanks to its safety properties (such as low toxicity and high flash point) and easy scalability, linear alkyl benzene is the most common solvent used to produce liquid scintillators for large mass experiments. The knowledge of the refractive index is a pivotal point to understand the detector response, as this quantity (and its wavelength dependence) affects the Cherenkov radiation and photon propagation in the medium. In this paper, we report the measurement of the refractive index of the JUNO liquid scintillator between 260-1064 nm performed with two different methods (an ellipsometer and a refractometer), with a sub percent level precision. In addition, we used an interferometer to measure the group velocity in the JUNO liquid scintillator and verify the expected value derived from the refractive index measurements.</description>

      <title>An Ultra-High Vacuum Scanning Tunneling Microscope with Pulse Tube and Joule-Thomson cooling operating at sub-pm z-noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a compact ultra-high vacuum (UHV) scanning tunneling microscope (STM) system that does not need any external supply of cooling liquids. It achieves temperatures down to 1.5 K and a z-noise down to 300 fmRMS for the frequency range of 0.1 Hz - 5 kHz (feedback loop off). It employs a pulse tube cryocooler (PTC) and a Joule-Thomson (JT) stage inducing only small temperature oscillations at the STM with amplitude below 1 mK. The challenge to combine an effective vibrational decoupling from the PTC with sufficient thermal conduction is tackled by a multipartite approach. We realize a minimal stiffness of the UHV bellows that connect the PTC and the STM chamber. Fine Copper wires mechanically decouple the PTC stages from cooling plates that carry the thermal shields, the JT stage and the STM. Soft springs decouple the STM from the JT stage. Finally, the STM body has an optimized conical shape and is made of the light and stiff material Shapal Hi MSoft such that a strong reduction of low frequency vibrations results for the tunnel junction. The voltage noise in the tunnel junction is 0.12 mV and an RF antenna close to the tunnel junction provides radio frequency excitations up to 40 GHz with amplitudes up to 10 mV.</description>

      <title>Development of the Low Frequency Telescope focal plane detector arrays for LiteBIRD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: LiteBIRD, a forthcoming JAXA mission, aims to accurately study the microwave sky within the 40-400 GHz frequency range divided into 15 distinct nominal bands. The primary objective is to constrain the CMB inflationary signal, specifically the primordial B-modes. LiteBIRD targets the CMB B-mode signal on large angular scales, where the primordial inflationary signal is expected to dominate, with the goal of reaching a tensor-to-scalar ratio sensitivity of $\sigma_r\sim0.001$. LiteBIRD frequency bands will be split among three telescopes, with some overlap between telescopes for better control of systematic effects. Here we report on the development status of the detector arrays for the Low Frequency Telescope (LFT), which spans the 34-161 GHz range, with 12 bands subdivided between four types of trichroic pixels consisting of lenslet-coupled sinuous antennas. The signal from the antenna is bandpass filtered and sensed by AlMn Transition-Edge Sensors (TES). We provide an update on the status of the design and development of LiteBIRD's LFT LF1 (40-60-78 GHz), LF2 (50-68-89 GHz) pixels. We discuss design choices motivated by LiteBIRD scientific goals. In particular we focus on the details of the optimization of the design parameters of the sinuous antenna, on-chip bandpass filters, cross-under and impedance transformers and all the RF components that define the LF1 and LF2 pixel detection chain. We present this work in the context of the technical challenges and physical constraints imposed by the finite size of the instrument.</description>

      <title>Autonomous programmable microscopic electronic lablets optimized with digital control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lablets are autonomous microscopic particles with programmable CMOS electronics that can control electrokinetic phenomena and electrochemical reactions in solution via actuator and sensor microelectrodes. In this paper, we describe the design and fabrication of optimized singulated lablets (CMOS3) with dimensions 140x140x50 micrometers carrying an integrated coplanar encapsulated supercapacitor as a rechargeable power supply. The lablets are designed to allow docking to one another or to a smart surface for interchange of energy, electronic information, and chemicals. The paper focusses on the digital and analog design of the lablets to allow significant programmable functionality in a microscopic footprint, including the control of autonomous actuation and sensing up to the level of being able to support a complete lablet self-reproduction life cycle, although experimentally this remains to be proven. The potential of lablets in autonomous sensing and control and for evolutionary experimentation are discussed.</description>

      <title>High-sensitivity Kinetic Inductance Detector Arrays for the Probe Far-Infrared Mission for Astrophysics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02175v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Far-infrared (far-IR) astrophysics missions featuring actively cooled telescopes will offer orders of magnitude observing speed improvement at wavelengths where galaxies and forming planetary systems emit most of their light. The PRobe far-Infrared Mission for Astrophysics (PRIMA), which is currently under study, emphasizes low and moderate resolution spectroscopy throughout the far-IR. Full utilization of PRIMA's cold telescope requires far-IR detector arrays with per-pixel noise equivalent powers (NEPs) at or below 1 x 10-19 W/rtHz. We are developing low-volume Aluminum kinetic inductance detector (KID) arrays to reach these sensitivities. We will present on the development of our long-wavelength (210 um) array approach, with a focus on multitone measurements of our 1,008-pixel arrays. We measure an NEP below 1 x 10-19 W/rtHz for 73 percent of our pixels.</description>
