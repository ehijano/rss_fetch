      <title>Quantum critical scaling of altermagnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The term altermagnetism has recently been introduced to describe the N\'eel order of a class of materials whose magnetic sublattices are neither related by translation nor inversion. While these materials arguably have large technological potential, little effort has been devoted to studying the universal distinction of this phase of matter compared to collinear antiferromagnetism. Employing a recently proposed minimal microscopic model, we explicitly derive a nonlinear sigma model describing long-wavelength fluctuations of the staggered magnetization in this system, including quantum effects to leading order. The term that distinguishes the altermagnetic nonlinear sigma model from its antiferromagnetic counterpart is an interaction term that derives directly from the Berry phase of the microscopic spin degrees of freedom. Its effects on the one-loop renormalization group flow in $d=2+\epsilon$ dimensions are examined. Extending the theory to describe the fermionic excitations of the metallic altermagnet, we find an effective low-energy model of $d$-wave spin-split Dirac fermions interacting with the magnetic fluctuations. Using a Dyson-Schwinger approach, we derive the many-body effects on the dynamical critical scaling due to the competition between the long-range Coulomb interaction and the fluctuations of the staggered magnetization.</description>

      <title>Parity anomaly from LSM: exact valley symmetries on the lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the honeycomb tight-binding model hosts an exact microscopic avatar of its low-energy SU(2) valley symmetry and parity anomaly. Specifically, the SU(2) valley symmetry arises from a collection of conserved, integer-quantized charge operators that obey the Onsager algebra. Along with lattice reflection and time-reversal symmetries, this Onsager symmetry has a Lieb-Schultz-Mattis (LSM) anomaly that matches the parity anomaly in the IR. Indeed, we show that any local Hamiltonian commuting with these symmetries cannot have a trivial unique gapped ground state. We study the phase diagram of the simplest symmetric model and survey various deformations, including Haldane's mass term, which preserves only the Onsager symmetry. Our results place the parity anomaly in 2+1D alongside Schwinger's anomaly in 1+1D and Witten's SU(2) anomaly in 3+1D as 't Hooft anomalies that can arise from the Onsager symmetry on the lattice.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic response and emergent topological orders in transition metal dichalcogenide MoTe$_2$ bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twisted bilayer transition metal dichalcogenides, such as MoTe$_2$, provide a versatile platform for exploring correlated topological phases. This work investigates the interplay of perpendicular magnetic and electric fields in tuning the electronic structure and emergent topological orders of twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ (t-MoTe$_2$) across two distinct regimes: a low-twist-angle phase ($\theta\approx2.1^\circ$) hosting multiple Chern bands of identical Chern numbers per valley, and a higher-angle phase ($\theta\approx 3.89^\circ$) featuring Haldane-like bands with opposite Chern numbers. Using a continuum model incorporating moir\'e potentials up to second harmonics, we compute the Hofstadter fractal spectra under applied fields, revealing Landau fan structures and magnetic-flux-dependent band topology. These fractal spectra are useful in studying emergent topological orders in terms of the composite fermion picture, where the statistical Chern-Simons flux is approximated as a uniform gauge field. We demonstrate that the system hosts both Jain-sequence fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) and non-Jain "fractal FCIs" with higher Chern numbers. The electric field suppresses composite fermion gaps and induces topological quantum phase transitions. Furthermore, our analysis extends to valley-contrasting flux attachment, proposing pathways to describe fractional quantum spin Hall states.</description>

      <title>Dissipation meets conformal interface: How the relaxation rate is suppressed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conformal interfaces play an important role in quantum critical systems. In closed systems, the transmission properties of conformal interfaces are typically characterized by two quantities: One is the effective central charge $c_{\text{eff}}$, which measures the amount of quantum entanglement through the interface, and the other is the transmission coefficient $c_{\text{LR}}$, which measures the energy transmission through the interface. In the present work, to characterize the transmission property of conformal interfaces in open quantum systems, we propose a third quantity $c_{\text{relax}}$, which is defined through the ratio of Liouvillian gaps with and without an interface. Physically, $c_{\text{relax}}$ measures the suppression of the relaxation rate towards a steady state when the system is subject to a local dissipation. We perform both analytical perturbation calculations and exact numerical calculations based on a free fermion chain at the critical point. It is found that $c_{\text{relax}}$ decreases monotonically with the strength of the interface. In particular, $0\le c_{\text{relax}}\le c_{\text{LR}}\le c_{\text{eff}}$, where the equalities hold if and only if the interface is totally reflective or totally transmissive. Our result for $c_{\text{relax}}$ is universal in the sense that $c_{\text{relax}}$ is independent of (i) the dissipation strength in the weak dissipation regime and (ii) the location where the local dissipation is introduced. Comparing to the previously known $c_{\text{LR}}$ and $c_{\text{eff}}$ in a closed system, our $c_{\text{relax}}$ shows a distinct behavior as a function of the interface strength, suggesting its novelty to characterize conformal interfaces in open systems and offering insights into critical systems under dissipation.</description>

      <title>Quantum geometry and magnon Hall transport in an altermagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute magnon Hall conductivities in a minimal model of a two-dimensional altermagnet. To do so, we derive an analytic expression for the relevant quantum geometric tensor describing two-band bosonic Bogoliubov Hamiltonians, providing insight into the geometric, topological, and transport properties. The magnon thermal Hall and spin Nernst conductivities are shown to directly depend on the altermagnetic parameter, which may serve as an experimental probe of altermagnetism.</description>

      <title>Dehybridization transition in Kondo insulators and heavy fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In strongly correlated multi-band systems, like inter-metallics, heavy fermions or Kondo insulators, electron-electron and electron-phonon scattering of the electrons in the bands give rise, at finite temperatures, to a damping of these quasi-particles. This is responsible for producing an effective dehybridization between the electrons in the large conduction bands and those in the narrow, correlated band. This dehybridization effect has been used to explain the transport properties of inter-metallics and ARPES experiments in heavy fermions at sufficiently high temperatures. A new insight into this problem has been recently proposed using the theory of non-Hermitian systems. In this note, we review previous work on dehybridization in Kondo insulators and strongly correlated metals within this new perspective. For this purpose, we use a parametrization of the self-energy of the strongly correlated electrons obtained from LDA+DMFT calculations. We discuss the nature of the dehybridization transition and its consequences in the electronic spectrum and transport properties.</description>

      <title>Theoretical perspectives on optical control of magnetism in spin-charge coupled systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we review recent theoretical research on photocontrol of magnetism in several spin-charge coupled systems. The control of magnetism with light has been a central issue in condensed-matter physics, attracting enormous research interest both for fundamental science and for technological applications. This field of research has developed rapidly in recent years along with the development of laser technology. However, because the direct coupling between the light magnetic field and magnetization via the Zeeman coupling is very weak in terms of the energy scale, it is, in principle, difficult to induce dramatic effects as far as this magnetic light-matter interaction is exploited. On the contrary, the interaction between the light electric field and electron charges has an energy scale two to three orders of magnitude larger than that of the magnetic interaction. Therefore, we may realize astonishing photoinduced physical phenomena and novel optical device functions by exploiting this electric light-matter interaction. Spin-charge coupled magnets, e.g., double-exchange magnets, multiferroics materials, and Rashba electron systems, in which spins and charges are strongly coupled through several kinds of mechanisms such as exchange interactions and spin-orbit coupling, are ideal systems for realizing this idea. Recent theoretical studies have revealed that it is possible to control, manipulate and switch the magnetization coupled to electron charges in these systems through exciting and/or driving them with light electric fields. The following three recent topics are discussed as examples of such theoretical studies, that is, photoinduced magnetic phase transitions in irradiated double-exchange models, highly efficient photoinduction of spin polarization in Rashba electron systems, and electromagnon excitations and their intense excitation effects in multiferroic materials.</description>

      <title>A versatile setup for symmetry-resolved ultrafast dynamics of quantum materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Correlated phenomena occur in quantum materials because of the delicate interplay between internal degrees of freedom, leading to multiple symmetry-broken quantum phases. Resolving the structure of these phases is a key challenge, often requiring facilities equipped with x-ray free-electron lasers and electron sources that may not be readily accessible to the average user. Table-top sources that offer alternative means are therefore needed. In this work, we present an all-optical, table-top setup that enables symmetry-resolved studies using linear and nonlinear spectroscopies. We demonstrate the versatility of the setup with chosen examples that underscore the importance of tracking symmetries and showcase the strengths of the setup, which offers a large tunable parameter space.</description>

      <title>Topological phase transition to a hidden charge density wave liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Charge density waves (CDWs), electronic crystals that form within a host solid, have long been speculated to melt into a spatially textured electronic liquid. Though they have not been previously detected, liquid CDWs may nonetheless be fundamental to the phase diagrams of many correlated electron systems, including high temperature superconductors and quantum Hall states. In one of the most promising candidate materials capable of hosting a liquid CDW, 1T-TaS2, a structural phase transition impedes its observation. Here, by irradiating the material with a femtosecond light pulse, we circumvent the structural phase transition to reveal how topological defect dynamics govern the otherwise invisible CDW correlations. Upon photoexcitation, the CDW diffraction peaks broaden azimuthally, initially revealing a hexatic state. At higher temperatures, photoexcitation completely destroys translational and orientational order and only a ring of diffuse scattering is observed, a key signature of a liquid CDW. Our work provides compelling evidence for a defect-unbinding transition to a CDW liquid and presents a protocol for uncovering states that are hidden by other transitions in thermal equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Ground-states of the Shastry-Sutherland Lattice Materials Gd$_2$Be$_2$GeO$_7$ and Dy$_2$Be$_2$GeO$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent realization that the rare-earth melilites RE$_2$Be$_2$GeO$_7$ host the Shastry-Sutherland lattice within planes of RE$^{3+}$ ions has sparked a number of studies. This family of materials lacks appreciable site mixing and conductivity, making them promising candidates for the Shastry-Sutherland model. Herein, we present the magnetic ground states of two of these rare-earth melilites: RE = Gd and Dy. We find, through measurements of magnetic susceptibility, magnetization, and specific heat capacity (RE = Dy only), that these two melilites are antiferromagnets (T$_N$ $\sim$~1~K). Gd$_2$Be$_2$GeO$_7$, in accordance with its electronic configuration, has isotropic single-ion anisotropy but shows a quadratic contribution to its magnetization. Dy$_2$Be$_2$GeO$_7$ has Ising-like single-ion ansiotropy and is likely an effective spin-$1/2$ system. Both materials exhibit metamagnetic transitions. We identify this transition in Dy$_2$Be$_2$GeO$_7$, occurring at 86(1)~mT for T=500~mK, to likely be a spin-flip transition.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in Spin-Orbit coupled SU(8) Dirac Fermions on Honeycomb lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study superconducting (SC) phases that are naturally proximate to a spin-orbit coupled SU(8) Dirac semi-metal on a honeycomb lattice. This system, which offers enhanced low-energy symmetries, presents an interesting platform for realizing unconventional superconductivity in j=3/2 electrons. In particular, we find 72 superconducting charge-$2e$ fermion bilinears which, under classification of microscopic symmetries, lead to 12 different SCs -- four singlets, two doublets, and six triplets -- 7 of them are gapped and 5 are symmetry-protected nodal SCs. The strong spin-orbit coupling leads to locking of the spin of the Cooper pairs with real-space direction -- as is evident from the structure of the Cooper pair wave-functions -- leading to unusual non-unitary superconductors (even singlets), and with finite momentum pairing (for the triplets). This results, in many cases, in the magnitude of multiple pairing gaps being intricately dependent on the direction of the SC order-parameter. The present classification of SCs along with normal phases (Phys. Rev. B 108, 245106 (2023)) provides the complete list of naturally occurring phases in the vicinity of such a SU(8) Dirac semi-metal. This study allows for understanding the global phase diagram of such systems, stimulating further experimental work on candidate materials such as metallic halides (MX$_3$ with M=Zr, Hf, and X=Cl, Br). Further, it provides the starting point for the exploration of unconventional phase transitions in such systems.</description>

      <title>Internal and External Field Effects upon Crystal Field Excitations in REFeO$_3$ (RE = Nd$^{3+}$, Er$^{3+}$, Yb$^{3+}$, Pr$^{3+}$, and Ho$^{3+}$)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The crystal field (CF) excitations of Kramers (Nd$^{3+}$, Er$^{3+}$, and Yb$^{3+}$) and non-Kramers (Pr$^{3+}$ and Ho$^{3+}$) rare earth ions in rare earth orthoferrites REFeO$_{3}$ were systematically studied by simulations. The optimised CF models were used to study the internal and external field impacts to the CF excitation peaks of these Kramers and non-Kramers ions. The Kramers ions excitations consist of doublets due to the Kramers degeneracy theorem while the non-Kramers ions excitations are non-degenerated singlets. The ground-state doublets of all Kramers ions undergo peak splitting and generate low energy excitation peaks ~ 1 meV under the internal magnetic fields from the Fe$^{3+}$ and RE$^{3+}$ sublattices. The ground-states of non-Kramers ions may form pseudo doublets due to the accidental degeneracy of two singlet states, as the case of Ho$^{3+}$ in HoFeO$_3$. Such pseudo-doublet ground states can split and produce low energy excitations just like the Kramers ions. However, singlet ground states of non-Kramers ions without accidental degeneracy, like Pr$^{3+}$, has no ground state excitation and splitting at zero fields. A ground-state singlet excitation shows up under non-zero magnetic fields due to the symmetry breaking induced by the magnetic fields. The internal/external magnetic field effects on CF excitations in REFeO$_3$ demonstrate strong anisotropies. The local symmetry was confirmed to play the critical role in the CF excitation splitting and anisotropic responses to magnetic fields in REFeO$_{3}$. This study provides a consistent in-depth understanding to the abnormal Zeeman splitting effect of the CF ground states in REFeO$_{3}$.</description>

      <title>Microscopic phase-transition theory of charge density waves: revealing hidden transitions of phason and amplitudon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a self-consistent phase-transition theory of charge density waves (CDWs), starting from a purely microscopic model. Specifically, we derive a microscopic CDW gap equation $|\Delta_0(T)|$, taking into account of thermal phase fluctuations (i.e., thermal excitation of phason) and their influence on CDW pinning (i.e., the phason mass) and CDW gap. We demonstrate that as temperature increases from zero, the phason gradually softens, leading to a depinning transition (where the phason becomes gapless) at $T_d$ and a subsequent first-order CDW phase transition at $T_c&gt;T_d$. The predicted values of $T_d$, $T_c$ as well as the large ratio of $|\Delta_0(T=0)|/(k_BT_c)$ for the quasi-one-dimensional CDW material (TaSe$_4$)$_2$I show remarkable quantitative agreements with experimental measurements and explain many of the previously observed key thermodynamic features and unresolved issues in literature. To further validate the theory, we calculate the energy gap of CDW amplitudon and its lifetime, and reveal a transition of amplitudon from a lightly damped to a heavily damped excitation during pinning-depinning transition while its energy gap is nearly unchanged throughout the entire CDW phase. This finding quantitatively captures and explains the recently observed coherent signal in ultrafast THz emission spectroscopy on (TaSe$_4$)$_2$I.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the evolution of polarized electronic Raman response in trilayer nickelate La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$, uncovering a systematic reduction of the incoherent electron continuum across the density wave transition in the $A_{1g}$ and $B_{1g}$ representations. Analysis based on the Fermi surface band curvatures points to quasiparticle coherence in momentum positions with dominant $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital character. Our findings establish the symmetry channels and the active role of $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals involved in the density wave formation, offering important insight into the electronic and magnetic correlations in the nickelate.</description>

      <title>Static and dynamic properties of Kitaev-Heisenberg ferromagnet on a triangular lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an extensive study of ground state and excitations of ferromagnetic anisotropic-exchange Kitaev-Heisenberg model on a triangular lattice using order-by-disorder calculations. It is shown that while bond-dependent terms do not affect the ground state classically, quantum fluctuations select preferred magnetization direction of the ferromagnetic state. Anisotropic terms of the magnetic Hamiltonian also give rise to magnon-magnon interactions that lead to spontaneous decays and spectral renormalization, which we illustrate using non-linear spin-wave theory.</description>

      <title>Magnetic ground states of highly doped two-leg Hubbard ladders with a particle bath</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the ground-state magnetism of a Hubbard model in a system consisting of a main frame (subsystem) and a particle bath (center sites). The hole doping in the main frame is controlled by adjusting the chemical potential of the particle bath. In the weakly doped region, the saturated ferromagnetic state emerges due to the Nagaoka mechanism [Phys. Rev. B 90, 224426 (2014)]. However, in the highly doped region, a variety of intriguing magnetic states are observed, including partially polarized states and nonmagnetic states. To understand these states, we analyze the state of the subsystem by comparing its properties with those of a two-leg ladder system, which corresponds to the subsystem with the center sites removed. Furthermore, to gain insight into the microscopic origin of the magnetic phase diagram, we study the ground state of the corresponding effective t-J model, derived from the Hubbard model by considering the second-order processes of the electron hopping. The phase diagram is well reproduced by the effective t-J model, which includes the three-site pair-hopping term. To elucidate the competition among different energy contributions, such as potential, kinetic, and magnetic energies, we classify the energies within the effective t-J model.</description>

      <title>Evidence of chiral fermion edge modes through geometric engineering of thermal Hall in $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The experimental observation of half-integer-quantized thermal Hall conductivity in the Kitaev candidate material $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ has served as smoking-gun signature of non-Abelian anyons through an associated chiral Majorana edge mode. However, both the reproducibility of the quantized thermal Hall conductivity and the fundamental nature of the associated heat carriers, whether bosonic or fermionic, are subjects of ongoing and vigorous debate. In a recent theoretical work, it was proposed that varying the sample geometry through creating constrictions can distinguish between different origins of the thermal Hall effect in magnetic insulators. Here, we provide experimental evidence of chiral fermion edge modes by comparing the thermal Hall effect of a geometrically constricted $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ sample with that of an unconstricted bulk sample. In contrast to the bulk crystals where the thermal Hall signal fades below 5\,K, the constricted crystals display a significant thermal Hall signal that remains measurable even at 2\,K. This sharp difference agrees well with the theoretical prediction and provides compelling evidence for the contribution of chiral fermion edge modes to the thermal Hall effect in $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$. More broadly, this work confirms that the geometry dependence of the thermal Hall effect can help identify chiral spin liquids in candidate materials like $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ and paves the way for the experimental realization of thermal anyon interferometry.</description>

      <title>Reduced Basis Method for Driven-Dissipative Quantum Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reduced basis methods provide an efficient way of mapping out phase diagrams of strongly correlated many-body quantum systems. The method relies on using the exact solutions at select parameter values to construct a low-dimensional basis, from which observables can be efficiently and reliably computed throughout the parameter space. Here we show that this method can be generalized to driven-dissipative Markovian systems allowing efficient calculations of observables in the transient and steady states. A subsequent distillation of the reduced basis vectors according to their explained variances allows for an unbiased exploration of the most pronounced parameter dependencies indicative of phase boundaries in the thermodynamic limit.</description>

      <title>Higher symmetries and anomalies in quantum lattice systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define an 't Hooft anomaly index for a group acting on a 2d quantum lattice system by finite-depth circuits. It takes values in the degree-4 cohomology of the group and is an obstruction to on-siteability of the group action. We introduce a 3-group (modeled as a crossed square) describing higher symmetries of a 2d lattice system and show that the 2d anomaly index is an obstruction for promoting a symmetry action to a morphism of 3-groups. This demonstrates that 't Hooft anomalies are a consequence of a mixing between ordinary symmetries and higher symmetries. Similarly, to any 1d lattice system we attach a 2-group (modeled as a crossed module) and interpret the Nayak-Else anomaly index as an obstruction for promoting a group action to a morphism of 2-groups. The meaning of indices of Symmetry Protected Topological states is also illuminated by higher group symmetry.</description>

      <title>Theoretically proposed controlled creation of Bloch-type skyrmions with spin-orbit torque in a chiral-ferromagnet/heavy-metal heterojunction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The creation and manipulation of magnetic skyrmions in magnetic bilayer heterostructures via spin-orbit torque have been intensively studied in spintronics because of their potential application as information carriers in next-generation magnetic memory devices. However, experimental attempts have not always been successful. In this paper, we theoretically elucidate the underlying reasons for these difficulties and propose a practical method to overcome them by employing magnetic bilayer heterostructures that incorporate a chiral ferromagnetic layer hosting Bloch-type skyrmions instead of the conventional ferromagnetic layer that hosts N\'{e}el-type skyrmions. Our micromagnetic simulations demonstrate that Bloch-type skyrmions can be controllably created in this system via spin-orbit torque exerted by a perpendicular spin current. This finding provides a promising platform and method for realizing skyrmion-based spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Proposed controlled creation and manipulation of skyrmions with spin-orbit torque</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The physical mechanisms underlying current-driven skyrmion motion include the spin-transfer torque exerted by a spin-polarized horizontal electric current and the spin-orbit torque exerted by a perpendicular spin current. Each mechanism requires a specific sample geometry and structural configuration. Regarding current-induced skyrmion creation, skyrmions can be efficiently created at low current densities via spin-transfer torque when an electric current is applied to a nanotrack structure with a small notch. However, an effective and controlled method for skyrmion creation via spin-orbit torque in notched nanotracks has yet to be established. Here we theoretically propose a method for the creation, driving, and deletion of skyrmions in a three-terminal magnetic heterojunction with a notch. Our proposal offers valuable insights into the design of techniques for skyrmion creation and manipulation using spin-orbit torque, which is essential for technical applications of magnetic skyrmions as information carriers in next-generation spintronic memory devices.</description>

      <title>Systematic construction of asymptotic quantum many-body scar states and their relation to supersymmetric quantum mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a systematic method for constructing asymptotic quantum many-body scar (AQMBS) states. While AQMBS states are closely related to quantum many-body scar (QMBS) states, they exhibit key differences. Unlike QMBS states, AQMBS states are not energy eigenstates of the Hamiltonian, making their construction more challenging. We demonstrate that, under appropriate conditions, AQMBS states can be obtained as low-lying gapless excited states of a parent Hamiltonian, which has a QMBS state as its ground state. Furthermore, our formalism reveals a connection between QMBS and supersymmetric (SUSY) quantum mechanics. The QMBS state can be interpreted as a SUSY-unbroken ground state.</description>

      <title>Discrete time crystal for periodic-field sensing with quantum-enhanced precision</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sensing periodic-fields using quantum sensors has been an active field of research. In many of these scenarios, the quantum state of the probe is flipped regularly by the application of ${\pi}$-pulses to accumulate information about the target periodic-field. The emergence of a discrete time crystalline phase, as a nonequilibrium phase of matter, naturally provides oscillations in a many-body system with an inherent controllable frequency. They benefit from long coherence time and robustness against imperfections, which makes them excellent potential quantum sensors. In this paper, through theoretical and numerical analysis, we show that a disorder-free discrete time crystal probe can reach the ultimate achievable precision for sensing a periodic-field. As the amplitude of the periodic-field increases, the discrete time crystalline order diminishes, and the performance of the probe decreases remarkably. Nevertheless, the obtained quantum enhancement in the discrete time crystal phase shows robustness against different imperfections in the protocol. Finally, we propose the implementation of our protocol in ultra-cold atoms in optical lattices.</description>

      <title>Planar fault-tolerant circuits for non-Clifford gates on the 2D color code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a family of scalable planar fault-tolerant circuits that implement logical non-Clifford operations on a 2D color code, such as a logical $T$ gate or a logical non-Pauli measurement that prepares a magic $|T\rangle$ state. The circuits are relatively simple, consisting only of physical $T$ gates, $CX$ gates, and few-qubit measurements. They can be implemented with an array of qubits on a 2D chip with nearest-neighbor couplings, and no wire crossings. The construction is based on a spacetime path integral representation of a non-Abelian 2+1D topological phase, which is related to the 3D color code. We turn the path integral into a circuit by expressing it as a spacetime $ZX$ tensor network, and then traversing it in some chosen time direction. We describe in detail how fault tolerance is achieved using a "just-in-time" decoding strategy, for which we repurpose and extend state-of-the-art color-code matching decoders.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional $J_1$-$J_2$ clock model: A cornucopia of emergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study on the frustrated $J_1$-$J_2$ classical $q$-state clock model with even $q&gt;4$ on a two-dimensional square lattice, revealing a rich ensemble of phases driven by competing interactions. In the unfrustrated regime ($J_1&gt;2J_2$), the model reproduces the standard clock model phenomenology: a low-temperature $\mathbb{Z}_q$-broken ferromagnet, an intermediate XY-like critical quasi-long-range-ordered (QLRO) phase with emergent $U(1)$ symmetry, and a high-temperature paramagnet. For $J_1&lt;2J_2$, frustration stabilizes five distinct regimes: the disordered paramagnet, a stripe-ordered phase breaking $\mathbb{Z}_q\times\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry, two $\mathbb{Z}_2$-broken nematic phases (one with and one without QLRO), and an exotic stripe phase with emergent discrete $\mathbb{Z}_q$ spin degrees of freedom prohibited in the microscopic Hamiltonian. Remarkably, this seemingly forbidden $\mathbb{Z}_q$ order emerges via a relevant operator in the infrared long-wavelength limit, rather than from an irrelevant perturbation, highlighting a non-standard route to emergence. Using large-scale corner transfer matrix renormalization group calculations, complemented by classical Monte Carlo simulations, we map the complete phase diagram and identify Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless, Ising, first-order, and unconventional Landau-incompatible transitions between different phases. Finally, we propose an effective field-theoretic framework that encompasses these emergent orders and their interwoven transitions.</description>

      <title>Polymorphic spin ordering in a single-crystalline cobalt-doped Fe3GaTe2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A single crystalline system typically stabilizes a unique state for spin ordering below a critical temperature. Certain materials exhibit multiple magnetic states, driven by structural phase transitions under varying thermodynamic conditions. Recently, van der Waals magnets have demonstrated subtle interlayer exchange interactions, offering a promising approach to electrically control spin states without structural transformation. Here, we report the emergence of three distinct magnetic states, ferromagnetic ordering and both collinear and non-collinear antiferromagnetic orderings, in a layered single crystalline magnet, cobalt-doped Fe3GaTe2 ((Co, Fe)3GaTe2). These three magnetic phases occur without structural phase transitions, a phenomenon we designate as polymorphic spin ordering in the material. The introduction of 16% Co-doping in Fe3GaTe2 modulates the interlayer magnetic interaction, enabling multiple spin orderings within the same lattice system with three critical temperatures: a Curie temperature for a ferromagnetic state (Tc=210 K) and two Neel temperatures for the collinear (TN1=110 K) and non-collinear (TN2=30 K) antiferromagnetic states. Our findings are supported by magnetic force microscopy, first-principles calculations, and circular dichroism angular photoemission spectroscopy, which reveals varying spin ordering and changes in the topological band structure and Berry curvature at different temperatures within the single-crystalline (Co, Fe)3GaTe2.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nonlinear optical responses of chiral phonons to terahertz and infrared light are studied using the nonlinear response theory. We show that the photo-induced angular momentum increases with the square of the chiral-phonon relaxation time $\tau$, giving a significantly larger angular momentum compared to ordinary phonons. We also find that the photo-induced Peltier effect by chiral phonons occurs through a mechanism distinct from those proposed recently; the induced energy current scales $\propto\tau^2$, giving a larger energy current in the clean limit. We prove a linear relation between the generated angular momentum and the energy current. Lastly, we show that the orbital current, an analog of the spin current, occurs through a nonlinear response. These findings demonstrate the unique properties and functionalities of chiral phonons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding and controlling the charge density wave (CDW) phase diagram of transition metal dichalcogenides is a long-studied problem in condensed matter physics. However, due to complex involvement of electron and lattice degrees of freedom and pronounced anharmonicity, theoretical simulations of the CDW phase diagram at the density-functional-theory level are often numerically demanding. To reduce the computational cost of first principles modelling by orders of magnitude, we have developed an electronic free energy machine learning model for monolayer NbSe$_2$ that allows changing both electronic and ionic temperatures independently. Our approach relies on a machine learning model of the electronic density of states and zero-temperature interatomic potential. This allows us to explore the CDW phase diagram of monolayer NbSe$_2$ both under thermal and laser-induced nonthermal conditions. Our study provides an accurate estimate of the CDW transition temperature at low cost and can disentangle the role of hot electrons and phonons in nonthermal ultrafast melting process of the CDW phase in NbSe$_2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The symmetry and geometry of the Fermi surface play an essential role in governing the transport properties of a metallic system. A Fermi surface with reduced symmetry is intimately tied to unusual transport properties such as anomalous Hall effect and nonlinear Hall effect. Here, combining theoretical calculations and transport measurements, we report the discovery of a new class of bulk Fermi surface structure with unprecedented low symmetry, the ``Fermi lune", with peculiar crescent shaped Fermi energy contours, in rhombohedral multilayer graphene. This emergent Fermi-lune structure driven by electron-electron interactions spontaneously breaks time-reversal, mirror, and rotational symmetries, leading to two distinctive phenomena: giant intrinsic non-reciprocity in longitudinal transport and a new type of magnetism termed ``transdimensional orbital magnetism". Coupling the Fermi lune to a superlattice potential further produces a novel Chern insulator exhibiting quantized anomalous Hall effect controlled by in-plane magnetic field. Our work unveils a new symmetry breaking state of matter in the transdimensional regime, which opens an avenue for exploring correlated and topological quantum phenomena in symmetry breaking phases.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric decay of quantum many-body scars in XYZ quantum spin chains</title>

Abstract: Quantum many-body scars are atypical energy eigenstates of chaotic quantum many-body systems that prevent certain special non-equilibrium initial conditions from thermalizing. We point out that quantum many-body scars exist for any nearest-neighbor spin-$S$ XYZ quantum spin chain, and arise in the form of an infinite family of highly excited yet nonentangled product-state eigenstates, which define periodic textures in spin space. This set of scars, discovered originally by Granovskii and Zhedanov in 1985, encompasses both the experimentally relevant 'spin helices' for XXZ chains and more complicated helix-like states constructed from Jacobi elliptic functions for generic XYZ chains. An appealing feature of Granovskii-Zhedanov scars is that they are well-defined in the semiclassical limit $S \to \infty$, which allows for a systematic and analytical treatment of their dynamical instability to perturbations of the Hamiltonian. Using time-dependent spin-wave theory, we predict that upon perturbing along certain directions in Hamiltonian space, Granovskii-Zhedanov scars exhibit a dramatic asymmetry in their decay: depending on the sign of the perturbation, the decrease of their contrast is either slow and linear, or fast and exponential in time. This asymmetry can be traced to the absence (presence) of imaginarity in the spectrum of the Bogoliubov Hamiltonian governing quantum fluctuations about the scar, which corresponds to the absence (presence) of a non-zero Lyapunov exponent for the limiting classical trajectory. Numerical simulations using matrix product states (MPS) and infinite time-evolving block decimation (iTEBD) confirm that our prediction remains valid even far from the semiclassical limit. Our findings challenge existing theories of how quantum-many body scars relax.</description>

Abstract: We present Ir $4f$ core-level hard-x-ray photoemission spectroscopy (HAXPES) experiments conducted across antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering transition in Ruddlesden-Popper iridates Sr$_2$IrO$_4$ and Sr$_3$Ir$_2$O$_7$. The Ir $4f$ spectra exhibit distinct changes between the AFM and paramagnetic (PM) phases, with the spectral difference $I_\text{PM}-I_\text{AFM}$ showing a contrasting behavior in the two compounds. By employing computational simulations using the local-density approximation combined with the dynamical mean-field theory method, we elucidate that $I_\text{PM}-I_\text{AFM}$ primary reflects the Slater or Mott-Hubbard character of the AFM insulating state rather than material specific details. This sensitivity to fine low-energy electronic structure arises from the dependence of charge-transfer responses to the sudden creation of a localized core hole on both metal-insulator transitions and long-range AFM ordering. Our result broadens the applications of core-level HAXPES as a tool for characterization of electronic structure.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Freezing in Exactly Solvable Models of Driven Chaotic Quantum Dots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01627v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The late-time equilibrium behavior of generic interacting models is determined by the coupled hydrodynamic equations associated with the globally conserved quantities. In the presence of an external time-dependent drive, non-integrable systems typically thermalize to an effectively infinite-temperature state, losing all memory of their initial states. However, in the presence of a large time-periodic Floquet drive, there exist special points in phase-space where the strongly interacting system develops approximate {\it emergent} conservation laws. Here we present results for an exactly solvable model of two coupled chaotic quantum dots with multiple orbitals interacting via random two and four-fermion interactions in the presence of a Floquet drive. We analyze the phenomenology of dynamically generated freezing using a combination of exact diagonalization, and field-theoretic analysis in the limit of a large number of electronic orbitals. The model displays universal freezing behavior irrespective of whether the theory is averaged over the disorder configurations or not. We present explicit computations for the growth of many-body chaos and entanglement entropy, which demonstrates the long-lived coherence associated with the interacting degrees of freedom even at late-times at the dynamically frozen points. We also compute the slow timescale that controls relaxation away from exact freezing in a high-frequency expansion.</description>

      <title>Fractionalization of Coset Non-Invertible Symmetry and Exotic Hall Conductance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20401v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate fractionalization of non-invertible symmetry in (2+1)D topological orders. We focus on coset non-invertible symmetries obtained by gauging non-normal subgroups of invertible $0$-form symmetries. These symmetries can arise as global symmetries in quantum spin liquids, given by the quotient of the projective symmetry group by a non-normal subgroup as invariant gauge group. We point out that such coset non-invertible symmetries in topological orders can exhibit symmetry fractionalization: each anyon can carry a "fractional charge" under the coset non-invertible symmetry given by a gauge invariant superposition of fractional quantum numbers. We present various examples using field theories and quantum double lattice models, such as fractional quantum Hall systems with charge conjugation symmetry gauged and finite group gauge theory from gauging a non-normal subgroup. They include symmetry enriched $S_3$ and $O(2)$ gauge theories. We show that such systems have a fractionalized continuous non-invertible coset symmetry and a well-defined electric Hall conductance. The coset symmetry enforces a gapless edge state if the boundary preserves the continuous non-invertible symmetry. We propose a general approach for constructing coset symmetry defects using a "sandwich" construction: non-invertible symmetry defects can generally be constructed from an invertible defect sandwiched by condensation defects. The anomaly free condition for finite coset symmetry is also identified.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09310v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the potential experimental realization of the mixed-spin Kitaev model in materials such as Zr$_{0.5}$Ru$_{0.5}$Cl$_3$, where spin-1/2 and spin-3/2 ions occupy distinct sublattices of a honeycomb lattice. By developing a superexchange theory specifically for this mixed-spin system, we identify the conditions under which dominant Kitaev-like interactions emerge. Focusing on the limiting case of pure Kitaev coupling with single-ion anisotropy, we employ a combination of superexchange theory, parton mean-field theory, and density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations. We establish a comprehensive ground-state phase diagram identifying four distinct quantum spin liquid phases. Our findings highlight the importance of spin-orbital couplings and quadrupolar order parameters in stabilizing exotic phases, providing a foundation for exploring mixed-spin Kitaev magnets.</description>

      <title>Precursors to Anderson Localization in the Holstein Model: Quantum and Quantum-Classical Solutions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17770v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We calculate the frequency-dependent mobility of the Holstein polaron in one dimension near adiabatic limit using the method based on dynamical quantum tipicality, as well as the quantum-classical method. The agreement between fully quantum and quantum-classical solutions is very good. The most prominent feature is the appearance of a zero-frequency peak in the mobility, in addition to the displaced peak associated to the precursors of Anderson localization. The zero-frequency peak cannot be obtained within the phenomenological transient localization approach, which is often used in a semiquantitative description of charge transport in quasi-one-dimensional organic semiconductors.</description>

      <title>Unconventional excitonic insulators in two-dimensional topological materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18694v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bound electron-hole pairs in semiconductors known as excitons can form a coherent state at low temperatures akin to a BCS condensate. The resulting phase is known as the excitonic insulator and has superfluid properties. Here we theoretically study the excitonic insulator in a pair of recently proposed two-dimensional candidate materials with nontrivial band topology. Contrary to previous works, we include interaction channels that violate the individual electron and hole number conservations. These are on equal footing with the number-conserving processes due to the substantial overlap of Wannier orbitals of different bands, which cannot be exponentially localized due to the nontrivial Chern numbers of the latter. Their inclusion is crucial to determine the symmetry of the electron-hole pairing, and by performing mean-field calculations at nonzero temperatures we find that the order parameter in these systems is a chiral $d$-wave. We discuss the nontrivial topology of this unconventional state and discuss some properties of the associated Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition. In particular, we argue that here it becomes a smooth crossover and estimate the associated temperature to lie between $\SI{50}{\kelvin}$ and $\SI{75}{\kelvin}$ on realistic substrates, over an order of magnitude larger than in the number-conserving approximation where $s$-wave pairing is favored. Our results highlight the interplay between topology at the single-particle level and long-range interactions, motivating further research in systems where both phenomena coexist.</description>

Abstract: Nonintegrable many-body quantum systems typically thermalize at long times through the mechanism of quantum chaos. However, some exceptional systems, such as those harboring quantum scars, break thermalization, serving as testbeds for foundational problems of quantum statistical physics. Here, we investigate a class of nonintegrable bond-staggered models that is endowed with a large number of zero-energy eigenstates and possesses a non-Abelian internal symmetry. We use character theory to give a lower bound on the zero-energy degeneracy, which matches exact diagonalization results, and is found to grow exponentially with the system size. We also show that few-magnon zero-energy states have an exact analytical description, allowing us to build a basis of low-entangled fixed-separation states, which is stable to most perturbations found in experiments. This remarkable dynamical stability of special states elucidates our understanding of nonequilibrium processes in non-Abelian chaotic quantum models.</description>

      <title>Correlations and Krylov spread for a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian: Ising chain with a complex-valued transverse magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07775v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Krylov complexity measures the spread of an evolved state in a natural basis, induced by the generator of the dynamics and the initial state. Here, we study the spread in Hilbert space of the state of an Ising chain subject to a complex-valued transverse magnetic field, initialized in a trivial product state with all spins pointing down. We demonstrate that Krylov spread reveals structural features of many-body systems that remain hidden in correlation functions that are traditionally employed to determine the phase diagram. When the imaginary part of the spectrum of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian is gapped, the system state asymptotically approaches the non-Hermitian Bogoliubov vacuum for this Hamiltonian. We find that the spread of this evolution unravels three different dynamical phases based on how the spread reaches its infinite-time value. Furthermore, we establish a connection between the Krylov spread and the static correlation function for the z-components of spins in the underlying non-Hermitian Bogoliubov vacuum, providing a full analytical characterization of correlations across the phase diagram. Specifically, for a gapped imaginary spectrum in a finite magnetic field, we find that the correlation function exhibits an oscillatory behavior that decays exponentially in space. Conversely, for a gapless imaginary spectrum, the correlation function displays an oscillatory behavior with an amplitude that decays algebraically in space; the underlying power law depends on the manifestation of two exceptional points within this phase.</description>

      <title>A Unified Simulation Framework for Correlated Driven-Dissipative Quantum Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01541v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time-resolved photoemission spectroscopy provides a unique and direct way to explore the real-time nonequilibrium dynamics of electrons and holes. The formal theory of the spectral function evolution requires inclusion of electronic correlations and dissipation, which are challenging due to the associated long simulation timescales which translate to a high computational cost. Recent methodological developments, namely the Real-Time Dyson Expansion, as well as theoretical developments of many-body perturbation theory for dissipative systems, have allowed for the study of driven-dissipative interacting quantum systems. In this work, we implement the hitherto unrealized study of driven-dissipative interacting quantum systems which includes driven dynamical correlations and utilizes these new methods and perturbative expansions. We illustrate the combined formalism on a prototypical two-band semiconductor model with long-range density-density Coulomb interactions. We show that the intraband thermalization of conduction band electrons induces nontrivial time-dependent changes in the system's bandstructure and a time-evolving band-gap renormalization (with a reduction by up to 10\%). We show that the qualitative features are preserved for a variety of parameters, discuss the corresponding spectral dynamics, and provide an outlook on the newly introduced simulation framework, which enables treating electron-electron scattering and dissipation effects on equal footing.</description>
