      <title>A 3D view of multiple populations kinematics in Galactic globular clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first 3D kinematic analysis of multiple stellar populations (MPs) in a representative sample of 16 Galactic globular clusters (GCs). For each GC in the sample we studied the MP line-of-sight, plane-of-the-sky and 3D rotation as well as the velocity distribution anisotropy. The differences between first- (FP) and second-population (SP) kinematic patterns were constrained by means of parameters specifically defined to provide a global measure of the relevant physical quantities and to enable a meaningful comparison among different clusters. Our analysis provides the first observational description of the MP kinematic properties and of the path they follow during the long-term dynamical evolution. In particular, we find evidence of differences between the rotation of MPs along all velocity components with the SP preferentially rotating faster than the FP. The difference between the rotation strength of MPs is anti-correlated with the cluster dynamical age. We observe also that FPs are characterized by isotropic velocity distributions at any dynamical age probed by our sample. On the contrary, the velocity distribution of SP stars is found to be radially anisotropic in dynamically young clusters and isotropic at later evolutionary stages. The comparison with a set of numerical simulations shows that these observational results are consistent with the long-term evolution of clusters forming with an initially more centrally concentrated and more rapidly rotating SP subsystem. We discuss the possible implications these findings have on our understanding of MP formation and early evolution.</description>

      <title>RUBIES Reveals a Massive Quiescent Galaxy at z=7.3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the spectroscopic discovery of a massive quiescent galaxy at $z_{\rm spec}=7.29\pm0.01$, just $\sim700\,$Myr after the Big Bang. RUBIES-UDS-QG-z7 was selected from public JWST/NIRCam and MIRI imaging from the PRIMER survey and observed with JWST/NIRSpec as part of RUBIES. The NIRSpec/PRISM spectrum reveals one of the strongest Balmer breaks observed thus far at $z&gt;6$, no emission lines, but tentative Balmer and Ca absorption features, as well as a Lyman break. Simultaneous modeling of the NIRSpec/PRISM spectrum and NIRCam and MIRI photometry (spanning $0.9-18\,\mu$m) shows that the galaxy formed a stellar mass of log$(M_*/M_\odot)=10.23^{+0.04}_{-0.04}$ in a rapid $\sim 100-200\,$Myr burst of star formation at $z\sim8-9$, and ceased forming stars by $z\sim8$ resulting in $\log \rm{sSFR/yr}^{-1}&lt;-10$. We measure a small physical size of $209_{-24}^{+33}\,{\rm pc}$, which implies a high stellar mass surface density within the effective radius of $\log(\Sigma_{*,\rm e}/{\rm M_\odot\,kpc}^{-2})=10.85_{-0.12}^{+0.11}$ comparable to the densities measured in quiescent galaxies at $z\sim2-5$. The 3D stellar mass density profile of RUBIES-UDS-QG-z7 is remarkably similar to the central densities of local massive ellipticals, suggesting that at least some of their cores may have already been in place at $z&gt;7$. The discovery of RUBIES-UDS-QG-z7 has strong implications for galaxy formation models: the estimated number density of quiescent galaxies at $z\sim7$ is $&gt;100\times$ larger than predicted from any model to date, indicating that quiescent galaxies have formed earlier than previously expected.</description>

      <title>McFine: python-based Monte-Carlo multi-component hyperfine structure fitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modelling complex line emission in the interstellar medium (ISM) is a degenerate, high-dimensional problem. Here, we present McFine, a tool for automated multi-component fitting of emission lines with complex hyperfine structure, in a fully automated way. We use Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to efficiently explore the complex parameter space, allowing for characterising model denegeracies. This tool allows for both local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) and radiative-transfer (RT) models. McFine can fit individual spectra and data cubes, and for cubes encourage spatial coherence between neighbouring pixels. It is also built to fit the minimum number of distinct components, to avoid overfitting. We have carried out tests on synthetic spectra, where in around 90~per~cent of cases it fits the correct number of components, otherwise slightly fewer components. Typically, $T_{\rm ex}$ is overestimated and $\tau$ underestimated, but accurate within the estimated uncertainties. The velocity and line widths are recovered with extremely high accuracy, however. We verify McFine by applying to a large Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) N$_2$H$^+$ mosaic of an high-mass star forming region, G316.75-00.00. We find a similar quality of fit to our synthetic tests, aside from in the active regions forming O-stars, where the assumptions of Gaussian line profiles or LTE may break down. To show the general applicability of this code, we fit CO(J = 2-1) observations of NGC 3627, a nearby star-forming galaxy, again obtaining excellent fit quality. McFine provides a fully automated way to analyse rich datasets from interferometric observations, is open source, and pip-installable.</description>

      <title>Are BAL outflows powered by radiation pressure on dust?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Broad absorption line (BAL) outflows are commonly detected in active galactic nuclei (AGN), but their driving mechanism remains poorly constrained. Here we investigate whether radiation pressure on dust can adequately explain the BAL phenomenon observed in quasars. In the framework of our AGN radiative dusty feedback scenario, we show that dust-driven outflows can reach BAL wind-like velocities ($v \sim 10^4$ km/s) on galactic scales ($r \lesssim 1$ kpc). This is consistent with recent observations indicating that BAL acceleration typically occurs on scales of $\sim 10$ pc, and that the majority of BAL outflows are located at galactocentric radii greater than $\sim 100$ pc. We derive the outflow radial velocity profile and compute the associated outflow momentum rate and kinetic power, which are found to be in agreement with the outflow energetics measured in BAL quasars. Therefore radiation pressure on dust may account for the observed BAL outflow dynamics and energetics. Furthermore, we consider BAL clouds/clumps (leading to a clumpy BAL flow characterised by a wide range of outflowing velocities), and we analyse how the resulting covering factors affect the shape of the absorption line profiles. We conclude that dust-driven BAL outflows may provide a significant contribution to AGN feedback on galactic scales.</description>

      <title>H I Kinematics and the E(B-V)/N(H I) ratio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $\lambda 21$cm H I emission that is used to trace the gas to dust ratio at high Galactic latitudes has contributions from material beyond the Milky Way disk, with uncertain and likely sub-Solar metallicity and dust content. These contributions can be isolated kinematically and their presence is clear for sightlines with small mean reddening $&lt;$E(B-V)$&gt;$ $\la$ 0.03 mag, which have mean ratios $&lt;$N(H I)$&gt;$/$&lt;$E(B-V)$&gt;$ that are 20-50\% above the high latitude Galactic average $&lt;$N(H I)$&gt;/&lt;$E(B-V)$&gt;=8.3\times10^{21}$cm$^{-2}$mag$^{-1}$. By mapping N(H I) and E(B-V) across H I High Velocity Cloud complexes and the Magellanic Clouds we show that the reddening of this kinematically-isolated gas is on average five times smaller per H I than the high latitude average. However, the aggregate contribution of this gas is small and $&lt;$N(H I)$&gt;/&lt;$E(B-V)$&gt;=8.3\times10^{21}$cm$^{-2}$mag$^{-1}$ is the appropriate value for Galactic gas seen at high latitude using the H I and reddening measures employed here and in our previous work.</description>

      <title>Stellar Mass Calibrations for Local Low-Mass Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stellar masses of galaxies are measured using integrated light via several methods -- however, few of these methods were designed for low-mass ($M_{\star}\lesssim10^{8}\rm{M_{\odot}}$) "dwarf" galaxies, whose properties (e.g., stochastic star formation, low metallicity) pose unique challenges for estimating stellar masses. In this work, we quantify the precision and accuracy at which stellar masses of low-mass galaxies can be recovered using UV/optical/IR photometry. We use mock observations of 469 low-mass galaxies from a variety of models, including both semi-empirical models (GRUMPY, UniverseMachine-SAGA) and cosmological baryonic zoom-in simulations (MARVELous Dwarfs and FIRE-2), to test literature color-$M_\star/L$ relations and multi-wavelength spectral energy distribution (SED) mass estimators. We identify a list of "best practices" for measuring stellar masses of low-mass galaxies from integrated photometry. These include updated prescriptions for stellar mass based on $g-r$ color and WISE 3.4 $\mu$m luminosity, which are less systematically biased than literature calibrations and can recover true stellar masses of low-mass galaxies with $\sim0.1$ dex precision. When using SED fitting to estimate stellar mass, we find that the form of the assumed star formation history can induce significant biases: parametric SFHs can underestimate stellar mass by as much as $\sim0.4$ dex, while non-parametric SFHs recover true stellar masses with insignificant offset ($-0.03\pm0.11$ dex). However, we also caution that non-informative dust attenuation priors may introduce $M_\star$ uncertainties of up to $\sim0.6$ dex.</description>

      <title>The Arizona Molecular ISM Survey with the SMT: Variations in the CO(2-1)/CO(1-0) Line Ratio Across the Galaxy Population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The J=1$\rightarrow$0 spectral line of carbon monoxide (CO(1-0)) is the canonical tracer of molecular gas. However, CO(2-1) is frequently used in its place, following the assumption that the higher energy line can be used to infer the CO(1-0) luminosity and molecular gas mass. The use of CO(2-1) depends on a knowledge of the ratio between CO(2-1) and CO(1-0) luminosities, r21. Here we present galaxy-integrated r21 measurements for 122 galaxies spanning stellar masses from 10$^9$ to 10$^{11.5}$ M$_\odot$ and star formation rates (SFRs) from 0.08 to 35 M$_\odot$/yr. We find strong trends between r21 and SFR, SFR surface density, star formation efficiency, and distance from the star formation main sequence (SFMS). We show that the assumption of a constant r21 can introduce biases into the molecular gas trends in galaxy population studies and demonstrate how this affects the recovery of important galaxy scaling relations, including the Kennicutt-Schmidt law and the relation between SFMS offset and star formation efficiency. We provide a prescription which accounts for variations in r21 as a function of SFR and can be used to convert between CO(2-1) and CO(1-0) when only one line is available. Our prescription matches variations in r21 for both AMISS and literature samples and can be used to derive more accurate gas masses from CO(2-1) observations.</description>

      <title>A New Framework for ISM Emission Line Models: Connecting Multi-Scale Simulations Across Cosmological Volumes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The JWST and ALMA have detected emission lines from the ionized interstellar medium (ISM), including [OII], [OIII], and hydrogen Balmer series lines, in some of the first galaxies at z&gt;6. These measurements present an opportunity to better understand galaxy assembly histories and may allow important tests of state-of-the-art galaxy formation simulations. It is challenging, however, to model these lines in their proper cosmological context given the huge dynamic range in spatial scales involved. In order to meet this challenge, we introduce a novel sub-grid line emission modeling framework. The framework uses the high-z zoom-in simulation suite from the Feedback in Realistic Environments (FIRE) collaboration. The line emission signals from HII regions within each simulated FIRE galaxy are modeled using the semi-analytic HIILines code. A machine learning, Mixture Density Network, approach is then used to determine the conditional probability distribution for the line luminosity to stellar-mass ratio from the HII regions around each simulated stellar particle given its age, metallicity, and its galaxy's total stellar mass. This conditional probability distribution can then be applied to predict the line luminosities around stellar particles in lower resolution, yet larger volume cosmological simulations. As an example, we apply this approach to the Illustris-TNG simulations at z=6. The resulting predictions for the [OII], [OIII], and Balmer line luminosities as a function of star-formation rate agree well with current observations. Our predictions differ, however, from related work in the literature which lack detailed sub-grid ISM models. This highlights the importance of our multi-scale simulation modeling framework. Finally, we provide forecasts for future line luminosity function measurements from the JWST and quantify the cosmic variance in such surveys.</description>

      <title>The LBT Satellites of Nearby Galaxies Survey (LBT-SONG): The Diffuse Satellite Population of Local Volume Hosts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results of the Large Binocular Telescope Satellites Of Nearby Galaxies Survey (LBT-SONG) ``Far Sample,'' including survey completeness estimates. We find 10 satellite candidates in the inner virial regions of 13 star-forming galaxies outside the Local Group. The hosts are at distances between $\sim 5-11$ Mpc and have stellar masses in the little explored range of $\sim 5 \times 10^8 - 5\times 10^{10}~\text{M}_{\odot}$. Among the 10 satellite candidates, 3 are new discoveries in this survey. In this paper, we characterize the properties of 8 low-mass satellite candidates, including the 3 new discoveries but excluding 2 well-studied massive satellites. Of the 8 low-mass dwarfs, optical colors from the LBT imaging and measurements in the ultraviolet with GALEX suggest that 2 show signs of active star formation, and 6 are likely quenched (although some may still have H\textsc{i} gas reservoirs). Notably, we report the discovery of an ultrafaint dwarf candidate, NGC 672 dwD, with $\text{M}_{\text{V}} = -6.6$ and an estimated stellar mass of $5.6 \times 10^4 ~\text{M}_{\odot}$ if its association with the host is confirmed. It is spatially coincident with a weak detection of H\textsc{i}, with $\text{M}_{\text{HI}}/\text{M}_{\text{*}} \sim 1$. If confirmed, it would be the least luminous known ultrafaint satellite to be so gas-rich. The prevalence of quenched satellites in our sample suggests there are environmental effects at work in lower mass hosts that are similar to those at play in Milky Way-size hosts, although the preponderance of H\textsc{i} detections is at odds with the paucity of H\textsc{i} detections in Milky Way satellites. By robustly measuring our survey completeness function, we are able to compare our observational results to predictions from theory, finding good agreement with the Cold Dark Matter galaxy evolution paradigm.</description>

      <title>Dependence of Galaxy Stellar Properties on the Primordial Spin Factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a numerical discovery that the observable stellar properties of present galaxies retain significant dependences on the primordial density and tidal fields. Analyzing the galaxy catalogs from the IllustrisTNG 300-1 simulations, we first compute the primordial spin factor, $\tau$, defined as the mean degree of misalignments between the principal axes of the initial density and potential hessian tensors at the protogalactic sites. Then, we explore in the framework of Shannon's information theory if and how strongly each of six stellar properties of the present galaxies, namely the stellar sizes, ages, specific star formation rates, optical colors and metallicities, share mutual information with $\tau$, measured at $z=127$. The TNG galaxy samples are deliberately controlled to have no differences in the mass, environmental density and shear distributions and to single out net effects of $\tau$ on each of the galaxy stellar properties. In the higher stellar mass range of $M_{\star}/(h^{-1}\,M_{\odot})\ge 10^{10}$, significant amounts of mutual information with $\tau$ are exhibited by all of the six stellar properties, while in the lower range of $M_{\star}/(h^{-1}\,M_{\odot})&lt; 10^{10}$ only four of the six properties except for the specific star formation rates and colors yield significant signals of $\tau$-dependence. It is also shown that the galaxy stellar sizes, which turn out to be most robustly dependent on $\tau$ regardless of $M_{\star}$, follow a {\it bimodal} Gamma distribution, the physical implication of which is discussed.</description>

      <title>The Spatial Distribution of $\rm CH_4$ and $\rm CO_2$ Ice around Protostars IRAS 16253-2429 and IRAS 23385+6053</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin and evolution of organic molecules represent a pivotal issue in the fields of astrobiology and astrochemistry, potentially shedding light on the origins of life. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), with its exceptional sensitivity and spectral resolution, is well suitable to observe molecules such as methane ($\rm CH_4$). Our analysis focused on the distribution of $\rm CH_4$, $\rm CO_2$, $\rm H_2O$, $\rm{CH_3OH+NH_4^+}$ ice and silicate absorption dips at approximately 7.7, 15.0, 6.0, 6.7 and 10.0 micrometres in two protostars: IRAS 16253-2429 and IRAS 23385+6053. We extract the $\rm CH_4$, $\rm CO_2$, $\rm H_2O$, $\rm{CH_3OH+NH_4^+}$ ice equivalent width (EW) maps and silicate extinction maps of the two sources. Our results reveal that the spatial distribution of $\rm CH_4$ in the protostellar system IRAS 16253-2429 closely mirrors that of its $\rm CO_2$ ice, forming a surrounded distribution that encircles the central protostar. This alignment suggests a common formation mechanism and subsequent trapping within the protostellar envelope, which is consistent with the "Classical" dark-cloud chemistry with ion-molecule reaction. In contrast, the spatial distributions of various molecules in the system IRAS 23385+6053 exhibit low similarities, which may be attributed to the dynamic influences of outflows or accretion processes. These discrepancies highlight the complex interplay between physical processes and chemical evolution in protostellar environments.</description>

      <title>An "alien" called Oosterhoff dichotomy?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter we investigate the origin of the Oosterhoff dichotomy, considering recent discoveries related to several ancient merging events of external galaxies with the Milky Way (MW). In particular, we aim to clarify if the subdivision in Oosterhoff type of Galactic Globular Clusters (GGCs) and field RR Lyrae (RRLs) could be traced back to one or more ancient galaxies that merged with the MW in its past. To this purpose, we first explored the association of GGCs with the past merging events according to different literature studies. Subsequently we compiled positions, proper motions and radial velocity for 10,138 field RRLs variables from the $Gaia$ Data Release 3. To infer the distances, we adopted the $M_G$--[Fe/H] relation, with [Fe/H] values estimated through empirical relationships involving the individual periods and Fourier parameters. We then calculated the orbits and the integrals of motions (IoM) using the Python library Galpy for the whole sample. By comparing the location of the field RRLs in the energy-angular momentum diagram with that of the GGCs we assign their likely origin. Finally, we discriminate from the $Gaia$ G-band light curves the Oosterhoff type of our sample of RRL stars based on their location in the Bailey diagram. The analysis of the Bailey diagrams for Galactic RRLs stars and GGCs associated with \textit{In-Situ} vs \textit{Accreted} halo origin shows remarkable differences. The \textit{In-Situ} sample displays a wide range of metallicities with a continuous distribution and no sign of Oosterhoff dichotomy. Conversely, the \textit{Accreted} RRLs clearly shows the Oosterhoff dichotomy and a significantly smaller dispersion in metallicity. Our results suggest that the Oosterhoff dichotomy was imported into the MW by the merging events that shaped the Galaxy.</description>

      <title>The External Heating of Dust in a Homogeneous Spherical Shell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a procedure for calculating the heating of, and the infrared emission from, dust in a homogeneous spherical shell surrounded by a spherically symmetric source of radiation. The results are applicable to newly formed dust either in supernova ejecta or in the circumstellar medium that has been swept up by the expanding shock wave. They can also be applied to the heating and IR emission from dust in clumps or clouds embedded in a homogeneous radiation field.</description>

      <title>Map-level baryonification: Efficient modelling of higher-order correlations in the weak lensing and thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semi-analytic methods can generate baryon-corrected fields from N-body simulations (``baryonification'') and are rapidly becoming a ubiquitous tool in modeling structure formation on non-linear scales. We extend this formalism to consistently model the weak lensing and thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich (tSZ) fields directly on the full-sky, with an emphasis on higher-order correlations. We use the auto- and cross- $N$th-order moments, with $N \in \{2, 3, 4\}$, as a summary statistic of the lensing and tSZ fields, and show that our model can jointly fit these statistics measured in IllustrisTNG to within measurement uncertainties, for scales above $\gtrsim 1 {\rm Mpc}$ and across multiple redshifts. The model predictions change only minimally when including additional information from secondary halo properties, such as halo concentration and ellipticity. Each individual moment is dependent on halos of different mass ranges and has different sensitivities to the model parameters. A simulation-based forecast on the ULAGAM simulation suite shows that the combination of all moments, measured from current and upcoming lensing and tSZ surveys, can jointly constrain cosmology and baryons to high precision. The lensing and tSZ field are sensitive to different combinations of the baryonification parameters, with degeneracy directions that are often orthogonal, and the combination of the two fields leads to significantly better constraints on both cosmology and astrophysics. Our pipeline for map-level baryonification is publicly available at https://github.com/DhayaaAnbajagane/Baryonification.</description>

      <title>BH-BH mergers with &amp; without EM counterpart: A model for stable tertiary mass transfer in hierarchical triple systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Triple stars are prevalent within the population of observed stars. Their evolution, compared to binaries, is notably more complex, influenced by unique dynamical, tidal, and mass transfer processes. Understanding these phenomena is essential for a comprehensive insight into multistar evolution and the formation of energetic transients, including gravitational-wave mergers. Our study probes the evolution of triple star systems when the tertiary fills its Roche lobe and transfers mass to the inner binary, potentially forming GW sources with distinct properties. We develop an analytical model for hierarchical triples undergoing stable mass transfer from the tertiary. Using population synthesis simulations, we investigate triples with a Roche-lobe filling tertiary and an inner binary black hole. These systems originate from inner binaries undergoing chemically homogeneous evolution. Our analysis includes populations with metallicities of Z=0.005 and Z=0.0005, focusing on primary components with initial masses of 20 to 100 M_sun, and inner and outer orbital separations up to 40 R_sun and 10^5 R_sun, respectively. Our results show that mass transfer predominantly leads to orbital shrinkage of the inner binary, non-zero eccentricities, and expansion of the outer orbit. Among systems with CHE inner binaries, 9.5% result in mass transfer from the tertiary onto an inner BBH. We predict high formation efficiency of GW mergers, ranging from 85.1% to 100% at Z=0.005 and 100% at Z=0.0005, with short delay times. Local merger rates are projected to be between 0.69 to 1.74 Gpc^-3 yr^-1. A fraction of these BBH mergers, entering the LISA and aLIGO frequency bands, may still be accreting gas, potentially producing a strong electromagnetic counterpart. EM signals vary significantly based on model assumptions, ranging from less than 0.03% to 46.8% of all mergers if circumbinary disk formation is allowed.</description>

      <title>AxionH0graphy: hunting for ultralight dark matter with cosmographic H$_0$ bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: If ultralight boson fields exist, then vacuum misalignment populates them with nonzero relic abundance. For a broad range of particle mass $m$ the field condenses into fuzzy cores in massive galaxies. We use numerical simulations to test this idea, extending previous work (Blum and Teodori 2021) and focusing on ultralight dark matter (ULDM) that makes-up a subdominant fraction of the total dark matter density, consistent with observational constraints. Our simulations mimic galactic halos and explore different initial conditions and levels of sophistication in the modeling of the halo potential. For $m\sim10^{-25}$ eV ULDM cores act as approximate internal mass sheets in strong gravitational lensing, and could first be detected as an $H_0$ bias in cosmography: a scenario we dub AxionH0graphy. The mass sheet degeneracy is broken by finite core radius and by the dynamical displacement of cores from the halo center of mass, which introduce imaging distortions and restrict the $H_0$ bias limit of AxionH0graphy to $m\lesssim5\times10^{-25}$ eV. Cosmological simulations are called for to sharpen the predicted connection between the amplitude of ULDM galactic cores and the ULDM cosmological fraction.</description>

      <title>Buoyant crystals halt the cooling of white dwarf stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: White dwarfs are stellar remnants devoid of a nuclear energy source, gradually cooling over billions of years and eventually freezing into a solid state from the inside out. Recently, it was discovered that a population of freezing white dwarfs maintains a constant luminosity for a duration comparable to the age of the universe, signaling the presence of a powerful yet unknown energy source that inhibits the cooling. For certain core compositions, the freezing process is predicted to trigger a solid-liquid distillation mechanism, due to the solid phase being depleted in heavy impurities. The crystals thus formed are buoyant and float up, thereby displacing heavier liquid downward and releasing gravitational energy. Here we show that distillation interrupts the cooling for billions of years and explains all the observational properties of the unusual delayed population. With a steady luminosity surpassing that of some main-sequence stars, these white dwarfs defy their conventional portrayal as dead stars. Our results highlight the existence of peculiar merger remnants and have profound implications for the use of white dwarfs in dating stellar populations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.04026v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we describe the survey design for the Ultradeep NIRSpec and NIRCam ObserVations before the Epoch of Reionization (UNCOVER) Cycle 1 \JWST Treasury program, which executed its early imaging component in November 2022. The UNCOVER survey includes ultradeep ($\sim29-30\mathrm{AB}$) imaging of $\sim$45 arcmin$^2$ on and around the well-studied Abell 2744 galaxy cluster at $z=0.308$ and will follow-up ${\sim}500$ galaxies with extremely deep low-resolution spectroscopy with the NIRSpec/PRISM during the summer of 2023, with repeat visits in summer 2024. We describe the science goals, survey design, target selection, and planned data releases. We also present and characterize the depths of the first NIRCam imaging mosaic, highlighting previously unparalleled resolved and ultradeep 2-4 micron imaging of known objects in the field. The UNCOVER primary NIRCam mosaic spans 28.8 arcmin$^2$ in seven filters (F115W, F150W, F200W, F277W, F356W, F410M, F444W) and 16.8 arcmin$^2$ in our NIRISS parallel (F115W, F150W, F200W, F356W, and F444W). To maximize early community use of the Treasury data set, we publicly release full reduced mosaics of public JWST imaging including 45 arcmin$^2$ NIRCam and 17 arcmin$^2$ NIRISS mosaics on and around the Abell 2744 cluster, including the Hubble Frontier Field primary and parallel footprints.</description>

      <title>The PAU Survey: galaxy stellar population properties estimates with narrowband data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20385v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Narrowband galaxy surveys have recently gained interest as a promising method to achieve the necessary accuracy on the photometric redshift estimate of individual galaxies for stage-IV cosmological surveys. One key advantage is the ability to provide higher spectral resolution information about galaxies that should allow a more accurate and precise estimation of galaxy stellar population properties. However, the impact of adding narrow-band photometry on the stellar population properties estimate is largely unexplored. The scope of this work is two-fold: on one side, leveraging the predictive power of broad-band and narrow-band data to infer galaxy physical properties such as stellar masses, ages, star formation rates and metallicities. On the other hand, evaluating the improvement of performance in estimating galaxy properties when we use narrow-band data instead of broad-band. In this work we measure the stellar population properties of a sample of galaxies in the COSMOS field for which both narrowband and broadband data are available. In particular, we employ narrowband data from PAUS and broad-band data from CFHTLS. We use two different spectral energy distribution fitting codes to measure galaxy properties, namely CIGALE and Prospector. We find that the increased spectral resolution of narrow-band photometry does not yield a substantial improvement on constraining galaxy properties using spectral energy distribution fitting. Still we find that we obtain a more diverse distribution of metallicities and dust optical depths with cigale when employing the narrowband data. The effect is not as prominent as expected, which we relate this to the low narrowband SNR of a majority of the galaxies, the respective drawbacks of both codes as well as the coverage only in the optical regime. The measured properties are afterwards compared to the COSMOS2020 catalogue, showing good agreement.</description>

      <title>Prospects for Revealing Intermediate-Mass Black Holes in NGC 1399 using SKA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02893v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the detectability of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) within the mass range $10^2-10^5$ solar masses in the globular star clusters of NGC 1399 at a frequency of 300.00 MHz. Employing the theoretical Bondi accretion model and the empirical fundamental plane of black hole accretion, we estimate IMBH masses based on bolometric luminosity and X-ray/radio luminosities, respectively. By simulating a 3-hour observation of 77 globular cluster candidates using the Square Kilometer Array, we identify radio detection benchmarks indicative of accretion onto IMBHs. Our results show that IMBHs inside the globular star clusters located in NGC 1399 are indeed detectable, with the Bondi accretion model providing IMBH mass estimates ranging from $2.93 \times 10^{3.0\pm 0.39}$ to $7.43 \times 10^{4.0 \pm 0.39}$ solar masses, and the empirical fundamental-plane relation suggesting IMBH mass estimation with $3.41\times 10^{5.0 \pm 0.96}$ solar masses. These findings highlight the presence and detectability of IMBHs in globular clusters, offering insights into their role as precursors to supermassive black holes and enriching our understanding of black hole formation and evolution in astrophysical environments.</description>

      <title>Galaxy assembly bias in the stellar-to-halo mass relation for red central galaxies from SDSS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03004v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report evidence of galaxy assembly bias - the correlation between galaxy properties and biased secondary halo properties at fixed halo mass (M$_H$) - in the stellar-to-halo mass relation (SHMR) for red central galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. In the M$_H = 10^{11.5}-10^{13.5} h^{-1}$ M$_{\odot}$ range, central galaxy stellar mass (M$_*$) is correlated with the number density of galaxies within $10 h^{-1}$ Mpc ($\delta_{10}$), a common proxy for halo formation time. This galaxy assembly bias signal is also present when M$_H$, M$_*$, and $\delta_{10}$ are substituted with group luminosity, galaxy luminosity, and metrics of the large-scale density field. To associate differences in $\delta_{10}$ with variations in halo formation time, we fitted a model that accounts for (1) errors in the M$_H$ measured by the Tinker 2021, 2022 group catalog and (2) the level of correlation between halo formation time and M$_*$ at fixed M$_H$. Fitting of this model yields that (1) errors in M$_H$ are 0.15 dex and (2) halo formation time and M$_*$ are strongly correlated (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient ~0.85). At fixed M$_H$, variations of ~0.4 dex in M$_*$ are associated with ~1-3 Gyr variations in halo formation time and in galaxy formation time (from stellar population fitting; Oyarz\'un et al. 2022). These results are indicative that halo properties other than M$_H$ can impact central galaxy assembly.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02164v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Atacama Large Millimetre/submillimetre Array (ALMA) receivers and technical papers are cited fewer than once in every six publications. This citation shortage is impeding the development of future (sub)millimetre instruments. In an effort to facilitate the correct citations of ALMA receivers and technical papers, this memo provides a comprehensive list of papers for the scientific community. This list was produced in discussion with the scientific and instrumentalist community, based on a June 2024 survey at the European Southern Observatory workshop on the ALMA Wideband Sensitivity Upgrade, as well as with the ALMA technical staff. The authors now encourage the community to enhance their already-excellent ALMA science with the appropriate references to ensure future (sub)millimetre instrumentation can keep addressing the key questions about our Universe.</description>
