      <title>Augmenting Plane Straight-Line Graphs to Meet Parity Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a plane geometric graph $G$ on $n$ vertices, we want to augment it so that given parity constraints of the vertex degrees are met. In other words, given a subset $R$ of the vertices, we are interested in a plane geometric supergraph $G'$ such that exactly the vertices of $R$ have odd degree in $G'\setminus G$. We show that the question whether such a supergraph exists can be decided in polynomial time for two interesting cases. First, when the vertices are in convex position, we present a linear-time algorithm. Building on this insight, we solve the case when $G$ is a plane geometric path in $O(n \log n)$ time. This solves an open problem posed by Catana, Olaverri, Tejel, and Urrutia (Appl. Math. Comput. 2020).</description>

      <title>Classification of Temporal Graphs using Persistent Homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Temporal graphs effectively model dynamic systems by representing interactions as timestamped edges. However, analytical tools for temporal graphs are limited compared to static graphs. We propose a novel method for analyzing temporal graphs using Persistent Homology. Our approach leverages $\delta$-temporal motifs (recurrent subgraphs) to capture temporal dynamics %without aggregation
  . By evolving these motifs, we define the \textit{average filtration} and compute PH on the associated clique complex. This method captures both local and global temporal structures and is stable with respect to reference models. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach to the temporal graph classification task. Experiments verify the effectiveness of our approach, achieving over 92\% accuracy, with some cases reaching 100\%. Unlike existing methods that require node classes, our approach is node class free, offering flexibility for a wide range of temporal graph analysis.</description>

      <title>ParkView: Visualizing Monotone Interleavings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10728v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Merge trees are a powerful tool from topological data analysis that is frequently used to analyze scalar fields. The similarity between two merge trees can be captured by an interleaving: a pair of maps between the trees that jointly preserve ancestor relations in the trees. Interleavings can have a complex structure; visualizing them requires a sense of (drawing) order which is not inherent in this purely topological concept. However, in practice it is often desirable to introduce additional geometric constraints, which leads to variants such as labeled or monotone interleavings. Monotone interleavings respect a given order on the leaves of the merge trees and hence have the potential to be visualized in a clear and comprehensive manner.
  In this paper, we introduce ParkView: a schematic, scalable encoding for monotone interleavings. ParkView captures both maps of the interleaving using an optimal decomposition of both trees into paths and corresponding branches. We prove several structural properties of monotone interleavings, which support a sparse visual encoding using active paths and hedges that can be linked using a maximum of 6 colors for merge trees of arbitrary size. We show how to compute an optimal path-branch decomposition in linear time and illustrate ParkView on a number of real-world datasets.</description>
