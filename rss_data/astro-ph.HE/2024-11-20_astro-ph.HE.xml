      <title>A population study on the effect of metallicity on ZAMS to the merger</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiband observations of compact object sources offer a unique opportunity to explore their progenitors and enhance early multi-messenger alert. Recent analyses have indicated that metallicity significantly impacts the evolution of progenitors and the resulting compact objects. Using binary population synthesis, we investigate the formation of eccentric, inspiralling black hole binaries and black hole-neutron star binaries through the isolated binary evolution channel. We introduced a fiducial mass and metallicity relation for each ZAMS star. We model the stellar cluster of ZAMS stars by extending COSMIC's publicly available code. Our BPS code effectively accounts for the metallicity of each stellar object in the stellar cluster. In our analysis, we observed a significant increase in the number of inspiral binaries remaining in the stellar cluster. Instead of assuming a uniform metallicity for a stellar cluster, ZAMS stars within the cluster, characterized by diverse metallicity, evolve into more massive compact objects. The total mass of a single binary black hole inspiral varies from $\sim 9-86$ M$_\odot$; whereas for a black hole-neutron star system, this range becomes $\sim 6-32$ M$_\odot$. We compare the detectability of the characteristic strain against sub-Hz gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <title>Zooming-in on cluster radio relics -- I. How density fluctuations explain the Mach number discrepancy, microgauss magnetic fields, and spectral index variations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is generally accepted that radio relics are the result of synchrotron emission from shock-accelerated electrons. Current models, however, are still unable to explain several aspects of their formation. In this paper, we focus on three outstanding problems: i) Mach number estimates derived from radio data do not agree with those derived from X-ray data, ii) cooling length arguments imply a magnetic field that is at least an order of magnitude larger than the surrounding intracluster medium (ICM), and iii) spectral index variations do not agree with standard cooling models. To solve these problems, we first identify typical shock conditions in cosmological simulations, using the results to inform significantly higher resolution shock-tube simulations. We apply the cosmic ray electron spectra code CREST and the emission code CRAYON+ to these, thereby generating mock observables ab-initio. We identify that upon running into an accretion shock, merger shocks generate a shock-compressed sheet, which, in turn, runs into upstream density fluctuations in pressure equilibrium. This mechanism directly gives rise to solutions to the three problems: it creates a distribution of Mach numbers at the shock-front, which flattens cosmic ray electron spectra, thereby biasing radio-derived Mach number estimates to higher values. We show that this effect is particularly strong in weaker shocks. Secondly, the density sheet becomes Rayleigh-Taylor unstable at the contact discontinuity, causing turbulence and additional compression downstream. This amplifies the magnetic field from ICM-like conditions up to microgauss levels. We show that synchrotron-based measurements are strongly biased by the tail of the distribution here too. Finally, the same instability also breaks the common assumption that matter is advected at the post-shock velocity downstream, thus invalidating laminar-flow based cooling models.</description>

      <title>ALMA observations of the gamma-ray binary system PSR B1259-63/LS 2883 during the 2024 periastron passage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present observations of the gamma-ray binary PSR B1259-63/LS 2883 with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) at Bands 3 (97 GHz), 6 (233 GHz), and 7 (343 GHz). PSR B1259-63/LS 2883 consists of a pulsar in a highly eccentric orbit around a massive companion star, with the pulsar passing through the circumstellar disk near periastron. Our new data were obtained over several epochs, ranging from -61 to +29 days from the periastron passage in 2024. We report an increase in flux in all bands near the periastron. The significant change in Band 3 flux suggests synchrotron emission from the interaction between the pulsar wind and the stellar wind or disk. The Band 6 flux shows an increase around periastron and a transition from thermal emission from the circumstellar disk to synchrotron emission. The Band 7 observation +24 days after periastron shows a brightening, suggesting that the pulsar's passage through the disk does not result in its immediate destruction. We discuss the implications of these results for the interaction between the pulsar wind and the circumstellar disk, such as the possible disk expansion after periastron.</description>

      <title>Coincident Multimessenger Bursts from Eccentric Supermassive Binary Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supermassive binary black holes are a key target for the future Laser Interferometer Space Antenna, and excellent multi-messenger sources with gravitational waves. However, unique features of their electromagnetic emission that are needed to distinguish them from single supermassive black holes are still being established. Here, we conduct the first magnetohydrodynamic simulation of accretion onto eccentric binary black holes in full general relativity incorporating synchrotron radiation transport through their dual-jet. We show that the total accretion rate, jet Poynting luminosity, and the optically thin synchrotron emission exhibit periodicity on the binary orbital period, demonstrating explicitly, for the first time, that the binary accretion rate periodicity can be reflected in its electromagnetic signatures. Additionally, we demonstrate that during each periodic cycle eccentric binaries spend more time in a low emission state than in a high state. Furthermore, we find that the gravitational wave bursts from eccentric binaries are coincident with the bursts in their jet luminosity and synchrotron emission. We discuss how multimessenger observations of these systems can probe plasma physics in their jet.</description>

      <title>New Evidence for a Flux-independent Spectral Index of Sgr A* in the Near-infrared</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we measure the spectral index of Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) between the $H$ (1.6 $\mu$m) and $K^\prime$ (2.2 $\mu$m) broadband filters in the near-infrared (NIR), sampling over a factor $\sim 40$ in brightness, the largest range probed to date by a factor $\sim 3$. Sgr A*-NIR is highly variable, and studying the spectral index $\alpha$ (with $F_\nu \propto \nu^{\alpha}$) is essential to determine the underlying emission mechanism. For example, variations in $\alpha$ with flux may arise from shifts in the synchrotron cutoff frequency, changes in the distribution of electrons, or multiple concurrent emission mechanisms. We investigate potential variations of $\alpha_{H-K^\prime}$ with flux by analyzing 7 epochs (2005 to 2022) of Keck Observatory imaging observations from the Galactic Center Orbits Initiative (GCOI). We remove the flux contribution of known sources confused with Sgr A*-NIR, which can significantly impact color at faint flux levels. We interpolate between the interleaved $H$ and $K^\prime$ observations using Multi-Output Gaussian Processes. We introduce a flexible empirical model to quantify $\alpha$ variations and probe different scenarios. The observations are best fit by an $\alpha_{H-K^\prime} = - 0.50 \pm 0.08 _{\rm stat} \pm 0.17_{\rm sys}$ that is constant from $\sim 1$ mJy to $\sim 40$ mJy (dereddened 2 $\mu$m flux). We find no evidence for a flux-dependence of Sgr A*'s intrinsic spectral index. In particular, we rule out a model explaining NIR variability purely by shifts in the synchrotron cutoff frequency. We also constrain the presence of redder, quiescent emission from the black hole, concluding that the dereddened 2 $\mu$m flux contribution must be $\leq 0.3$ mJy at 95% confidence level.</description>

      <title>Black Hole Supernovae, their Equation of State Dependence and Ejecta Composition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent literature on core-collapse supernovae suggests that a black hole (BH) can form within $\sim 1$ s of shock revival, while still culminating in a successful supernova. We refer to these as black hole supernovae, as they are distinct from other BH formation channels in both timescale and impact on the explosion. We simulate these events self-consistently from core-collapse until $20\text{-}50$ days after collapse using three axisymmetric models of a $60$ M$_\odot$ zero-age main sequence progenitor star and investigate how the composition of the ejecta is impacted by the BH formation. We employ Skyrme-type equations of state (EOSs) and vary the uncertain nucleonic effective mass, which affects the pressure inside the proto-neutron star through the thermal part of the EOS. This results in different BH formation times and explosion energies at BH formation, yielding final explosion energies between $0.06\text{-}0.72\times 10^{51}$ erg with $21.8\text{-}23.3$ M$_\odot$ of ejecta, of which $0\text{-}0.018$ M$_\odot$ is $^{56}$Ni. Compared to expectations from 1D simulations, we find a more nuanced EOS dependence of the explosion dynamics, the mass of the BH remnant, and the elemental composition of the ejecta. We investigate why the explosions survive despite the massive overburden and link the shape of the diagnostic energy curve and character of the ejecta evolution to the progenitor structure.</description>

      <title>Constraint on the equation of state of strange quark star: Perturbative QCD along with a density-dependent bag constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the structural properties of strange quark stars (SQS) using a Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) perturbative model combined with the latest Particle Data Group dataset. Given the energy scale present in compact stars, QCD perturbation theory alone may not fully explain their structure. To account for non-perturbative contributions, we incorporate a density-dependent effective bag parameter, $B$, and derive the equation of state (EOS) for strange quark matter (SQM). We start by demonstrating the limitations of EOSs with a constant $B$ in describing massive objects with $ M_{TOV}&gt; 2M_{\odot} $. Subsequently, we show that considering $B$ as a density-dependent function significantly changes the results. Our definition of $B$ includes two parameters determined by both theoretical and observational constraints. We demonstrate that incorporating a density-dependent $B$ into the perturbative EOS can yield SQSs with masses exceeding $2M_{\odot}$, while complying with gravitational wave constraints such as tidal deformability, and thermodynamic considerations, including stability conditions and speed of sound behavior. Specifically, we show that massive compact objects like PSR J0952-0607, PSR J2215+5135, PSR J0740+6620, and the secondary mass of GW190814 can be SQSs. Additionally, we compare our EOS with the EOS of the authors who use a generalized polytropic form with adjustable parameters and obtain an interesting result.</description>

      <title>Multiwavelength Afterglow Analysis of GRB 221009A: Unveiling the Evolution of a Cooling Break in a Wind-like Medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are the most energetic explosions in the universe, and their afterglow emission provides an opportunity to probe the physics of relativistic shock waves in an extreme environment. Several key pieces for completing the picture of the GRB afterglow physics are still missing, including jet properties, emission mechanism, and particle acceleration. Here we present a study of the afterglow emission of GRB 221009A, the most energetic GRB ever observed. Using optical, X-ray, and gamma-ray data up to approximately two days after the trigger, we trace the evolution of the multi-wavelength spectrum and the physical parameters behind the emission process. The broadband spectrum is consistent with the synchrotron emission emitted by relativistic electrons with its index of $p = 2.29\pm 0.02$. We identify a break energy at keV and an exponential cutoff at GeV in the observed multi-wavelength spectrum. The break energy increases in time from $16.0_{-4.9}^{+7.1}$ keV at 0.65 days to $46.8_{-15.5}^{+25.0}$ keV at 1.68 days, favoring a stellar wind-like profile of the circumburst medium with $k=2.4\pm0.1$ as in $\rho (r) \propto r^{-k}$. The high-energy attenuation at around 0.4 to 4 GeV is attributed to the maximum of the particle acceleration in the relativistic shock wave. This study confirms that the synchrotron process can explain the multi-wavelength afterglow emission and its evolution.</description>

      <title>Investigation into Pulsar Glitch Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An updated analysis of pulsar glitch parameters was conducted using a sample of 215 pulsars, encompassing 677 recorded glitch events, each glitch at least once between 1968 and 2024. The glitch rates were estimated and plotted against various pulsar parameters, including rotational frequency, spin-down rate, and characteristic age. These relationships were analyzed using Pearson's correlation coefficient. The results indicate linear and weak relationships between glitch rate and the pulsar parameters. However, the relationship between glitch rate and characteristic age is inversely weak.</description>

      <title>New insight into the orbital parameters of the gamma-ray binary HESS J0632+057</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gamma-ray binary HESS J0632+057 consists of a Be star and an undetected compact object in a $\sim$317 day orbit. The interpretation of the emission from this system is complicated by the lack of a clear orbital solution, as two different and incompatible orbital solutions were obtained by previous radial velocity studies of this source. In order to address this, we report on 24 new observations, covering $\sim$60 per cent of the orbit which we have undertaken with the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT). We obtained new radial velocity measurements from cross-correlation of the narrower spectral features, and by fitting Voigt profiles to the wings of the Balmer emission lines. Additionally, we find an indication of orbital variability in the equivalent widths and V/R of the Balmer lines. Using the combined data from this study, as well as archival data from the earlier radial velocity studies, we have derived updated orbital solutions. Using reported H $\alpha$ emission radial velocities - previously not considered for the orbital solution - along with the new SALT data, a solution is obtained where the brighter peak in the X-ray and gamma-ray light curves is closer to periastron. However, continuing sparse coverage in the data around the expected phases of periastron indicates that the orbital solution could be improved with further observation.</description>

      <title>Fifty Years After the Discovery of the First Stellar-Mass Black Hole: A Review of Cyg X-1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Around 50 years ago, the famous bet between Stephen Hawking and Kip Thorne on whether Cyg X-1 hosts a stellar-mass black hole became a well-known story in the history of black hole science. Today, Cyg X-1 is widely recognised as hosting a stellar-mass black hole with a mass of approximately 20 solar masses. With the advancement of X-ray telescopes, Cyg X-1 has become a prime laboratory for studies in stellar evolution, accretion physics, and high-energy plasma physics. In this review, we explore the latest results from X-ray observations of Cyg X-1, focusing on its implications for black hole spin, its role in stellar evolution, the geometry of the innermost accretion regions, and the plasma physics insights derived from its X-ray emissions. This review primarily focuses on Cyg X-1; however, the underlying physics applies to other black hole X-ray binaries and, to some extent, to AGNs.</description>

      <title>Assessing Matched Filtering for Core-Collapse Supernova Gravitational-Wave Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational waves from core-collapse supernovae are a promising yet challenging target for detection due to the stochastic and complex nature of these signals. Conventional detection methods for core-collapse supernovae rely on excess energy searches because matched filtering has been hindered by the lack of well-defined waveform templates. However, numerical simulations of core-collapse supernovae have improved our understanding of the gravitational wave signals they emit, which enables us, for the first time, to construct a set of templates that closely resemble predictions from numerical simulations. In this study, we investigate the possibility of detecting gravitational waves from core-collapse supernovae using a matched-filtering methods. We construct a theoretically-informed template bank and use it to recover a core-collapse supernova signal injected into real LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA detector data. We evaluate the detection efficiency of the matched-filtering approach and how well the injected signal is reconstructed. We discuss the false alarm rate of our approach and investigate the main source of false triggers. We recover 88\% of the signals injected at a distance of 1 kpc and 50% of the signals injected at 2 kpc. For more than 50% of the recovered events, the underlying signal characteristics are reconstructed within an error of 15%. We discuss the strengths and limitations of this approach and identify areas for further improvements to advance the potential of matched filtering for supernova gravitational-wave detection. We also present the open-source Python package SynthGrav used to generate the template bank.</description>

      <title>Measuring the expansion velocities of broad-line Ic supernovae: An investigation of neglected sources of error in two popular methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The velocities of Ic-BL supernovae can be determined using two techniques (spline fitting and template fitting), sometimes resulting in different velocities for the same event. This work compares and contrasts both methods, identifying sources of error which are not accounted for by most authors and quantifying their impact on the final velocity measurement. Finally, it identifies the cause of velocity discrepancies for events measured using both methods. We quantified the impact of pre-smoothing the spectra prior to use of both methods using two well-sampled cases. To identify the source of velocity discrepancies, two cases were measured and directly compared. Additional sources of error for template fitting arise due to the choice of phase of the template spectrum ($\sim$1000 km/s) and smoothing of the input spectrum ($\sim$500 km/s). The impact of phase shifts is minimised at peak time. The spline fitting method tends to underestimate uncertainties by around 1000 km/s. This method can also be impacted by fine tuning of the smoothing parameters ($\sim$500-1000 km/s). Optimum smoothing parameters for different cases are presented along with suggestions for best practice. Direct comparison of both methods showed that velocity discrepancies are not always present, debunking the claim that the template fitting method always handles blending better than spline fitting. Spline fitting seems to struggle to handle blending only in cases where the Fe II features are superimposed on a red continuum, which biases the minimum of this feature towards the bluest line of the triplet, creating an artificially higher velocity. This situation may be relatively rare among Ic-BLs, based on typical temperature evolution. Both methods can be applied under certain circumstances with similar results. The morphology of the velocity evolution of an SN appears to be the same regardless of the method used.</description>

      <title>A Survey of General Relativistic Magnetohydrodynamic Models for Black Hole Accretion Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: General Relativistic Magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) simulations are an indispensable tool in studying accretion onto compact objects. The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) frequently uses libraries of ideal GRMHD simulations to interpret polarimetric, event-horizon-scale observations of supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies. In this work, we present a library of ten non-radiative, ideal GRMHD simulations that were utilized by the EHT Collaboration in their analysis of Sagittarius A*. The parameter survey explores both low (SANE) and high (MAD) magnetization states across five black hole spins $a_{*}=-15/16,-1/2,0,+1/2,+15/16$ where each simulation was run out to $30,000\hspace{0.1cm}\mathrm{GM/c}^{3}$. We find the angular momentum and energy flux in SANE simulations closely matches the thin-disk value, with minor deviations in prograde models due to fluid forces. This leads to spin equilibrium around $a_{*}\sim0.94$, consistent with previous studies. We study the flow of conserved quantities in our simulations and find mass, angular momentum, and energy transport in SANE accretion flows to be primarily inward and fluid-dominated. MAD models produce powerful jets with outflow efficiency $&gt;1$ for $a_{*}=+0.94$, leading to black hole spin-down in prograde cases. We observe outward directed energy and angular momentum fluxes on the horizon, as expected for the Blandford-Znajek mechanism. MAD accretion flows are sub-Keplerian and exhibit greater variability than their SANE counterpart. They are also hotter than SANE disks within $r\lesssim 10\hspace{0.1cm}\mathrm{GM/c}^{2}$. This study is accompanied by a public release of simulation data at \url{http://thz.astro.illinois.edu/}.</description>

      <title>Phenomenology of dark matter indirect detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this thesis, we present a comprehensive and pedagogical overview of dark matter (DM). Chapter 1 discusses the main evidences for its existence, its properties, and potential candidates. We then explore major detection strategies, with Chapter 2 specifically dedicated to indirect detection. In the following chapters, we study the emission of secondary photons resulting from the interaction between DM products and the Galactic environment. Chapters 3 and 4 focus on DM as sub-GeV particles, analysing how the DM-produced electrons and positrons interact with ambient photons to generate X-rays through inverse Compton scattering. Comparing the predicted spectra with data from X-ray observatories yields strong constraints on sub-GeV DM. Chapter 5 extends these techniques to the case of primordial black hole (PBH) evaporation, imposing significant limits on PBHs as potential DM candidates.</description>

      <title>A Novel Density Profile for Isothermal Cores of Dark Matter Halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel density profile for halos in self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) models, which accurately captures the flat- and isothermal-core configurations. We show analytically how our density profile satisfies these conditions, with comparisons to other contemporary functional choices. We demonstrate the versatility of our profile by putting it into the context of idealized N-body simulations and show that it provides excellent representations for both density and velocity dispersion structures of the simulation data. When an estimated fitting criterion is used to approximate the general cases, such as in cosmological simulations, the resulting regressions maintain their goodness of fit in both extremes, in the initial thermalization phase and the late core-collapse regime. Our density profile provides a framework for more detailed analyses of halos in different SIDM models while serving as the basis for reducing simulation needs and constructing initial conditions for deep core-collapse simulations.</description>

      <title>The Gravitational Wave Bias Parameter from Angular Power Spectra: Bridging Between Galaxies and Binary Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents the modeling of the gravitational wave (GW) bias parameter by bridging a connection between simulated GW sources and galaxies in low redshift galaxy surveys 2MPZ and WISExSCOS (WISC). We study this connection by creating a mock GW catalog, populating galaxy surveys with binary black holes (BBHs) for different scenarios of the GW occupation fraction (or selection function) as a function of the galaxy stellar mass. We probe the observable consequences of this connection by exploring the spatial clustering of the GW sources in terms of the GW bias parameter. We consider a phenomenological broken power law model for the selection function, with a potential turnover $M_{K}$ at high stellar mass ($10^{11}$ $M_{\odot}$ in the fiducial model) where the star formation efficiency begins to drop. We vary the parameters of the selection function and find that generically the GW bias increases as $M_{K}$ increases (and gets suppressed as $M_{K}$ decreases). The change in the GW bias parameter shows a maximum change of about $30\%$ for different scenarios explored in this work in comparison to the galaxy bias. Future measurements of the GW bias can help constrain $M_{K}$ and the slopes of the selection function and thus offer insights into the underlying astrophysical processes.</description>

      <title>Shadows of generalised Hayward spacetimes : in vacuum and with plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Hayward regular BH solution attempted to resolve the curvature singularity issue by entering the domain of non-singular spacetimes. Recently, Dutta Roy and Kar (Phys. Rev. D 106, 044028) expanded this solution to encompass a broader range of spacetimes. These spacetimes are constructed based on the Damour-Solodukhin prescription, which involves introducing different metric parameters in the $g_{tt}$ and $g_{rr}$ components of the original Hayward line element, and are characterized by two parameters ($\sigma, \kappa$). This generalization gives rise to both known and novel regular/singular BHs as well as various types of wormhole spacetimes. In this work, we explore the spacetimes that emerge for different values of ($\sigma, \kappa$) from the generalized Hayward metric, particularly focusing on their shadows in vacuum and when surrounded by plasma. Intriguingly, we observe the presence of both photon and anti-photon spheres for certain regular spacetimes. Our study highlights the differences in the shadows of different types of regular spacetime compared to those of the singular BH derived from the generalized Hayward metric and also sheds light on the impact of plasma on the shadow radius.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Space-based astronomy of hard X-rays and gamma rays covers more than seven orders of magnitude in photon energy, from 10 keV to several hundred GeV. Detecting cosmic photons in this energy range is a challenge, due to the relatively low probability of interaction of high-energy photons with matter and the high background noise generated in space detectors by environmental charged particles and radiation. However, the development of new detection technologies is constantly improving the performance of space-based X- and gamma-ray telescopes. This chapter presents the different detectors used in this field of astronomy, their configuration within space telescopes and some proposals for new instruments.</description>

      <title>Quantum van der Waals quarkyonic matter at non-zero isospin asymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the recently developed quantum van der Waals quarkyonic matter to non-zero isospin asymmetries by utilizing the two-component van der Waals equation with a generalized excluded volume prescription. The isospin dependence of van der Waals interaction parameters is determined by constraints on the symmetry energy, slope of the symmetry energy, and nuclear ground state properties. We find that the speed of sound has a peak for all values of the asymmetry parameter, signifying a transition to quarkyonic matter. The quarkyonic matter onset density is found to have a mild dependence on isospin asymmetry, with specific details influenced by the isospin dependence of the repulsive interactions. We also incorporate leptonic degrees of freedom and explore the neutron star matter equation of state, calculating mass-radius relations and tidal properties of neutron stars. We find that quarkyonic matter supports heavy neutron stars with a maximum mass of at least 2.6 solar masses. We observe quantitatively different behavior for the excluded volume cases of isospin-blind ($b_{n}=b_{pn}$) and isospin-dependent ($b_{n} \neq b_{pn}$) repulsion, the latter being preferred by observational constraints.</description>

      <title>Intermediate Mass Ratio Inspirals in Milky Way Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A consequence of a non-zero occupation fraction of massive black holes (MBHs) in dwarf galaxies is that these MBHs can become residents of larger galaxy halos via hierarchical merging and tidal stripping. Depending on the parameters of their orbits and original hosts, some of these MBHs will merge with the central supermassive black hole in the larger galaxy. We examine four cosmological zoom-in simulations of Milky Way-like galaxies to study the demographics of the black hole mergers which originate from dwarf galaxies. Approximately half of these mergers have mass ratios less than 0.04, which we categorize as intermediate mass ratio inspirals, or IMRIs. Inspiral durations range from 0.5 - 8 Gyr, depending on the compactness of the dwarf galaxy. Approximately half of the inspirals may become more circular with time, while the eccentricity of the remainder does not evolve. Overall, IMRIs in Milky Way-like galaxies are a significant class of black hole merger that can be detected by LISA, and must be prioritized for waveform modeling.</description>

      <title>Mass evolution of broad line regions to explain the luminosity variability of broad H$\alpha$ in the TDE ASASSN-14li</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this manuscript, an oversimplified model is proposed for the first time to explain the different variability trends in the observed broad H$\alpha$ emission line luminosity $L_{H\alpha}(t)$ and in the TDE model determined bolometric luminosity $L_{bol}(t)$ in the known TDE ASASSN-14li. Considering broad emission line regions (BLRs) lying into central accretion disk related to accreted materials onto central black hole in TDEs, mass evolution $M_{BLRs}(t)$ of central BLRs can be determined by the maximum mass $M_{BLRs,0}$ of central BLRs minus the corresponding accreted mass in a TDE. Meanwhile, through the simple linear dependence of Broad Balmer emission line luminosity on mass of BLRs, the mass evolution $M_{BLRs}(t)$ of central BLRs can be applied to describe the observed $L_{H\alpha}(t)$. Although the proposed model is oversimplified with only one free model parameter $M_{BLRs,0}$, the model with $M_{BLRs,0}\sim0.02{\rm M_\odot}$ can be applied to well describe the observed $L_{H\alpha}(t)$ in the TDE ASASSN-14li. Meanwhile, the oversimplified model can also be applied to roughly describe the observed $L_{H\alpha}(t)$ in the TDE ASASSN-14ae. The reasonable descriptions to the observed $L_{H\alpha}(t)$ in ASASSN-14li and ASASSN-14ae indicate the oversimplified model with only one free model parameter is probably efficient enough to describe mass evolutions of $M_{BLRs}$ related to central accreted debris in TDEs.</description>

      <title>Investigating the asymmetry of young stellar outflows: Combined MUSE-X-shooter study of the Th 28 jet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Characterising stellar jet asymmetries is key to setting robust constraints on jet launching models and improving our understanding of the underlying mechanisms behind jet launching. We aim to characterise the asymmetric properties of the bipolar jet coming from the Classical T Tauri Star Th 28. We combined data from integral field spectroscopy with VLT/MUSE and high-resolution spectra from VLT/X-shooter to map the optical emission line ratios in both jet lobes. We carried out a diagnostic analysis of these ratios to compare the density, electron temperature, and ionisation fraction within both lobes. The mass accretion rate was derived from the emission lines at the source and compared with the mass outflow rate derived for both lobes, using the estimated densities and measured [O I]6300 and [S II ]6731 luminosities. The blue-shifted jet exhibits a significantly higher electron temperature and moderately higher ionisation fraction than the red-shifted jet. In contrast to previous studies, we also estimated higher densities in the blue-shifted jet by a factor of ~2. These asymmetries are traced to within 160 au of the source in the line ratio maps. We estimate the mass accretion rate onto the central star and compare this with estimates of the mass outflow rates through each side of the jet. The emission line maps and diagnostic results suggest that the jet asymmetries originate close to the source and are likely to be intrinsic to the jet. Furthermore, the combined dataset offers access to a broad array of accretion tracers. In turn, this enables a more accurate estimation of the mass accretion rate, revealing a value of Macc that is higher by a factor &gt;350 than would otherwise be determined. Supplementary figures and tables are available via a public Zenodo repository (doi:10.5281/zenodo.13373809).</description>

      <title>Aperture correction for Beamforming in radiometric detection of ultra-high energy cosmic rays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For high-energy cosmic-ray physics, it is imperative to determine the mass and energy of the cosmic ray that initiated the air shower in the atmosphere. This information can be extracted from the longitudinal profile of the air shower. In radio-metric observations, this profile is customarily determined through an extensive fitting procedure where calculated radio intensity is fitted to data. Beamforming the measured signals offers a promising alternative to bypass the cumbersome fitting procedure and to determine the longitudinal profile directly. Finite aperture effects in beamforming hamper the resolution with which this profile can be determined. We present a comprehensive investigation of the beamforming resolution in radiometric observations of air showers. There are two, principally different, approaches possible in air-shower beamforming, one where the total beamforming intensity is determined and an alternative where the beamforming trace is cross-correlated with a known response function. The effects due to a finite aperture (size of antenna array and bandwidth) are large for both approaches. We argue that it is possible to correct for the aperture corrections using an unfolding procedure. We give an explicit expression for the folding function, the kernel. Being able to calculate the folding function allows for unfolding the finite aperture effects from the data. We show that, in a model-to-model comparison, this allows for an accurate reconstruction of the current profile as the shower develops in the atmosphere. We present also an example where we reconstruct the longitudinal current profile of a shower developing under thunderstorm conditions where the atmospheric electric fields greatly alter the orientation of the transverse current in the shower front.</description>

      <title>Using time series to identify strongly-lensed gravitational waves with deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The presence of a massive body between the Earth and a gravitational-wave source will produce the so-called gravitational lensing effect. In the case of strong lensing, it leads to the observation of multiple deformed copies of the initial wave. Machine-learning (ML) models have been proposed for identifying these copies much faster than optimal Bayesian methods, as will be needed with the detection rate of next-generation detector. Most of these ML models are based on a time-frequency representation of the data that discards the phase information. We introduce a neural network that directly uses the time series data to retain the phase, limit the pre-processing time and keep a one-dimensional input. We show that our model is more efficient than the base model used on time-frequency maps at any False Alarm Rate (FPR), up to $\sim 5$ times more for an FPR of $10^{-4}$. We also show that it is not significantly impacted by the choice of waveform model, by lensing-induced phase shifts and by reasonable errors on the merger time that induce a misalignment of the waves in the input.</description>

      <title>flashcurve: A machine-learning approach for the simple and fast generation of adaptive-binning light curves with Fermi-LAT data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gamma rays measured by the Fermi-LAT satellite tell us a lot about the processes taking place in high-energetic astrophysical objects. The fluxes coming from these objects are, however, extremely variable. Hence, gamma-ray light curves optimally use adaptive bin sizes in order to retrieve most information about the source dynamics and to combine gamma-ray observations in a multi-messenger perspective. However, standard adaptive binning approaches are slow, expensive and inaccurate in highly populated regions. Here, we present a novel, powerful, deep-learning-based approach to estimate the necessary time windows for adaptive binning light curves in Fermi-LAT data using raw photon data. The approach is shown to be fast and accurate. It can also be seen as a prototype to train machine-learning models for adaptive binning light curves for other astrophysical messengers.</description>

      <title>The NANOGrav 15 yr Data Set: Looking for Signs of Discreteness in the Gravitational-wave Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07020v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The cosmic merger history of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) is expected to produce a low-frequency gravitational wave background (GWB). Here we investigate how signs of the discrete nature of this GWB can manifest in pulsar timing arrays through excursions from, and breaks in, the expected $f_{\mathrm{GW}}^{-2/3}$ power-law of the GWB strain spectrum. To do this, we create a semi-analytic SMBHB population model, fit to NANOGrav's 15 yr GWB amplitude, and with 1,000 realizations we study the populations' characteristic strain and residual spectra. Comparing our models to the NANOGrav 15 yr spectrum, we find two interesting excursions from the power-law. The first, at $2 \; \mathrm{nHz}$, is below our GWB realizations with $p$-value significance $p = 0.05$ to $0.06$ ($\approx 1.8 \sigma - 1.9 \sigma$). The second, at $16 \; \mathrm{nHz}$, is above our GWB realizations with $p = 0.04$ to $0.15$ ($\approx 1.4 \sigma - 2.1 \sigma$). We explore the properties of a loud SMBHB which could cause such an excursion. Our simulations also show that the expected number of SMBHBs decreases by three orders of magnitude, from $\sim 10^6$ to $\sim 10^3$, between $2\; \mathrm{nHz}$ and $20 \; \mathrm{nHz}$. This causes a break in the strain spectrum as the stochasticity of the background breaks down at $26^{+28}_{-19} \; \mathrm{nHz}$, consistent with predictions pre-dating GWB measurements. The diminished GWB signal from SMBHBs at frequencies above the $26~\mathrm{nHz}$ break opens a window for PTAs to detect continuous GWs from individual SMBHBs or GWs from the early universe.</description>

      <title>Low injection rate of cosmic-ray protons in the turbulent reacceleration model of radio halos in galaxy clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13846v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A giant radio halo (RH) is a diffuse synchrotron emission observed on the scale of megaparsecs (Mpc), typically found in the central region of merging galaxy clusters. Its large size and steep spectrum suggest that it originates from the re-energization of an aged population of cosmic ray electrons (CREs), while the secondary leptons produced in the $pp$ hadronic collision of cosmic ray protons (CRPs) may contribute to the emission. In this study, we investigate the reacceleration model including both primary and secondary CREs, assuming that the primary CRs originate from internal galaxies. In our new method, we follow the cosmological evolution of each cluster and calculate the energy spectra and one-dimensional spatial distributions of CRs. The primary CRE model with $\sim 3$ Gyr duration of reacceleration successfully reproduces the statistical properties of the RHs observed in the recent LOFAR survey, as well as the spectrum and profile of the Coma cluster. The gamma-ray and neutrino emissions produced by reaccelerated CRPs are consistent with the upper limits. However, if the CRP injection rate is high and the secondary CREs become significant, the model with the required $\sim 3$ Gyr reacceleration overproduces the number of RHs. The limit on the CRP injection rate, $L_{\rm p} \lesssim 10^{41}$ erg/s, is significantly lower than that expected from the early starburst activity or jets from active galactic nuclei. This discrepancy requires a revision of either the model of CR supply from galaxies or the turbulent reacceleration model.</description>

      <title>SRGe J194401.8+284452 -- an X-ray Cataclysmic Variable in the Field of the Gamma-Ray Source 4FGL J1943.9+2841</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14136v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: SRGe J194401.8+284452 is the brightest point-like X-ray object within the position uncertainty ellipse of an unidentified $\gamma$-ray source 4FGL J1943.9+2841. We performed multi-wavelength spectral and photometric studies to determine its nature and possible association with the $\gamma$-ray source. We firmly established its optical counterpart with the Gaia based distance of about 415 pc. Our data show that the object is a cataclysmic variable with an orbital period of about 1.5 hours. SRGe J194401.8+284452 exhibits fast spontaneous transitions between the high and low luminosity states simultaneously in the optical and X-rays, remaining relatively stable between the transitions on scales of several months/years. This can be caused by an order of magnitude changes in the accretion rate. The brightness of the source is about 17 mag and 20 mag in the optical range and $5\times 10^{-12}$ and $5\times 10^{-13}$ erg/cm$^2$/s in the $0.3- 10$ keV range in the high and low states, respectively. We constrained the mass of the white dwarf ($0.3 - 0.9$ $M_\odot$) and its temperature in the low state (14750 $\pm$ 1250 K), the mass of the donor star ($\leq$ 0.08 $\pm$ 0.01 $M_ \odot$). In the low state, we detected regular optical pulsations with an amplitude of 0.2 mag and a period of 8 min. They are likely associated with the spin of the white dwarf, rather than with its non-radial pulsations. In the high state, the object demonstrates only stochastic optical brightness variations on time scales of $1 - 15$~minutes with amplitudes of $0.2 - 0.6$~mag. We conclude, that SRGe J194401.8+284452 can be classified as an intermediate polar, and its association with the $\gamma$-ray source is very unlikely.</description>

      <title>Star Log-extended eMulation: a method for efficient computation of the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10556v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We emulate the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations, including tidal deformability, for neutron stars using a novel hybrid method based upon the Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) for the first time. This new method, which we call Star Log-extended eMulation (SLM), utilizes the underlying logarithmic behavior of the differential equations to enable accurate emulation of the nonlinear system. We show predictions for well-known phenomenological equations of state (EOS) with fixed parameters and with a freely-varying parametric Quarkyonic EOS. Our results produce a significant computational speed-up of $\approx 3 \times 10^4$ compared to high fidelity (HF) calculations using standard Runge-Kutta methods, providing an efficient emulator for the numerous TOV evaluations required by multi-messenger astrophysical frameworks that infer constraints on the EOS from neutron star mergers. The ability of the SLM algorithm to learn a mapping between parameters of the EOS and subsequent neutron star properties also opens up potential extensions for assisting in computationally prohibitive uncertainty quantification (UQ) for any type of EOS. The source code for the methods developed in this work will be openly available in a public GitHub repository for community modification and use.</description>

      <title>The interacting double white dwarf population with LISA; stochastic foreground and resolved sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16867v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the impact of tidal torques and mass transfer on the population of double white dwarfs (DWDs) that will be observed with LISA. Starting from a distribution of DWDs at formation predicted by numerical simulations, we use a semi-analytical model to evolve DWDs under different hypotheses for the efficiency of tidal coupling and the birth spins of white dwarfs. We then estimate the stochastic foreground and the population of resolvable binaries for LISA in each scenario. Our predicted DWD binary distribution can differ substantially from the distribution expected if only gravitational waves (GWs) are considered. If white dwarfs spin slowly, then we predict an excess of systems around a few mHz, due to binaries that outspiral after the onset of mass transfer. This excess of systems leads to differences in the confusion noise, which are most pronounced for strong tidal coupling. In that case, we find a significantly higher number of resolvable binaries than in the GW-only scenario. If instead white dwarfs spin rapidly and tidal coupling is weak, then we find no excess around a few mHz, and the confusion noise due to DWDs is very small. In that scenario, we also predict a subpopulation of outspiralling binaries below 0.1 mHz. Using the Fisher matrix approximation, we estimate the uncertainty on the GW-frequency derivative of resolvable systems. We estimate that, even for non-accreting systems, the mismodelling error due to neglect of effects other than GWs is larger than the statistical uncertainty, and thus this neglect would lead to biased estimates for mass and distance. Our results highlight the need for flexible tools in LISA data analysis. Because our semi-analytical model hinges upon a simplistic approach to determining the stability of mass accretion it will be important to deepen our comprehension of stability in mass-transferring DWD binaries.</description>

      <title>Axion signals from neutron star populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19028v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutron stars provide a powerful probe of axion dark matter, especially in higher frequency ranges where there remain fewer laboratory constraints. Populations of neutron stars near the Galactic Centre have been proposed as a means to place strong constraints on axion dark matter. One downside of this approach is that there are very few direct observations of neutron stars in this region, introducing uncertainties in the total number of neutron stars in this ``invisible" population at the Galactic Centre, whose size must be inferred through birth rate modelling. We suggest this number could also be reduced due to stellar dynamics carrying stars away from the Galactic Centre via large kick velocities at birth. We attempt to circumvent the uncertainty on the Galactic Centre population size by modelling the axion signal from better understood populations outside the Galactic Centre using {\tt PsrPopPy} which is normalised against pulsar observations. We consider lower-frequency, wider-angle searches for this signal via a range of instruments including MeerKAT and SKA-low but find that the sensitivity is not competitive with existing constraints. Finally, returning to the Galactic Centre, we compare populations to single objects as targets for axion detection. Using the latest modelling of axion-photon conversion in the Galactic Centre magnetar, we conclude that within astrophysical uncertainties, the Galactic Centre population and the magnetar could give comparable sensitivities to axion dark matter, suggesting one should continue to search for both signals in future surveys.</description>

      <title>Transverse instability of electron-acoustic solitons in a relativistic degenerate astrophysical magnetoplasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04404v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the nonlinear theory of small-amplitude electron-acoustic solitons (EASs) in a relativistic astrophysical magnetoplasma consisting of two-temperature electrons: a sparse population of relativistic nondegenerate classical electrons and a group of fully degenerate dense relativistic electrons (main constituent) immersed in a static magnetic field with a neutralizing stationary ion background. By using the multiple-scale reductive perturbation technique with the Lorentz transformation, the Zakharov-Kuznetsov (ZK) and the modified Zakharov-Kuznetsov (mZK) equations are derived to describe the evolution of EASs in two different regimes of relativistic degeneracy: $r_{d0}&lt;50$ and $r_{d0}\gtrsim50$. The characteristics of the plane soliton solutions of ZK and mZK equations and the soliton energy are studied. We show that the solitons moving at an angle $\alpha$ to the external magnetic field can be unstable under transverse long-wavelength perturbations. The growth rates of instabilities are obtained and analyzed with the effects of the relativity parameter $\beta_{\rm{cl}}=k_BT_{\rm{cl}}/m_ec^2$ and the degeneracy parameter $r_{d0}$, where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant and $T_{\rm{cl}}$ is the temperature of classical electrons. Interestingly, the ZK solitons, even if it is stable for the first-order perturbations, can be unstable in the second-order correction. Furthermore, while the first-order growth rates of perturbations for ZK solitons tend to vanish as $\alpha\rightarrow 38^\circ$, that for the mZK soliton goes to zero as $\alpha\rightarrow 90^\circ$. However, depending on the angle $\alpha$, the growth rates are found to be reduced either by increasing the values of $\beta_{\rm{cl}}$ or by decreasing the values of $r_{d0}$. The applications of our results to astrophysical plasmas, such as those in the environments of white dwarfs are discussed.</description>

      <title>Reconciling PTA and JWST and preparing for LISA with POMPOCO: a Parametrisation Of the Massive black hole POpulation for Comparison to Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17916v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a parametrised model to describe the formation and evolution of massive black holes, designed for comparisons with both electromagnetic and gravitational wave observations. Using an extended Press-Schechter formalism, we generate dark matter halo merger trees. We then seed and evolve massive black holes through parameterised prescriptions. This approach, which avoids solving differential equations, is computationally efficient, enabling us to analyse observational data and infer the parameters of our model in a fully Bayesian framework. We find that observations of the black hole luminosity function are compatible with the nHz gravitational wave signal (likely) measured by PTAs, provided we allow for an increased luminosity function at high redshift ($4-7$), as recently suggested by JWST observations. Our model can simultaneously reproduce the bulk of the $M_*-M_{\rm BH}$ relation at $z-0$, as well as its outliers, something cosmological simulations struggle to do. The inferred model parameters are consistent with expectations from observations and more complex simulations: They favour heavier black hole seeds and short delays between halo and black hole mergers, while requiring supper-Edington accretion episodes lasting a few tens of million years, which in our model are linked to galaxy mergers. We find accretion to be suppressed in the most massive black holes below $z\simeq 2.5$, consistently with the anti-hierarchical growth hypothesis. Finally, our predictions for LISA, although fairly broad, are in agreement with previous models. Our model offers a new perspective on the apparent tensions between the black hole luminosity function and the latest JWST and PTA results. Its flexibility makes it ideal to fully exploit the potential of future gravitational wave observations of massive black hole binaries with LISA.</description>

      <title>Solar flares in the Solar Orbiter era: Short-exposure EUI/FSI observations of STIX flares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09319v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Aims: This paper aims to demonstrate the importance of short-exposure extreme ultraviolet (EUV) observations of solar flares in the study of particle acceleration, heating and energy partition in flares. This work highlights the observations now available from the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI) instrument suite on board Solar Orbiter while operating in short-exposure mode.
  Methods: A selection of noteworthy flares observed simultaneously by the Spectrometer Telescope for Imaging X-rays (STIX) and the Full Sun Imager of EUI (EUI/FSI) are detailed. New insights are highlighted and potential avenues of investigation are demonstrated, including forward-modelling the atmospheric response to a non-thermal beam of electrons using the RADYN 1D hydrodynamic code, in order to compare the predicted and observed EUV emission.
  Results: The examples given in this work demonstrate that short-exposure EUI/FSI observations are providing important diagnostics during flares. A dataset of more than 9000 flares observed by STIX (from November 2022 until December 2023) with at least one short-exposure EUI/FSI 174 \r{A} image is currently available. The observations reveal that the brightest parts of short-exposure observations consist of substructure in flaring ribbons that spatially overlap with the hard X-ray emission observed by STIX in the majority of cases. We show that these observations provide an opportunity to further constrain the electron energy flux required for flare modelling, among other potential applications.</description>
