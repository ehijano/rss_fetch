      <title>OGRePy: An Object-Oriented General Relativity Package for Python</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present OGRePy, the official Python port of the popular Mathematica tensor calculus package OGRe (Object-Oriented General Relativity) - a powerful, yet user-friendly, tool for advanced tensor calculations in mathematics and physics, especially suitable for general relativity. The Python port uses the same robust and performance-oriented algorithms as the original package, and retains its core design principles. However, its truly object-oriented interface, enabled by Python, is more intuitive and flexible than the original Mathematica implementation. It utilizes SymPy for symbolic computations and Jupyter as a notebook interface. OGRePy allows calculating arbitrary tensor formulas using any combination of addition, multiplication by scalar, trace, contraction, partial derivative, covariant derivative, and permutation of indices. Transformations of the tensor components between different index configurations and/or coordinate systems are performed seamlessly behind the scenes as needed, eliminating user error due to combining incompatible representations, and guaranteeing consistent results. In addition, the package provides facilities for easily calculating various curvature tensors and geodesic equations in multiple representations. This paper presents the main features of the package in great detail, including many examples of its use in the context of general relativity research.</description>

      <title>Signatures of Linearized Gravity in Atom Interferometers: a Simplified Computational Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a general framework for calculating the leading-order, fully-relativistic contributions to the gravitational phase shift in single-photon atom interferometers within the context of linearized gravity. We show that the atom gradiometer observable, which only depends on the atom interferometer propagation phase, can be written in terms of three distinct contributions: the Doppler phase shift, which accounts for the tidal displacement of atoms along the baseline, the Shapiro phase shift, which accounts for the delay in the arrival time of photons at atom-light interaction points, and the Einstein phase shift, which accounts for the gravitational redshift measured by the atoms. For specific atom gradiometer configurations, we derive the signal and response functions for two physically-motivated scenarios: ($i$) transient gravitational waves in the transverse-traceless gauge and, for the first time, in the proper detector frame, and ($ii$) transient massive objects sourcing weak and slow-varying Newtonian potentials. We find that the Doppler contribution of realistic Newtonian noise sources ($e.g.$, a freight truck or a piece of space debris) at proposed atom gradiometer experiments, such as AION, MAGIS and AEDGE, can exceed the shot noise level and thus affect physics searches if not properly subtracted.</description>

      <title>AI forecasting of higher-order wave modes of spinning binary black hole mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a physics-inspired transformer model that predicts the non-linear dynamics of higher-order wave modes emitted by quasi-circular, spinning, non-precessing binary black hole mergers. The model forecasts the waveform evolution from the pre-merger phase through the ringdown, starting with an input time-series spanning $ t \in [-5000\textrm{M}, -100\textrm{M}) $. The merger event, defined as the peak amplitude of waveforms that include the $l = |m| = 2$ modes, occurs at $ t = 0\textrm{M} $. The transformer then generates predictions over the time range $ t \in [-100\textrm{M}, 130\textrm{M}] $. We produced training, evaluation and test sets using the NRHybSur3dq8 model, considering a signal manifold defined by mass ratios $ q \in [1, 8] $; spin components $ s^z_{\{1,2\}} \in [-0.8, 0.8] $; modes up to $l \leq 4$, including the $(5,5)$ mode but excluding the $(4,0)$ and $(4,1)$ modes; and inclination angles $\theta \in [0, \pi]$. We trained the model on 14,440,761 waveforms, completing the training in 15 hours using 16 NVIDIA A100 GPUs in the Delta supercomputer. We used 4 H100 GPUs in the DeltaAI supercomputer to compute, within 7 hours, the overlap between ground truth and predicted waveforms using a test set of 840,000 waveforms, finding that the mean and median overlaps over the test set are 0.996 and 0.997, respectively. Additionally, we conducted interpretability studies to elucidate the waveform features utilized by our transformer model to produce accurate predictions. The scientific software used for this work is released with this manuscript.</description>

      <title>The anti-aligned spin of GW191109: glitch mitigation and its implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With a high total mass and an inferred effective spin anti-aligned with the orbital axis at the 99.9% level, GW191109 is one of the most promising candidates for a dynamical formation origin among gravitational wave events observed so far. However, the data containing GW191109 are afflicted with terrestrial noise transients, i.e., detector glitches, generated by the scattering of laser light in both LIGO detectors. We study the implications of the glitch(es) on the inferred properties and astrophysical interpretation of GW191109. Using time- and frequency-domain analysis methods, we isolate the critical data for spin inference to 35 - 40 Hz and 0.1 - 0.04 s before the merger in LIGO Livingston, directly coincident with the glitch. Using two models of glitch behavior, one tailored to slow scattered light and one more generic, we perform joint inference of the glitch and binary parameters. When the glitch is modeled as slow scattered light, the binary parameters favor anti-aligned spins, in agreement with existing interpretations. When more flexible glitch modeling based on sine-Gaussian wavelets is used instead, a bimodal aligned/anti-aligned solution emerges. The anti-aligned spin mode is correlated with a weaker inferred glitch and preferred by ~ 70 : 30 compared to the aligned spin mode and a stronger inferred glitch. We conclude that if we assume that the data are only impacted by slow scattering noise, then the anti-aligned spin inference is robust. However, the data alone cannot validate this assumption and resolve the anti-aligned spin and potentially dynamical formation history of GW191109.</description>

      <title>Strong gravitational lensing in a Kerr black hole within Quantum Einstein Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detailed study of the strong gravitational lensing of a Kerr black hole within Quantum Einstein Gravity (QEG) is performed. We calculate the photon sphere, the deflection angle of light, and observables on the equatorial plane under the strong deflection limit in a vacuum. The presence of quantum effects reduces the radius of the photon sphere, the magnification, the position of relativistic images, and the time delays on the same side of the lens. However, it increases the strong deflection angle, the separations, and the time delays on the opposite side of the lens. By modeling M87* and Sgr A* as the Kerr black hole within QEG, we find that the time delays are more significant in M87*, while other observables are more pronounced in Sgr A*. Furthermore, we consider the influence of plasma on the gravitational lensing effect. Plasma causes an additional deflection of light, increasing the magnification, images position and the time delays, but decreasing the separations. More importantly, we calculate the time delays under the strong deflection limit in the presence of plasma, and they increase with higher plasma concentrations. Our research may help to evaluate the observational imprints left by such quantum effects in the propagation of light and the impact of plasma around black holes on gravitational lensing.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave signatures and detectability of the mass transfer effect in compact binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mass transfer process is prevalent during the inspiral phase of compact binary systems. Our study focuses on systems comprising low-mass white dwarfs, particularly in neutron star-white dwarf binaries and double white dwarf binaries, where a stable mass transfer process occurs at low frequencies. By analyzing the evolution of gravitational wave frequencies in the presence of mass transfer within quasi-circular orbits, we derive an analytical expression for the time-dependent frequency across different frequency bands and the waveforms emitted by compact binaries. Considering gravitational waves emitted by compact binaries in the $1\thicksim10$ mHz band, based on the Fisher analysis, we find that the mass transfer rate can be measured as accurately as $10^{-7} M_\odot/\text{year}$ by space-based gravitational-wave detectors with a signal-to-noise ratio of the order of $10^3$. Including the mass transfer effect in the waveforms provides a new possibility to measure the individual masses of double white dwarf binaries. The relative error of measured white dwarf masses can be down to the order of $0.01$.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium of charged fluid around a Kerr black hole immersed in a magnetic field: variation of angular momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present work presents analytically constructed equilibrium structures of charged perfect fluids orbiting Kerr Black holes embedded in an asymptotically uniform magnetic field. Our focus is on the effect of the non-constant angular momentum distribution through the disk, as well as its combined effect with the external magnetic field and the fluid charge. We demonstrate that the three parameters of our study have a significant impact on the various features of the accretion disk: the shape, the size of the disk and the characteristic of the fluid, as the pressure and the rest-mass density. Through our investigation, we observe substantial deviations from both the uncharged thick disk model and the charged disk model with constant angular momentum.</description>

      <title>Formation of stable wormhole solution with non-commutative geometry in the framework of $f(R,\mathcal{L}_m, T)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04172v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research delves into the potential existence of traversable wormholes (WHs) within the framework of $f(R,\mathcal{L}_m, T)$ gravity, a modification that includes the matter Lagrangian and the trace of the energy-momentum tensor with specific coupling strengths $\alpha$ and $\beta$. A thorough examination of WH solutions is undertaken using a constant redshift function in tandem with a linear $f(R,\mathcal{L}_m, T)$ model. The analysis involves deriving WH shape functions based on non-commutative geometry, with a particular focus on Gaussian and Lorentzian matter distributions $\rho$. Constraints on the coupling parameters are developed so that the shape function satisfies both the flaring-out and asymptotic flatness conditions. Moreover, for positive coupling parameters, violating the null energy condition (NEC) at the WH throat $r_0$ demands the presence of exotic matter. For negative couplings, however, we find that exotic matter can be avoided by establishing the upper bound $\beta+\alpha/2&lt;-\frac{1}{\rho r_0^2}-8\pi$. Additionally, the effects of gravitational lensing are explored, revealing the repulsive force of our modified gravity for large negative couplings. Lastly, the stability of the derived WH solutions is verified using the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) formalism.</description>

      <title>Scalar-tensor theories of gravity from a thermodynamic viewpoint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In both general relativity and Lanczos-Lovelock theories of gravity, it has been found that the Noether charge density in any bulk region of spacetime can be interpreted as the heat content of the boundary surface. In addition, it was found that the dynamical evolution of spacetime can be interpreted as the departure from an ``equipartition" between properly defined bulk and surface degrees of freedom. We find that the same interpretations are valid for scalar-tensor theories of gravity, in which case the gravity is mediated by the metric tensor as well as by the scalar field. Moreover, these results hold in both the frames associated with the scalar-tensor theory, namely the Jordan and the Einstein frames. However, it turns out that there are two dynamically equivalent representations of the scalar-tensor theory in the Jordan frame, differing by total derivatives in the action, which are thermodynamically inequivalent. Thus thermodynamics is sensitive to various representations of scalar-tensor theories. This not only implies the robustness of the thermodynamic description of gravity beyond general relativity, but also depicts the importance of having a thermodynamic description by distinguishing various dynamically equivalent representations.</description>

      <title>The Second-Level Preheating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes two levels of preheating for the inflaton that is non-minimally coupled with gravity. The first level, later named by the quadratic regime, corresponds to the matter-dominated era and is responsible for draining the inflaton's energy density. The second level, which we will call the quartic regime, corresponds to the radiation-dominated era and is responsible for the reheating of the universe. We investigate the behavior of non-renormalizable higher dimension operators in both the quadratic and quartic regimes. In the quadratic regime, the certain order $n$ in the non-renormalizable higher-dimension operator could lead to an efficient preheating. On the other hand, the non-renormalizable higher dimension operators in the quartic regime are extremely inefficient for any order of $n$. In our work, we also introduce a mechanism controlled by the characteristic momentum $\alpha$ to suppress the particle production during preheating. Additionally, we emphasized the significance of the small momentum of the particles produced during preheating for the abundance of primordial black holes. This result favors the efficient preheating in the quadratic regime. Finally, we evaluate two modes of the reheating temperature, which differ based on the preheating efficiency during the quadratic regime.</description>

      <title>Similarity in the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner Mass from Brill and Teukolsky Initial Data Sets Beyond the Linear Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The two most common initial data for vacuum axisymmetric spacetimes are the Brill and Teukolsky gravitational waves. The subsequent numerical evolution of these data exhibits distinct properties mainly associated with the critical gravitational collapse. A possible way of understanding these differences is first to look at the linear level, where the Brill waves have a multipolar structure, while the Teukolsky waves have a quadrupolar structure. Despite being structurally distinct at the linear and nonlinear levels, we show that these gravitational wave initial data share an unexpected similarity related to the distribution of ADM mass as a function of the initial wave's amplitude. More specifically, both configurations satisfy a nonextensive relation, commonly seen in systems governed by long range interactions.</description>

      <title>Curvature of an Arbitrary Surface for Discrete Gravity and for $d=2$ Pure Simplicial Complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a computation of curvature of arbitrary two-dimensional surfaces of three-dimensional objects, which is a contribution to discrete gravity with potential applications in network geometry. We begin by linking each point of the surface in question to its four closest neighbors, forming quads. We then focus on the simplices of $d=2$, or triangles embedded in these quads, which make up a pure simplicial complex with $d=2$. This allows us to numerically compute the local metric along with zweibeins, which subsequently leads to a derivation of discrete curvature defined at every triangle or face. We provide an efficient algorithm with $\mathcal{O}(N \log{N})$ complexity that first orients two-dimensional surfaces, solves the nonlinear system of equations of the spin-connections resulting from the torsion condition, and returns the value of curvature at each face.</description>

      <title>On the Role of Muons in Binary Neutron Star Mergers: First Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we present a set of binary neutron star (BNS) merger simulations including the net muon fraction as an additional degree-of-freedom in the equation of state (EoS) and hydrodynamics evolution using the numerical-relativity code BAM. Neutrino cooling is modeled via a neutrinos leakage scheme, including in-medium corrections to the opacities and emission rates of semi-leptonic charged-current reactions. We show that, for our particular choice of baseline baryonic EoS, the presence of muons delays the gravitational collapse of the remnant compared to the case where muons are neglected. Furthermore, when muons and muon-driven neutrino reactions are considered, no gravitational collapse occurs within our simulation timespan and muons are confined in the densest portions of the remnant, while the disk is effectively colder, less protonized and de-muonized. Accordingly, ejecta properties are affected, e.g., ejecta masses are systematically smaller for the muonic setups and exhibit a larger fraction of neutron-rich, small velocity material. Overall, our results suggest that the inclusion of muons and muon-flavored neutrino reactions in the context of BNS merger simulations should not be neglected, thus representing an important step towards more realistic modelling of such systems.</description>

      <title>Microscopic entropy of static black holes in 3d Lovelock gravities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a microscopic derivation of the semi-classical entropy of static black holes in 3d Lovelock gravities, which are certain 3d Horndeski theories that were recently discovered from higher-dimensional Lovelock gravities via various methods and admit novel black hole solutions analogous to higher-dimensional ones. Assuming the ground state is described by the soliton obtained from the black hole solution by performing a double Wick rotation, we reproduce the semi-classical entropy from Cardy formula without central charges for the asymptotic growth of the number of states. We explain in detail how the mass of the soliton, which is needed in the Cardy formula, can be computed in the mini-superspace formalism.</description>

      <title>Decoherence due to Casimir effect?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Open system dynamics of an electron is studied in the presence of radiation field, confined between two parallel conducting pates. It has been suggested in previous works that the quantized zero-point modes of this field lead to finite decoherence effects, possibly due to the Casimir force. However, in this work it is shown that the off-diagonal elements of the reduced density matrix of the electron are suppressed due to the sudden switching on of the interaction with the environment, and would not be observationally relevant in typical scenarios. The work clarifies important theoretical aspects of the setup and argues that any irreversible loss of coherence, in general, should not be ascribed to vacuum fluctuations. It can only originate from emission of bremsstrahlung by the electron, due to the acceleration caused by the effective Coulomb potential of all the infinite image charges.</description>

      <title>Response of interferometers to the vacuum of quantum gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has recently been suggested that exotic quantum gravity effects could lead to large vacuum fluctuations, potentially observable with realistic detectors. Experiments are currently being built to search for these signals. Here we analyze the minimal model of quantum gravity at low energies -- the usual effective quantum field theory of gravitons -- and show that it unambiguously predicts an unobservably small variation in the measured interferometer length $\Delta L \sim \ell_{\rm pl} \sim 10^{-35}~{\rm m}$. Thus, detection of a large, gravitationally-induced length variation would signal a severe breakdown of effective quantum field theory in low energy quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Remote Hawking-Moss instanton and the Lorentzian path integral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Hawking-Moss (HM) bounce solution implies that the tunneling amplitude between vacua is uniquely determined by the vacuum energy at the initial vacuum and the top of a potential barrier, regardless of the field distance between them $\Delta \phi$. This implausible conclusion was carefully discussed in [E. J. Weinberg, Phys. Rev. Lett. 98, 251303, (2007)], and it was concluded that the conventional HM amplitude is not reliable for a transition to the top of distant local maxima (hereinafter referred to as the remote HM transition). We revisit this issue and study the impact of the quantum tunneling effect on the remote HM transition. We demonstrate that the amplitude for such a distant transition is indeed smaller than the conventional HM amplitude by employing the Lorentzian path integral in a simple setup. We consider a linear potential, which allows for analytic treatments, and evaluate the up-tunneling probability of a homogeneous scalar field in de Sitter spacetime. The Picard-Lefschetz theory is employed to identify the relevant Lefschetz thimble, representing the relevant tunneling trajectory. We then compare the resulting transition amplitude with the conventional HM amplitude. We find that when the field separation $|\Delta \phi|$ is larger, the quantum-tunneling amplitude, estimated by our Lorentzian path integral, is smaller than that of the conventional HM amplitude. This implies that the transition amplitude may be significantly suppressed if the thermal interpretation is not applicable and the quantum-tunneling effect is dominant for the remote HM transition.</description>

      <title>Primordial Bounce-Inflation Scenario to Alleviate Cosmological Tensions and Lensing Anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We put forward a primordial scenario to alleviate cosmological tensions, i.e. Hubble ($H_0$) tension and $ S_8 $ tension. Based on flat $\Lambda$CDM, the Bounce-Inflation (BI) scenario gives the results that $ H_0 = 68.60^{+0.40}_{-0.45} \, \text{km}/\text{s}/\text{Mpc}$, $ S_8 = 0.806 \pm 0.011 $ by using \texttt{Planck 2018} data sets and $ H_0 = 68.96 \pm 0.38 \, \text{km}/\text{s}/\text{Mpc}$, $ S_8 = 0.797\pm 0.010 $ by using \texttt{Planck 2018} + \texttt{SPT3G} data sets. These reduce the cosmological tensions slightly. We also take an extended $\Lambda$CDM model into account, $\Lambda$CDM (BI)+$A_L$, where $ A_L $ is the gravitational lensing amplitude. The results are $ H_0 = 69.38 \pm 0.49 \, \text{km}/\text{s}/\text{Mpc}$, $ S_8 = 0.774 \pm 0.014 $ fitted by \texttt{Planck 2018} data sets and $ H_0 = 69.49 \pm 0.45 \, \text{km}/\text{s}/\text{Mpc}$, $ S_8 = 0.771^{+0.013}_{-0.012} $ fitted by \texttt{Planck 2018} + \texttt{SPT3G} data sets, which reduce the Hubble tension to $\sim 3\sigma $ level and show no $S_8 $ tension. The $A_L \approx 1.1$ is smaller than the result of the inflation scenario with a constraint of \texttt{Planck 2018} data sets. Besides, the spectral index of the bounce-inflation scenario $ n_s $ is about $ 0.98 $, with a trend to the Harrison-Zel'dovich spectrum.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear dynamics of oscillons and transients during preheating after single field inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the single-field model, the preheating process occurs through self-resonance of inflaton field. We study the nonlinear structures generated during preheating in the $\alpha$-attractor models and monodromy models. The potentials have a power law form $\propto\left|\phi\right|^{2n}$ near the origin and a flat region away from bottom, which are consistent with current cosmological observations. The Floquet analysis shows that potential parameters in monodromy model have a significant influence on the region of resonance bands. The analytical oscillons solution for the $\alpha$-attractor T model with parameter $n=1$ is derived using the small amplitude analysis method. Besides we investigate the formation of nonlinear structures, the equation of state and the energy transfer through the (3+1) dimensional lattice simulation. We find that the symmetric T potential and the asymmetric E potential in the $\alpha$-attractor models have similar nonlinear dynamics. And the potential parameter $n$ in monodromy model significantly influences the lifetime of transients, whereas the parameter $q$ exerts minimal impact on the nonlinear dynamics.</description>

      <title>A Double-Sine-Gordon Early Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A solitonic model of the early universe is introduced by employing the Double-Sine-Gordon (DSG) potential. The model predicts the appropriate number of e-foldings ($N_e$) required for favored inflation and is an advantage for the model in addressing the flatness, horizon, and magnetic monopole problems. Compatibility of the model with observations, including the Planck $2018$ data \cite{Akrami et al. (2020)} and the Planck $2018$ data+BK$18$+BAO \cite{Ade et al. (2021)} paves the way to estimate the model's free parameters. The results generate acceptable and proper values for the spectral index ($n_s$) and the tensor-to-scalar ratio ($r$) in agreement with the Planck $2018$ data \cite{Akrami et al. (2020)} and the Planck $2018$ data+BK$18$+BAO \cite{Ade et al. (2021)}. Correspondingly, a consistent description of the reheating era is obtained, yielding positive reheating number of e-foldings ($N_{\mathrm{reh}}$) and reheating final temperature ($T_{\mathrm{reh}}$) from $10^{-2}$ GeV to $10^{16}$ GeV. Overall, the model seems viable at the inflationary and reheating eras.</description>

      <title>Dual balanced readout for scattered light noise mitigation in Michelson interferometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ground-based gravitational wave detectors use laser interferometry to detect the minuscule distance change between test masses caused by gravitational waves. Stray light that scatters back into the interferometer causes transient signals that can cover the same frequency range as a potential gravitational wave signal. Scattered light noise is a potentially limiting factor in current and future detectors thus making it relevant to find new ways to mitigate it. Here, we demonstrate experimentally a technique for the subtraction of scattered light noise from the displacement readout of a Michelson interferometer. It is based on using a balanced homodyne detector at both the symmetric and the antisymmetric port. While we have been able to demonstrate a noise reduction of \SI{13.2}{\decibel}, the readout scheme seems to be only limited by the associated noise couplings, with no theoretical limit to the scattered light suppression itself other than shot noise. We also discuss challenges for using the dual balanced homodyne detection scheme in more complex interferometer topologies, which could lead to improvements in scattered light noise mitigation of gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <title>A Snapshot of Relativistic Motion: Visualizing the Terrell Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an experimental visualization of the Terrell effect, an optical phenomenon predicted in 1959 by Roger Penrose and James Terrell, which reveals that the Lorentz contraction of a moving object is not visible in a snapshot photograph. Using fs-laser pulses and a gated intensified camera that allows gating times as short as 300 ps, we achieve a virtual reduction of the speed of light to less than 2 m/s, enabling the visualisation of relativistically moving objects in real time. By capturing light reflected from deliberately Lorentz-contracted objects, our setup effectively reconstructs their visual appearance. This didactic visualization not only commemorates the centennial of Anton Lampa's seminal 1924 paper on relativistic length contraction but also provides the first experimental evidence of the Terrell effect in a laboratory setup. Our results comprise detailed relativistic illustrations, simulations and photographic snapshots of a sphere and a cube, which are animated to velocities close to the speed of light, revealing the apparent rotation effect and the distortion predicted by relativistic theory.</description>

      <title>Memory burden effect mimics reheating signatures on SGWB from ultra-low mass PBH domination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultra-low mass primordial black holes (PBH), briefly dominating the expansion of the universe, would leave detectable imprints in the secondary stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB). Such a scenario leads to a characteristic doubly peaked spectrum of SGWB and strongly depends on the Hawking evaporation of such light PBHs. However, these observable signatures are significantly altered if the memory burden effect during the evaporation of PBHs is taken into account. We show that for the SGWB induced by PBH density fluctuations, the memory burden effects on the Hawking evaporation of ultra-low mass PBHs can mimic the signal arising due to the non-standard reheating epoch before PBH domination. Finally, we point out that this degeneracy can be broken by the simultaneous detection of the first peak in the SGWB, which is typically induced by the inflationary adiabatic perturbations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17626v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most approaches towards a quantum theory of gravitation indicate the existence of a minimal length scale of the order of the Planck length. Quantum mechanical models incorporating such an intrinsic length scale call for a deformation of Heisenberg's algebra resulting in a generalized uncertainty principle and constitute what is called gravitational quantum mechanics. Utilizing the position representation of this deformed algebra, we study various models of gravitational quantum mechanics. The free time evolution of a Gaussian wave packet is investigated as well as the spectral properties of a particle bound by an external attractive potential. Here the cases of a box with infinite walls and an attractive potential well of finite depth are considered.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02353v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present work, we analyzed the Kantowski-Sachs cosmological model along with teleparallel gravity, where a bulk viscous fluid containing one-dimensional cosmic strings serves as the source for the energy$-$momentum tensor. To obtain the deterministic solution of the field equations, we employed the proportionality condition linking the shear scalar $(\sigma)$ and the expansion scalar $(\theta)$, establishing a relationship between metric potentials. Another approach employed is the utilization of the hybrid expansion law (HEL). The discussion focuses on the behavior of the accelerating universe concerning the specific choice of a nonlinear (or power law model) of teleparallel gravity $f(T)=\alpha T + \beta T^m$, where
  $T$ is the torsion scalar, $\alpha$ , and $\beta$ are model parameters and $m$ is restricted to greater than or equal to 2. The effective equation of the state parameter $(\omega_{eff})$ of models support the acceleration of the universe. We observed that the null energy condition and weak energy condition are obeyed but violate the strong energy condition as per the present accelerating expansion. Under specific model parameter constraints, the universe shows a transition from a decelerating to an accelerating phase.</description>

Abstract: In quantum cosmology, it is expected that the Big Bang singularity is resolved and the universe undergoes a bounce. We find that for Gaussian initial states, matter-gravity entanglement entropy rises rapidly during the bounce, declines, and then approaches a steady-state value following the bounce. These observations suggest that matter-gravity entanglement is a feature of the macroscopic universe and that there is no Second Law of entanglement entropy.</description>

Abstract: After initial tests performed during previous observing runs, a Newtonian Calibrator (NCal) system was developed and installed on the Virgo gravitational wave detector for the O4 observing run. This system, which is continuously operated, provides the absolute calibration of Virgo for this run. Its $1\mbox{-}\sigma$ uncertainty of $0.17\%$ on the amplitudes of the injected signals is better than that obtained with other calibration techniques like the photon calibrator (PCal). This paper presents this NCal system and details the different sources of uncertainties</description>

Abstract: We investigate future singularities originating from the anisotropy in the Universe. We formulate a new class of singularities in the homogeneous and anisotropic universe, comparing them with the known singularities in the homogeneous and isotropic universe. We also discuss the physical consequences of the new singularities. Moreover, we develop a novel reconstruction method for the anisotropic universe by introducing four scalar fields to reconstruct cosmological models in which future singularities appear. We present an explicit example where the anisotropy may grow in the future up to singularity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02908v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Measuring accurate long-duration gravitational waves from extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs) could provide scientifically fruitful knowledge of massive black hole populations and robust tests for general relatively during the LISA mission. However, the immense computational requirements surrounding EMRI data processing and analysis makes their detection and analysis challenging. We further develop and explore a sparse dictionary learning (SDL) algorithm to expeditiously reconstruct EMRI gravitational waveforms lasting as long as 1 year. A suite of year-long EMRI systems are studied to understand the detection and accurate waveform retrieval prospects of the method. We show that full-year EMRIs can be reconstructed within 2 minutes, some with a false alarm rate less than 0.001/yr and with 1.16 day time windows with mismatch as low as 0.06. This provides an encouraging prospect to use the SDL method for long-duration GW searches like that for EMRIs in this study.</description>

      <title>Baumgarte-Shapiro-Shibata-Nakamura formalism in cylindrical coordinates: Brill and Teukolsky waves in both linear and nonlinear regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01527v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we present a numerical code, based on the collocation or pseudospectal method, which integrates the equations of the BSSN formalism in cylindrical coordinates. In order to validate the code, we carried out a series of tests, using three groups of initial data: i) pure gauge evolution; ii) Teukolsky quadrupole solution for low amplitudes and iii) Brill and Teukolsky solutions with higher amplitudes, which accounts for a deviation from the linear regime when compared to the case of low amplitudes. In practically all cases, violations of the Hamiltonian and momentum constraints were analyzed. We also analyze the behavior of the lapse function, which can characterize the collapse of gravitational waves into black holes. Furthermore, all three groups of tests used different computational mesh resolutions and different gauge choices, thus providing a general scan of most of the numerical solutions adopted.</description>

      <title>Mean-Motion Resonances With Interfering Density Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15694v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the dynamics of two less massive objects moving around a central massive object, which are all embedded within a thin accretion disc. In addition to the gravitational interaction between these objects, the disc-object interaction is also crucial for describing the long-term dynamics of the multi-body system, especially in the regime of mean-motion resonances. We point out that near the resonance the density waves generated by the two moving objects generally coherently interfere with each other, giving rise to extra angular momentum fluxes. The resulting backreaction on the objects is derived within the thin-disc scenario, which explicitly depends on the resonant angle and sensitively depends on the smoothing scheme used in the two-dimensional theory. We have performed hydrodynamical simulations with planets embedded within a thin accretion disc and have found qualitatively agreement on the signatures of interfering density waves by measuring the torques on the embedded objects, for the cases of $2:1$ and $3:2$ resonance. By including in interference torque and the migration torques in the evolution of a pair of planets, we show that the chance of resonance trapping depends on the sign of the interference torque. For negative interference torques the pairs are more likely located at off-resonance regimes. The negative interference torques may also explain the $1\%-2\%$ offset (for the period ratios) from the exact resonance values as observed in {\it Kepler} multi-planet systems.</description>

      <title>Generalized cold-atom simulators for vacuum decay</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.02156v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cold-atom analog experiments are a promising new tool for studying relativistic vacuum decay, enabling one to empirically probe early-Universe theories in the laboratory. However, existing proposals place stringent requirements on the atomic scattering lengths that are challenging to realize experimentally. Here we eliminate these restrictions and show that any stable mixture between two states of a bosonic isotope can be used as a faithful relativistic analog. This greatly expands the landscape of suitable experiments, and will expedite efforts to study vacuum decay with cold atoms.</description>

      <title>Linear polarization of the stochastic gravitational-wave background with pulsar timing arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03056v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pulsar-timing collaborations have recently reported evidence for the detection of an isotropic stochastic gravitational-wave background consistent with one sourced by a population of inspiralling supermassive black hole binaries. However, a certain degree of anisotropy and polarization may be present. Thus, the characterization of the energy density and polarization of the background at different angular scales is important. In this paper, we describe the signatures of linear polarization in the stochastic gravitational-wave background on the timing residuals obtained with pulsar-timing arrays. We expand the linear polarization map in terms of spin-weighted spherical harmonics and recast it into the $E$-mode (parity even) and $B$-mode (parity odd) basis. We provide expressions for the minimum-variance estimators for the coefficients of that expansion and evaluate the smallest detectable signal as a function of the signal-to-noise ratio with which the isotropic GW signal is detected and the number of pulsars in the survey. We evaluate the covariance between the estimators for the spherical-harmonic coefficients of the linear polarization $E$-modes and those for the intensity anisotropy. We also show that there is no covariance between the spherical-harmonic coefficients for the $B$-modes of the linear polarization and those for the circular polarization, even though both have the same parity. Our approach results in simple, elegant, and easily evaluated expressions for the overlap reduction functions for linear polarization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04388v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves are a unique probe of the early Universe, as the Universe is transparent to gravitational radiation right back to the end of inflation. In this article, we summarise detection prospects and the wide scope of primordial events that could lead to a detectable stochastic gravitational wave background. Any such background would shed light on what lies beyond the Standard Model, sometimes at remarkably high scales. We overview the range of strategies for detecting a stochastic gravitational wave background before delving deep into three major primordial events that can source such a background. Finally, we summarize the landscape of other sources of primordial backgrounds.</description>

      <title>Probing orbits of stellar mass objects deep in galactic nuclei with quasi-periodic eruptions -- II: population analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06429v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are intense repeating soft X-ray bursts with recurrence times about a few hours to a few weeks from galactic nuclei. Though the debates on the origin of QPEs have not completely settled down, more and more analyses favor the interpretation that QPEs are the result of collisions between a stellar mass object (a stellar mass black hole or a main sequence star) and an accretion disk around a supermassive black hole (SMBH) in galactic nuclei. If this interpretation is correct, QPEs will be invaluable in probing the orbits of stellar mass objects in the vicinity of SMBHs, and further inferring the formation of extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs), one of the major targets of spaceborne gravitational wave missions. In this work, we extended the EMRI orbital analysis in Paper I arXiv:2401.11190 to all the known QPE sources with more than $6$ flares observed. Among all the analyzed 5 QPE sources, two distinct EMRI populations are identified: 4 EMRIs are of low orbital eccentricity (consistent with 0) which should be born in the wet EMRI formation channel, and 1 mildly eccentric EMRI (with $e= 0.25^{+0.18}_{-0.20}$ at 2-$\sigma$ confidence level) is consistent with the predictions of both the dry loss-cone formation channel and the Hills mechanism.</description>

      <title>CMB Implications of Multi-field Axio-dilaton Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10820v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Axio-dilaton models are among the simplest scalar-tensor theories that contain the two-derivative interactions that naturally compete at low energies with the two-derivative inter-actions of General Relativity. Such models are well-motivated as the low energy fields arising from string theory compactification. We summarize these motivations and compute their cosmological evolution, in which the dilaton acts as dark energy and its evolution provides a framework for dynamically evolving particle masses. The derivative axion-dilaton couplings play an important role in the success of these cosmologies. We derive the equations for fluctuations needed to study their implications for the CMB anisotropy, matter spectra and structure growth. We use a modified Boltzmann code to study in detail four benchmark parameter choices, including the vanilla Yoga model, and identify couplings that give viable cosmologies, including some with surprisingly large matter-scalar interactions. The axion has negligible potential for most of the cosmologies we consider but we also examine a simplified model for which the axion potential plays a role, using axion-matter couplings motivated by phenomenological screening considerations. We find such choices can also lead to viable cosmologies.</description>

      <title>Simulating the Galactic population of axion clouds around stellar-origin black holes: Gravitational wave signals in the 10-100 kHz band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03714v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultralight scalar fields can experience runaway `superradiant' amplification near spinning black holes, resulting in a macroscopic `axion cloud' which slowly dissipates via continuous monochromatic gravitational waves. For a particular range of boson masses, $\mathcal{O}(10^{-11}$ -- $10^{-10})$ eV, an axion cloud will radiate in the $10$ -- $100$ kHz band of the Levitated Sensor Detector (LSD). Using fiducial models of the mass, spin, and age distributions of stellar-origin black holes, we simulate the present-day Milky Way population of these hypothetical objects. As a first step towards assessing the LSD's sensitivity to the resultant ensemble of GW signals, we compute the corresponding signal-to-noise ratios which build up over a nominal integration time of $10^{7}$ s, assuming the projected sensitivity of the $1$-m LSD prototype currently under construction, as well as for future $10$-m and $100$-m concepts. For a $100$-m cryogenic instrument, hundreds of resolvable signals could be expected if the boson mass $\mu$ is around $3\times10^{-11}$ eV, and this number diminishes with increasing $\mu$ up to $\approx 5.5\times10^{-11}$ eV. The much larger population of unresolved sources will produce a confusion foreground which could be detectable by a $10$-m instrument if $\mu \in (3-4.5)\times10^{-11}$ eV, or by a $100$-m instrument if $\mu \in (3-6)\times10^{-11}$ eV.</description>
