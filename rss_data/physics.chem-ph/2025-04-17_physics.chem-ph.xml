      <title>Combining the Maximum Overlap Method with Multiwavelets for Core-Ionisation Energy Calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a protocol for computing core-ionisation energies for molecules, which is essential for reproducing X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy experiments. The electronic structure of both the ground state and the core-ionised states are computed using Multiwavelets and Density-Functional Theory, where the core ionisation energies are computed by virtue of the $\Delta$SCF method. To avoid the collapse of the core-hole state or its delocalisation, we make use of the Maximum Overlap Method, which provides a constraint on the orbital occupation. Combining Multiwavelets with the Maximum Overlap Method allows for the first time an all-electron calculation of core-ionisation energies with Multiwavelets, avoiding known issues connected to the use of Atomic Orbitals (slow convergence with respect to the basis set limit, numerical instabilities of core-hole states for large systems). We show that our results are consistent with previous Multiwavelet calculations which made use of pseudopotentials, and are generally more precise than corresponding Atomic Orbital calculations. We analyse the results in terms of precision compared to both Atomic Orbital calculations and Multiwavelets+pseudopotentials calculations. Moreover, we demonstrate how the protocol can be applied to target molecules of relatively large size. Both closed-shell and open-shell methods have been implemented.</description>

      <title>Separating orders of response in transient absorption and coherent multi-dimensional spectroscopy by intensity variation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interpretation of time-resolved spectroscopies such as transient absorption (TA) or two-dimensional (2D) spectroscopy often relies on the perturbative description of light-matter interaction. In many cases the third order of nonlinear response is the leading and desired term. When pulse amplitudes are high, higher orders of light-matter interaction can both distort lineshapes and dynamics and provide valuable information. Here, we present a general procedure to separately measure the nonlinear response orders in both TA and 2D spectroscopies, using linear combinations of intensity-dependent spectra. We analyze the residual contamination and random errors and show how to choose optimal intensities to minimize the total error in the extracted orders. For an experimental demonstration, we separate the nonlinear orders in the 2D electronic spectroscopy of squaraine polymers up to 11$^{th}$ order.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Battery Capacity Estimation in Data-Limited Scenarios through Swarm Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data-driven methods have shown potential in electric-vehicle battery management tasks such as capacity estimation, but their deployment is bottlenecked by poor performance in data-limited scenarios. Sharing battery data among algorithm developers can enable accurate and generalizable data-driven models. However, an effective battery management framework that simultaneously ensures data privacy and fault tolerance is still lacking. This paper proposes a swarm battery management system that unites a decentralized swarm learning (SL) framework and credibility weight-based model merging mechanism to enhance battery capacity estimation in data-limited scenarios while ensuring data privacy and security. The effectiveness of the SL framework is validated on a dataset comprising 66 commercial LiNiCoAlO2 cells cycled under various operating conditions. Specifically, the capacity estimation performance is validated in four cases, including data-balanced, volume-biased, feature-biased, and quality-biased scenarios. Our results show that SL can enhance the estimation accuracy in all data-limited cases and achieve a similar level of accuracy with central learning where large amounts of data are available.</description>

      <title>ChemKANs for Combustion Chemistry Modeling and Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient chemical kinetic model inference and application for combustion problems is challenging due to large ODE systems and wideley separated time scales. Machine learning techniques have been proposed to streamline these models, though strong nonlinearity and numerical stiffness combined with noisy data sources makes their application challenging. The recently developed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) and KAN ordinary differential equations (KAN-ODEs) have been demonstrated as powerful tools for scientific applications thanks to their rapid neural scaling, improved interpretability, and smooth activation functions. Here, we develop ChemKANs by augmenting the KAN-ODE framework with physical knowledge of the flow of information through the relevant kinetic and thermodynamic laws, as well as an elemental conservation loss term. This novel framework encodes strong inductive bias that enables streamlined training and higher accuracy predictions, while facilitating parameter sparsity through full sharing of information across all inputs and outputs. In a model inference investigation, we find that ChemKANs exhibit no overfitting or model degradation when tasked with extracting predictive models from data that is both sparse and noisy, a task that a standard DeepONet struggles to accomplish. Next, we find that a remarkably parameter-lean ChemKAN (only 344 parameters) can accurately represent hydrogen combustion chemistry, providing a 2x acceleration over the detailed chemistry in a solver that is generalizable to larger-scale turbulent flow simulations. These demonstrations indicate potential for ChemKANs in combustion physics and chemical kinetics, and demonstrate the scalability of generic KAN-ODEs in significantly larger and more numerically challenging problems than previously studied.</description>

      <title>Superfluorescent upconversion nanoparticles as an emerging second generation quantum technology material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12891v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superfluorescence (SF) in lanthanide doped upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) is a room-temperature quantum phenomenon, first discovered in 2022. In a SF process, the many emissive lanthanide ions within a single UCNP are coherently coupled by an ultra-short (ns or fs) high-power excitation laser pulse. This leads to a superposition of excited emissive states which decrease the emissive lifetime of the UCNP by a factor proportional to the square of the number of lanthanide ions which are coherently coupled. This results in a dramatic decrease in UCNP emission lifetime from the microsecond regime to the nanosecond regime. Thus SF offers a tantalizing prospect to achieving superior upconversion photon flux in upconversion materials, with potential applications such as imaging and sensing. This perspective article contextualizes how SF-UCNPs can be regarded as a second generation quantum technology, and notes several challenges, opportunities, and open questions for the development of SF-UCNPs.</description>
