      <title>Comparison of Structure Preserving Schemes for the Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes Equations with Degenerate Mobility and Adaptive Mesh Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes (CHNS) system utilizes a diffusive phase-field for interface tracking of multi-phase fluid flows. Recently structure preserving methods for CHNS have moved into focus to construct numerical schemes that, for example, are mass conservative or obey initial bounds of the phase-field variable. In this work decoupled implicit-explicit formulations based on the Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methodology are considered and compared to existing schemes from the literature.
  For the fluid flow a standard continuous Galerkin approach is applied. An adaptive conforming grid is utilized to further draw computational focus on the interface regions, while coarser meshes are utilized around pure phases. All presented methods are compared against each other in terms of bound preservation, mass conservation, and energy dissipation for different examples found in the literature, including a classical rising droplet problem.</description>

      <title>cmaes: A Simple yet Practical Python Library for CMA-ES</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01373v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES) has been highly effective in black-box continuous optimization, as demonstrated by its success in both benchmark problems and various real-world applications. To address the need for an accessible and powerful tool in this domain, we developed cmaes, a simple and practical Python library for CMA-ES. cmaes is characterized by its simplicity, offering intuitive use and high code readability. This makes it suitable for quick use of CMA-ES, as well as for educational purposes and seamless integration into other libraries. Despite its simple design, cmaes maintains advanced functionality. It incorporates recent advancements in CMA-ES, such as learning rate adaptation for challenging scenarios, transfer learning, mixed-variable optimization, and multi-objective optimization capabilities. These advanced features are accessible through a user-friendly API, ensuring that cmaes can be easily adopted in practical applications. We present cmaes as a strong candidate for a practical Python CMA-ES library aimed at practitioners. The software is available under the MIT license at https://github.com/CyberAgentAILab/cmaes.</description>
