      <title>Graph-based method for constructing consensus trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A consensus tree is a phylogenetic tree that synthesizes a given collection of phylogenetic trees, all of which share the same leaf labels but may have different topologies, typically obtained through bootstrapping. Our research focuses on creating a consensus tree from a collection of phylogenetic trees, each detailed with branch-length data. We integrate branch lengths into the consensus to encapsulate the progression rate of genetic mutations. However, traditional consensus trees, such as the strict consensus tree, primarily focus on the topological structure of these trees, often neglecting the informative value of branch lengths. This oversight disregards a crucial aspect of evolutionary study and highlights a notable gap in traditional phylogenetic approaches. In this paper, we extend \textit{PrimConsTree}\footnote{A preliminary version of this article was presented at \emph{the Fifteenth International Conference on Bioscience, Biochemistry, and Bioinformatics (ICBBB~2025)}~(reference~\cite{torquet2005icbbb}).}, a graph-based method for constructing consensus trees. This algorithm incorporates topological information, edge frequency, clade frequency, and branch length to construct a more robust and comprehensive consensus tree. Our adaptation of the well-known Prim algorithm efficiently identifies the maximum frequency branch and maximum frequency nodes to build the optimal consensus tree. This strategy was pre-processed with clustering steps to calibrate the robustness and accuracy of the consensus tree.\\ \textbf{Availability and implementation:} The source code of PrimConsTree is freely available on GitHub at https://github.com/tahiri-lab/PrimConsTree.</description>

      <title>Hierarchy Entropy Degeneration Explains the Rat Utopia Population Collapse: The Role of Full Visibility and Isolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Calhoun's Rat Utopia experiments demonstrated a puzzling population trajectory: initial growth, plateau, and eventually a total collapse of the rat population despite abundant resources. This paper proposes a hypothesis that the enclosure's design enabled full visibility of the social hierarchy (pecking order), leading to entropy degeneration: progressive loss of uncertainty in rats' perceived ranks over generations. High initial uncertainty drives engagement in dominance, reproduction, and care; as visibility solidifies the hierarchy over the generations, uncertainty vanishes, nullifying perceived gains from social activities. Simulations reproduce the experimental arc which rely on a game theoretic matrix that is parameterized by the uncertainty (entropy) in the hierarchy which changes over rat generations.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the direct and indirect impact of COVID-19 vaccination: evidence from Victoria, Australia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vaccines not only directly protect vaccinated individuals but also contribute to protect the entire population via indirect herd-immunity benefits. However, researchers have long struggled to quantify these indirect effects at the population level, hindering assessment of vaccination program effectiveness. We developed a new method to estimate these effects, thereby markedly improving measures of the number of infections, hospitalizations, and deaths averted by vaccination. Our population-based analysis of 6,440,000 residents of Victoria, Australia reveal strong indirect effects during the Delta outbreak (September-November 2021). By modelling a non-vaccination counterfactual, we conservatively estimate 316,000 infections were averted (95\% BCI: 232k-406k), as well as 33,500 hospitalizations (95\% BCI: 22.2k-46.2k), and 4,900 deaths (95\% BCI: 2.9k-7.3k). These are 4.0, 7.5, and 8.0 times higher, respectively, than observed. Half of the averted infections and around one-quarter of hospitalizations and deaths were attributable to indirect protection. Homogeneous vaccination across LGAs could have reduced outcomes by approximately 25\%.</description>

      <title>Drivers of periodicity in population dynamic models of long-lived, large mammals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Population cycles are important components of many natural systems. Most studied in short-lived and small-bodied species, cycles frequently appear to be driven by density-dependent feedbacks. However, compelling evidence of cycles -- often more qualitative than quantitative -- also exists in large mammals. Among ungulates, both density-dependent vital rates and 'cohort effects' (lasting impacts of birth conditions on fecundity and survival) exist, but the implications of such feedbacks for oscillatory population dynamics have not been explored. Here, we present a synthetic model of ungulate population dynamics, parameterized for barren-ground caribou (Rangifer tarandus groenlandicus) and motivated by extensive Indigenous knowledge suggesting decades-long fluctuations in abundance. Caribou herds are theorized to be subject to both cohort effects and density dependence, and we linked these endogenous factors with environmental stochasticity to understand cycling. Using wavelet analysis, we characterized periodic phenomena and performed sensitivity analyses to clarify the drivers and characteristics of population cycles. We found that cohort effects, predominantly those impacting survival, can produce long-period oscillatory behavior across a wide range of environments and demographic structures. Our modeling framework is generalizable to other long-lived, large-bodied species with complex demography, and collectively, these efforts broaden the scope of inquiry into proximal drivers of population cycling.</description>

      <title>Coordinating cooperation in stag-hunt game: Emergence of evolutionarily stable procedural rationality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Humans are bounded rational at best and this, we argue, has worked in their favour in the hunter-gatherer society where emergence of a coordinated action, leading to cooperation, is otherwise the standard stag-hunt dilemma (when individuals are rational). In line with the fact the humans strive for developing self-reputation by having less propensity to cheat than to be cheated, we observe that the payoff structure of the stag-hunt game appropriately modifies to that of coordination-II game. Subsequently, within the paradigm of evolutionary game theory, we establish that a population -- consisting of procedural rational players (a type of bounded rationality) -- is unequivocally evolutionarily stable against emergence of more rational strategies in coordination-II game. The cooperation is, thus, shown to have been established by evolutionary forces picking less rational individuals.</description>

      <title>Non-participant externalities reshape the evolution of altruistic punishment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While voluntary participation is a key mechanism that enables altruistic punishment to emerge, its explanatory power typically rests on the common assumption that non-participants have no impact on the public good. Yet, given the decentralized nature of voluntary participation, opting out does not necessarily preclude individuals from influencing the public good. Here, we revisit the role of voluntary participation by allowing non-participants to exert either positive or negative impacts on the public good. Using evolutionary analysis in a well-mixed finite population, we find that positive externalities from non-participants lower the synergy threshold required for altruistic punishment to dominate. In contrast, negative externalities raise this threshold, making altruistic punishment harder to sustain. Notably, when non-participants have positive impacts, altruistic punishment thrives only if non-participation is incentivized, whereas under negative impacts, it can persist even when non-participation is discouraged. Our findings reveal that efforts to promote altruistic punishment must account for the active role of non-participants, whose influence can make or break collective outcomes.</description>

      <title>Identifiability of linear stochastic state-space models with application to ecology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: State-space models are dynamical systems defined by a latent and an observed process. In ecology, stochastic state-space models in discrete time are most often used to describe the imperfectly observed dynamics of population sizes or animal movement. However, several studies have observed identifiability issues when state-space models are fitted to simulated or real data, and it is not currently clear whether those are due to data limitations or more fundamental model non-identifiability. To investigate such theoretical identifiability, a suitable exhaustive summary is required, defined as a vector of parameter combinations which fully determines the model. Previous work on exhaustive summaries has used expectations of the stochastic process, so that noise parameters are unaccounted for. In this paper, we build an exhaustive summary using the spectral density of the observed process, which fully accounts for all mean and variance parameters. This diagnostic is applied to contrasted ecological models and we show that they are generally theoretically identifiable, unless some model compartements are unobserved. This suggest that issues encountered while fitting models are mostly due to practical identifiability.</description>

      <title>Maximum Likelihood Degrees of Brownian Motion Tree Models: Star Trees and Root Invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10322v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A Brownian motion tree (BMT) model is a Gaussian model whose associated set of covariance matrices is linearly constrained according to common ancestry in a phylogenetic tree. We study the complexity of inferring the maximum likelihood (ML) estimator for a BMT model by computing its ML-degree. Our main result is that the ML-degree of the BMT model on a star tree with $n + 1$ leaves is $2^{n+1}-2n-3$, which was previously conjectured by Am\'endola and Zwiernik. We also prove that the ML-degree of a BMT model is independent of the choice of the root. The proofs rely on the toric geometry of concentration matrices in a BMT model. Toward this end, we produce a combinatorial formula for the determinant of the concentration matrix of a BMT model, which generalizes the Cayley-Pr\"ufer theorem to complete graphs with weights given by a tree.</description>

      <title>Subtree Distances, Tight Spans and Diversities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13202v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Metric embeddings are central to metric theory and its applications. Here we consider embeddings of a different sort: maps from a set to subsets of a metric space so that distances between points are approximated by minimal distances between subsets. Our main result is a characterization of when a set of distances $d(x,y)$ between elements in a set $X$ have a subtree representation, a real tree $T$ and a collection $\{S_x\}_{x \in X}$ of subtrees of~$T$ such that $d(x,y)$ equals the length of the shortest path in~$T$ from a point in $S_x$ to a point in $S_y$ for all $x,y \in X$. The characterization was first established for {\em finite} $X$ by Hirai (2006) using a tight span construction defined for distance spaces, metric spaces without the triangle inequality. To extend Hirai's result beyond finite $X$ we establish fundamental results of tight span theory for general distance spaces, including the surprising observation that the tight span of a distance space is hyperconvex. We apply the results to obtain the first characterization of when a diversity -- a generalization of a metric space which assigns values to all finite subsets of $X$, not just to pairs -- has a tight span which is tree-like.</description>
