      <title>Systematic Design and Demonstration of Multipole, Coupled-Cavity Integrated Photonic Bandpass Filters with High FSR, High-Q Single-Mode Microresonators in Low-Loss Silicon Nitride Platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tunable, low-loss, narrowband, and frequency-stabilized filters play a critical role in the realization of transceivers for efficient signal processing in telecommunications and sensing applications in the presence of strong interference and noise. We systematically design, fabricate, and demonstrate multi-cavity, multipole integrated photonic bandpass filters with gigahertz to sub-gigahertz bandwidths. The filters feature ultra-wideband tunable center frequencies exceeding 400 GHz, ultra-low insertion loss, steep roll-off, and compact footprints, making them suitable for radio-frequency, microwave, and millimeter-wave front-end applications. Using a set of design principles for multi-cavity high-order filters together with supporting nanofabrication techniques in a silicon nitride platform, the demonstrated filters achieve record-high figures of merit and advance the state of the art in integrated photonic filtering for radio-frequency, microwave, and millimeter-wave systems. The resonator structures, which are the key building blocks enabling the reported performance, combine a large free spectral range of approximately 70 GHz with a high quality factor of 2.1 times ten to the power of seven. This performance is enabled by combining wide multimode waveguide segments with narrow single-mode regions connected through adiabatic tapers. To the best of our knowledge, the experimentally demonstrated bandwidth of 520 MHz, tuning range of one free spectral range, filter insertion loss of 2 dB, and out-of-band rejection ratios of up to 55 dB represent record performance metrics for integrated photonic filtering of radio-frequency, millimeter-wave, and terahertz signals.</description>

      <title>Optofluidic light routing via analytically configuring streamlines of micro-flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformation optics (TO) is a new method to design metamaterials that can manipulate electromagnetic fields. Inspired by the traditional TO techniques which is mostly based on the solid metamaterials with a limited range of tunability, a novel streamline tracing-based transformation optofluidics (STTOF) method is proposed to manipulate the light path by analytically designating the light-carrying streamlines of the flow in a two-dimensional circular bounded domain. A dipole flow model is built to analytically calculate the streamlines of the flow field inside the domain which allocates the optical/fluidic source and sink pairs at arbitrary positions. Liquid core/liquid cladding (L2) configuration is used in the experiment to trace the light via a specific streamline. Experimental results verify that the light paths agree well with the theoretical predictions, and demonstrate that a good range of tunability can be achieved by adjusting the flow rates and the source-sink positions of optical/fluidic source and sink pairs.</description>

      <title>Fractional optical skyrmions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical topologies in the form of Skyrmions have attracted significant interest of late, where their integer Skyrmion number has been shown to be robust to complex media. Here we create the first fractional Skyrmions by structuring light as a vectorial superposition of non-integer orbital angular momentum. We unravel the map structure to reveal a new phenomenon, the abrupt transition jumps in skyrmion number, which serves to reinforce the integer nature of skyrmion topologies. Our experimental demonstration agrees well with simulation, opening a new spectrum of optical topologies to explore, with exciting possibilities in optical communication and sensing.</description>

      <title>Singular value decomposition to describe bound states in the continuum in periodic metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how bound states in the continuum (BICs) emerge in periodic metasurfaces is essential for the controlled design of high-Q resonances and their systematic manipulation. Here, we investigate the singular value decomposition (SVD) of the effective transition matrix and the scattering matrix of periodic metasurfaces within a parameter range where the metasurface sustains a BIC. Our analysis yields general and practically applicable conditions on the singular values and singular vectors that enable BIC formation. At the BIC eigenfrequency, the inverse of the largest singular value of both matrices vanishes, and the corresponding left (right) singular vector is orthogonal to outgoing (incoming) plane waves that propagate in the directions of open diffraction orders. Our SVD-based approach predicts the spectral position of the BIC and provides detailed information about its properties, including the expansion coefficients in the multipole and plane-wave bases, as well as its behavior under perturbations that transform the BIC into a quasi-BIC. The approach is numerically validated by considering both symmetry-protected and accidental BICs in arrays of scatterers supporting electromagnetic or acoustic multipole resonances. The presented SVD framework offers a broadly applicable foundation for engineering BICs and quasi-BICs in complex metasurfaces, potentially enabling new routes for wave-based devices with tailored radiative properties.</description>

      <title>PRISM: Photonics-Informed Inverse Lithography for Manufacturable Inverse-Designed Photonic Integrated Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in photonic inverse design have demonstrated the ability to automatically synthesize compact, high-performance photonic components that surpass conventional, hand-designed structures, offering a promising path toward scalable and functionality-rich photonic hardware. However, the practical deployment of inverse-designed PICs is bottlenecked by manufacturability: their irregular, subwavelength geometries are highly sensitive to fabrication variations, leading to large performance degradation, low yield, and a persistent gap between simulated optimality and fabricated performance. Unlike electronics, photonics lacks a systematic, flexible mask optimization flow. Fabrication deviations in photonic components cause large optical response drift and compounding error in cascaded circuits, while calibrating fabrication models remains costly and expertise-heavy, often requiring repeated fabrication cycles that are inaccessible to most designers. To bridge this gap, we introduce PRISM, a photonics-informed inverse lithography workflow that makes photonic mask optimization data-efficient, reliable, and optics-informed. PRISM (i) synthesizes compact, informative calibration patterns to minimize required fabrication data, (ii) trains a physics-grounded differentiable fabrication model, enabling gradient-based optimization, and (iii) performs photonics-informed inverse mask optimization that prioritizes performance-critical features beyond geometry matching. Across multiple inverse-designed components with both electron-beam lithography and deep ultra-violet photolithography processes, PRISM significantly boosts post-fabrication performance and yield while reducing calibration area and turnaround time, enabling and democratizing manufacturable and high-yield inverse-designed photonic hardware at scale.</description>

      <title>Tunable microwave frequency synthesis with optically-derived spectral purity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microwave synthesizers are central to test and measurement systems across applications including wireless communications, radar, spectroscopy, and time and frequency metrology. State-of-the-art microwave sources, however, are fundamentally constrained by trade-offs between frequency tunability and spectral purity. Electro-optic frequency division (eOFD) is an emerging technique for dividing down the purity of optical sources to the microwave domain. Previously reported eOFD-based synthesizers generally have limited tunability due to feedback stabilization requirements. Here we demonstrate a feed-forward eOFD architecture in which the frequency tunability of a microwave source is preserved while optical spectral purity is divided through feed-forward cancellation, without any downstream electronic frequency synthesis. By canceling the phase noise of the microwave source without feedback, this eOFD approach removes loop bandwidth and source noise constraints observed in prior eOFD architectures. We achieve octave-spanning tunability, including the entire X-band, with phase noise below -140 dBc/Hz at kilohertz offsets and a high-frequency noise floor between -155 dBc/Hz and -145 dBc/Hz for carrier frequencies from 8 to 16 GHz. This performance corresponds to single-femtosecond integrated timing jitter, enabling, to our knowledge, the first demonstration of coherent, optically referenced microwave synthesis under wide tuning with this level of spectral purity.</description>

      <title>Controlling coherence between waveguide-coupled quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17890v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel waveguide design that incorporates a split-diode structure, allowing independent electrical control of transition energies of multiple emitters over a wide range with minimal loss in waveguide coupling efficiency. We use this design to systematically map out the transition from superradiant to independent emission from two quantum dots. We perform both lifetime as well as Hanbury Brown-Twiss measurements on the device, observing anti-dips in the photon coincidences indicating collective emission while at the same time observing a drop in lifetime around zero detuning, indicating superradiant behaviour. Performing both measurement types allows us to investigate detuning regions which show both superradiant rate enhancement and inter-emitter coherence, as well as regions in which correlations persist in the absence of rate enhancement.</description>

      <title>Near-Infrared and Telecommunication-Wavelength Photon-Pair Source in Optical Fiber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a photon-pair source in commercially available optical fiber that produces paired photons at telecommunication and near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths. The highly nondegenerate pairs are 700 nm apart: one in the 1500 nm E- and S-band telecommunication range and the other in the 830 nm NIR range. The high non-degeneracy means the photon pairs are far-detuned from Raman noise, resulting in a high coincidence-to-accidental ratio even while operating at room temperature. The source produces two spectrally and spatially distinct phase-matched processes with low spectral cross-talk, distinct transverse spatial modes in the NIR, and a single fundamental spatial mode in the telecommunication range. The source's room-temperature operation, off-the-shelf materials, and multiplexing potential make it promising for deployment in quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Transition radiation in helical metamaterials with strong spatial dispersion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The theory of transition radiation in helical metamaterials with strong spatial dispersion is developed in the framework of an effective field theory approach. The average number of photons radiated by a charged particle passing through a plate made of this metamaterial is obtained. Given the positions of the transition radiation maxima in momentum space for different velocities of a charged particle, the method for reconstruction of the dispersion law of plasmon-polaritons in metamaterials is proposed. Applying this method conversely, one can predict the radiation spectrum and polarization properties of transition radiation by means of the dispersion law of plasmon-polaritons in the metamaterial known, for example, from the effective model. It is shown that the strong spatial dispersion alters qualitatively the properties of transition radiation from a charged particle traversing normally a plate made of the helical metamaterial along its symmetry axis in the paraxial regime, viz., there is a nonzero forward radiation in contrast to transition radiation in media without strong spatial dispersion. Vavilov-Cherenkov radiation and the anomalous Doppler effect in helical metamaterials with strong spatial dispersion are described.</description>

      <title>Theory of temporal three-photon interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent demonstrations of cascaded PDC (CPDC) and the hopeful prospects of realizing third-order PDC (TOPDC) for the generation of three-photon entangled states are paving the way for experimental studies on genuine three-photon interference. In this article, we formulate three-photon interference in terms of ``each three-photon interfering only with itself.'' We show that although a generalized two-alternative three-photon interference setup based on CPDC or TOPDC involves eight different length parameters, the interference can be fully characterized in terms of only three independent parameters. The first parameter is the three-photon path-length difference, which has a direct analog in the one-photon and two-photon cases, and the other two parameters quantify the path-asymmetry length. Unlike two-photon interference, which requires only one parameter to quantify path-asymmetry, two independent parameters are needed in three-photon interference. This results in a broader class of nonclassical three-photon effects, including three-photon HOM-type effects. Our work provides the theoretical basis for existing and future three-photon interference experiments exploring the rich and complex quantum correlations associated with three-particle entanglement and potentially enabling the development of novel protocols for harnessing those correlations.</description>

      <title>Generating quantum entanglement from sunlight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Energy consumption is becoming a serious bottleneck for integrating quantum technologies within the existing global information infrastructure. In photonic architectures, considerable energy overheads stem from using lasers, whose high coherence was long considered indispensable for quantum state preparation. Here, we demonstrate that natural, incoherent sunlight can successfully produce quantum-entangled states via spontaneous parametric down-conversion. We detect polarization-entangled photon pairs with a concurrence of $0.905\pm0.053$ and a Bell state fidelity of $0.939\pm0.027$. Importantly, the system violates Bell's inequality with $S=2.5408\pm0.2171$, exceeding the classical threshold of 2, while maintaining generation rates comparable to laser-based setups. These findings pave the way for sustainable quantum applications in resource-limited environments like interplanetary missions.</description>

      <title>Polarization-resolved measurement of forward volume spin waves by micro-focused Brillouin light scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show how the micro-focused BLS signal of forward volume spin waves is formed and why it remains observable despite symmetry-based "suppression" expectations. A reciprocity-theorem based model with vectorial diffraction-limited focusing identifies the nonnegligible longitudinal focal-field component as the key element responsible for BLS sensitivity in the forward volume geometry. We further demonstrate that full polarization analysis, implemented through polarizer-analyzer maps of coherently excited spin waves, provides information beyond the conventional crossed polarizer-analyzer readout. In a BiYIG thin film, the measured maps exhibit Stokes/anti-Stokes polarization asymmetries and nontrivial patterns that stem from quadratic magneto-optical coupling terms. Fitting the data with a model including Voigt and Cotton-Mouton contributions yields an effective Cotton-Mouton constant and shows that the quadratic response is comparable to the linear Voigt contribution.</description>

      <title>Chiral phase memory of twisted light through multiple scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08677v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chiroptical signals, optical responses sensitive to molecular handedness, are rapidly suppressed by multiple scattering, fundamentally limiting their use in turbid media. Here we show that coupling molecular chirality to the topological structure of twisted light generates a protected phase observable that survives strong scattering. When Laguerre-Gaussian beams carrying orbital angular momentum propagate through chiral media, spin-orbit interaction converts circular birefringence into an azimuthal rotation of the helical wavefront. Remarkably, this chiral phase memory persists at scattering strengths that fully depolarize conventional beams, with the rotation magnitude preserved quantitatively between transparent solutions and strongly scattering tissue. The sign of the azimuthal rotation encodes molecular handedness: opposite enantiomers produce mirror-symmetric phase maps even after multiple scattering. Differential measurements between conjugate topological charges isolate the chiral contribution while cancelling achiral background, enabling the resolution of refractive-index changes of order 10-6. These results establish topological phase observables as robust carriers of weak chiral light-matter interactions in complex media, opening new routes for chiroptical spectroscopy and sensing beyond the ballistic-photon regime.</description>

Abstract: Moir\'e patterns have recently become a very active field in nanophotonics. Those structures exhibit novel photonic properties unattainable with traditional photonic crystals. Especially, moir\'e magic configurations have been shown to allow intriguing slow light modes with zero group velocity. Starting from macroscopic moir\'e patterns in the everyday life, we will then shift to the subwavelength scale of moir\'e photonic crystals and detail some of their unusual properties.</description>

Abstract: Scalable solid state single-photon sources (SPSs) with triggered single-photon emission rates exceeding a few GHz would aid in the wide technological adoption of photonic quantum technologies. We demonstrate triggering of a quantum dot (QD) single photon emission using dynamic Purcell effect induced at a frequency of several GHz by acoustic strain. To this end, InAs QDs are integrated in a hybrid photon-phonon patterned microcavity, where the density of optical states is tailored by the lateral confinement of photons in um-sized traps defined lithographically in the microcavity spacer. The single-photon character of the emission form a QD in a trap is confirmed by measuring single-photon statistics. We demonstrate modulation of the QD transition energy in a trap with a frequency up to 14 GHz by monochromatic longitudinal bulk acoustic phonons generated by piezoelectric transducers. For the modulation frequency of 5.6 GHz, corresponding to the acoustic mode of the microcavity, the QD energy is periodically shifted through a spectrally narrow confined photonic mode leading to an appreciable enhancement of the QD emission due to the dynamic Purcell effect. The platform thus enables the implementation of scalable III-V-based SPSs with on-chip tunable acoustic clocks with frequencies that can exceed several GHz under continuous wave optical excitation.</description>

      <title>Compressive multi-beam scanning transmission electron microscopy</title>

Abstract: We demonstrate a multi-beam scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) imaging that integrates down-sampling with super-resolution image reconstruction via a compressive sensing framework. A custom condenser aperture with six randomly positioned circular holes is employed to produce a multi-beam STEM probe, with the beam shape and distribution tuned through defocus. While the raw multi-beam images exhibit overlapping patterns, reconstruction using Adam optimization and total variation normalization yields high-fidelity images that closely reproduce the original sample structures, even from substantially down-sampled data. The proposed approach offers a pathway toward significant acceleration of such techniques through multibeam sparse sampling and computational reconstruction potentially useful for the analytical scanning methods in general.</description>

      <title>Coherent-state boundary conditions as the first-principles origin of background fields in QED</title>

Abstract: QED formulated in prescribed classical background electromagnetic fields is a standard framework for strong-field and laser\textendash matter interactions. It is usually treated as a theory modified by externally imposed fields, obscuring its precise relation to full QED and, in particular, the role of asymptotic boundary conditions for the gauge field. Starting from an operator-based formulation, we show that QED with background fields is not a distinct theory but arises as a well-defined boundary-condition limit of full QED, in which the classical background field emerges from coherent-state boundary conditions on the quantized electromagnetic field. In this limit, the conventional generating functional used in calculations with prescribed background fields is recovered naturally, while relaxing the boundary conditions allows depletion and backreaction effects to be incorporated within the same framework. The central new result is a rigorous operator-level proof of the equivalence between the fixed background-field approximation and coherent-state asymptotic boundary conditions\textemdash a formulation that, to our knowledge, has not been made explicit in previous approaches. We further demonstrate that the apparent time dependence of background fields does not originate from an explicitly time-dependent Hamiltonian, but instead reflects the choice of picture\textemdash Schr\"{o}dinger versus Heisenberg\textemdash in the underlying quantum theory. Rather than introducing new properties of coherent states, our analysis provides a first-principles reinterpretation of the fixed background-field approximation as a controlled and picture-dependent limit of full QED.</description>

      <title>Complete transparency with three active-passive-coupled optical resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18937v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The phenomena of induced transparency, with the typical examples of electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) in atomic media and coupled optical resonators, have attracted tremendous interest since their discoveries. Due to the limitations of the involved elements, however, near-100\% transmissions were reported under highly demanding experimental conditions for atomic and other media. Based on a structure of three linearly coupled optical resonators, an active one carrying a possibly arbitrary optical gain and two passive ones simply with dissipation, we demonstrate that a transmitted light field can become completely transparent through the structure, which displays all properties similar to those of EIT. A destructive interference mechanism is discovered to totally eliminate the intracavity field in the resonator directly coupled to the transmitted field of any feasible power, when the coupling strength of two other resonators is tuned to a point inside the designed range. This mechanism works for all possible coupling strengths of the dark resonator with its neighboring resonator and the input field, as well as for any available quality factor from its fabrication. The transparency window size and the output field intensity at the transparency window center can be freely engineered by adjusting two inter-cavity couplings, without modifying the built-in optical gain which can be just slightly stronger than the dissipation of the active resonator.</description>
