      <title>Closed-Form of Two-Agent New Keynesian Model with Price and Wage Rigidities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper argues and analytically demonstrates that, in a fully analytical Two-Agent New Keynesian model with Rotemberg-type nominal rigidities, monetary transmission is amplified if and only if two conditions hold: first, the heterogeneity-induced IS-slope effect dominates; second, the price-stickiness channel is active. We also show when amplification weakens or disappears, most notably under pure wage stickiness, where the price channel shuts down and the heterogeneity-driven term vanishes. The framework features household heterogeneity between savers and hand-to-mouth households and adheres strictly to microeconomic foundations while avoiding restrictive assumptions on relative wages or labor supply across types that are common in prior analytical work. The closed-form solution makes transparent how price stickiness, wage stickiness, and the share of hand-to-mouth households jointly shape amplification. We further derive a modified aggregate welfare loss function that quantifies how heterogeneity, operating through distributional effects from firm profits, re-weights the relative importance of stabilizing inflation. Overall, the tractable yet micro-founded analytical framework clarifies the interaction between household heterogeneity and nominal rigidities and pinpoints the precise conditions under which monetary policy gains or loses traction.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Non-Bayesian Persuasion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a multi-step persuasion problem involving a Bayesian sender and a non-Bayesian receiver. When the receiver deviates from Bayesian updating, the sender may benefit from -- or be harmed by -- gradually revealing information over time. We show that under divisible updating rules (Cripps, 2018), delaying information provision does not affect the sender's ex-ante value. Focusing on the $\alpha$--$\beta$ rule of Grether (1980), we derive the necessary and sufficient conditions under which the sender is strictly better or worse off under a two-step persuasion scheme.</description>

      <title>When is it (im)possible to respect all individuals' preferences under uncertainty?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When aggregating Subjective Expected Utility preferences, the Pareto principle leads to an impossibility result unless the individuals have a common belief. This paper examines the source of this impossibility in more detail by considering the aggregation of a general class of incomplete preferences that can represent gradual ambiguity perceptions. Our result shows that the planner cannot avoid ignoring some individuals unless there is a probability distribution that all individuals agree is most plausible. This means that even if individuals have similar ambiguity perceptions, the impossibility persists as long as some individual's most plausible belief differs even slightly from those of others.</description>

      <title>Contest success functions with luck</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The contest success function (CSF) is a mapping from contestants' efforts to the probabilistic allocation. An axiomatization of the CSFs with luck is provided. It extends the classic axiomatization of Tullock CSF and connects to works of CSF with draws. The central axiom is homogeneous relative externality, which restricts the relative externality from one contestant's effort to others' probabilistic allocation to be scale-invariant. More specifications on parameters are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Redeeming Falsifiability?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.15723v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit Popper's falsifiability criterion. A tester hires a potential expert to produce a theory, offering payments contingent on the observed performance of the theory. In our model, instead of knowing the true data-generating process, the expert knows the state-of-the-art belief over data-generating processes. A non-expert does not. We argue that if the expert can, moreover, acquire additional information to refine this knowledge, falsifiability does have the power to distinguish between experts and non-experts and to identify valuable theories, capitalizing on experts' ability to acquire and refine knowledge.</description>

      <title>Technological Innovation and Bursting Bubbles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08215v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a macro-finance model with innovation and knowledge spillover. Skilled agents engage in R&amp;D activities (establish firms) or work in the knowledge-intensive sector. Unskilled agents work in the traditional sector. Knowledge spillover from innovations to the two sectors is initially high and uneven (unbalanced growth), but eventually weakens and equalizes (balanced growth). A rational stock bubble (prices exceed fundamentals) necessarily emerges, even though it is expected to burst with regime switching. Despite the inevitable collapse, stock bubbles and technological innovation reinforce each other and lead to permanently higher output and wages because technologies developed during the bubble era prevail.</description>

      <title>The Social Learning Barrier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12136v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider long-lived agents who interact repeatedly in a social network. In each period, each agent learns about an unknown state by observing a private signal and her neighbors' actions from the previous period before choosing her own action. Our main result shows that the learning rate of the slowest-learning agent is bounded from above by a constant that only depends on the marginal distributions of the agents' private signals and not on the number of agents, the network structure, correlations between the private signals, and the agents' strategies. Applying this result to equilibrium learning with rational agents shows that the learning rate of all agents in any equilibrium is bounded under general conditions. This extends recent findings on equilibrium learning and demonstrates that the limitation stems from an information-theoretic tradeoff between optimal action choices and information revelation, rather than strategic considerations. We also show that a social planner can achieve almost optimal learning by designing strategies for which each agent's learning rate is close to the upper bound.</description>

      <title>A Tale of Two Monopolies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06763v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply marginal analysis \`a la Bulow and Roberts (1989) to characterize the revenue-maximizing selling mechanism for a multiproduct monopoly. Specifically, we derive the revenue change due to a price perturbation on any subset of bundles, holding the prices of other bundles fixed. In an optimal mechanism, total revenue must not increase with any small price change for bundles with positive demand, nor with a small price decrease for bundles with zero demand. For any symmetric two-dimensional type distribution satisfying mild regularity conditions, the marginal analysis fully characterizes the optimal mechanism, regardless of whether the products are independent, substitutes, or complements. For general type distributions and allocation spaces with more than two items, the analysis identifies bundles that must carry positive demand and provides conditions under which pure bundling or separate selling is suboptimal.</description>

      <title>Self-Equivalent Voting Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15310v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, I introduce a novel stability axiom for stochastic voting rules, called self-equivalence, by which a society considering whether to replace its voting rule using itself will choose not to do so. I then show that under the unrestricted strict preference domain, a voting rule satisfying the democratic principles of anonymity, optimality, monotonicity, and neutrality is self-equivalent if and only if it assigns to every voter equal probability of being a dictator (i.e., uniform random dictatorship). Thus, any society that desires stability and adheres to the aforementioned democratic principles is bound to either employ the uniform random dictatorship or decide whether to change its voting rule using a voting rule other than itself.</description>

      <title>Two-Instrument Screening under Soft Budget Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10724v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study soft budget constraints in multi-tier public finance when an upper-tier government uses two instruments: an ex-ante grant schedule and an ex-post rescue. Under convex rescue costs and standard primitives, the three-stage leader-follower problem collapses to one dimensional screening with a single allocation index: the cap on realized rescue. A hazard-based characterization delivers a unified rule that nests (i) no rescue, (ii) a threshold-cap with commitment, and (iii) a threshold--linear--cap without commitment. The knife-edge for eliminating bailouts compares the marginal cost at the origin to the supremum of a virtual weight, and the comparative statics show how greater curvature tightens caps while discretion shifts transfers toward front loading by lowering the effective grant weight. The framework provides a portable benchmark for mechanism design and yields testable implications for policy and empirical work on intergovernmental finance.</description>

      <title>The Subtlety of Optimal Paternalism in a Population with Bounded Rationality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13658v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study optimal policy when a paternalistic utilitarian planner has the power to design a discrete choice set for a heterogeneous population with bounded rationality. We show that the policy that most effectively constrains or influences choices depends in a particular multiplicative way on the preferences of the population and on the choice probabilities conditional on preferences that measure the suboptimality of behavior. We first consider the planning problem in abstraction. We then study two settings in which the planner may mandate an action or decentralize decision making. In one setting, we suppose that individuals measure utility with additive random error and maximize mismeasured rather than actual utility. Then optimal planning requires knowledge of the distribution of measurement errors. In the second setting, we consider binary treatment choice under uncertainty when the planner can mandate a treatment conditional on publicly observed personal covariates or can enable individuals to choose their own treatments conditional on private information. We focus on situations where bounded rationality takes the form of deviations between subjective personal beliefs and objective probabilities of uncertain outcomes. To illustrate, we consider clinical decision making in medicine. In toto, our analysis is cautionary. It characterizes the subtle nature of optimal policy, whose determination requires the planner to possess extensive knowledge that is rarely available. We conclude that studies of policy choice by a paternalistic utilitarian planner should view not only the population but also the planner to be boundedly rational.</description>
