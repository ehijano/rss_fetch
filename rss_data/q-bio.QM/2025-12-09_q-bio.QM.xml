      <title>Algorithmic design of "smart canopy" maize architectures that maximize light use efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a computational framework that integrates functional-structural plant modeling (FSPM) with an evolutionary algorithm to optimize three-dimensional maize canopy architecture for enhanced light interception under high-density planting. The optimization revealed an emergent ideotype characterized by two distinct strategies: a vertically stratified leaf profile (steep, narrow upper leaves for penetration; broad, horizontal lower leaves for capture) and a radially tiled azimuthal arrangement that breaks the conventional distichous symmetry of maize to minimize self and mutual shading. Reverse ray-tracing simulations show that this architecture intercepts significantly more photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) than virtual canopies parameterized from high-performing field hybrids, with gains that generalize across multiple U.S. latitudes and planting densities. The optimized trait combinations align with characteristics of modern density-tolerant cultivars, supporting biological plausibility. Because recent gene editing advances enable more independent control of architectural traits, the designs identified here are increasingly feasible. By uncovering effective, non-intuitive trait configurations, our approach provides a scalable, predictive tool to guide breeding targets, improve light-use efficiency, and ultimately support sustainable yield gains.</description>

      <title>Beyond Lux thresholds: a systematic pipeline for classifying biologically relevant light contexts from wearable data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Wearable spectrometers enable field quantification of biologically relevant light, yet reproducible pipelines for contextual classification remain under-specified.
  Objective: To establish and validate a subject-wise evaluated, reproducible pipeline and actionable design rules for classifying natural vs. artificial light from wearable spectral data.
  Methods: We analysed ActLumus recordings from 26 participants, each monitored for at least 7 days at 10-second sampling, paired with daily exposure diaries. The pipeline fixes the sequence: domain selection, log-base-10 transform, L2 normalisation excluding total intensity (to avoid brightness shortcuts), hour-level medoid aggregation, sine/cosine hour encoding, and MLP classifier, evaluated under participant-wise cross-validation.
  Results: The proposed sequence consistently achieved high performance on the primary task, with representative configurations reaching AUC = 0.938 (accuracy 88%) for natural vs. artificial classification on the held-out subject split. In contrast, indoor vs. outdoor classification remained at feasibility level due to spectral overlap and class imbalance (best AUC approximately 0.75; majority-class collapse without contextual sensors). Threshold baselines were insufficient on our data, supporting the need for spectral-temporal modelling beyond illuminance cut-offs.
  Conclusions: We provide a reproducible, auditable baseline pipeline and design rules for contextual light classification under subject-wise generalisation. All code, configuration files, and derived artefacts will be openly archived (GitHub + Zenodo DOI) to support reuse and benchmarking.</description>

      <title>Spatial Analysis for AI-segmented Histopathology Images: Methods and Implementation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantitatively characterizing the spatial organization of cells and their interaction is essential for understanding cancer progression and immune response. Recent advances in machine intelligence have enabled large-scale segmentation and classification of cell nuclei from digitized histopathology slides, generating massive point pattern and marked point pattern datasets. However, accessible tools for quantitative analysis of such complex cellular spatial organization remain limited. In this paper, we first review 27 traditional spatial summary statistics, areal indices, and topological features applicable to point pattern data. Then, we introduce SASHIMI (Spatial Analysis for Segmented Histopathology Images using Machine Intelligence), a browser-based tool for real-time spatial analysis of artificial intelligence (AI)-segmented histopathology images. SASHIMI computes a comprehensive suite of mathematically grounded descriptors, including spatial statistics, proximity-based measures, grid-level similarity indices, spatial autocorrelation measures, and topological descriptors, to quantify cellular abundance and cell-cell interaction. Applied to two cancer datasets, oral potentially malignant disorders (OPMD) and non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), SASHIMI identified multiple spatial features significantly associated with patient survival outcomes. SASHIMI provides an accessible and reproducible platform for single-cell-level spatial profiling of tumor morphological architecture, offering a robust framework for quantitative exploration of tissue organization across cancer types.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Neural Koopman Machine for Interpretable Longitudinal Personalized Alzheimer's Disease Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Early forecasting of individual cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is central to disease evaluation and management. Despite advances, it is as of yet challenging for existing methodological frameworks to integrate multimodal data for longitudinal personalized forecasting while maintaining interpretability. To address this gap, we present the Neural Koopman Machine (NKM), a new machine learning architecture inspired by dynamical systems and attention mechanisms, designed to forecast multiple cognitive scores simultaneously using multimodal genetic, neuroimaging, proteomic, and demographic data. NKM integrates analytical ($\alpha$) and biological ($\beta$) knowledge to guide feature grouping and control the hierarchical attention mechanisms to extract relevant patterns. By implementing Fusion Group-Aware Hierarchical Attention within the Koopman operator framework, NKM transforms complex nonlinear trajectories into interpretable linear representations. To demonstrate NKM's efficacy, we applied it to study the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. Our results suggest that NKM consistently outperforms both traditional machine learning methods and deep learning models in forecasting trajectories of cognitive decline. Specifically, NKM (1) forecasts changes of multiple cognitive scores simultaneously, (2) quantifies differential biomarker contributions to predicting distinctive cognitive scores, and (3) identifies brain regions most predictive of cognitive deterioration. Together, NKM advances personalized, interpretable forecasting of future cognitive decline in AD using past multimodal data through an explainable, explicit system and reveals potential multimodal biological underpinnings of AD progression.</description>

      <title>Synergistic Computational Approaches for Accelerated Drug Discovery: Integrating Quantum Mechanics, Statistical Thermodynamics, and Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately predicting protein-ligand binding free energies (BFEs) remains a central challenge in drug discovery, particularly because the most reliable methods, such as free energy perturbation (FEP), are computationally intensive and difficult to scale. Here, we introduce a hybrid quantum-classical framework that combines Mining Minima sampling with quantum mechanically refined ligand partial charges, QM/MM interaction evaluation, and variational quantum eigensolver (VQE)-based electronic energy correction. This design enables explicit treatment of polarization, charge redistribution, and electronic correlation effects that are often underestimated in purely classical scoring schemes, while retaining computational efficiency. Across 23 protein targets and 543 ligands, the method achieves a mean absolute error of about 1.10 kcal/mol with strong rank-order fidelity (Pearson R = 0.75, Spearman rho = 0.76, Kendall tau = 0.57), consistent with the performance of contemporary FEP protocols. Notably, the workflow requires only about 25 minutes per ligand on standard compute resources, resulting in an approximate 20-fold reduction in computational cost relative to alchemical free energy approaches. This level of accuracy and efficiency makes the method well-suited for high-throughput lead optimization and iterative design cycles in pharmaceutical discovery. The framework also provides a natural foundation for future integration with machine learning models to enable predictive, large-scale, and adaptive screening strategies.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Information Content of Individual Spikes in Population-Level Models of Neural Spiking Activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the last decade, there have been major advances in clusterless decoding algorithms for neural data analysis. These algorithms use the theory of marked point processes to describe the joint activity of many neurons simultaneously, without the need for spike sorting. In this study, we examine information-theoretic metrics to analyze the information extracted from each observed spike under such clusterless models. In an analysis of spatial coding in the rat hippocampus, we compared the entropy reduction between spike-sorted and clusterless models for both individual spikes observed in isolation and when the prior information from all previously observed spikes is accounted for. Our analysis demonstrates that low-amplitude spikes, which are difficult to cluster and often left out of spike sorting, provide reduced information compared to sortable, high-amplitude spikes when considered in isolation, but the two provide similar levels of information when considering all the prior information available from past spiking. These findings demonstrate the value of combining information measures with state-space modeling and yield new insights into the underlying mechanisms of neural computation.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Neural Approximation of Stochastic Reaction Dynamics with Guaranteed Reliability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic Reaction Networks (SRNs) are a fundamental modeling framework for systems ranging from chemical kinetics and epidemiology to ecological and synthetic biological processes. A central computational challenge is the estimation of expected outputs across initial conditions and times, a task that is rarely solvable analytically and becomes computationally prohibitive with current methods such as Finite State Projection or the Stochastic Simulation Algorithm. Existing deep learning approaches offer empirical scalability, but provide neither interpretability nor reliability guarantees, limiting their use in scientific analysis and in applications where model outputs inform real-world decisions. Here we introduce DeepSKA, a neural framework that jointly achieves interpretability, guaranteed reliability, and substantial computational gains. DeepSKA yields mathematically transparent representations that generalise across states, times, and output functions, and it integrates this structure with a small number of stochastic simulations to produce unbiased, provably convergent, and dramatically lower-variance estimates than classical Monte Carlo. We demonstrate these capabilities across nine SRNs, including nonlinear and non-mass-action models with up to ten species, where DeepSKA delivers accurate predictions and orders-of-magnitude efficiency improvements. This interpretable and reliable neural framework offers a principled foundation for developing analogous methods for other Markovian systems, including stochastic differential equations.</description>

      <title>PRIMRose: Insights into the Per-Residue Energy Metrics of Proteins with Double InDel Mutations using Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how protein mutations affect protein structure is essential for advancements in computational biology and bioinformatics. We introduce PRIMRose, a novel approach that predicts energy values for each residue given a mutated protein sequence. Unlike previous models that assess global energy shifts, our method analyzes the localized energetic impact of double amino acid insertions or deletions (InDels) at the individual residue level, enabling residue-specific insights into structural and functional disruption. We implement a Convolutional Neural Network architecture to predict the energy changes of each residue in a protein mutation. We train our model on datasets constructed from nine proteins, grouped into three categories: one set with exhaustive double InDel mutations, another with approximately 145k randomly sampled double InDel mutations, and a third with approximately 80k randomly sampled double InDel mutations. Our model achieves high predictive accuracy across a range of energy metrics as calculated by the Rosetta molecular modeling suite and reveals localized patterns that influence model performance, such as solvent accessibility and secondary structure context. This per-residue analysis offers new insights into the mutational tolerance of specific regions within proteins and provides higher interpretable and biologically meaningful predictions of InDels' effects.</description>

      <title>Small Language Models Can Use Nuanced Reasoning For Health Science Research Classification: A Microbial-Oncogenesis Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificially intelligent (AI) co-scientists must be able to sift through research literature cost-efficiently while applying nuanced scientific reasoning. We evaluate Small Language Models (SLMs, &lt;= 8B parameters) for classifying medical research papers. Using literature on the oncogenic potential of HMTV/MMTV-like viruses in breast cancer as a case study, we assess model performance with both zero-shot and in-context learning (ICL; few-shot prompting) strategies against frontier proprietary Large Language Models (LLMs). Llama 3 and Qwen2.5 outperform GPT-5 (API, low/high effort), Gemini 3 Pro Preview, and Meerkat in zero-shot settings, though trailing Gemini 2.5 Pro. ICL leads to improved performance on a case-by-case basis, allowing Llama 3 and Qwen2.5 to match Gemini 2.5 Pro in binary classification. Systematic lexical-ablation experiments show that SLM decisions are often grounded in valid scientific cues but can be influenced by spurious textual artifacts, underscoring need for interpretability in high-stakes pipelines. Our results reveal both promise and limitations of modern SLMs for scientific triage; pairing SLMs with simple but principled prompting strategies can approach performance of the strongest LLMs for targeted literature filtering in co-scientist pipelines.</description>

      <title>Visual Function Profiles via Multi-Path Aggregation Reveal Neuron-Level Responses in the Drosophila Brain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately predicting individual neurons' responses and spatial functional properties in complex visual tasks remains a key challenge in understanding neural computation. Existing whole-brain connectome models of Drosophila often rely on parameter assumptions or deep learning approaches, yet remain limited in their ability to reliably predict dynamic neuronal responses. We introduce a Multi-Path Aggregation (MPA) framework, based on neural network steady-state theory, to build a whole-brain Visual Function Profiles (VFP) of Drosophila neurons and predict their responses under diverse visual tasks. Unlike conventional methods relying on redundant parameters, MPA combines visual input features with the whole-brain connectome topology. It uses adjacency matrix powers and finite-path optimization to efficiently predict neuronal function, including ON/OFF polarity, direction selectivity, and responses to complex visual stimuli. Our model achieves a Pearson correlation of 0.84+/-0.12 for ON/OFF responses, outperforming existing methods (0.33+/-0.59), and accurately captures neuron functional properties, including luminance and direction preferences, while allowing single-neuron or population-level blockade simulations. Replacing CNN modules with VFP-derived Lobula Columnar(LC) population responses in a Drosophila simulation enables successful navigation and obstacle avoidance, demonstrating the model's effectiveness in guiding embodied behavior. This study establishes a "connectome-functional profile-behavior" framework, offering a whole-brain quantitative tool to study Drosophila visual computation and a neuron-level guide for brain-inspired intelligence.</description>

      <title>Self-Supervised Learning on Molecular Graphs: A Systematic Investigation of Masking Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) plays a central role in molecular representation learning. Yet, many recent innovations in masking-based pretraining are introduced as heuristics and lack principled evaluation, obscuring which design choices are genuinely effective. This work cast the entire pretrain-finetune workflow into a unified probabilistic framework, enabling a transparent comparison and deeper understanding of masking strategies. Building on this formalism, we conduct a controlled study of three core design dimensions: masking distribution, prediction target, and encoder architecture, under rigorously controlled settings. We further employ information-theoretic measures to assess the informativeness of pretraining signals and connect them to empirically benchmarked downstream performance. Our findings reveal a surprising insight: sophisticated masking distributions offer no consistent benefit over uniform sampling for common node-level prediction tasks. Instead, the choice of prediction target and its synergy with the encoder architecture are far more critical. Specifically, shifting to semantically richer targets yields substantial downstream improvements, particularly when paired with expressive Graph Transformer encoders. These insights offer practical guidance for developing more effective SSL methods for molecular graphs.</description>

      <title>Big shells, bigger data: cohort analysis of Chesapeake Bay Crassostrea virginica reefs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Oysters in Virginia Chesapeake Bay oyster reefs are "age-truncated", possibly due to a combination of historical overfishing, disease epizootics, environmental degradation, and climate change. Research has suggested that oysters exhibit resilience to environmental stressors; however, that evidence is based on the current limited understanding of oyster lifespan. Until this paper, the Virginia Oyster Stock Assessment and Replenishment Archive (VOSARA), a spatially and temporally expansive dataset (222 reefs across 2003-2023) of shell lengths (SL, mm), had yet to be examined comprehensively in the context of resilience. We develop a novel method using Gaussian mixture modeling (GMM) to identify the age groups in each reef using yearly SL data and then link those age groups over time to identify cohorts and estimate their lifespan. Sixty-four reefs (29%) are deemed to have sufficient data (at least 300 oysters sampled for a minimum of 8 consecutive years) for this analysis. We fit univariate GMMs for each year ($t$) and reef ($r$) for each of the seven river strata ($R$) to estimate 1) the mean and standard deviation of SL for each $a_{Rrt}$th age group, and 2) the mixture percentage of each $a_{Rrt}$th age group. We link age groups across time to infer age cohorts by developing a mechanistic algorithm that prevents the shrinking of shell length when an $a_{Rrt}$th group becomes an ($a_{R,r,t+1}$)th group. Our method shows promise in identifying oyster cohorts and estimating lifespan solely using SL data. Our results show signals of resiliency in almost all river systems: oyster cohorts live longer and grow larger in the mid-to-late 2010s compared to the early 2000s.</description>

      <title>A Structured Review of Fixed and Multimodal Sensing Techniques for Bat Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective monitoring of mobile animal populations is crucial for ecological research, wildlife management, and agricultural applications. Monitoring of bats specifically can help understand the spread of disease as well as shine light on bat migration patterns, population dynamics, and the impacts of environmental changes on bat colonies. Fixed sensing modalities, such as infrared sensors, cameras, radar, and acoustic detectors, play a pivotal role in tracking and understanding animal behavior. This survey goes over context-informing details about bat biology, and then reviews these fixed sensing modalities, discussing the unique challenges and contributions of each approach.

      <title>Universal bounds on entropy production from fluctuating coarse-grained trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entropy production is arguably the most universally applicable measure of non-equilibrium behavior, particularly for systems coupled to a heat bath. This setting encompasses driven soft matter as well as biomolecular, biochemical, and biophysical systems. Despite its central role, direct measurements of entropy production remain challenging - especially in small systems dominated by fluctuations. The main difficulty arises because not all degrees of freedom contributing to entropy production are experimentally accessible. A key question, therefore, is how to infer entropy production from coarse-grained observations, such as time series of experimentally measurable variables. Over the past decade, stochastic thermodynamics has provided several inequalities that yield model-free lower bounds on entropy production from such coarse-grained data. The major approaches rely on observations of coarse-grained states, fluctuating currents or ticks, correlation functions of coarse-grained observables, and waiting-time distributions between so-called Markovian events, which correspond to transitions between mesoscopic states. Here, we systematically review these techniques valid under the sole assumption of a Markovian, i.e., memoryless, dynamics on an underlying, not necessarily observable, network of states or following a possibly high-dimensional Langevin equation. We discuss in detail the large class of non-equilibrium steady states and highlight extensions of these methods to time-dependent and relaxing systems. While our focus is on mean entropy production, we also summarize recent progress in quantifying entropy production along individual coarse-grained trajectories.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Clinic: A Large-Scale Evaluation of Augmenting EHR with Wearable Data for Diverse Health Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22920v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electronic health records (EHRs) provide a powerful basis for predicting the onset of health outcomes. Yet EHRs primarily capture in-clinic events and miss aspects of daily behavior and lifestyle containing rich health information. Consumer wearables, by contrast, continuously measure activity, heart rate, and sleep, and more, offering complementary signals that can fill this gap. Despite this potential, there has been little systematic evaluation of the benefit that wearable data can bring to health outcome prediction on top of EHRs. In this study, we present an extensible framework for multimodal health outcome prediction that integrates EHR and wearable data streams. Using data from the All of Us Program, we systematically compared the combination of different encoding methods on EHR and wearable data, including the traditional feature engineering approach, as well as foundation model embeddings. Across ten clinical outcomes, wearable integration consistently improved model performance relative to EHR-only baselines, e.g., average delta AUROC +6.8% for major depressive disorder, +9.7% for hypertension, and +12.6% for diabetes. On average across all ten outcomes, fusing EHRs with wearable features shows 8.5% improvement in AUROC. To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale evaluation of wearable-EHR fusion, underscoring the utility of wearable-derived signals in complementing EHRs and enabling more holistic, personalized health outcome predictions. Meanwhile, our analysis elucidates future directions for optimizing foundation models for wearable data and its integration with EHR data.</description>

      <title>Anatomical basis of sex differences in the electrocardiogram identified by three-dimensional torso-heart imaging reconstruction pipeline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13976v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The electrocardiogram (ECG) is used for diagnosis and risk stratification in myocardial infarction (MI). Women have a higher incidence of missed MI diagnosis and complications following infarction, and to address this we aim to provide quantitative information on sex-differences in ECG and torso-ventricular anatomical features and their interdependence. A novel computational automated pipeline is presented enabling the three-dimensional reconstruction of torso-ventricular anatomies for 425 post-MI subjects and 1051 healthy controls from UK Biobank clinical images. Regression models were created relating torso-ventricular and ECG parameters. We found that female hearts were positioned more posteriorly and superiorly than male, and in MI hearts were oriented more horizontally, especially for women. Post-MI women exhibited less QRS prolongation, requiring 27% more prolongation than men to exceed 120ms. Only half of the sex difference in QRS duration was associated with smaller female cavities. Lower STj amplitude in women was striking, associated with smaller ventricles, but also more superior and posterior cardiac position. Post-MI, T wave amplitude and R axis deviations were more strongly associated with posterior and horizontal cardiac positioning in women than in men. Our study highlights the need to quantify sex differences in anatomical features, their implications in ECG interpretation, and the application of clinical ECG thresholds in post-MI.</description>

      <title>SeqProFT: Sequence-only Protein Property Prediction with LoRA Finetuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11530v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Protein language models (PLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in learning relationships between protein sequences and functions. However, finetuning these large models requires substantial computational resources, often with suboptimal task-specific results. This study investigates how parameter-efficient finetuning via LoRA can enhance protein property prediction while significantly reducing computational demands. By applying LoRA to ESM-2 and ESM-C models of varying sizes and evaluating 10 diverse protein property prediction tasks, we demonstrate that smaller models with LoRA adaptation can match or exceed the performance of larger models without adaptation. Additionally, we integrate contact map information through a multi-head attention mechanism, improving model comprehension of structural features. Our systematic analysis reveals that LoRA finetuning enables faster convergence, better performance, and more efficient resource utilization, providing practical guidance for protein research applications in resource-constrained environments.

      <title>A network-driven framework for enhancing gene-disease association studies in coronary artery disease</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19030v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) link genetic variation to complex traits by leveraging expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) data. However, most implementations are typically limited to local (cis-acting) effects and fail to account for long-range (trans) regulatory influences mediated through gene networks. We introduce GRN-TWAS, a framework that reconstructs gene regulatory networks (GRNs) and integrates their topology into gene expression prediction models, thereby propagating distal (trans) regulatory effects through tissue-specific gene networks to trait- or disease-associated phenotypes. By incorporating network-derived trans-eQTLs, GRN-TWAS generates gene expression imputation models that capture both local and distal genetic components, enabling a more complete, systems-level view of genetic regulation consistent with the omnigenic model hypothesis. Using genotype and multi-tissue expression data from 600 coronary artery disease (CAD) cases in the STARNET study together with GWAS summary statistics, we show that GRN-TWAS improves gene-expression prediction and sharpens discovery of CAD-associated genes. Across seven tissues, the framework identified 5,779 transcriptome-wide significant genes, more than 50\% of which appear to be previously unreported in the CAD literature. A knowledge-based gene-ranking engine then prioritized 882 genes as highly CAD-relevant, including 237 regulated exclusively through trans effects. Key-driver analysis highlighted 18 putative trans mediators with high network centrality and disease relevance, offering mechanistic hypotheses that complement association signals. Collectively, these results demonstrate that embedding network topology into TWAS improves discovery and interpretability by exposing tissue-specific regulatory routes from genotype to phenotype and expanding the landscape of gene-disease associations.</description>

      <title>A Simple Approximate Bayesian Inference Neural Surrogate for Stochastic Petri Net Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10714v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stochastic Petri Nets (SPNs) are an increasingly popular tool of choice for modeling discrete-event dynamics in areas such as epidemiology and systems biology, yet their parameter estimation remains challenging in general and in particular when transition rates depend on external covariates and explicit likelihoods are unavailable. We introduce a neural-surrogate (neural-network-based approximation of the posterior distribution) framework that predicts the coefficients of known covariate-dependent rate functions directly from noisy, partially observed token trajectories. Our model employs a lightweight 1D Convolutional Residual Network trained end-to-end on Gillespie-simulated SPN realizations, learning to invert system dynamics under realistic conditions of event dropout. During inference, Monte Carlo dropout provides calibrated uncertainty bounds together with point estimates. On synthetic SPNs with $10\%$ missing events, our surrogate recovers rate-function coefficients with an $RMSE = 0.043$ and substantially runs faster than traditional Bayesian approaches. These results demonstrate that data-driven, likelihood-free surrogates can enable accurate, robust, and real-time parameter recovery in complex, partially observed discrete-event systems.</description>
