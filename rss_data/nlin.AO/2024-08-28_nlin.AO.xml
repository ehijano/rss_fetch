Abstract: The widespread development and use of neural networks have significantly enriched a wide range of computer algorithms and promise higher speed at lower cost. However, the imitation of neural networks by means of modern computing substrates is highly inefficient, whereas physical realization of large scale networks remains challenging. Fortunately, delayed-feedback oscillators, being much easier to realize experimentally, represent promising candidates for the empirical implementation of neural networks and next generation computing architectures. In the current research, we demonstrate that coupled bistable delayed-feedback oscillators emulate a multilayer network, where one single-layer network is connected to another single-layer network through coupling between replica nodes, i.e. the multiplex network. We show that all the aspects of the multiplexing impact on wavefront propagation and stochastic resonance identified in multilayer networks of bistable oscillators are entirely reproduced in the dynamics of time-delay oscillators. In particular, varying the coupling strength allows suppressing and enhancing the effect of stochastic resonance, as well as controlling the speed and direction of both deterministic and stochastic wavefront propagation. All the considered effects are studied in numerical simulations and confirmed in physical experiments, showing an excellent correspondence and disclosing thereby the robustness of the observed phenomena.</description>
