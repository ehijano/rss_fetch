      <title>Industrial Upgrading and New Quality Productive Forces: Evidence from China's Provincial Panel Data (2003-2022)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accelerating the deep transformation and upgrading of industrial structure and forming new quality productive forces are essential components for China to achieve the great rejuvenation of the Chinese Dream. After more than 40 years of rapid development, China has entered the "new normal" of development, making the advancement of new quality productive forces an urgent task. This paper reviews the evolution of China's industrial structure, argues the necessity for a new round of deep industrial transformation, and explores the impact of industrial structure transformation and upgrading on the level of new quality productive forces using various methods. The research findings are as follows:(1)The deep transformation and upgrading of the industrial structure can significantly promote the development of new quality productive forces, but there are obvious regional differences.(2)The core indicator of the improvement in the level of new quality productive forces is the enhancement of total factor productivity. Furthermore, this paper summarizes past industrial development processes and the challenges faced, and analyzes and discusses the potential challenges that may arise in promoting the development of new quality productive forces through deep industrial structure transformation, based on empirical research results.</description>

      <title>Avoiding Overfitting in Variable-Order Markov Models: a Cross-Validation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Higher$\text{-}$order Markov chain models are widely used to represent agent transitions in dynamic systems, such as passengers in transport networks. They capture transitions in complex systems by considering not only the current state but also the path of previously visited states. For example, the likelihood of train passengers traveling from Paris (current state) to Rome could increase significantly if their journey originated in Italy (prior state). Although this approach provides a more faithful representation of the system than first$\text{-}$order models, we find that commonly used methods$-$relying on Kullback$\text{-}$Leibler divergence$-$frequently overfit the data, mistaking fluctuations for higher$\text{-}$order dependencies and undermining forecasts and resource allocation. Here, we introduce DIVOP (Detection of Informative Variable$\text{-}$Order Paths), an algorithm that employs cross$\text{-}$validation to robustly distinguish meaningful higher$\text{-}$order dependencies from noise. In both synthetic and real$\text{-}$world datasets, DIVOP outperforms two state$\text{-}$of$\text{-}$the$\text{-}$art algorithms by achieving higher precision, recall, and sparser representations of the underlying dynamics. When applied to global corporate ownership data, DIVOP reveals that tax havens appear in 82$\%$ of all significant higher$\text{-}$order dependencies, underscoring their outsized influence in corporate networks. By mitigating overfitting, DIVOP enables more reliable multi$\text{-}$step predictions and decision$\text{-}$making, paving the way toward deeper insights into the hidden structures that drive modern interconnected systems.</description>

      <title>Counting Clinical Trials: New Evidence on Pharmaceutical Sector Productivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08030v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a method for assigning high-quality labels to unstructured text. This method is based on fine-tuning an efficient, open-source language model with data extracted from a large, proprietary language model. We apply this method to construct a census of published clinical trials. With these data, we revisit a literature that contends that pharmaceutical sector productivity is declining. Central to this conclusion are measurements of substantial increases in the quantity of clinical trials over time, unmatched by trends in measures of output. In our data, the quantity, quality, and composition of clinical trials are stable since 2010. We show that previous measurements are an artifact of biases introduced by shifts in the composition of other forms of research.</description>
