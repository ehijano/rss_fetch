      <title>Reading the unreadable: Creating a dataset of 19th century English newspapers using image-to-text language models</title>

Abstract: Oscar Wilde said, "The difference between literature and journalism is that journalism is unreadable, and literature is not read." Unfortunately, The digitally archived journalism of Oscar Wilde's 19th century often has no or poor quality Optical Character Recognition (OCR), reducing the accessibility of these archives and making them unreadable both figuratively and literally. This paper helps address the issue by performing OCR on "The Nineteenth Century Serials Edition" (NCSE), an 84k-page collection of 19th-century English newspapers and periodicals, using Pixtral 12B, a pre-trained image-to-text language model. The OCR capability of Pixtral was compared to 4 other OCR approaches, achieving a median character error rate of 1%, 5x lower than the next best model. The resulting NCSE v2.0 dataset features improved article identification, high-quality OCR, and text classified into four types and seventeen topics. The dataset contains 1.4 million entries, and 321 million words. Example use cases demonstrate analysis of topic similarity, readability, and event tracking. NCSE v2.0 is freely available to encourage historical and sociological research. As a result, 21st-century readers can now share Oscar Wilde's disappointment with 19th-century journalistic standards, reading the unreadable from the comfort of their own computers.</description>
