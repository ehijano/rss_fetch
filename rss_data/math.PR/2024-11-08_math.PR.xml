      <title>Stochastic homogenization of dynamical discrete optimal transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to examine the large-scale behavior of dynamical optimal transport on stationary random graphs embedded in $\R^n$. Our primary contribution is a stochastic homogenization result that characterizes the effective behavior of the discrete problems in terms of a continuous optimal transport problem, where the homogenized energy density results from the geometry of the discrete graph.</description>

      <title>Holomorphic jump-diffusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a class of jump-diffusions, called holomorphic, of which the well-known classes of affine and polynomial processes are particular instances. The defining property concerns the extended generator, which is required to map a (subset of) holomorphic functions to themselves. This leads to a representation of the expectation of power series of the process' marginals via a potentially infinite dimensional linear ODE. We apply the same procedure by considering exponentials of holomorphic functions, leading to a class of processes named affine-holomorphic for which a representation for quantities as the characteristic function of power series is provided. Relying on powerful results from complex analysis, we obtain sufficient conditions on the process' characteristics which guarantee the holomorphic and affine-holomorphic properties and provide applications to several classes of jump-diffusions.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Approaches to The Energy Equality in Forced Surface Quasi-Geostrophic Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore probabilistic approaches to the deterministic energy equality for the forced Surface Quasi-Geostrophic (SQG) equation on a torus. First, we prove the zero-noise dynamical large deviations for a corresponding stochastic SQG equation, where the lower bound matches the upper bound on a certain closure of the weak-strong uniqueness class for the deterministic forced SQG equation. Furthermore, we show that the energy equality for the deterministic SQG equation holds on arbitrary time-reversible subsets of the domain, where we match the upper bound and the lower bound. Conversely, the violation of the deterministic energy equality breaks the lower bound of large deviations. These results extend the existing techniques in Gess, Heydecker, and the second author \cite{arXiv:2311.02223} to generalized Sobolev spaces with negative indices. Finally, we provide an analysis of the restricted quasi-potential and prove a conditional equivalence compared to the rate function of large deviations for the Gaussian distribution. This suggests a potential connection between non-Gaussian large deviations in equilibrium for the stochastic SQG equation and the open problem regarding the uniqueness of the deterministic SQG equation.</description>

      <title>Singular stochastic delay equations driven by fractional Brownian motion: Dynamics, longtime behaviour, and pathwise stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study differential equations with a linear, path dependent drift and discrete delay in the diffusion term driven by a $\gamma$-H\"older rough path for $\gamma &gt; \frac{1}{3}$. We prove well-posedness of these systems and establish a priori bounds for their solutions. Applying these results to an equation driven by a multidimensional fractional Brownian motion with Hurst paramter $H \in \big(\frac{1}{3},1\big)$, we can prove the existence of a Lyapunov spectrum for the linearized system that describes its long-time behaviour. Furthermore, we can deduce the existence of local stable, unstable, and center manifolds for the nonlinear equation. As an application, we can prove that under suitable conditions, the solution exhibits pathwise local exponential stability. En passant, we present new, concise and relatively short proofs for some classical results for $\mathcal{C}_0$-semigroups that build on the Multiplicative Ergodic Theorem formulated on Banach spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the article, we find the asymptotic distribution of the derivative of the taut string accompanying a Wiener process in a strip of fixed width on long time intervals. This enables to find explicit expressions for minimal energy (averaged function of the derivative) of an absolutely continuous function in this strip. For example, for kinetic energy which was considered earlier by Lifshits and Setterqvist, the minimal energy per unit of time tends to $\pi^2/6r^2$ where $r$ is the strip width.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the meeting level between squared Bessel (BESQ) flow lines of different dimensions, and show that it gives rise to a jump Markov process. We apply these results to the skew Brownian flow introduced by Burdzy and Chen \cite{burdzy2001local} and Burdzy and Kaspi \cite{burdzy2004lenses}. It allows us to extend the results of \cite{burdzy2001local} and of Gloter and Martinez \cite{gloter2013distance} describing the local time flow of skew Brownian motions. Finally, we compute the Hausdorff dimension of exceptional times revealed by Burdzy and Kaspi \cite{burdzy2004lenses} when skew Brownian flow lines bifurcate.</description>

      <title>Coupling between Brownian motion and random walks on the infinite percolation cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the supercritical $\mathbb{Z}^d$-Bernoulli percolation ($d \geq 2$), we give a coupling between the random walk on the infinite cluster and its limit Brownian motion, such that the typical distance between the paths during $[0,T]$ is of order $T^{\frac{1}{3}+o(1)}$. This partially answers an open question posed by Biskup [Probab. Surv., 8:294-373, 2011]. The construction of the coupling utilizes the optimal transport tool, and the analysis relies on local CLT and percolation density concentration. As an application, our result implies the law of the iterated logarithm proved by Duminil-Copin [arXiv:0809.4380], and further identifies the limit constant.</description>

      <title>Metastable Distributions of Semi-Markov Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider semi-Markov processes whose transition times and transition probabilities depend on a small parameter $\varepsilon$. Understanding the asymptotic behavior of such processes is needed in order to study the asymptotics of various randomly perturbed dynamical and stochastic systems. The long-time behavior of a semi-Markov process $X^\varepsilon_t$ depends on how the point $(1/\varepsilon, t(\varepsilon))$ approaches infinity. We introduce the notion of complete asymptotic regularity (a certain asymptotic condition on transition probabilities and transition times), originally developed for parameter-dependent Markov chains, which ensures the existence of the metastable distribution for each initial point and a given time scale $t(\varepsilon)$. The result may be viewed as a generalization of the ergodic theorem to the case of parameter-dependent semi-Markov processes.</description>

      <title>Dynkin ghost games with asymmetry and consolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a stopping game of preemption type between two players who both act under uncertain competition. In this framework we introduce, and study the effect of, (i) asymmetry of payoffs, allowing e.g. for different investment costs, and (ii) consolation, i.e. partial compensation to the forestalled stopper. In general, this setting does not offer an explicit equilibrium. Instead, we provide a general verification theorem, which we then use to explore various situations in which a solution can be constructed so that an equilibrium is obtained.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove an inequality relating the isoperimetric profile of a graph to the decay of the random walk total variation distance $\sup_{x\sim y} ||P^n(x,\cdot)-P^n(y,\cdot)||_{\mathrm{TV}}$. This inequality implies a quantitative version of a theorem of Salez (GAFA 2022) stating that bounded-degree graphs of non-negative Ollivier-Ricci curvature cannot be expanders. Along the way, we prove universal upper-tail estimates for the random walk displacement $d(X_0,X_n)$ and information $-\log P^n(X_0,X_n)$, which may be of independent interest.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we study a principal-agent problem in continuous time with multiple lump-sum payments (contracts) paid at different deterministic times. We reduce the non-zero sum Stackelberg game between the principal and agent to a standard stochastic optimal control problem. We apply our result to a benchmark model for which we investigate how different inputs (payment frequencies, payments' distribution, discounting factors, agent's reservation utility) affect the principal's value and agent's optimal compensations.</description>

      <title>Slow Mixing of Quantum Gibbs Samplers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Preparing thermal (Gibbs) states is a common task in physics and computer science. Recent algorithms mimic cooling via system-bath coupling, where the cost is determined by mixing time, akin to classical Metropolis-like algorithms. However, few methods exist to demonstrate slow mixing in quantum systems, unlike the well-established classical tools for systems like the Ising model and constraint satisfaction problems. We present a quantum generalization of these tools through a generic bottleneck lemma that implies slow mixing in quantum systems. This lemma focuses on quantum measures of distance, analogous to the classical Hamming distance but rooted in uniquely quantum principles and quantified either through Bohr spectrum jumps or operator locality.
  Using our bottleneck lemma, we establish unconditional lower bounds on the mixing times of Gibbs samplers for several families of Hamiltonians at low temperatures. For classical Hamiltonians with mixing time lower bounds $T_\mathrm{mix} = 2^{\Omega(n^\alpha)}$, we prove that quantum Gibbs samplers also have $T_\mathrm{mix} = 2^{\Omega(n^\alpha)}$. This applies to models like random $K$-SAT instances and spin glasses. For stabilizer Hamiltonians, we provide a concise proof of exponential lower bounds $T_\mathrm{mix} = 2^{\Omega(n)}$ on mixing times of good $n$-qubit stabilizer codes at low constant temperature, improving upon previous bounds of $T_\mathrm{mix} = 2^{\Omega(\sqrt n)}$. Finally, for $H = H_0 + h\sum_i X_i$ with $H_0$ diagonal in $Z$ basis, we show that a linear free energy barrier in $H_0$ leads to $T_\mathrm{mix} = 2^{\Omega(n)}$ for local Gibbs samplers at low temperature and small $h$. Even with sublinear barriers, we use Poisson Feynman-Kac techniques to lift classical bottlenecks to quantum ones establishing an asymptotically tight lower bound $T_\mathrm{mix} = 2^{n^{1/2-o(1)}}$ for the 2D transverse field Ising model.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide abstract, general and highly uniform rates of asymptotic regularity for a generalized stochastic Halpern-style iteration, which incorporates a second mapping in the style of a Krasnoselskii-Mann iteration. This iteration is general in two ways: First, it incorporates stochasticity in a completely abstract way rather than fixing a sampling method; secondly, it includes as special cases stochastic versions of various schemes from the optimization literature, including Halpern's iteration as well as a Krasnoselskii-Mann iteration with Tikhonov regularization terms in the sense of Bo\c{t}, Csetnek and Meier. For these particular cases, we in particular obtain linear rates of asymptotic regularity, matching (or improving) the currently best known rates for these iterations in stochastic optimization, and quadratic rates of asymptotic regularity are obtained in the context of inner product spaces for the general iteration. We utilize these rates to give bounds on the oracle complexity of such iterations under suitable variance assumptions and batching strategies, again presented in an abstract style. Finally, we sketch how the schemes presented here can be instantiated in the context of reinforcement learning to yield novel methods for Q-learning.</description>

      <title>Gluing methods for quantitative stability of optimal transport maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish quantitative stability bounds for the quadratic optimal transport map $T_\mu$ between a fixed probability density $\rho$ and a probability measure $\mu$ on $\mathbb{R}^d$. Under general assumptions on $\rho$, we prove that the map $\mu\mapsto T_\mu$ is bi-H\"older continuous, with dimension-free H\"older exponents. The linearized optimal transport metric $W_{2,\rho}(\mu,\nu)=\|T_\mu-T_\nu\|_{L^2(\rho)}$ is therefore bi-H\"older equivalent to the $2$-Wasserstein distance, which justifies its use in applications.
  We show this property in the following cases: (i) for any log-concave density $\rho$ with full support in $\mathbb{R}^d$, and any log-bounded perturbation thereof; (ii) for $\rho$ bounded away from $0$ and $+\infty$ on a John domain (e.g., on a bounded Lipschitz domain), while the only previously known result of this type assumed convexity of the domain; (iii) for some important families of probability densities on bounded domains which decay or blow-up polynomially near the boundary. Concerning the sharpness of point (ii), we also provide examples of non-John domains for which the Brenier potentials do not satisfy any H\"older stability estimate.
  Our proofs rely on local variance inequalities for the Brenier potentials in small convex subsets of the support of $\rho$, which are glued together to deduce a global variance inequality. This gluing argument is based on two different strategies of independent interest: one of them leverages the properties of the Whitney decomposition in bounded domains, the other one relies on spectral graph theory.</description>

      <title>Structure Matters: Dynamic Policy Gradient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study $\gamma$-discounted infinite-horizon tabular Markov decision processes (MDPs) and introduce a framework called dynamic policy gradient (DynPG). The framework directly integrates dynamic programming with (any) policy gradient method, explicitly leveraging the Markovian property of the environment. DynPG dynamically adjusts the problem horizon during training, decomposing the original infinite-horizon MDP into a sequence of contextual bandit problems. By iteratively solving these contextual bandits, DynPG converges to the stationary optimal policy of the infinite-horizon MDP. To demonstrate the power of DynPG, we establish its non-asymptotic global convergence rate under the tabular softmax parametrization, focusing on the dependencies on salient but essential parameters of the MDP. By combining classical arguments from dynamic programming with more recent convergence arguments of policy gradient schemes, we prove that softmax DynPG scales polynomially in the effective horizon $(1-\gamma)^{-1}$. Our findings contrast recent exponential lower bound examples for vanilla policy gradient.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider an optimal control problem inspired by neuroscience, where the dynamics is driven by a Poisson process with a controlled stochastic intensity and an uncertain parameter. Given a prior distribution for the unknown parameter, we describe its evolution according to Bayes' rule. We reformulate the optimization problem using Girsanov's theorem and establish a dynamic programming principle. Finally, we characterize the value function as the unique viscosity solution to a finite-dimensional Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, which can be solved numerically.</description>

      <title>On asymptotic properties of high moments of compound Poisson distribution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2007.00379v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study asymptotic behavior of the moments $M_k(\lambda)$ of the sum $X_1+\dots+X_{N_\lambda}$, where $N_\lambda$ follows the Poisson probability distribution with mean value $\lambda$ and $\{X_j\}$ is a family of i.i.d. random variables also independent from $N_\lambda$. We obtain an explicit expression for the leading term of $M_k(\lambda)$ as $k\to\infty$ and study it in dependence of the asymptotic behavior of $\lambda= \lambda_k$.
  In application, we establish a concentration property of maximal vertex degree of large weighted random graphs. Another application is related with a variable that arises in the studies of high moments of large random matrices. Finally, regarding three particular cases of probability distribution of $X_j$, we comment on the asymptotic behavior of certain combinatorial polynomials, including the Bell polynomials of even partitions.</description>

      <title>Intransitive dice tournament is not quasirandom</title>

      <description>arXiv:2011.10067v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We settle a version of the conjecture about intransitive dice posed by Conrey, Gabbard, Grant, Liu and Morrison in 2016 and Polymath in 2017. We consider generalized dice with $n$ faces and we say that a die $A$ beats $B$ if a random face of $A$ is more likely to show a higher number than a random face of $B$. We study random dice with faces drawn iid from the uniform distribution on $[0,1]$ and conditioned on the sum of the faces equal to $n/2$. Considering the "beats" relation for three such random dice, Polymath showed that each of eight possible tournaments between them is asymptotically equally likely. In particular, three dice form an intransitive cycle with probability converging to $1/4$. In this paper we prove that for four random dice not all tournaments are equally likely and the probability of a transitive tournament is strictly higher than $3/8$.</description>

Abstract: We establish the consistency of a local time approximation of a diffusion at a sticky threshold based on high-frequency observations. First, we prove the result for sticky Brownian motion, and then extend it to It\^o diffusions with a sticky point (SID). For this, we derive the pathwise formulation of an SID along with respective versions of key stochastic calculus results (It\^o formula, Girsanov theorem). Based on the local time approximation, we develop a consistent estimator for the stickiness parameter. We conclude with numerical experiments and assess statistical properties of the stickiness estimator and the local time approximation.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we examine a specific type of random chains and propose an unified approach to studying the degree-based topological indices, including their extreme values. We derive explicit analytical expressions for the expected values and variances of these indices and we establish the asymptotic behavior of the indices. Specifically, we analyze the first Zagreb index, Sombor index, Harmonic index, Geometric-Arithmetic index, Inverse Sum Index, and the second Zagreb index for various general random chains, including random phenylene, random polyphenyl, random hexagonal, and linear chains.</description>

      <title>A class of sparse Johnson--Lindenstrauss transforms and analysis of their extreme singular values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.14858v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Johnson--Lindenstrauss (JL) lemma is a powerful tool for dimensionality reduction in modern algorithm design. The lemma states that any set of high-dimensional points in a Euclidean space can be flattened to lower dimensions while approximately preserving pairwise Euclidean distances. Random matrices satisfying this lemma are called JL transforms (JLTs). Inspired by existing $s$-hashing JLTs with exactly $s$ nonzero elements on each column, the present work introduces an ensemble of sparse matrices encompassing so-called $s$-hashing-like matrices whose expected number of nonzero elements on each column is~$s$. The independence of the sub-Gaussian entries of these matrices and the knowledge of their exact distribution play an important role in their analyses. Using properties of independent sub-Gaussian random variables, these matrices are demonstrated to be JLTs, and their smallest and largest singular values are estimated non-asymptotically using a technique from geometric functional analysis. As the dimensions of the matrix grow to infinity, these singular values are proved to converge almost surely to fixed quantities (by using the universal Bai--Yin law), and in distribution to the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble (GOE) Tracy--Widom law after proper rescalings. Understanding the behaviors of extreme singular values is important in general because they are often used to define a measure of stability of matrix algorithms. For example, JLTs were recently used in derivative-free optimization algorithmic frameworks to select random subspaces in which are constructed random models or poll directions to achieve scalability, whence estimating their smallest singular value in particular helps determine the dimension of these subspaces.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we study integrals on the unitary group with respect to the Haar measure. We give a combinatorial interpretation in terms of maps of the asymptotic topological expansion, established previously by Guionnet and Novak. The maps we introduce -- the maps of unitary type -- satisfy Tutte like equations. It allows us to show that in the perturbative regime they describe the different orders of the asymptotic topological expansion. Furthermore, they generalize the monotone Hurwitz numbers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.07611v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore two aspects of geometric approximation via a coupling approach to Stein's method. Firstly, we refine precision and increase scope for applications by convoluting the approximating geometric distribution with a simple translation selected based on the problem at hand. Secondly, we give applications to several stochastic processes, including the approximation of Poisson processes with random time horizons and Markov chain hitting times. Particular attention is given to geometric approximation of random sums, for which explicit bounds are established. These are applied to give simple approximations, including error bounds, for the infinite-horizon ruin probability in the compound binomial risk process.</description>

Abstract: The existence of unique solutions is established for rough differential equations (RDEs) with path-dependent coefficients and driven by c\`adl\`ag rough paths. Moreover, it is shown that the associated solution map, also known as It\^o-Lyons map, is locally Lipschitz continuous. These results are then applied to various classes of rough differential equations, such as controlled RDEs and RDEs with delay, as well as stochastic differential equations with delay. To that end, a joint rough path is constructed for a c\`adl\`ag martingale and its delayed version, that corresponds to stochastic It\^o integration.</description>

      <title>Random walks with stochastic resetting in complex networks: a discrete time approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08394v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a discrete-time Markovian random walk with resets on a connected undirected network. The resets, in which the walker is relocated to randomly chosen nodes, are governed by an independent discrete-time renewal process. Some nodes of the network are target nodes, and we focus on the statistics of first hitting of these nodes. In the non-Markov case of the renewal process, we consider both light- and fat-tailed inter-reset distributions. We derive the propagator matrix in terms of discrete backward recurrence time PDFs and in the light-tailed case we show the existence of a non-equilibrium steady state. In order to tackle the non-Markov scenario, we derive a defective propagator matrix which describes an auxiliary walk characterized by killing the walker as soon as it hits target nodes. This propagator provides the information on the mean first passage statistics to the target nodes. We establish sufficient conditions for ergodicity of the walk under resetting. Furthermore, we discuss a generic resetting mechanism for which the walk is non-ergodic. Finally, we analyze inter-reset time distributions with infinite mean where we focus on the Sibuya case. We apply these results to study the mean first passage times for Markovian and non-Markovian (Sibuya) renewal resetting protocols in realizations of Watts-Strogatz and Barab\'asi-Albert random graphs. We show non trivial behavior of the dependence of the mean first passage time on the proportions of the relocation nodes, target nodes and of the resetting rates. It turns out that, in the large-world case of the Watts-Strogatz graph, the efficiency of a random searcher particularly benefits from the presence of resets.</description>

Abstract: We derive the KPZ equation as a continuum limit of height functions in asymmetric simple exclusion processes with a hyperbolic-scale drift that depends on the local particle configuration. To our knowledge, it is a first such result for a general class of particle systems with neither duality nor explicit invariant measures. The new tools to handle the lack of an invariant measure are estimates for Kolmogorov equations that produce a more robust proof of the Kipnis-Varadhan inequality. These tools are not exclusive to KPZ.</description>

      <title>The supercooled Stefan problem with transport noise: weak solutions and blow-up</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20421v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive two weak formulations for the supercooled Stefan problem with transport noise on a half-line: one captures a continuously evolving system, while the other resolves blow-ups by allowing for jump discontinuities in the evolution of the temperature profile and the freezing front. For the first formulation, we establish a probabilistic representation in terms of a conditional McKean--Vlasov problem, and we then show that there is finite time blow-up with positive probability when part of the initial temperature profile exceeds a critical value. On the other hand, the system is shown to evolve continuously when the initial profile is everywhere below this value. In the presence of blow-ups, we show that the conditional McKean--Vlasov problem provides global solutions of the second weak formulation. Finally, we identify a solution of minimal temperature increase over time and we show that its discontinuities are characterized by a natural resolution of emerging instabilities with respect to an infinitesimal external heat transfer.</description>
