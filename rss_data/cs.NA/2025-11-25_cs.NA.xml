      <title>Variational Tensor-Product Splines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multidimensional continuous-domain inverse problems are often solved by the minimization of a loss functional, formed as the sum of a data fidelity and a regularization. In this work, we present a new construction where the regularization is itself built as the sum of two terms: i) the M norm of the regularizing operator L1 b L2, with L1 and L2 being two one-dimensional differential operators; ii) a bounded-variation norm that regularizes on the infinite-dimensional nullspace of L1 b L2. In this construction, we show that the extreme points of the solution set are the tensor product of one-dimensional splines, with a number of atoms upper-bounded in term of the number of data points. Further, when the data of the inverse problem is localized, we reveal that the term ii) must take the form of a sum of bounded-variation norms, precomposed with partial derivative of different orders.</description>

      <title>The Closest Point Method for Surface PDEs with General Boundary Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize the closest point method (CPM) to solve surface partial differential equations with general boundary conditions. The proposed extrapolation method provides a unified framework for treating a broad class of inhomogeneous Neumann and Robin boundary conditions within the framework of CPM. The accuracy and robustness of the method are demonstrated through numerical convergence studies of an elliptic problem, Steklov eigenvalue problems, and a nonlinear reaction-diffusion system.</description>

      <title>Fast and stable global interpolation based on equidistant points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the symmetric wave interpolation method for stable global interpolation using readily available equidistant points. Its key achievement is the integration of the practical utility of such points with the numerical stability of Chebyshev interpolation. Experimental results demonstrate that symmetric wave interpolation effectively suppresses the Runge phenomenon and, crucially, delivers accuracy that matches or even surpasses Chebyshev interpolation. This work thereby provides a robust and practical solution that bridges the long-standing gap between point accessibility and numerical stability in global interpolation.</description>

      <title>Coupling of conforming and mixed finite element methods for a model of wave propagation in thermo-poroelasticity in the frequency domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A dynamic linear thermo-poroelasticity model, containing inertial and relaxation terms with second-order time derivatives, is investigated in this paper. The mathematical and numerical analysis of this model is performed in the frequency domain. The variational formulation is analyzed within the framework of Fredholm's alternative and T-coercivity. Under appropriate assumptions on the coefficients, the well-posedness of the problem is proved. For its discretization, we propose a stabilized coupling of conforming and mixed finite element spaces, which are free of volumetric locking, and both, pressure as well as temperature oscillations. By incorporating projections in certain sesquilinear forms, the well-posedness of the finite element solution can be obtained through a similar reasoning as in the continuous case. Optimal error estimates are derived for all variables. Numerical studies validate the accuracy and robustness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Two-step Generalized RBF-Generated Finite Difference Method on Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving partial differential equations (PDEs) on manifolds defined by randomly sampled point clouds is a challenging problem in scientific computing and has broad applications in various fields. In this paper, we develop a two-step generalized radial basis function-generated finite difference (gRBF-FD) method for solving PDEs on manifolds without boundaries, identified by randomly sampled point cloud data. The gRBF-FD is based on polyharmonic spline kernels and multivariate polynomials (PHS+Poly) defined over the tangent space in a local Monge coordinate system. The first step is to regress the local target function using a generalized moving least squares (GMLS) while the second step is to compensate for the residual using a PHS interpolation. Our gRBF-FD method has the same interpolant form with the standard RBF-FD but differs in interpolation coefficients. Our approach utilizes a specific weight function in both the GMLS and PHS steps and implements an automatic tuning strategy for the stencil size K (i.e., the number of nearest neighbors) at each point. These strategies are designed to produce a Laplacian matrix with a specific coefficient structure, thereby enhancing stability and reducing the solution error. We establish an error bound for the operator approximation in terms of the so-called local stencil diameter as well as in terms of the number of data. We further demonstrate the high accuracy of gRBF-FD through numerical tests on various smooth manifolds.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a family of integral equation-based solvers for the heat equation, reaction-diffusion systems, the unsteady Stokes equation and the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in two space dimensions. Our emphasis is on the development of methods that can efficiently follow complex solution features in space-time by refinement and coarsening at each time step on an adaptive quadtree. For simplicity, we focus on problems posed in a square domain with periodic boundary conditions. The performance and robustness of the methods are illustrated with several numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Trigonometric-Interpolation Based Approach for Second-Order Volterra Integro-Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The trigonometric interpolation has been recently applied to solve a second-order Fredholm integro-differentiable equation (FIDE). It achieves high accuracy with a moderate size of grid points and effectively addresses singularities of kernel functions. In addition, it work well with general boundary conditions and the framework can be generalized to work for FIDEs with a high-order ODE component. In this paper, we apply the same idea to develop an algorithm for the solution of a second-order Volterra integro-differentiable equation (VIDE) with the same advantages as in the study of FIDE. Numerical experiments with various boundary conditions are conducted with decent performances as expected.</description>

      <title>Numerical Approximation of Lambert W Function For Real Values By Unique Method of Quadratic Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new numerical method for approximating the Lambert W function in the real domain. The method transforms the function into a simpler form that allows iterative refinement of an initial guess. Two iterative strategies are proposed for positive inputs, and the method is extended to handle negative inputs within a defined range. Unlike standard methods, this approach works for both branches without restrictive initial assumptions. Examples and software demonstrate the accuracy and flexibility of the method.</description>

      <title>Stationarity preservation and the low Mach number behaviour of the Discontinuous Galerkin method on Cartesian grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to added numerical stabilization (diffusion), the stationary states of numerical methods for hyperbolic problems need not be consistent discretizations of those of the PDEs. A closely related phenomenon is the lack of consistency of common finite volume methods for the Euler equations in the limit of low Mach number. In this work, the stationary states of the Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method for linear acoustics on Cartesian grids are explored theoretically and experimentally, thus extending previous studies in the context of first-order finite difference methods. It is found that for a polynomial degree above some threshold, DG is stationarity preserving, but depending on the choice of numerical flux can suffer from a reduction of the order of accuracy at stationary state. This allows to explain the behaviour of the method for the Euler equations at low Mach number.</description>

      <title>Introduction and Numerical Validation of an Open-Source MATLAB Package for Quantitative Ultrasound Tomography via Ray-Born Inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a MATLAB package for reconstructing sound-speed images from transmission ultrasound data. The package is based on two-point ray tracing and implements two complementary inversion strategies for image reconstruction. The first is a time-of-flight (ToF) method that produces low-resolution, low-contrast images with minimal artefacts. The second is a ray-Born inversion method, which integrates high-frequency ray theory with the Born approximation to generate high-resolution sound-speed reconstructions. Early iterations of the ToF reconstruction are used to provide an initial estimate for the more advanced ray-Born approach. The core of this software package consists of four ray-tracing algorithms, whose accuracy is assessed in this study with respect to known analytical trajectories and accumulated acoustic path lengths. Furthermore, both image-reconstruction strategies have been validated numerically with simulated synthetic datasets and experimentally with open-source in-vitro and in-vivo datasets in related parallel studies.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking stabilized and self-stabilized p-virtual element methods with variable coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Standard Virtual Element Methods (VEM) are based on polynomial projections and require a stabilization term to evaluate the contribution of the non-polynomial component of the discrete space. However, the stabilization term does not generally conform to the physics of the considered problem and a criterion for its choice is not typically supported by theoretical arguments. Hence, stabilization-free and self-stabilized formulations have been proposed. Moreover, the accuracy of VEM deteriorates in case of problems with variable coefficients, that are not usually accounted when constructing polynomial projections. The mentioned aspects might limit the use of the method when tackling real-world applications. This paper provides an in-depth numerical investigation into different stabilized and self-stabilized formulations for the p-version of VEM. The results show that self-stabilized and stabilization-free formulations achieve optimal accuracy, while suffering from worse conditioning. Moreover, a new approach for dealing with variable coefficients is introduced: the discrete space is modified so that general coefficients can be accounted when computing the polynomial projectors. Numerical results show that this new approach is more robust than the standard ones.</description>

      <title>Local Multilevel Preconditioned Jacobi-Davidson Method for Elliptic Eigenvalue Problems on Adaptive Meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose an efficient adaptive multilevel preconditioned Jacobi-Davidson (PJD) method for eigenvalue problems with singularity. Our multilevel method utilizes a local smoothing strategy to solve the preconditioned Jacobi-Davidson algebraic systems arising from adaptive finite element methods (AFEM). As a result, the algorithm holds optimal computational complexity $O(N)$. The theoretical analysis reveals that our method has a uniform convergence rate with respect to mesh levels and degrees of freedom. Further, the convergence rate is not affected by highly discontinuous coefficients within the domain. Numerical results verify our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>A Smoothly Varying Quadrature Approach for 3D IgA-BEM Discretizations: Application to Stokes Flow Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel quadrature strategy for Isogeometric Analysis (IgA) boundary element discretizations, specifically tailored to collocation methods. Thanks to the dimensionality reduction and the natural handling of unbounded domains, boundary integral formulations are particularly appealing in the IgA framework. However, they require the evaluation of boundary integrals whose kernels exhibit singular or nearly singular behavior. Even when the kernel is not singular, its numerical evaluation becomes challenging whenever the integration region lies close to a collocation point. These integrals of polar and nearly singular functions represent the main computational difficulty of IgA-BEM and motivate the development of efficient and accurate quadrature rules. Unlike traditional methods that classify integrals as singular, nearly singular, or regular, our approach employs a desingularizing change of variables that smoothly adapts to the physical distance from singularities in the boundary integral kernels. The transformation intensifies near the polar point and progressively weakens when integrating over portions of the domain that are farther from it, ultimately leaving the integrand unchanged in the limit of a diametrically opposed region. This automatic calibration enhances accuracy and robustness by eliminating the traditional classification step, to which the approximation quality is often highly sensitive. Moreover, integration is performed directly over B-spline supports rather than over individual elements, reducing computational cost, particularly for higher-degree splines. The proposed method is validated through boundary element benchmarks for the three dimensional Stokes problem, where we achieve excellent convergence rates.</description>

      <title>Multigrid with Linear Storage Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the discretization error for the solution of a partial differential equation (PDE) decreases, the precision required to store the corresponding coefficients naturally increases. Storing the solution's finite element coefficients explicitly requires $\mathcal O(n \log n)$ bits of storage, where $n$ is the number of degrees of freedom (DoFs). This paper presents a full multigrid method to compute the solution in a compressed format that reduces the storage complexity of the solution and intermediate vectors to $\mathcal O(n)$ bits. This reduction allows a matrix-free implementation to solve elliptic PDEs with an overall linear space complexity. For problems limited by the memory capacity of current supercomputers, we expect a memory footprint reduction of about an order of magnitude compared to state-of-the-art mixed-precision methods. We demonstrate the applicability of our algorithm by solving two model problems. Depending on the PDE and polynomial degree, but irrespective of the problem size, the solution vector on the finest grid requires between 4 and 12 bits per DoF, and the residual and correction require 3 to 6 bits each. Additional data is stored on the coarse grids with modestly increasing bit widths toward coarser grids.</description>

      <title>Scientific Calculator With The Aid Of Geometry And Based Upon It, A Mechanical Calculator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scientific calculations involving multiplication, division, exponents, inverse exponents of real numbers, geometric mean, reciprocal, Euler number, logarithm, and antilogarithm are generally carried out using battery operated electronic calculators. In this paper, geometric methods employing properties of similar right angled triangles have been devised for performing error free scientific calculations without the use of batteries. Based on this method, a mechanical analogue calculator has also been designed. A right-angled triangle with one perpendicular side of unit length is drawn, and from the vertex of the right angle, a perpendicular is drawn onto the hypotenuse. From the point of intersection of this perpendicular with the hypotenuse, another perpendicular is drawn to the base, and this process is continued until n perpendiculars are drawn. The resultant figure is a right angled triangle containing n similar triangles. Using properties of similar triangles, it is found that the lengths of the first, second, third so on till last perpendicular form a geometric series. If the length of the nth perpendicular is equated to a given real positive quantity less than one, and the base angle is adjusted, then the length of the first perpendicular represents the nth root of the given quantity. If the given quantity is greater than one, its reciprocal is equated to the length of the nth perpendicular, and the reciprocal of the first perpendicular gives the nth root. In this manner, several scientific calculations can be performed using geometric techniques.</description>

      <title>Numerical Approximation In Real Domain Of Special Function Of Product Of A Variable And Its Double Exponential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose of writing this paper is to solve a transcendental function containing a product of a variable and its double exponential by a unique method of approximation. If the value of the said product is given, then its inverse function is approximated by use of linear expression in place of natural logarithm of a positive real quantity and, that transforms the function to a quadratic equation. Roots of the equation are, then used for solving the function. For precise approximation, the process is iterated a number of times and more the number of iterations, more precise will be the approximation. To prove truthfulness of the formulae derived, a number of examples are given in tabular form.</description>

      <title>Finite Element Spaces of Double Two-Forms With Polynomial Coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop finite element spaces of symmetric tensor products of two-forms with polynomial coefficients. In three dimensions, these give higher order finite element spaces of matrix fields with normal-normal continuity, which have applications to the TDNNS method for elasticity, for example. In general dimension, these spaces can be used to represent the Riemann curvature tensor in numerical relativity. In many ways, our methods parallel Li's work generalizing Regge calculus to higher order, as Regge elements can be thought of as symmetric tensor products of one-forms. However, whereas the constant coefficient Regge space has one shape function per edge, the constant coefficient space of double-forms in our paper has one shape function per triangle and two shape functions per tetrahedron, so we must address the fact that there are shape functions of two different types. Like Li, we obtain an explicit geometrically decomposed basis of shape functions.</description>

      <title>Reduced-Basis Deep Operator Learning for Parametric PDEs with Independently Varying Boundary and Source Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parametric PDEs power modern simulation, design, and digital-twin systems, yet their many-query workloads still hinge on repeatedly solving large finite-element systems. Existing operator-learning approaches accelerate this process but often rely on opaque learned trunks, require extensive labeled data, or break down when boundary and source data vary independently from physical parameters. We introduce RB-DeepONet, a hybrid operator-learning framework that fuses reduced-basis (RB) numerical structure with the branch-trunk architecture of DeepONet. The trunk is fixed to a rigorously constructed RB space generated offline via Greedy selection, granting physical interpretability, stability, and certified error control. The branch network predicts only RB coefficients and is trained label-free using a projected variational residual that targets the RB-Galerkin solution. For problems with independently varying loads or boundary conditions, we develop boundary and source modal encodings that compress exogenous data into low-dimensional coordinates while preserving accuracy. Combined with affine or empirical interpolation decompositions, RB-DeepONet achieves a strict offline-online split: all heavy lifting occurs offline, and online evaluation scales only with the RB dimension rather than the full mesh. We provide convergence guarantees separating RB approximation error from statistical learning error, and numerical experiments show that RB-DeepONet attains accuracy competitive with intrusive RB-Galerkin, POD-DeepONet, and FEONet while using dramatically fewer trainable parameters and achieving significant speedups. This establishes RB-DeepONet as an efficient, stable, and interpretable operator learner for large-scale parametric PDEs.</description>

      <title>Neural network approximation of regularized density functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Density functional theory is one of the most efficient and widely used computational methods of quantum mechanics, especially in fields such as solid state physics and quantum chemistry. From the theoretical perspecive, its central object is the universal density functional which contains all intrinsic information about the quantum system in question. Once the external potential is provided, in principle one can obtain the exact ground-state energy via a simple minimization. However, the universal density functional is a very complicated mathematical object and almost always it is replaced with its approximate variants. So far, no ``first principles'', mathematically consistent and convergent approximation procedure has been devised that has general applicability. In this paper, we propose such a procedure by first applying Moreau--Yosida regularization to make the exact functionals continuous (even differentiable) and then approximate the regularized functional by a neural network. The resulting neural network preserves the positivity and convexity of the exact functionals. More importantly, it is differentiable, so it can be directly used in a Kohn--Sham calculation.</description>

      <title>Solving Equilibrium Problem with New Inertial Technique</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose in this work a subgradient extragradient method with inertial and correction terms for solving equilibrium problems in a real Hilbert space. We obtain that the sequence generated by our proposed method converges weakly to a point in the solutions set of the equilibrium problem when the associated bivariate function is pseudomonotone and satisfies Lipschitz conditions. Furthermore, in a case where the bifunction is strongly pseudomonotone, we establish a linear convergence rate. Lastly, through different numerical examples, we demonstrate that the incorporation of multiple correction terms significantly improves our proposed method when compared with other methods in the literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose in this paper a proximal and contraction method for solving a convex mixed variational inequality problem in a real Hilbert space. To accelerate the convergence of our proposed method, we incorporate an inertial extrapolation term, two correction terms, and a relaxation technique. We therefore obtain a weak convergence result under some mild assumptions. Finally, we present numerical examples to practically demonstrate the effectiveness of the relaxation technique, the inertial extrapolation term, and the correction terms in our proposed method.</description>

      <title>A Trust-region Funnel Algorithm for Grey Box Optimisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Grey-box optimisation, where some parts of an optimisation problem are represented by explicit algebraic (glass-box) models while others are treated as black-box models lacking analytic derivatives, remains a challenge in process systems engineering. Trust-region (TR) methods provide a robust framework for grey-box problems by combining accurate glass-box derivatives with local reduced models (RMs) for black-box components. However, existing TR approaches often involve complex multi-layered formulations requiring extensive parameter tuning, or lack open-source implementations. Motivated by the recent advances in funnel-based convergence theory for nonlinear optimisation and the TR filter method, we propose a novel TR funnel algorithm for grey-box optimisation that replaces the filter acceptance criterion with a generalisable uni-dimensional funnel, maintaining a monotonically non-increasing upper bound on approximation error of the local black-box RMs. A global convergence proof to a first-order critical point is established. The algorithm, implemented in an open-source Pyomo framework, supports multiple RM forms and globalisation strategies (filter or funnel). Benchmark tests on seven numerical and engineering problems show that the TR funnel algorithm achieves comparable and often improved performance relative to the classical TR filter method. The TR funnel method thus provides a simpler, and extensible alternative for large-scale grey-box optimisation.</description>

      <title>Duality Perspective on Nonlinear Eigenproblems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate nonlinear eigenproblems for a broad class of proper, closed, convex functionals in reflexive Banach spaces. We develop a dual formulation of the nonlinear eigenproblem using the Fenchel conjugate and establish an equivalence to the primal problem. Further, we introduce a duality gap and a geometric characterization of eigenvectors that apply in general Banach spaces. We interpret the dual problem as the eigenproblem for the inverse operator of the primal problem. Concerning numerical methods for solving nonlinear eigenproblems, we analyze the inverse power method, framed as a dual power method, showing strong convergence in the case of absolutely p-homogeneous functionals. Our theoretical results are validated by extensive numerical experiments for the p-Laplacian. We further connect the flow-based proximal power method from the literature to the inverse power method and discuss two numerical approaches to approximate higher-order nonlinear eigenfunctions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2205.11596v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates properties of complex-valued eigenvalue trajectories for the interior transmission problem parametrized by the index of refraction for homogeneous media. Our theoretical analysis for the unit disk shows that the only intersection points with the real axis, as well as the unique trajectorial limit points as the refractive index tends to infinity, are Dirichlet eigenvalues of the Laplacian. Complementing numerical experiments even give rise to an underlying one-to-one correspondence between Dirichlet eigenvalues of the Laplacian and complex-valued interior transmission eigenvalue trajectories. We also examine other scatterers than the disk for which similar numerical observations can be made. We summarize our results in a conjecture for general simply-connected scatterers.</description>

Abstract: This paper explores the extension of dimension reduction (DR) techniques to the multi-dimension case by using the Einstein product. Our focus lies on graph-based methods, encompassing both linear and nonlinear approaches, within both supervised and unsupervised learning paradigms. Additionally, we investigate variants such as repulsion graphs and kernel methods for linear approaches. Furthermore, we present two generalizations for each method, based on single or multiple weights. We demonstrate the straightforward nature of these generalizations and provide theoretical insights. Numerical experiments are conducted, and results are compared with original methods, highlighting the efficiency of our proposed methods, particularly in handling high-dimensional data such as color images.</description>

      <title>Finite-dimensional approximations of push-forwards on locally analytic functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10769v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper develops a functional-analytic framework for approximating the push-forward induced by an analytic map from finitely many samples. Instead of working directly with the map, we study the push-forward on the space of locally analytic functionals and identify it, via the Fourier--Borel transform, with an operator on the space of entire functions of exponential type. This yields finite-dimensional approximations of the push-forward together with explicit error bounds expressed in terms of the smallest eigenvalues of certain Hankel moment matrices. Moreover, we obtain sample complexity bounds for the approximation from i.i.d.~sampled data. As a consequence, we show that linear algebraic operations on the finite-dimensional approximations can be used to reconstruct analytic vector fields from discrete trajectory data. In particular, we prove convergence of a data-driven method for recovering the vector field of an ordinary differential equation from finite-time flow map data under fairly general conditions.</description>

      <title>A Fast and Accurate Solver for the Fractional Fokker-Planck Equation with Dirac-Delta Initial Conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15315v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The classical Fokker-Planck equation (FPE) is a key tool in physics for describing systems influenced by drag forces and Gaussian noise, with applications spanning multiple fields. We consider the fractional Fokker-Planck equation (FFPE), which models the time evolution of probability densities for systems driven by L\'evy processes, relevant in scenarios where Gaussian assumptions fail. The paper presents an efficient and accurate numerical approach for the free-space FFPE with constant coefficients and Dirac-delta initial conditions. This method utilizes the integral representation of the solutions and enables the efficient handling of very high-dimensional problems using fast algorithms. Our work is the first to present a high-precision numerical solver for the free-space FFPE with Dirac-delta initial conditions. In addition to Dirac-delta initial data, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for initial conditions given by sums of Gaussians. This opens the door for future research on more complex scenarios, including those with variable coefficients and other types of initial conditions.</description>

      <title>Adaptive-Growth Randomized Neural Networks for PDEs: Algorithms and Numerical Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17225v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Randomized neural network (RaNN) methods have been proposed for solving various partial differential equations (PDEs), demonstrating high accuracy and efficiency. However, initializing the fixed parameters remains challenging. Additionally, RaNNs often struggle to approximate PDE solutions with sharp gradients or discontinuities when using smooth activations and shallow architectures. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive-Growth Randomized Neural Network (AG-RaNN) to address these challenges. We first design a frequency-based initialization for a shallow RaNN. Using the residual as an error indicator, we then adaptively grow the network in width (neuron growth) and depth (layer growth) to improve the accuracy of the numerical solution. The weights and biases of new neurons are constructed rather than trained, which enhances the approximation power without additional nonlinear optimization. To handle discontinuities, we further introduce a domain splitting strategy. We also establish a unified error analysis covering approximation, statistical, and optimization errors. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of AG-RaNN.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Steady-State Approach for Efficient Multiscale Simulation and Optimization of mAb Glycosylation in CHO Cell Culture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00281v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Glycosylation is a critical quality attribute for monoclonal antibody (mAb) production, influenced by both process conditions and cellular mechanisms. Multiscale mechanistic models, spanning from the bioreactor to the Golgi apparatus, have been proposed for analyzing the glycosylation process. However, these models are computationally intensive to solve when using traditional methods, making optimization and control challenging. In this work, we propose a quasi-steady-state (QSS) approach for efficiently solving the multiscale glycosylation model. By introducing the QSS assumption and assuming negligible nucleotide sugar donor (NSD) flux for glycosylation in the Golgi, the large-scale partial differential algebraic equation system is converted into a series of independent differential algebraic equation systems. Based on that representation, we develop a three-step QSS simulation method and further reduce computational time through parallel computing and nonuniform time grid strategies. Case studies in simulation, parameter estimation, and dynamic optimization demonstrate that the QSS approach can be more than 300-fold faster than the method of lines, with less than 1.6% relative errors. This work establishes a solid foundation for multiscale model-based optimization and control of the glycosylation process, supporting the implementation of quality by design.</description>

Abstract: A nonlinear generalisation of the PageRank problem involving the Moore-Penrose inverse of an incidence matrix is developed for local graph partitioning purposes. The Levenberg-Marquardt method with a full rank Jacobian variant provides a strategy for obtaining a numerical solution to the generalised problem. Sets of vertices are formed according to the ranking supplied by the solution, and a conductance criterion decides upon the set that best represents the cluster around a starting vertex. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world inspired graphs demonstrate the capability of the approach to not only produce low conductance sets, but to also recover local clusters with an accuracy that consistently surpasses state-of-the-art algorithms.</description>

      <title>Barycentric rational approximation for learning the index of a dynamical system from limited data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02000v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the task of data-driven identification of dynamical systems, specifically for systems whose behavior at large frequencies is non-standard, as encoded by a non-trivial relative degree of the transfer function or, alternatively, a non-trivial index of a corresponding realization as a descriptor system. We develop novel surrogate modeling strategies that allow state-of-the-art rational approximation algorithms (e.g., AAA and vector fitting) to better handle data coming from such systems with non-trivial relative degree. Our contribution is twofold. On one hand, we describe a strategy to build rational surrogate models with prescribed relative degree, with the objective of mirroring the high-frequency behavior of the high-fidelity problem, when known. The surrogate model's desired degree is achieved through constraints on its barycentric coefficients, rather than through ad-hoc modifications of the rational form. On the other hand, we present a degree-identification routine that allows one to estimate the unknown relative degree of a system from low-frequency data. By identifying the degree of the system that generated the data, we can build a surrogate model that, in addition to matching the data well (at low frequencies), has enhanced extrapolation capabilities (at high frequencies). We showcase the effectiveness and robustness of the newly proposed method through a suite of numerical tests.</description>

      <title>Boundary corrections for kernel approximation to differential operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09332v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kernel-based approach to operator approximation for partial differential equations has been shown to be unconditionally stable for linear PDEs and numerically exhibit unconditional stability for non-linear PDEs. These methods have the same computational cost as an explicit finite difference scheme but can exhibit order reduction at boundaries. In previous work on periodic domains, [8,9], order reduction was addressed, yielding high-order accuracy. The issue addressed in this work is the elimination of order reduction of the kernel-based approach for a more general set of boundary conditions. Further, we consider the case of both first and second order operators. To demonstrate the theory, we provide not only the mathematical proofs but also experimental results by applying various boundary conditions to different types of equations. The results agree with the theory, demonstrating a systematic path to high order for kernel-based methods on bounded domains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09634v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we revisit nonlinear generalized minimal residual method (NGMRES) applied to nonlinear problems. NGMRES is used to accelerate the convergence of fixed-point iterations, which can substantially improve the performance of the underlying fixed-point iterations. We consider NGMRES with a finite window size $m$, denoted as NGMRES($m$). However, there is no convergence analysis for NGMRES($m$) applied to nonlinear systems. We prove that for general $m&gt;0$, the residuals of NGMRES($m$) converge r-linearly under some conditions. For $m=0$, we prove that the residuals of NGMRES(0) converge q-linearly.</description>

      <title>Multilevel Picard approximations for McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations with nonconstant diffusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03205v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce multilevel Picard (MLP) approximations for McKean--Vlasov stochastic differential equations (SDEs) with nonconstant diffusion coefficient. Under standard Lipschitz assumptions on the coefficients, we show that the MLP algorithm approximates the solution of the SDE in the $L^2$-sense without the curse of dimensionality. The latter means that its computational cost grows at most polynomially in both the dimension and the reciprocal of the prescribed error tolerance. In two numerical experiments, we demonstrate its applicability by approximating McKean--Vlasov SDEs in dimensions up to 1000.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07093v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Establishing Lipschitz stability estimates is crucial for ensuring the mathematical robustness of neural network (NN) approximations in machine learning (ML)-based parameter estimation, particularly in physics-informed settings. In this work, we derive such estimates for the inverse of a nonlinear map defined on a manifold that captures both unknown parameters and the nonlinear physical processes they influence. Our analysis is based on finite-dimensional, learnable representations of the manifold and provides Lipschitz stability estimates on the manifold-based subspaces, for a class of inverse maps associated with parameter dependent linear compact operators. Such operators model scattered and far-field data that can be used to detect structures such as cracks. We apply our theoretical ML manifold framework to inverse Helmholtz problems in unbounded regions exterior to cracks, addressing the scattered-field data-driven inverse problem while ensuring injectivity conditions on the manifold, a requirement for the Lipschitz stability. Our method accurately recovers crack-defining parameters without requiring prior knowledge of inputs such as incident wave types or external forces on the crack. Numerical experiments using NN approximations confirm the accuracy, efficiency, and robustness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Filtered Markovian Projection: Dimensionality Reduction in Filtering for Stochastic Reaction Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07918v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stochastic reaction networks (SRNs) model stochastic effects for various applications, including intracellular chemical or biological processes and epidemiology. A typical challenge in practical problems modeled by SRNs is that only a few state variables can be dynamically observed. Given the measurement trajectories, one can estimate the conditional probability distribution of unobserved (hidden) state variables by solving a stochastic filtering problem. In this setting, the conditional distribution evolves over time according to an extensive or potentially infinite-dimensional system of coupled ordinary differential equations with jumps, known as the filtering equation. The current numerical filtering techniques, such as the filtered finite state projection (D'Ambrosio et al., 2022), are hindered by the curse of dimensionality, significantly affecting their computational performance. To address these limitations, we propose to use a dimensionality reduction technique based on the Markovian projection (MP), initially introduced for forward problems (Ben Hammouda et al., 2024). In this work, we explore how to adapt the existing MP approach to the filtering problem and introduce a novel version of the MP, the Filtered MP, that guarantees the consistency of the resulting estimator. The novel consistent MP filter employs a reduced-variance particle filter for estimating the jump intensities of the projected model and solves the filtering equations in a low-dimensional space. The analysis and empirical results highlight the superior computational efficiency of projection methods compared to the existing filtered finite state projection in the large dimensional setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11074v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a higher-order dimensionality reduction framework based on the Trace Ratio (TR) optimization problem. We establish conditions for existence and uniqueness of solutions and clarify the theoretical connection between the Trace Ratio and its surrogate, the Ratio Trace (RT) formulation. Building on these foundations, we design a Newton-type iterative algorithm that operates directly in the tensor domain via the Einstein product, avoiding data flattening and preserving multi-dimensional structure.
  This approach extends classical Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to higher-order tensors, offering a natural generalization of trace-based dimensionality reduction from matrices to tensors. Numerical experiments on several benchmark datasets confirm the efficiency and robustness of the proposed methods, showing consistent improvements over existing matrix- and tensor-based techniques.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19481v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The time-harmonic Maxwell equations with impedance boundary condition and large wave number are discretized using the second-type N\'{e}d\'{e}lec's edge element method (EEM). Preasymptotic error bounds are derived, showing that, under the mesh condition $\kappa^{2p+1}h^{2p}$ being sufficiently small, the error of the EEM of order $p$ in the energy norm is bounded by $\mathcal{O}\big(\kappa^{p}h^p + \kappa^{2p+1}h^{2p}\big)$, while the error in the $\kappa$-scaled $\boldsymbol{L}^2$ norm is bounded by $\mathcal{O}\big((\kappa h)^{p+1} + \kappa^{2p+1} h^{2p}\big)$. Here, $\kappa$ is the wave number and $h$ is the mesh size. Numerical tests are provided to illustrate our theoretical results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03379v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A classical approach to the Calder\'on problem is to estimate the unknown conductivity by solving a nonlinear least-squares problem. It leads to a nonconvex optimization problem which is generally believed to be riddled with bad local minimums. We revisit this issue in the case of piecewise constant radial conductivities and prove that, contrary to previous claims, there are no spurious critical points in the case of two scalar unknowns with no measurement noise. We also provide a partial proof of this result in the general setting which holds under a numerically verifiable assumption. Finally, we investigate whether a recently proposed approach based on convexification yields better reconstructions. For the first time, we propose a way to implement it in practice and show that it is consistently outperformed by some least squares solvers, which are also faster and require less measurements.</description>

      <title>When do World Models Successfully Learn Dynamical Systems?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04898v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the use of compact latent representations with learned time dynamics ('World Models') to simulate physical systems. Drawing on concepts from control theory, we propose a theoretical framework that explains why projecting time slices into a low-dimensional space and then concatenating to form a history ('Tokenization') is so effective at learning physics datasets, and characterise when exactly the underlying dynamics admit a reconstruction mapping from the history of previous tokenized frames to the next. To validate these claims, we develop a sequence of models with increasing complexity, starting with least-squares regression and progressing through simple linear layers, shallow adversarial learners, and ultimately full-scale generative adversarial networks (GANs). We evaluate these models on a variety of datasets, including modified forms of the heat and wave equations, the chaotic regime 2D Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, and a challenging computational fluid dynamics (CFD) dataset of a 2D K\'arm\'an vortex street around a fixed cylinder, where our model is successfully able to recreate the flow.</description>

Abstract: This work presents a numerical analysis of computing transition states of semilinear elliptic partial differential equations (PDEs) via the index-1 saddle dynamics, or equivalently, the gentlest ascent dynamics. To establish clear connections between saddle dynamics and numerical methods of PDEs, as well as improving their compatibility, we first propose the continuous-in-space formulation of saddle dynamics for semilinear elliptic problems. This formulation yields a parabolic system that converges to saddle points. We then analyze the well-posedness, $H^1$ stability and error estimates of semi- and fully-discrete finite element schemes. Significant efforts are devoted to addressing the coupling, gradient nonlinearity, nonlocality of the proposed parabolic system, and the impacts of retraction due to the norm constraint. The error estimate results demonstrate the accuracy and index-preservation of the discrete schemes.</description>

Abstract: The deep Kolmogorov method is a simple and popular deep learning based method for approximating solutions of partial differential equations (PDEs) of the Kolmogorov type. In this work we provide an error analysis for the deep Kolmogorov method for heat PDEs. Specifically, we reveal convergence with convergence rates for the overall mean square distance between the exact solution of the heat PDE and the realization function of the approximating deep neural network (DNN) associated with a stochastic optimization algorithm in terms of the size of the architecture (the depth/number of hidden layers and the width of the hidden layers) of the approximating DNN, in terms of the number of random sample points used in the loss function (the number of input-output data pairs used in the loss function), and in terms of the size of the optimization error made by the employed stochastic optimization method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09533v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the inverse source problem arising in bioluminescence tomography, the objective of which is to reconstruct both the support and the intensity of an internal light source from boundary measurements governed by an elliptic model. A shape optimization framework is developed in which the source intensity and its support are decoupled through first-order optimality conditions. To enhance the stability of the reconstruction, we incorporate a parameter-dependent coupled complex boundary method together with perimeter and volume regularizations. Source support is represented by a level set function, allowing the algorithm to naturally accommodate topological changes and recover multiple, closely spaced, or nested source regions. Theoretical justifications for the proposed formulation and regularization strategy are established, and extensive numerical experiments are performed to assess the reconstruction accuracy for both noise-free and noisy data. The results demonstrate that our method achieves robust and accurate recovery of source geometry and intensity, and exhibits clear advantages over existing approaches.</description>

Abstract: Multi-view clustering has been widely used in recent years in comparison to single-view clustering, for clear reasons, as it offers more insights into the data, which has brought with it some challenges, such as how to combine these views or features. Most of recent work in this field focuses mainly on tensor representation instead of treating the data as simple matrices. This permits to deal with the high-order correlation between the data which the based matrix approach struggles to capture. Accordingly, we will examine and compare these approaches, particularly in two categories, namely graph-based clustering and subspace-based clustering. We will conduct and report experiments of the main clustering methods over a benchmark datasets.</description>

      <title>PINNsFailureRegion Localization and Refinement through White-box AdversarialAttack</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.11789v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have shown great promise in solving partial differential equations (PDEs). However, vanilla PINNs often face challenges when solving complex PDEs, especially those involving multi-scale behaviors or solutions with sharp or oscillatory characteristics. To precisely and adaptively locate the critical regions that fail in the solving process we propose a sampling strategy grounded in white-box adversarial attacks, referred to as WbAR. WbAR search for failure regions in the direction of the loss gradient, thus directly locating the most critical positions. WbAR generates adversarial samples in a random walk manner and iteratively refines PINNs to guide the model's focus towards dynamically updated critical regions during training. We implement WbAR to the elliptic equation with multi-scale coefficients, Poisson equation with multi-peak solutions, high-dimensional Poisson equations, and Burgers equation with sharp solutions. The results demonstrate that WbAR can effectively locate and reduce failure regions. Moreover, WbAR is suitable for solving complex PDEs, since locating failure regions through adversarial attacks is independent of the size of failure regions or the complexity of the distribution.</description>

      <title>An Unconditional Representation of the Conditional Score in Infinite-Dimensional Linear Inverse Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15643v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Score-based diffusion models (SDMs) have emerged as a powerful tool for sampling from the posterior distribution in Bayesian inverse problems. However, existing methods often require multiple evaluations of the forward mapping to generate a single sample, resulting in significant computational costs for large-scale inverse problems. To address this, we propose an unconditional representation of the conditional score function (UCoS) tailored to linear inverse problems, which avoids forward model evaluations during sampling by shifting computational effort to an offline training phase. In this phase, a \emph{task-dependent} score function is learned based on the linear forward operator. Crucially, we show that the conditional score can be derived \emph{exactly} from a trained (unconditional) score using affine transformations, eliminating the need for conditional score approximations. Our approach is formulated in infinite-dimensional function spaces, making it inherently discretization-invariant. We support this formulation with a rigorous convergence analysis that justifies UCoS beyond any specific discretization. Finally we validate UCoS through high-dimensional computed tomography (CT) and image deblurring experiments, demonstrating both scalability and accuracy.</description>

      <title>Why Does Stochastic Gradient Descent Slow Down in Low-Precision Training?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07142v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-precision training has become crucial for reducing the computational and memory costs of large-scale deep learning. However, quantizing gradients introduces magnitude shrinkage, which can change how stochastic gradient descent (SGD) converges. In this study, we explore SGD convergence under a gradient shrinkage model, where each stochastic gradient is scaled by a factor \( q_k \in (0,1] \). We show that this shrinkage affect the usual stepsize \( \mu_k \) with an effective stepsize \( \mu_k q_k \), slowing convergence when \( q_{\min} &lt; 1 \). With typical smoothness and bounded-variance assumptions, we prove that low-precision SGD still converges, but at a slower pace set by \( q_{\min} \), and with a higher steady error level due to quantization effects. We analyze theoretically how lower numerical precision slows training by treating it as gradient shrinkage within the standard SGD convergence setup.</description>

      <title>Convex relaxation approaches for high-dimensional optimal transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13847v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optimal transport (OT) is a powerful tool in mathematics and data science but faces severe computational and statistical challenges in high dimensions. We propose convex relaxation approaches based on marginal and cluster moment relaxations that exploit locality and correlative sparsity in the distributions. These methods approximate high-dimensional couplings using low-order marginals and sparse moment statistics, yielding semidefinite programs that provide lower bounds on the OT cost with greatly reduced complexity. For Gaussian distributions with sparse correlations, we prove reductions in both computational and sample complexity, and experiments show the approach also works well for non-Gaussian cases. In addition, we demonstrate how to extract transport maps from our relaxations, offering a simpler and interpretable alternative to neural networks in generative modeling. Our results suggest that convex relaxations can provide a promising path for dimension reduction in high-dimensional OT.</description>

      <title>A Wave Front Tracking Scheme for Flux Reconstruction in $2\times 2$ Hyperbolic Conservation Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15261v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel wave front tracking framework for reconstructing unknown flux functions in $2\times 2$ hyperbolic conservation laws, extending beyond the well-studied scalar case. By analyzing Riemann solutions at fixed observation times, we develop explicit reconstruction formulas that handle arbitrary combinations of shock and rarefaction waves through a unified equivalent shock concept. Our method constructs piecewise quadratic $C^1$ flux approximations with rigorous convergence guarantees: the approximation errors decrease quadratically with the discretization parameters for function values and linearly for derivatives under $C^{1,1}$ regularity, with enhanced cubic and quadratic convergence respectively under $C^3$ regularity. Applications to the isentropic Euler equations and the mathematically equivalent p-system in compressible fluid dynamics demonstrate the method's capability to identify complete equations of state from limited dynamic measurements, providing a systematic approach to a fundamental inverse problem in continuum mechanics.</description>
