      <title>A free fermions in disguise model with claws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, several spin chain models have been discovered that admit solutions in terms of "free fermions in disguise." A graph-theoretical treatment of such models was also established, giving sufficient conditions for free fermionic solvability. These conditions involve a particular property of the so-called frustration graph of the Hamiltonian, namely that it must be claw-free. Additionally, one set of sufficient conditions also requires the absence of so-called even holes. In this paper, we present a model with disguised free fermions where the frustration graph contains both claws and even holes. Special relations between coupling constants ensure that the free fermionic property still holds. The transfer matrix of this model can be factorized in a special case, thereby proving the conjectured free fermionic nature of a special quantum circuit published recently by two of the present authors. This is the first example of free fermions in disguise with both claws and even holes simultaneously.</description>

      <title>Simulation of a generalized asset exchange model with investment and income mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An agent-based model of the economy is generalized to incorporate investment and guaranteed income mechanisms in addition to the exchange and distribution mechanisms considered in earlier models. We find realistic wealth distributions and realistic values of the Gini coefficients and the Pareto index. We also show that although the system reaches a steady state, the system is not in thermal equilibrium. The nonequilibrium behavior is associated with the multiplicative noise generated by the investment mechanism.</description>

      <title>Dimensionality-induced dynamical phase transition in the large deviation of local time density for Brownian motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the fluctuation properties of the local time density, ${\rho _T} = \frac{1}{T}\int_0^T {\delta ( {r(t) - 1} )} dt$, spent by a $d$-dimensional Brownian particle at a spherical shell of unit radius, where $r(t)$ denotes the radial distance from the particle to the origin. In the large observation time limit, $T \to \infty$, the local time density $\rho_T$ obeys the large deviation principle, $P(\rho _T= \rho) \sim e^{-T I(\rho)}$, where the rate function $I(\rho)$ is analytic everywhere for $d\leq 4$. In contrast, for $d&gt;4$, $I(\rho)$ becomes nonanalytic at a specific point $\rho=\rho_c^{(d)}$, where $\rho_c^{(d)}=d(d-4)/(2d-4)$ depends solely on dimensionality. The singularity signals the occurrence of a first-order dynamical phase transition in dimensions higher than four. Such a transition is accompanied by temporal phase separations in the large deviations of Brownian trajectories. Finally, we validate our theoretical results using a rare-event simulation approach.</description>

      <title>Topological Defect Formation Beyond the Kibble-Zurek Mechanism in Crossover Transitions with Approximate Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation of topological defects during continuous second-order phase transitions is well described by the Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM). However, when the spontaneously broken symmetry is only approximate, such transitions become smooth crossovers, and the applicability of KZM in these scenarios remains an open question. In this work, we address this problem by analyzing both a weakly coupled Ginzburg-Landau model and a strongly coupled holographic setup, each featuring pseudo-spontaneous breaking of a global U(1) symmetry. In the slow quench regime, we observe a breakdown of the universal power-law scaling predicted by the Kibble-Zurek Mechanism. Specifically, the defect density acquires an exponential correction dependent on the quench rate, following a universal form dictated by the source of explicit symmetry breaking. Although these dynamics extend beyond the scope of the traditional KZM, we demonstrate that a generalized framework, that incorporates the effects of explicit symmetry breaking into the dynamical correlation length, remains valid and accurately captures the non-equilibrium defect formation across the entire range of quench rates.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic uncertainty relation for feedback cooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Feedback cooling enables a system to achieve low temperatures through measurement-based control. Determining the thermodynamic cost required to achieve the ideal cooling efficiency within a finite time remains an important problem. In this work, we establish a thermodynamic uncertainty relation (TUR) for feedback cooling in classical underdamped Langevin systems, thereby deriving a trade-off between the cooling efficiency and the entropy reduction rate. The obtained TUR implies that simultaneous achievement of the ideal cooling efficiency and finite entropy reduction rate is asymptotically possible by letting the fluctuation of the reversible local mean velocity diverge. This is shown to be feasible by using a feedback control based on the Kalman filter. Our results clarify the thermodynamic costs of achieving the fundamental cooling limit of feedback control from the perspective of the TUR.</description>

      <title>Surface tension of monoatomic liquids after relaxation: the main energy contributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the atomistic origin and the main mechanisms determining the energy of a liquid interface after relaxation. A simple theory is constructed for the monatomic densely packed liquids that allows calculation of the surface tension coefficients based on the interatomic potential parameters, without fitting coefficients. Considered are the potential energies of both &lt;&lt;broken&gt;&gt; and stretched bonds between surface atoms. The later contribution is found to be from $20 \%$ to $45 \%$, with an average stretching of the first layer in the range of $7 \% - 14 \%$. The equality of the unit tension force and the unit surface energy is shown. The calculated surface tension coefficients relate to the experimental values as $1.0 - 1.3$ for the ten $fcc$ substances considered. For twenty $bcc$ substances, this range is $0.65 - 1.35$. The increase of density of the second atomic layer is predicted, due to its influence on the coordination number of surface atoms. For a convex surface, increase in the surface tension coefficient with increase in curvature is predicted.</description>

      <title>An explicit formula of the Oslo stationary state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In most sandpile models under driven-dissipative condition, a critical stationary state is known to emerge. This state displays organization features encoded in the dynamical (e.g. avalanche spectrum) and static (e.g. hyperuniformity) observables. However, the access to the explicit stationary state expression happens only in few cases, and for most sandpile models the question is still open. In this article, we derive such an expression for the Oslo model. To do so, we use different representations of the system configurations and of the dynamical process. Back and forth between these representations allows to tag invariant quantities to each configurations. The stationary probabilities are obtained by summing over all paths leading to a given configuration under the constraint specified by the invariants. This description corresponds exactly to a parametrized path integral formulation in discrete space-time.</description>

      <title>Collective heat engines via different interactions: Minimal models, thermodynamics and phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics and thermodynamics of a framework composed of interacting units in which parameters (temperatures and energies) assume distinct values due to the contact with distinct (cold and hot) thermal reservoirs. The influence of different ingredients, such as the contact between thermal baths (simultaneous versus not simultaneous contact), the coupling between them (equal or different couplings) and the topology of interactions (all-to-all and local interactions). Closed expressions for transition lines have obtained, expressed by a linear combination of interaction energies times reciprocal temperatures for the simultaneous thermal contact baths and deviates from it when the contact is not simultaneous. The interplay between performance and dissipation is investigated under different conditions, giving rise to a richness of operation regimes, such as heat-engine and heat pump. The relationship between thermodynamic quantities (power, efficiency and dissipation) allows a careful choice of parameters to ensure the desirable compromise between them. Finally, the influence of different interactions energies (Ising, Potts versus Blume-Emery-Griffiths (BEG) like) are investigated, revealing that Potts interactions in general present superior performances than BEG ones.</description>

      <title>Generalized Holstein-Primakoff mapping and $1/N$ expansion of collective spin systems undergoing single particle dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a generalization of the Schwinger boson and Holstein-Primakoff transformations that is applicable to ensembles of $N$ spin $1/2$'s with weak permutational symmetry. These generalized mappings are constructed by introducing two independent bosonic variables that describe fluctuations parallel and transverse to the collective Bloch vector built out of the original spin $1/2$'s. Using this representation, we develop a systematic $1/N$ expansion and write down explicitly leading and next-to-leading order terms. We then illustrate how to apply these techniques using four example systems: (i) an ensemble of atoms undergoing spontaneous emission, incoherent pumping and single particle dephasing; (ii) a superradiant laser above and in the vicinity of the upper lasing transition; (iii) the all-to-all transverse field Ising model subject to incoherent pumping in the vicinity of its ordering phase transition; and (iv) the Dicke model at finite temperature both away and in the vicinity of its thermal phase transition. Thus, these mappings provide a common, Bloch-sphere based, geometrical description of all-to-all systems subject to single particle dissipation or at finite temperature, including their phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Low dimensional dynamics of a sparse balanced synaptic network of quadratic integrate-and-fire neurons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kinetics of a balanced network of neurons with a sparse grid of synaptic links is well representable by the stochastic dynamics of a generic neuron subject to an effective shot noise. The rate of delta-pulses of the noise is determined self-consistently from the probability density of the neuron states. Importantly, the most sophisticated (but robust) collective regimes of the network do not allow for the diffusion approximation, which is routinely adopted for a shot noise in mathematical neuroscience. These regimes can be expected to be biologically relevant. For the kinetics equations of the complete mean field theory of a homogeneous inhibitory network of quadratic integrate-and-fire neurons, we introduce circular cumulants of the genuine phase variable and derive a rigorous two cumulant reduction for both time-independent conditions and modulation of the excitatory current. The low dimensional model is examined with numerical simulations and found to be accurate for time-independent states and dynamic response to a periodic modulation deep into the parameter domain where the diffusion approximation is not applicable. The accuracy of a low dimensional model indicates and explains a low embedding dimensionality of the macroscopic collective dynamics of the network. The reduced model can be instrumental for theoretical studies of inhibitory-excitatory balances neural networks.</description>

      <title>Active Particle Doping Suppresses Brittle Failure in Ultrastable Glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultrastable glasses are known for their exceptional mechanical stability but often fail in a brittle manner, typically marked by the formation of shear bands when subjected to shear deformation. An open question is how shear banding is affected by active particles. Here, we address this issue by investigating ultrastable glasses that are doped with self-propelled particles (SPPs) that perform run-and-tumble motions. In the presence of active particles we find a crossover from heterogeneous to homogeneous yielding. Through extensive computer simulations of a polydisperse model, which is capable of producing ultrastable glasses using swap Monte Carlo Methods, we demonstrate the progressive emergence of multiple shear bands under activity, leading to continuous and delayed yielding. Interestingly, we uncover a compensatory relationship between active forces and global shear rates: a rise in one can offset a decline in the other, arising from the isomorphic-like behavior exhibited by different combinations of active forces and strain rates. We also identify a non-monotonic relationship between yielding and persistence time: while the yield stress increases at shorter persistence times with increasing active forces, it tends to decrease with longer persistence times. This observation highlights a tunable range of activity that can modify the yielding mode. Lastly, we show that the spacing between shear bands diminishes in a power law manner as the magnitude of the active force increases.</description>

      <title>Epidemic threshold and localization of the SIS model on directed complex networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model on directed complex networks within the quenched mean-field approximation. Combining results from random matrix theory with an analytic approach to the distribution of fixed-point infection probabilities, we derive the phase diagram and show that the model exhibits a nonequilibrium phase transition between the absorbing and endemic phases for $c \geq \lambda^{-1}$, where $c$ is the mean degree and $\lambda$ the average infection rate. Interestingly, the critical line is independent of the degree distribution but is highly sensitive to the form of the infection-rate distribution. We further show that the inverse participation ratio of infection probabilities diverges near the epidemic threshold, indicating that the disease may become localized on a small fraction of nodes. These results provide a comprehensive picture of how network heterogeneities shape epidemic spreading on directed contact networks.</description>

      <title>Round Aztec windows, a dual of the Aztec diamond theorem and a curious symmetry of the correlation of diagonal slits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fairly shortly after the publication of the Aztec diamond theorem of Elkies, Kuperberg, Larsen and Propp in 1992, interest arose in finding the number of domino tilings of an Aztec diamond with an ``Aztec window,'' i.e.\ a hole in the shape of a smaller Aztec diamond at its center. Several intriguing patterns were discovered for the number of tilings of such regions, but the numbers themselves were not ``round'' -- they didn't seem to be given by a simple product formula. In this paper we consider a very closely related shape of holes (namely, odd Aztec rectangles), and prove that a large variety of regions obtained from Aztec rectangles by making such holes in them possess the sought-after property that the number of their domino tilings is given by a simple product formula. We find the same to be true for certain symmetric cruciform regions. We also consider graphs obtained from a toroidal Aztec diamond by making such holes in them, and prove a simple formula that governs the way the number of their perfect matchings changes under a natural evolution of the holes. This yields in particular a natural dual of the Aztec diamond theorem. Some implications for the correlation of such holes are also presented, including an unexpected symmetry for the correlation of diagonal slits on the square grid.</description>

      <title>Intuition emerges in Maximum Caliber models at criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Whether large predictive models merely parrot their training data or produce genuine insight lacks a physical explanation. This work reports a primitive form of intuition that emerges as a metastable phase of learning that critically balances next-token prediction against future path-entropy. The intuition mechanism is discovered via mind-tuning, the minimal principle that imposes Maximum Caliber in predictive models with a control temperature-like parameter $\lambda$. Training on random walks in deterministic mazes reveals a rich phase diagram: imitation (low $\lambda$), rule-breaking hallucination (high $\lambda$), and a fragile in-between window exhibiting strong protocol-dependence (hysteresis) and multistability, where models spontaneously discover novel goal-directed strategies. These results are captured by an effective low-dimensional theory and frame intuition as an emergent property at the critical balance between memorizing what is and wondering what could be.</description>

      <title>Description length of canonical and microcanonical models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.05645v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The (non-)equivalence of canonical and microcanonical ensembles is a fundamental question in statistical physics, concerning whether the use of soft and hard constraints in the maximum-entropy construction leads to the same description of a system. Despite the fact that maximum-entropy models are also commonly used in statistical inference, pattern detection, and hypothesis testing, a complete understanding of the effects of ensemble non-equivalence on statistical modeling is still missing. Here, we study this problem from a rigorous model selection perspective by comparing canonical and microcanonical models via the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle, which yields a trade-off between likelihood, measuring model accuracy, and complexity, measuring model flexibility and its potential to overfit data. We compute the Normalized Maximum Likelihood (NML) of both formulations and find that: (i) microcanonical models always achieve higher likelihood but are always more complex; (ii) the optimal model choice depends on the empirical values of the constraints -- the canonical model performs best when its fit to the observed data exceeds its uniform average fit across all realizations; (iii) in the thermodynamic limit, the difference in description length per node vanishes when ensemble equivalence holds but persists otherwise, showing that non-equivalence implies extensive differences between large canonical and microcanonical models. Finally, we compare the NML approach to Bayesian methods, showing that (iv) the choice of priors, practically irrelevant in equivalent models, becomes crucial when an extensive number of constraints is enforced, possibly leading to very different outcomes.</description>

      <title>The Fluctuation-Dissipation Relations: Growth, Diffusion, and Beyond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10134v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this review, we scrutinize historical and modern results on the linear response of dynamical systems to external perturbations with a particular emphasis on the celebrated relationship between fluctuations and dissipation expressed by the fluctuation-dissipation theorem (FDT). The conceptual foundation of FDT originates from the definition of the equilibrium state and Onsager's regression hypothesis. Over time, the fluctuation-dissipation relation has been vividly investigated also in systems far from equilibrium, which often exhibit wild fluctuations in measured parameters. In this review, we recall the major formulations of the FDT, including those proposed by Langevin, Onsager and Kubo. We discuss the role of fluctuations in a broad class of growth and diffusion phenomena and examine the violation of the FDT resulting from a transition from Euclidean to fractal geometry. Finally, we highlight possible generalizations of the FDT formalism and discuss situations where the relation breaks down and is no longer applicable.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear projection for ballistic correlation functions: a formula in terms of minimal connected covers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05266v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In many-body systems, the dynamics is governed, at large scales of space and time, by the hydrodynamic principle of projection onto the conserved densities admitted by the model. This is formalised as local relaxation of fluctuations in the Ballistic Macroscopic Fluctuation Theory, and is a nonlinear version of the Boltzmann-Gibbs principle. We use it to derive a projection formula, expressing $n$-point connected correlation functions (cumulants) of generic observables at different space-time points, in terms of those of conserved densities. This applies in every $d\geq 1$ spatial dimensions and under the ballistic scaling of space and time, both in and out of equilibrium. It generalises the well-known linear-response principle for 2-point functions. For higher-point functions, one needs to account for nonlinear fluctuations of conserved densities and, correspondingly, higher derivatives of local averages. Using Malyshev's formula for the cumulant expansion, and keeping the leading order, the result is a nonlinear projection, expressed as a sum of products of correlation functions of conserved densities with equilibrium multivariances as coefficients. The sum is combinatorially organised via certain covers of the set of space-time points, which we call minimal connected covers. We use this in order to get general, explicit formulas for two- and three-point functions in stationary states, expressed in terms of thermodynamic and Euler-scale data.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic noise in one dimension: projected Kubo formula and how it vanishes in integrable models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05279v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hydrodynamic noise is the Gaussian process that emerges at larges scales of space and time in many-body systems. It is justified by the central limit theorem, and represents degrees of freedom forgotten when projecting coarse-grained observables onto conserved quantities. It is the basis for fluctuating hydrodynamics, where it appears along with bare diffusion terms related to the noise covariance by the Einstein relation. In one spatial dimension, nonlinearities are relevant and may modify the corrections to ballistic behaviours by superdiffusive effects. But in systems where no shocks appear, such as linearly degenerate and integrable systems, the diffusive scaling of these corrections stays intact. Nevertheless, anomalies remain. We show that in such systems, the noise covariance is given by a modification of the Kubo formula, where effects of ballistic long-range correlations have been projected out, and that nonlinearities are tamed by a point-splitting regularisation. With these ingredients, we obtain a well-defined hydrodynamic fluctuation theory in the ballistic scaling of space-time, as a stochastic PDE. It describes the asymptotic expansion in the inverse variation scale of connected correlation functions, self-consistently organised via a cumulant expansion. The resulting anomalous hydrodynamic equation for average densities takes into account both long-range correlations and bare diffusion, generalising recent results. Despite these anomalies, two-point functions satisfy an ordinary diffusion equation, with diffusion matrix determined by the Kubo formula. In integrable systems, we show that hydrodynamic noise, hence bare diffusion, must vanish, as was conjectured recently, and argue that under an appropriate gauge of the currents, this is true at all orders. Thus the Ballistic Macroscopic Fluctuation Theory give the all-order hydrodynamic theory for integrable models.</description>

      <title>Chaos in Nonequilibrium Two-Temperature $(T_x, T_y)$ Nos\'e-Hoover Cell Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10863v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit a two-temperature Nos\'e-Hoover wanderer particle embedded in a two-dimensional periodic 2x2 cell with four smooth repulsive corners at $(x,y) = (\pm 1, \pm 1)$ to explore chaos with anisotropic thermostatting. The model employs separate thermostats in the x and y directions, enabling controlled deviations from equilibrium. By integrating the full six-dimensional equations of motion and computing the complete Lyapunov spectrum, we confirm chaos and quantify phase-space contraction with high numerical precision. The total contraction rate, interpreted as entropy production, increases nonlinearly with the thermostat anisotropy, deviating from the quadratic dependence expected from linear-response theory, $\Lambda\propto -\delta^{2}$. We compare two fits for $\Lambda$ as a function of $\delta = 0.5 -T_y$: 1) a power law, $\Lambda\propto -\delta^{2.44}$, 2) a quadratic-plus-quartic expansion. While the former captures low-driving behavior slightly better, the latter more accurately describes the strongly driven regime and remains consistent with the equilibrium limit. An empirical linear relation between dissipation and phase-space dimensionality loss is also identified, $\Lambda\propto (D_{KY}-6) / 3$, where $D_{KY}$ is the approximate Kaplan-Yorke dimension. Our results demonstrate that nonlinear dissipation scaling emerges naturally even in minimal driven systems. Momentum statistics show significant non-Gaussian behavior under strong driving. Despite its dissipative nature, the model remains strictly time-reversible, offering a pedagogically rich example of microscopic reversibility coexisting with macroscopic entropy production.</description>

      <title>Micellization in active matter of asymmetric self-propelled particles: Experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.16659v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Active matter composed of self-propelled particles features fascinating self-organization phenomena, spanning from motility-induced phase separation to phototaxis to topological excitations depending on the nature and parameters of the system. In the present paper, we consider micelle formation by active particles with a broken symmetry having a circular back and a sharpened nose toward which the particles accelerate. As we demonstrate in experiments with robotic swarms, such particles can either remain in the isotropic phase or form micelles depending on the location of their center of inertia, in accordance with a recent theoretical proposal [T. Kruglov and A. Borisov, Presentations and Videos to 7th Edition of the International Conference on Particle-based Methods (2021), Vol. CT07, p. 2]. Such a behavior is observed for both nonchiral particles moving linearly and placed in a parabolic potential and for chiral particles moving along circular trajectories on a flat surface. By performing experiments with single robots and two-robot collisions, we unveil that the observed emergence of micellization associated with shifting robots' center of inertia towards their noses is governed by at least two-particle effects, in particular, by a difference in the formation of stable two-robot clusters. Finally, we consider the dependence of micelle lifetime and formation probability as well as two-robot collisions on friction between the lateral surfaces of the robots. Crucially, the predicted micellization does not involve any solvation shells that give rise to the micellization of surfactants but is instead driven by an interplay of activity and particle shape asymmetry.</description>

      <title>Bipartite Fluctuations of Critical Fermi Surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04331v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fluctuations of conserved quantities within a subsystem are non-local observables that provide unique insights into quantum many-body systems. In this paper, we study bipartite charge (and spin) fluctuations across interaction-driven ``metal-insulator transitions'' out of Landau Fermi liquids. The ``charge insulators'' include a class of non-Fermi-liquid states of fractionalized degrees of freedom, such as compressible composite Fermi liquids (for spinless electrons) and incompressible spin-liquid Mott insulators (for spin-$1/2$ electrons). We find that charge fluctuations $F$ exhibit distinct leading-order scalings across the transition: $F \sim L\log(L)$ in Landau Fermi liquids and $F \sim L$ in charge insulators, where $L$ is the linear size of the subsystem. In composite Fermi liquids, under certain conditions, we also identify a universal constant term $-f(\theta)|\sigma_{xy}|/(2\pi)$ when the subsystem geometry contains a sharp corner, where $f(\theta)$ denotes a function of the corner angle, and $\sigma_{xy}$ is the Hall conductivity. At the critical point, provided the transition is continuous, the leading scaling $F\sim L$ is accompanied by a subleading universal corner contribution $-\log(L)f(\theta)C_{\rho}/2$ with the same angle dependence $f(\theta)$, and the universal coefficient $C_{\rho}$ is directly related to the predicted universal jumps in longitudinal and Hall resistivities. These results establish fluctuation-transport relations, paving the way for numerical and experimental studies of unconventional quantum criticalities in metals.</description>

      <title>Explicit decoders using fixed-point amplitude amplification based on QSVT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06051v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reliably transmitting quantum information via a noisy quantum channel is a central challenge in quantum information science. While constructing a decoder is crucial to this goal, little was known about quantum circuit implementations of decoders that reach high communication rates. In this paper, we provide two decoders with explicit quantum circuits capable of recovering quantum information when the decoupling condition is satisfied, i.e., when quantum information is in principle recoverable. These are applicable to both entanglement-assisted and non-assisted settings. By developing a technique that relies on a symmetric structure of the decoders, we show that they are applicable to any noise model. As a consequence, for any noisy channel, our decoders can be used to achieve a communication rate arbitrarily close to the quantum capacity by increasing the number of channel uses. To construct the decoders, we employ the fixed-point amplitude amplification (FPAA) based on the quantum singular value transformation (QSVT), extending a previous approach applicable only to erasure noise. Our constructions offer advantages in the computational cost, largely reducing the circuit complexity compared to previous explicit decoders. Through an investigation of the decoding problem, unique advantages of the QSVT-based FPAA are highlighted.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamics without Boost-Invariance from Kinetic Theory: From Perfect Fluids to Active Flocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00025v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive the hydrodynamic equations of perfect fluids without boost invariance [1] from kinetic theory. Our approach is to follow the standard derivation of the Vlasov hierarchy based on an a-priori unknown collision functional satisfying certain axiomatic properties consistent with the absence of boost invariance. The kinetic theory treatment allows us to identify various transport coefficients in the hydrodynamic regime. We identify a drift term that effects a relaxation to an equilibrium where detailed balance with the environment with respect to momentum transfer is obtained. We then show how the derivative expansion of the hydrodynamics of flocks can be recovered from boost non-invariant kinetic theory and hydrodynamics. We identify how various coefficients of the former relate to a parameterization of the so-called equation of kinetic state that yields relations between different coefficients, arriving at a symmetry-based understanding as to why certain coefficients in hydrodynamic descriptions of active flocks are naturally of order one, and others, naturally small. When inter-particle forces are expressed in terms of a kinetic theory influence kernel, a coarse-graining scale and resulting derivative expansion emerge in the hydrodynamic limit, allowing us to derive diffusion terms as infrared-relevant operators distilling different parameterizations of microscopic interactions. We conclude by highlighting possible applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01431v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the quantum-state-diffusion dynamics of the XXZ-staggered spin chain, also focusing on its noninteracting XX-staggered limit, and of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model. We describe the process through quantum trajectories and evaluate the nonstabilizerness (also known as ``magic'') along the trajectories, quantified through the stabilizer R\'enyi entropy (SRE). In the absence of measurements, we find that the SYK model is the only one in which the time-averaged SRE saturates the random state bound and has a scaling with the system size that is well described by the theoretical prediction for quantum chaotic systems. In the presence of measurements, we numerically find that the steady-state SRE versus the coupling strength to the environment is well fitted by a generalized Lorentzian function. The scaling of the fitting parameters with the system size suggests that the steady-state} SRE linearly increases with the system size in all the considered cases, and displays no measurement-induced quantum transition, as confirmed by the curves of the steady-state SRE versus the system size.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13218v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use concepts from quantum cryptography to relate the entanglement in many-body mixed states to standard correlation functions. If a system can be used as a resource for distilling private keys -- random classical bits that are shared by spatially separated observers but hidden from an eavesdropper having access to the environment -- we can infer that the state of the system is entangled. For thermal states, we derive a simple relation between the information accessible to the eavesdropper and the linear response of the system. This relation allows us to determine which spatial correlations can be used to detect entanglement across wide varieties of physical systems, and provides a new experimental probe of entanglement. We also show that strong symmetries of a density matrix imply the existence of correlations that are always hidden from the environment. This result implies that, although grand canonical ensembles are separable above a finite temperature, canonical ensembles are generically entangled at all finite temperatures.</description>

      <title>Line and Planar Defects with Zero Formation Free Energy: Applications of the Phase Rule toward Ripening-Immune Microstructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.24092v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extended one- and two-dimensional defects in crystalline materials are usually metastable. The thermodynamic ground state of the material is presumed to be defect-free. Here, we investigate the conditions under which extended defects, such as grain boundaries, can exist in a multicomponent alloy when the latter reaches the thermodynamic ground state allowed by the Gibbs phase rule. We treat all extended defects as low-dimensional phases on the same footing as the conventional bulk phases. Thermodynamic analysis shows that, in the ground state, the formation free energies of all extended defects must be zero, and the system must follow a generalized phase rule. The latter predicts that only a finite number of symmetry-related defect types can coexist in the material in the ground state. Guided by the phase rule, we discuss finite-size polycrystalline and/or polyphase microstructures that are fully immune to coarsening and their possible transformations.</description>

      <title>Simulations of dielectric permittivity of water by Machine Learned Potentials with long-range Coulombic interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04628v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dielectric permittivity of liquid water is a fundamental property that underlies its distinctive behaviors in numerious physical, biological, and chemical processes. Within a machine learning framework, we present a unified approach to compute the dielectric permittivity of water, systematically incorporating various electric boundary conditions. Our method employs a long-range-inclusive deep potential trained on data from hybrid density functional theory calculations. Dielectric response is evaluated using an auxiliary deep neural network that predicts the centers of maximally localized Wannier functions. We investigate three types of electric boundary conditions--metallic, insulating, and Kirkwood-Frohlich--to assess their influence on correlated dipole fluctuations and dielectric relaxation dynamics. In particular, we demonstrate a consistent methodology for computing the Kirkwood correlation factor, correlation length, and dielectric permittivity under each boundary condition, where long-range electrostatics play a critical role. This work establishes a robust and generalizable machine-learning framework for modeling the dielectric properties of polar liquids under diverse electrostatic environments.</description>
