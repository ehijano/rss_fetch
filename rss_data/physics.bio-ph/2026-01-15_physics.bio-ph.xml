      <title>Evolutionary tuning of TAM receptor-ligand interfaces highlights electrostatic features associated with regenerative phagocytic signaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient resolution of neuroinflammation and debris clearance is a key determinant of successful central nervous system regeneration. Regenerative vertebrates such as Danio rerio often exhibit faster immune resolution and debris clearance than mammals, yet the molecular determinants underlying these differences remain incompletely understood. TAM receptor tyrosine kinases (Tyro3, Axl, and Mertk) and their ligands Gas6 and Protein S are central regulators of phagocytosis and immune resolution in the nervous system, but whether intrinsic structural properties of these receptor-ligand complexes contribute to regenerative efficiency has not been systematically explored.
  Here, we present a comparative in silico analysis of TAM receptors and ligands from zebrafish, human, and mouse, integrating sequence evolution, high-confidence structural modeling, interface characterization, and electrostatic analysis. Despite substantial sequence divergence, ligand-binding domains display strong structural conservation, supporting a conserved global mode of TAM-ligand engagement. At the interface level, zebrafish complexes show enhanced electrostatic contributions and increased salt-bridge density, particularly in the Tyro3-Protein S interaction. Residue-level electrostatic analysis reveals clustered interface hotspots that are spatially conserved across species despite evolutionary rewiring of individual contacts.
  Together, these results suggest that TAM receptor-ligand interfaces are evolutionarily tuned through subtle electrostatic and geometric optimization rather than large-scale structural changes, providing a conserved yet adaptable framework for species-specific modulation of phagocytic signaling.</description>

      <title>Constitutive parameter inference using physics-based data-driven modeling in full volume datasets of intact and torn rotator cuff tendons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we characterized the material properties of an animal model of the rotator cuff tendon using full volume datasets of both its intact and injured states by capturing internal strain behavior throughout the tendon. Our experimental setup, involving tension along the fiber direction, activated volumetric, tensile, and shear mechanisms due to the tendon's complex geometry. We implemented an approach to model inference that we refer to as variational system identification (VSI) to solve the weak form of the stress equilibrium equation using these full volume displacements. Three constitutive models were used for parameter inference: a neo-Hookean model, a modified Holzapfel-Gasser-Ogden (HGO) model with higher-order terms in the first and second invariants, and a reduced polynomial model consisting of terms based on the first, second, and fiber-related invariants. Inferred parameters were further refined using an adjoint-based partial differential equation (PDE)-constrained optimization framework. Our results show that the modified HGO model captures the tendon's deformation mechanisms with reasonable accuracy, while the neo-Hookean model fails to reproduce key internal features, particularly the shear behavior in the injured tendon. Surprisingly, the simplified polynomial model performed comparably to the modified HGO formulation using only three terms. These findings suggest that while current constitutive models do not fully replicate the complex internal mechanics of the tendon, they are capable of capturing key trends in both intact and damaged tissue, using a homogeneous modeling approach. Continued model development is needed to bridge this gap and enable clinical-grade, predictive simulations of tendon injury and repair.</description>

      <title>Elasticity without a reference state: continuum mechanics of active tension nets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A constitutive relation between stress and strain relative to a reference state is the basic assumption of elasticity theory. However, in living matter, stress is governed by (motor molecule) activity rather than a constitutive law. What paradigm takes the place of elasticity in this setting? Here, we derive a continuum theory of active mechanics by taking the continuum limit of the Active Tension Network model of 2d epithelia. Instead of a reference state, we start from a prescribed active force configuration, encoded in a Riemannian "tension metric". Intuitively, one expects cells to adjust their positions to achieve force balance by rearranging local sources of active stress. More precisely, the cell positions define an embedding of the tension metric into 2d physical space, which determines the macroscopic physical stress. For free boundaries, tissue adopts a certain intrinsically defined shape, the force-balanced embedding with minimal internal stress. Boundary forces then deform this embedding. The resulting stress transformation yields an effective stress-strain relation. Key elements of elasticity hence emerge from a "stress-only" starting point, explaining how tissue shape can be adiabatically controlled by active stress during morphogenesis. Plastic behavior arises from topological cell rearrangement, which we represent by a continuous reparameterization of the tension metric, providing a principled continuum theory of emergent elasto-plastic flow. To express this physics, we use the mathematics of isothermal coordinates and quasi-conformal maps. The present theory elucidates the unconventional mechanics of living tissues and may apply to 2d active and granular materials more generally.</description>

      <title>Active alignment-driven coarsening in confined near-critical fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate vapor-liquid phase separation of an active near critical Lennard-Jones fluid confined within a cylindrical pore using molecular dynamics simulations. Activity is introduced via Vicsek-type alignment interactions, enabling a systematic study of how self-propulsion modifies domain morphology and coarsening kinetics under quasi-one-dimensional confinement. In the passive limit, the system undergoes early-time spinodal decomposition (diffusive growth characterized by the Lifshitz-Slyozov exponent $\alpha = 1/3$), followed by the formation of periodically modulated, plug-like liquid domains along the pore axis. At late times, coarsening becomes kinetically arrested, and the system remains trapped in a metastable striped state. Introducing activity destabilizes this arrested morphology by enhancing collective domain transport, leading to frequent domain mergers and complete phase separation at sufficiently high activity. The late-stage coarsening then exhibits a crossover to faster, ballistic growth with an effective exponent $\alpha = 2/3$, consistent with a cluster-coalescence mechanism. Analysis of two-point correlation functions and structure factors confirms dynamic scaling across all activity regimes. Our results demonstrate that alignment-induced activity can overcome confinement-driven kinetic arrest, providing new insight into phase separation in confined active fluids. The relevant growth laws are analyzed and interpreted using appropriate theoretical frameworks.</description>

      <title>A Magnetic-like Model for Chemotactic Navigation in Ants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17722v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a physical framework for ant navigation of chemical trails. For this, we use controlled experiments in which individuals follow narrow pheromone trails, for which ants display oscillatory motion, as previously reported in the literature. We model this behavior by treating chemotaxis as an effective magnetic interaction between the ant velocity and the local chemical gradient. Under suitable approximations, the model yields an analytical expression for the velocity correlations in the direction perpendicular to the trail, predicting an underdamped oscillatory decay. This theoretical prediction is in qualitative agreement with our experimental measurements, indicating that the model captures the essential dynamical features of ant trail following. We fit the model parameters to individual trajectories in order to assess the consistency of the underlying assumptions, finding the same parameter relationship in both theory and experiment. Our results contribute to the characterization of chemotactic navigation in ants and illustrate how physical modeling can provide mechanistic insights into complex biological dynamics.</description>

      <title>Designing semiconductor-electrochemical junctions for bioinspired energy transduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15863v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Long ago, life discovered how to efficiently push electrons thermodynamically uphill to lower potential by harnessing energy released by an equal number of electrons moving downhill. Known as electron bifurcation, this form of energy transduction has never been observed in the absence of natural enzymes. To successfully bifurcate electrons, a system must block short-circuit electron transfers that allow all electrons to flow downhill, while maintaining productive reactions. It is difficult to design systems that catalyze these highly-selective electron flows while minimizing free energy dissipation. Using theories of electron transfer and charge transport, I introduce semiconductor-electrolyte junctions that spontaneously bifurcate electrons analogously to natural enzymes (bifurcating junctions). I simulate a simple but illustrative bifurcating junction with typical material properties, and discuss how more complicated designs could achieve higher performance.</description>

      <title>High resolution quantum enhanced phase imaging of cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07965v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recovering both amplitude and phase information from a system is a fundamental goal of optical imaging. At the same time, it is crucial to operate at low photon doses to avoid altering the sample, particularly in biological applications. Quantum imaging provides a powerful route to extract more information per photon than classical techniques, which are ultimately limited by shot-noise. However, the trade-off between quantum noise reduction and spatial resolution has long been regarded as a major obstacle to the application of quantum techniques to small cellular and sub-cellular structures, where they could offer the greatest benefits. Here, we overcome this limitation by demonstrating sub-shot-noise quantitative phase imaging of biological cells based on the transport-of-intensity equation, enabling high-fidelity, label-free imaging of key cellular and sub-cellular features. We achieve high-resolution phase imaging limited only by the numerical aperture, while simultaneously obtaining a resolution-independent quantum advantage. Unlike other quantum imaging approaches, our method operates in a quasi-single-shot, wide-field configuration, retrieves both phase and amplitude information, and does not rely on interferometric measurements, making it intrinsically fast and stable. These results pave the way for the immediate application of sub-shot-noise imaging in biological microscopy.</description>
