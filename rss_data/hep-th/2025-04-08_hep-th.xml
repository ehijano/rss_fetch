      <title>Discrete Gauging of 6d SCFTs and Wreathed 3d $\mathcal{N}=4$ Quivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Higgs branch moduli space of certain 6d $(1,0)$ SCFTs after gauging their $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Green--Schwarz automorphism. We explain how to read the flavor symmetry of such SCFTs directly from the 6d construction, and we confirm the expectation by computing the Coulomb branch Hilbert series of their $\mathbb{Z}_2$-wreathed 3d $\mathcal{N}=4$ magnetic quiver. To perform the latter computation, we explicitly introduce a methodology to determine such Hilbert series for $\mathbb{Z}_2$-wreathed orthosymplectic quivers.</description>

      <title>Exact large $N$ expansion of $\mathcal{N}=4$ circular quiver Chern-Simons theories and squashing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we revisit the exact computation of the round sphere partition function of 3d $\mathcal{N}=4$ circular quiver Chern-Simons theories with mass and Fayet-Iliopoulos (FI) deformations. Utilizing the Fermi gas formalism, we derive the large $N$ expansion of the partition function and determine the Airy function structure, parameterized by three functions $C$, $B$ and $A$. We propose a novel closed-form expression for $A$ that incorporates the effects of FI parameters and satisfies various consistency constraints from quiver reductions. As an application, by using an accidental coincidence of the Fermi gas density matrices we extend our results to the squashed sphere partition function of $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills theories with an adjoint hypermultiplet and multiple fundamental hypermultiplets. Our findings provide further evidence for the universality of the Airy function structure in supersymmetric gauge theories of multiple M2-branes.</description>

      <title>Covariant quantization of gauge theories with Lagrange multipliers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisited the equivalence between the second- and first-order formulations of the Yang-Mills (YM) and gravity using the path integral formalism. We demonstrated that structural identities can be derived to relate Green's functions of auxiliary fields, computed in the first-order formulation, to Green's functions of composite fields in the second-order formulation. In YM theory, these identities can be verified at the integrand level of the loop integrals. For gravity, the path integral was obtained through the Faddeev-Senjanovi\'c procedure. The Senjanovi\'c determinant plays a key role in canceling tadpole-like contributions, which vanish in the dimensional regularization scheme but persist at finite temperature. Thus, the equivalence between the two formalisms is maintained at finite temperature. We also studied the coupling to matter. In YM theory, we investigated both minimal and non-minimal couplings. We derived first-order formulations, equivalent to the respective second-order formulations, by employing a procedure that introduces Lagrange multipliers (LM). This procedure can be easily generalized to gravity. We also considered an alternative gravity model, which is both renormalizable and unitary, that uses LM to restrict the loop expansion to one-loop order. However, this approach leads to a doubling of one-loop contributions due to the additional degrees of freedom associated with Ostrogradsky instabilities. To address this, we proposed a modified formalism that resolves these issues by requiring the path integral to be invariant under field redefinitions. This introduces ghost fields responsible for canceling the extra one-loop contributions arising from the LM fields, while also removing unphysical degrees of freedom. We also demonstrated that the modified formalism and the Faddeev-Popov procedure commute, indicating that the LM can be viewed as purely quantum fields.</description>

      <title>Finite-Temperature Perturbation Theory of Rotating Scalar Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate the finite-temperature perturbation theory of interacting scalar fields under external rotation. Because of the translational non-invariance in the radial direction, Green's functions are described using the Fourier-Bessel basis, instead of the conventional Fourier basis. We derive the leading order correction to the partition function and the one-loop self-energy, which involve an analytically intractable integral with Bessel functions. The Feynman rules obtained in our perturbation theory suggest that the zero-temperature thermodynamics of the perturbatively interacting theory is unaffected by rotation, similarly to that of the noninteracting theory.</description>

      <title>Equivalence Theorems and Double-Copy Structure in Scattering Amplitudes of Massive Kaluza-Klein States with Matter Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the scattering amplitudes of massive Kaluza-Klein (KK) states in compactified five-dimensional warped gauge and gravity theories. Focusing on tree-level $2\to2$ processes, we analyze the leading-order amplitudes involving bulk KK matter fields and KK gauge/gravitational Goldstone bosons. By imposing the gauge theory equivalence theorem (GAET) and the gravitational equivalence theorem (GRET) within warped KK theories, we systematically reconstruct the leading-order amplitudes for physical KK gauge bosons and gravitons, thereby circumventing the intricate energy cancellations inherent in physical amplitudes. Within this framework, the correspondence between GAET and GRET arises as a direct manifestation of the leading-order double-copy relation in the high-energy expansion. This connection provides a foundation for extending the BCJ double-copy construction to four-point amplitudes involving bulk KK matter fields, allowing for a systematic derivation of the corresponding gravitational amplitudes while consistently incorporating KK matter fields at leading order.</description>

      <title>Non-local charges from perturbed defects via SymTFT in 2d CFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate non-local conserved charges in perturbed two-dimensional conformal field theories from the point of view of the 3d SymTFT of the unperturbed theory. In the SymTFT we state a simple commutation condition which results in a pair of compatible bulk and defect perturbations, such that the perturbed line defects are conserved in the perturbed CFT. In other words, the perturbed defects are rigidly translation invariant, and such defects form a monoidal category which extends the topological symmetries. As examples we study the A-type Virasoro minimal models $M(p,q)$. Our formalism provides one-parameter families of commuting non-local conserved charges for perturbations by a primary bulk field with Kac label $(1,2)$, $(1,3)$, or $(1,5)$, which are the standard integrable perturbations of minimal models. We find solutions to the commutation condition also for other bulk perturbations, such as $(1,7)$, and we contrast this with the existence of local conserved charges. There has been recent interest in the possibility that in certain cases perturbations by fields such as $(1,7)$ can be integrable, and our construction provides a new way in which integrability can be found without the need for local conserved charges.</description>

      <title>Itzykson-Zuber correlators from character expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the consistency of character expansion for the Itzykson-Zuber (IZ) model in terms of Schur polynomials with the old formulas for pair correlators with the IZ measure. The non-symmetrical structure of the correlators led us to derive an ansatz for the decomposition of the differentiated Schur polynomials to calculate all the pair correlators. This opens a new way to study arbitrary IZ correlators of any order in character expansion.</description>

      <title>BCFW tilings and cluster adjacency for the amplituhedron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 2005, Britto, Cachazo, Feng and Witten gave a recurrence (now known as the BCFW recurrence) for computing scattering amplitudes in N=4 super Yang Mills theory. Arkani-Hamed and Trnka subsequently introduced the amplituhedron to give a geometric interpretation of the BCFW recurrence. Arkani-Hamed and Trnka conjectured that each way of iterating the BCFW recurrence gives a "triangulation" or "tiling" of the m=4 amplituhedron. In this article we prove the BCFW tiling conjecture of Arkani-Hamed and Trnka. We also prove the cluster adjacency conjecture for BCFW tiles of the amplituhedron, which says that facets of tiles are cut out by collections of compatible cluster variables for the Grassmannian Gr(4,n). Moreover we show that each BCFW tile is the subset of the Grassmannian where certain cluster variables have particular signs.</description>

      <title>Thin-shell Gravastar Model in a BTZ geometry with minimum length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct two spherically symmetric thin-shell gravastar models within a BTZ geometry with minimum length. Therefore, in the inner region of the gravastar, we consider an anti- de Sitter metric with minimum length. Thus, for the first model, we introduce the minimum length effect using the probability density of the ground state of the hydrogen atom in two dimensions. For the second gravastar model, we adopt a Lorentzian-type distribution. Also in the outer region, we consider the BTZ black hole metric. So, by examining the inner spacetime, the thin shell, and the outer spacetime, we find that there are different physical characteristics regarding their energy densities and pressures that make the gravastar stable. This effect persists even when the cosmological constant is zero. In addition, we determined the entropy of the gravastar thin shell. Besides, we explore the thermodynamic properties of the BTZ black hole with minimum length in Schwarzschild-type form and also check its stability.</description>

      <title>The ISW-Lensing Bispectrum &amp; Trispectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to the integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect, cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature and polarization fluctuations are correlated with the gravitational lensing potential. Famously, this induces a CMB three-point function, whose shape can be used to constrain dark energy and modifications to gravity. An analogous effect occurs at higher-order, producing an ISW-lensing trispectrum whose amplitude is hitherto unconstrained. We present a detailed discussion of this effect, and define minimum-variance estimators for the ISW-lensing three- and four-point functions. These are implemented within the PolySpec code, and bear strong similarities to the quadratic estimators used in lensing analyses. Applying these tools to Planck, we obtain strong detections of the bispectrum amplitude (consistent with previous works), but find only weak constraints on the trispectrum, due to a strong cancellation between the various ISW-induced contributions. We additionally forecast the constraints from future datasets, finding that (a) simple estimators for the ISW-lensing bispectrum will be severely limited by non-Gaussian modifications to the covariance, and (b) the ISW-lensing trispectrum will be very challenging to detect even with high-resolution future experiments. We finally consider the induced bias on primordial non-Gaussianity amplitudes (and lensing itself), which we show to be large for the bispectrum (as expected) but negligible for the trispectrum.</description>

      <title>The firewall paradox is Wigner's friend paradox</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The firewall paradox, a puzzle in black hole physics, depends on an implicit assumption: a rule that allows the infalling and the outside observer to combine their perspectives. However, a recent extension of the Wigner's friend paradox shows that such a combination rule conflicts with quantum theory $\unicode{x2013}$ without involving gravity. This challenges the usual conclusion of the firewall paradox, that standard quantum gravity assumptions are incompatible. More generally, black hole puzzles and Wigner's friend puzzles are closely related by a correspondence. This suggests that the firewall paradox may be a symptom of the same fundamental issue that leads to the extended Wigner's friend paradox.</description>

      <title>Exploring Leptogenesis in the Era of First Order Electroweak Phase Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel approach for implementing baryogenesis via leptogenesis at low scale within neutrino seesaw framework where a sufficient lepton asymmetry can be generated via out of equilibrium CP-violating decays of right handed neutrinos (RHNs) even when their mass falls below the Standard Model (SM) Higgs mass. It becomes possible by keeping the sphaleron in equilibrium below its conventional decoupling temperature $T_{\rm sp}^{\rm SM} \sim131.7$ GeV in SM so as to facilitate the conversion of lepton asymmetry to baryon asymmetry at such a low scale, thanks to the flexibility of the bubble nucleation temperature in case the electroweak phase transition (EWPT) is of first order. The scenario emerges as an exciting (and perhaps unique) possibility for low scale leptogenesis, particularly if the Universe attains a reheating temperature lower than 131.7 GeV. We show that a stochastic gravitational wave, characteristic of such first order EWPT, may be detected in near future detectors while the presence of RHNs of mass as low as 35 GeV opens up an intriguing detection possibility at current and future accelerator experiments.</description>

      <title>Simple third order operator-splitting schemes for stochastic mechanics and field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a method for constructing numerical schemes with up to 3rd strong convergence order for solution of a class of stochastic differential equations, including equations of the Langevin type. The construction proceeds in two stages. In the first stage one approximates the stochastic equation by a differential equation with smooth coefficients randomly sampled at each time step. In the second stage the resulting regular equation is solved with the conventional operator-splitting techniques. This separation renders the approach flexible, allowing one to freely combine the numerical techniques most suitable to the problem at hand. The approach applies to ordinary and partial stochastic differential equations. In the latter case, it naturally gives rise to pseudo-spectral algorithms. We numerically test the strong convergence of several schemes obtained with this method in mechanical examples. Application to partial differential equations is illustrated by real-time simulations of a scalar field with quartic self-interaction coupled to a heat bath. The simulations accurately reproduce the thermodynamic properties of the field and are used to explore dynamics of thermal false vacuum decay in the case of negative quartic coupling.</description>

      <title>The Quantum Channels of the Compton Scattering of an Entangled Pair of Photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the Compton scattering of an entangled pair of photons as an example, we demonstrate the process of deriving the Kraus operators corresponding to the interaction from the underlying fundamental theory, quantum electrodynamics. The normalization of the final density matrix of the entangled photons after the interaction is crucial to obtaining the correct correlations. The reduced density matrix of the photon, which does not participate in the interaction directly, remains unchanged. It indicates that quantum effects, using an entangled pair of photons for quantum sensing, can only be observed via the correlations or superposition of the complete entangled pair of photons.</description>

      <title>Tunneling time in non-Hermitian space fractional quantum mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the tunneling time of a wave packet propagating through a non-Hermitian potential $V_{r} - iV_{i}$ in space-fractional quantum mechanics. By applying the stationary phase method, we derive a closed-form expression for the tunneling time for this system. This study presents the first investigation of tunneling time at the interplay of non-Hermitian quantum mechanics and space-fractional quantum mechanics. The variation in tunneling time as the system transitions from a real to a complex potential is analyzed. We demonstrate that the tunneling time exhibits a dependence on the barrier width $d$ in the limit $d\rightarrow \infty$, showing the absence of the Hartman effect. A particularly striking feature of our findings is the potential manifestation of the Hartman effect for a specific combination of the absorption component $V_{i}$ and the Levy index $\alpha$. This behavior arises from the fact that the presence of the absorption component $V_{i}$ leads to a monotonic increase in tunneling time with barrier thickness, whereas the Levy index $\alpha$ reduces the tunneling time. The interplay of these contrasting influences facilitates the emergence of the Hartman effect under a specific combination of $V_{i}$ and the fractional parameter $\alpha$.</description>

      <title>Signals of critical end point from jet quenching and quark energy loss in holographic QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The jet quenching parameter and energy loss of light and heavy quarks have been investigated in the framework of holographic QCD models with a critical end point (CEP) at finite baryon chemical potential in $N_f=2,2+1,2+1+1$ systems. The properties of the jet quenching parameter and energy loss around CEP have been carefully studied, and some evident signatures for CEP are subtracted. It is found that the dimensionless jet quenching parameter and the energy loss of light and heavy quarks exhibit evident features around CEP. Specifically, all these quantities increase rapidly near the CEP phase transition temperature $T_{CEP}$ with fixed $\mu_{CEP}$. Moreover, the velocity dependent behavior of heavy quark energy loss at CEP differs significantly from charged particle energy loss in QED matter. For electromagnetic interaction, the energy loss of charged particle can be described by the Bethe-Bloch formula and the Lindhand-Scharff-Schiott theory at low and high velocities, respectively. However, the heavy quark energy loss at CEP is approximately proportional to velocity at low velocities and aligns with Bjorken's results at high velocities, which indicates that the heavy quark energy loss is predominantly collisional at low velocities and gluon radiation dominant at high velocities. For light quark energy loss, the behavior of the energy loss per unit length and the total energy loss differs significantly. However, the total energy loss and stopping distance exhibit similar behavior. This implies that the stopping distance predominantly determines the total energy loss. Thus, even with increased energy loss per unit length at higher temperatures or chemical potentials, the total energy loss decreases due to the reduced stopping distance.</description>

      <title>Gravitational dark matter production from fermionic spectator fields during inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the gravitational particle production from vacuum for a minimally coupled fermionic spectator field during a single-field inflationary phase. We observe that metric perturbations arising from the quantum fluctuations of a scalar inflaton field enhance gravitational production, showing that such a perturbative contribution becomes dominant if the field mass is sufficiently smaller than the inflationary Hubble rate. We focus on modes that leave the Hubble horizon during the latest stages of slow-roll and we numerically compute the total number of particles obtained from perturbations, providing a lower bound on the amount of such \enquote{geometric} particles for the case of Starobinsky inflation and a quadratic hilltop scenario. Our outcomes are compatible with the net observational cold dark matter abundance as experimentally measured, whose dark matter candidate exhibits mass in the range $10^5 \lesssim m \lesssim 10^7$ GeV, excluded by previous non-perturbative calculations.</description>

      <title>Has DESI detected exponential quintessence?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The new Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) DR2 results have strengthened the possibility that dark energy is dynamical, i.e., it has evolved over the history of the Universe. One simple, but theoretically well motivated and widely studied, physical model of dynamical dark energy is minimally coupled, single-field quintessence $\phi$ with an exponential potential $V(\phi)=V_0\,e^{-\lambda\phi}$. We perform a full Bayesian statistical analysis of the model using the DESI DR2 data, in combination with other cosmological observations, to constrain the model's parameters and compare its goodness of fit to that of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. We find that the quintessence model provides a significantly better fit to the data, both when the spatial curvature of the Universe is fixed to zero and when it is allowed to vary. The significance of the preference varies between $\sim3.3\sigma$ and $\sim3.8\sigma$, depending on whether the curvature density parameter $\Omega_K$ is fixed or varied. We obtain the values $0.698^{+0.173}_{-0.202}$ and $0.722^{+0.182}_{-0.208}$ at the $68.3\%$ (i.e., $1\sigma$) confidence level for the parameter $\lambda$ in the absence and the presence of $\Omega_K$, respectively, which imply $\sim3.5\sigma$ preference for a nonzero $\lambda$. We also obtain $\Omega_K=0.003\pm 0.001$, which implies $\sim3\sigma$ preference for a positive $\Omega_K$, i.e., a negative curvature. Finally, we discuss the differences between quintessence and phenomenological parametrizations of the dark energy equation-of-state parameter, in particular the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization.</description>

      <title>Higgs Decay Signal Strengths in an Extended 2HDM</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The combined CMS and ATLAS analysis of \(h \to Z\gamma\) reveals a \(2\sigma\) excess over the Standard Model (SM) prediction, hinting at potential new physics. In contrast, the observed agreement of \(\mu_{\gamma\gamma}\) with the SM imposes stringent constraints on such extension. In this context, we investigate a Two Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM) extended by a complex scalar singlet and a vector-like lepton (VLL). This framework successfully accommodates the Higgs decay signal strengths \(\mu_{{}_{W \,W^\star}}\), \( \mu_{Z\gamma}\,\), and \(\, \mu_{\gamma\gamma}\) while also satisfying precision electroweak constraints, the observed experimental value of muon \(g-2\), and bounds from LEP II data. We identify a viable region of parameter space that is consistent with all low energy data and current experimental limits on the Higgs decay signal strengths.</description>

      <title>Shedding Light on Gravity: Black Hole Shadows and Lensing Signatures in Lorentz Gauge Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances, including gravitational wave detections and imaging of black hole shadows, have strongly validated general relativity. Nevertheless, ongoing cosmological observations suggest potential limitations of general relativity, spurring interest in modified theories of gravity. This study explores Lorentz gauge theory, an alternative gravitational framework offering promising solutions to longstanding conceptual issues in quantum gravity and cosmology. By analyzing black hole shadow structures and gravitational lensing effects-both weak and strong deflection regimes-we highlight unique observational signatures of Lorentz gauge gravity. Our findings provide valuable tools for future observational tests, potentially distinguishing these modified gravity models from general relativity and advancing our understanding of spacetime geometry and fundamental gravitational interactions.</description>

      <title>How much has DESI dark energy evolved since DR1?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: DESI has reported a dynamical dark energy (DE) signal based on the $w_0 w_a$CDM model that is in conflict with Hubble tension. Recalling that the combination of DESI DR1 BAO and DR1 full-shape (FS) modeling are consistent with $\Lambda$CDM, in this letter we comment on the status of fluctuations in DR1 BAO documented in \cite{DESI:2024mwx, Colgain:2024xqj} in the DR2 update. In particular, we note that neither DR1 BAO nor DR2 BAO nor DR2 BAO+CMB confronted to the $w_0 w_a$CDM model with relaxed model parameter priors confirm late-time accelerated expansion today. Translating DESI BAO constraints into flat $\Lambda$CDM constraints, we observe that the DESI LRG1 constraint remains the most prominent outlier preferring larger $\Omega_m$ values, LRG2 switches from smaller to larger $\Omega_m$ values relative to Planck-$\Lambda$CDM, and ELG data drive the relatively low $\Omega_m$ in the full DR2 BAO. We observe that one cannot restore $w_0 = -1$ within one $1 \sigma$ by removing either LRG1 or LRG2, but LRG2 in DR2, in contrast to LRG1 in DR1, now has a greater bearing on $w_0 &gt; -1$. We conclude that the BAO has yet to stabilise, but the general trend is towards greater consistency with DESI DR1 FS modeling results, where there may be no dynamical DE signal in DESI data alone.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the influence of non-commutative geometry on various aspects of neutrino behavior in curved spacetime. Adopting a Schwarzschild-like black hole solution with Lorentzian mass deformation induced by non-commutativity, we analyze three fundamental phenomena: the energy deposition rate from neutrino pair annihilation, the gravitationally induced phase shift in neutrino oscillations, and the associated transition probabilities under lensing conditions. Our outcomes reveal that non-commutativity significantly alters the energy deposition profile and modifies oscillation phases. Furthermore, these corrections impact also the flavor transition probabilities, particularly under gravitational lensing phenomenon.</description>

      <title>A Power-law Inflation Tail for the Standard $R^2$-Inflation and the Trans-Planckian Censorship Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The conceptual problems of the standard slow-roll inflationary scenario include the Trans-Planckian Censorship Conjecture issue, which severely restricts the tensor-to-scalar ratio in the standard minimally coupled scalar field inflation. Motivated by the fact that a scalar field in its vacuum configuration can be minimally coupled to gravity, or conformally coupled, and also that the first quantum corrections of the scalar field action include $R^2$ corrections, in this work we assume that $R^2$ gravity in the presence of a scalar field with constant equation of state parameter co-exist and control the early Universe. Constant equation of state parameter scalar field result from exponential scalar potentials. In our approach, the standard slow-roll era is controlled by the $R^2$ gravity and is followed by a power-law inflationary tail governed by a minimally coupled scalar field with an quintessential equation of state parameter, stemming from an exponential scalar potential. The fact that the total equation of state parameter after the end of the slow-roll era is equal to the value determined by the scalar field, has an effect on the duration of the $R^2$ governed slow-roll era, and it actually shortens the duration of the slow-roll era, by an extent which depends on the reheating temperature too, after all the inflationary patches have ended. The power-law inflationary tail to the standard $R^2$ inflation, solves the Trans-Planckian Censorship Conjecture issues, and also the Swampland conjecture can be amended in this context. We also perform a dynamical system study to confirm numerically our findings.</description>

      <title>Novel Polarimetric Analysis of Near Horizon Flaring Episodes in M87* in Millimeter Wavelength</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent multi-wavelength observations of M87* \citep{2024A&amp;A...692A.140A} revealed a high-energy $\gamma$-ray flare without a corresponding millimeter counterpart. We present a theoretical polarimetric study to evaluate the presence and nature of a potential millimeter flare in M87*, using a suite of general relativistic magnetohydrodynamical simulations with varying black hole (BH) spins and magnetic field configurations. We find that the emergence of a millimeter flare is strongly influenced by both spin and magnetic structure, with limited sensitivity to the electron distribution (thermal vs. non-thermal). We model the intensity light curve with a damped random walk (DRW) and compare the characteristic timescale ($\tau$) with recent SMA observations, finding that the simulated $\tau$ exceeds observed values by over an order of magnitude. In a flaring case with BH spin a=+0.5, we identify a distinct millimeter flare followed by an order-of-magnitude flux drop. All Stokes parameters show variability near the flare, including a sign reversal in the electric vector position angle. While most $\beta_m$ modes remain stable, the $EB$-correlation phase is highly sensitive to both the flare peak and decay. We examine polarimetric signatures in photon sub-rings, focusing on modes ns=0 and ns=1. The ns=0 signal closely matches the full image, while ns=1 reveals distinct behaviors, highlighting the potential of space VLBI to isolate sub-ring features. Finally, we analyze the magnetic and velocity field evolution during the flare, finding that magnetic reconnection weakens during the flux decay, and the clockwise velocity flow transitions into an outflow-dominated regime. These results suggest that transient radio variability near flares encodes key information about black hole spin and magnetic field structure, offering a novel probe into the physics of active galactic nuclei.</description>

      <title>Critical Behaviour in the Single Flavor Thirring Model in 2+1$d$ with Wilson Kernel Domain Wall Fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present results of a lattice field theory simulation of the 2+1$d$ Thirring model with $N=1$ fermion flavors, using domain wall fermions. The model exhibits a U(2) symmetry-breaking phase transition with the potential to define a UV-stable renormalisation group fixed point. The novelty is the replacement of the Shamir kernel used in all previous work with the Wilson kernel, improving the action particularly with respect to the $L_s\to\infty$ limit needed to recover U(2), now under much better control. Auxiliary field ensembles generated on $16^3\times24$ with varying self-interaction strength $g^2$ and bare mass $m$ are used to measure the bilinear condensate order parameter $\langle\bar\psi i\gamma_3\psi\rangle$ with domain wall separations as large as $L_s=120$. The resulting $L_s\to\infty$ extrapolation is used to fit an empirical equation of state modelling spontaneous symmetry breaking as $m\to0$. The fit is remarkably stable and compelling, with the fitted critical exponents $\beta_m\simeq2.4$, $\delta\simeq1.3$ differing markedly from previous estimates. The associated susceptibility exhibits a mass hierarchy in line with physical expectations, again unlike previous estimates. Schwinger-Dyson equation (SDE) solutions of the Thirring model exploiting a hidden local symmetry in the action are reviewed, and analytic predictions presented for the exponents. In contrast to all previous lattice studies, the universal characteristics of the critical point revealed qualitatively resemble the SDE predictions.</description>

      <title>Stellar isotropic model in the symmetric teleparallel equivalent of general relativity theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, the theory of symmetric teleparallel equivalent of general relativity (STEGR) has gained much interest in the cosmology and astrophysics community. Within this theory, we discuss the method of deriving a stellar isotropic model. In this respect, we implement the equations of motion of STEGR theory to a spacetime that is symmetric in a spherical manner, resulting in a set of nonlinear differential equations with more unknowns than equations. To solve this issue, we assume a special form of $g_{tt}$, and suppose a null value of the anisotropy to obtain the form of $g_{rr}$. We then investigate the possibility of obtaining an isotropic stellar model consistent with observational data. To test the stability of our model, we apply the adiabatic index and the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation. Furthermore, we examine our model using different observed values of radii and masses of pulsars, showing that all of them fit in a consistent way.</description>

      <title>The universal crossover from thermodynamics and dynamics of supercritical RN-AdS black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the properties of supercritical Reissner-Nordstr\"om Anti-de Sitter (RN-AdS) black holes in the extended phase space with the pressure defines as the cosmological constant. Supercritical black holes exist in the region where both temperature and pressure exceed the critical point, known as the supercritical region. The conventional view states that black holes in this regime are indistinguishable between large and small phases. However, recent research reveals that the supercritical regime exhibits universal gas-like and liquid-like phase separation, which shed light on the study on the supercritical region of RN-AdS black holes in the extended phase space. In this work, we calculate the thermodynamic potential and quasinormal modes (QNMs) of RN-AdS black holes, and identify transition curves between two different states in supercritical region using thermodynamic and dynamic methods. On one hand, we find the thermodynamic crossover curve (Widom line) by defining the scaled variance $\Omega$ (a higher-order derivative of Gibbs free energy). On the other hand, we identify the dynamic crossover curve (Frenkel line) by analyzing transitions between distinct QNM decay modes.</description>

      <title>Displacement Memory Effect from Supersymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explain the recent results regarding the displacement memory effect (DME) of plane gravitational waves using supersymmetric quantum mechanics. This novel approach stems from the fact that both geodesic and Schr\"odinger equations are Sturm-Liouville boundary value problems. Supersymmetry provides a unified framework for P\"oschl-Teller and Scarf profiles and restores the critical values of wave amplitudes for DME in a natural way. Within our framework, we obtain a compact formula for DME in terms of the asymptotic values of the superpotential and the geodesics. In addition, this new technique enables us to build plane and gravitational waves with 2-transverse directions using superpartner potentials. Lastly, we study DME within a singular wave profile inspired by supersymmetric quantum mechanics, which shows the broader applicability of our method.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We evaluate thermodynamic observables such as pressure, baryon number, entropy and energy density, as well as the second and fourth order baryon number cumulants in the phase structure of QCD. The intertwined confinement and chiral dynamics is resolved within functional QCD, aiming for quantitative accuracy at larger densities. Specifically it is shown that the self-consistent resolution of the confining gluonic background is crucial in particular for even the qualitative properties of the cumulants. Our results are in quantitative agreement with lattice and functional QCD benchmarks at vanishing and small chemical potentials. Moreover, they offer novel insights in the dynamics at larger chemical potentials including the regime of the critical end point. A welcome by-product of this analysis is the computation of the Polyakov loop potential in finite density QCD, which, alongside the aforementioned observables, can be used as input and benchmark for effective theory computations at finite density.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes and absorption cross-section of a Bardeen black hole surrounded by perfect fluid dark matter in four dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study quasinormal modes and absorption cross sections for the $(1+3)$-dimensional Bardeen black hole surrounded by perfect fluid dark matter. Studies of the massless scalar field is already done in \cite{Sun:2023slzl}. Hence, in this paper we will focus on the massive scalar field perturbations and massless Dirac field perturbations. To compute the quasinormal modes we use the semi-analytical 3rd-order WKB method, which has been shown to be one of the best approaches when the effective potential is adequate and when $n &lt; \ell$ and $n &lt; \lambda$. We have also utilized the P\"oschl-Teller method to compare the valus obtained using the WKB approach. We have computed quasinormal frequencies by varying various parameters of the theory such as the mass of the scalar field $\mu$, dark matter parameter $\alpha$ and the magnetic charge $g$. We have summarized our solutions in tables and figures for clarity. As for the absorption cross section, we used third order WKB approach to compute reflection, transmission coefficients and partial absorption cross sections. Graphs are presented to demonstrate the behavior of the above quantities when the dark matter parameter and mass of the massive scalar field are varied.</description>

      <title>Measuring R\'enyi entropy using a projected Loschmidt echo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present efficient and practical protocols to measure the second R\'enyi entropy (RE), whose exponential is known as the purity. We achieve this by establishing a direct connection to a Loschmidt echo (LE) type measurement sequence, applicable to quantum many-body systems. Notably, our approach does not rely on random-noise averaging, a feature that can be extended to protocols to measure out-of-time-order correlation functions (OTOCs), as we demonstrate. By way of example, we show that our protocols can be practically implemented in superconducting qubit-based platforms, as well as in cavity-QED trapped ultra-cold gases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.04479v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate numerical evolution of massive Kaluza-Klein (KK) modes of a Dirac field on a thick brane. We deduce the Dirac equation in five-dimensional spacetime, and obtain the time-dependent evolution equation and Schr\"odinger-like equation of the extra-dimensional component. We use the Dirac KK resonances as the initial data and study the corresponding dynamics. By monitoring the decay law of the left- and right-chiral KK resonances, we compute the corresponding lifetimes and find that there could exist long-lived KK modes on the brane. Especially, for the lightest KK resonance with a large coupling parameter and a large three momentum, it will have an extremely long lifetime.</description>

      <title>A classical Bousso bound for higher derivative corrections to general relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16658v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Focussing on theories for which the higher derivative terms are considered as small corrections in the Lagrangian to Einstein's two-derivative theory of general relativity (GR), we prove the classical version of the covariant entropy bound (also known as the Bousso bound) in arbitrary diffeomorphism invariant gravitational theories. Even if the higher derivative corrections are treated perturbatively, we provide instances of specific configurations for which they can potentially violate the Bousso bound. To tackle this obstruction, we propose a modification in the Bousso bound that incorporates the offending contributions from the higher derivative corrections. We argue that the modified Bousso bound that we propose holds to all orders in the higher curvature corrections. Our proposed modifications are equivalent to replacing the Bekenstein-Hawking area term by Wald's definition (with dynamical corrections as suggested by Wall) for the black hole entropy. Hence, the modifications are physically well motivated by results from the laws of black hole mechanics in higher derivative theories.</description>

Abstract: We propose mixed boundary conditions for 3d conformal gravity consistent with variational principle in its second-order formalism that admit the chiral $\Lambda$-$\mathfrak{bms}_4$ algebra as their asymptotic symmetry algebra. This algebra is one of the four chiral $\mathcal W$-algebra extensions of $\mathfrak{so}(2,3)$ and is a generalisation of the chiral $\mathfrak{bms}_4$ algebra responsible for soft theorems of graviton MHV amplitudes in ${\mathbb R}^{1,3}$ gravity to the case of non-zero negative cosmological constant. The corresponding charges calculated using the modified covariant phase space formalism are shown to be finite and integrable, and realise this non-linear ${\cal W}$-algebra.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the second-order normal quantum fluctuation on the world-sheet of a probe string in the Ba\~nados-Teitelboim-Zanelli (BTZ) black hole. These fluctuations is treated as the projection of Hawking radiation on the worldsheet and indeed modify the action growth of the string. Then in the string field theory/boundary conformal field theory framework, via the boundary vertex operator we study the correlation function of the Schr\"odinger functional of excited fields on the world-sheet and further extract the field's formula. Our study could shed light on the potential connection between complexity growth and correlation function.</description>

      <title>Holographic spectroscopy of fermion with instantons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11557v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the gauge-gravity duality, we investigate the fermionic spectroscopy in the D(-1)-D3 brane system. The background geometry of this system described by IIB supergravity includes a black (deconfined) and bubble (confined) D3-brane which corresponds respectively to a deconfined and a confined gauge theory in holography. The charge of the D(-1) brane as the D-instanton gives the gluon condensate in this model. To simplify the holographic setup, we first reduce briefly the ten-dimensional supergravity background produced by D(-1)-D3-branes to an equivalently five-dimensional background. Then the fermionic spectrum in the confined case is obtained by decomposing the fermion with dimensional reduction. In addition, by using the standard method for computing the Green function in the AdS/CFT dictionary, we derive the equations for the fermionic correlation functions and solve them numerically with the infalling boundary condition. Our numerical results in the deconfined case illustrate that the fermionic correlation function as spectral function includes two branches of the dispersion curves whose behavior is very close to the results obtained from the method of hard thermal loop. And the effective mass generated by the medium effect of fermion splits into two values due to the spin-dependent interactions induced by instantons. In the confined case, the holographic correlation function indicates several separated dispersion curves which illustrates consistently the onset mass in the fermionic spectrum we obtained. Therefore, this work in holography demonstrates the instantonic configuration is very influential to the fermion in QCD.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17658v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computation of spin-resummed observables in post-Minkowskian dynamics typically involve evaluation of Feynman integrals deformed by an exponential factor, where the exponent is a linear sum of the momenta being integrated. Such integrals can be viewed as tensor integral generating functions, which provide alternative approaches to tensor reduction of Feynman integrals. We develop a systematic method to evaluate tensor integral generating functions using conventional multiloop integration techniques. The spin-resummed aligned-spin eikonal at second post-Minkowskian order is considered as a phenomenologically relevant example where evaluation of tensor integral generating functions is necessary.</description>

      <title>Vacuum transitions with the Gauss-Bonnet term in $D$ dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19451v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In our previous paper [1,2], we proposed a probabilistic argument to explain the reason why the cosmological constant is very small in $4D$. We can ask a question: if the behavior of tunneling exponent $B$ can be generalized to $D$-dimension. Moreover, in higher dimensional theory motivated by string theory the Gauss-Bonnet term plays an important role. Therefore, in this paper, we generalize our result in [1,2] to arbitrary $D$ dimensions including the Gauss-Bonnet term. As a result, we have two main results. We find that the Euclidean action of the bounce, $B$, describing the decay of a de Sitter vacuum, is proportional to $k^{-(D-2)}_{+}$, which has a pole as $k^2_{+} \rightarrow 0$ where $k^2_{+}$ is the curvature of the parent vacuum. This result is similar to the result in $4D$. The other result is that we find a new decay channel, describing up-tunneling from anti-de Sitter into de Sitter. The meaning of this new decay channel in the string landscape should be explored in the future.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07830v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study 1/2-BPS Wilson loop operators in maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory on $d$-dimensional spheres. Their vacuum expectation values can be computed at large $N$ through supersymmetric localisation. The holographic duals are given by back-reacted spherical D-branes. For $d\neq 4$, the resulting theories are non-conformal and correspondingly, the dual geometries do not possess an asymptotic AdS region. The main aim of this work is to compute the holographic Wilson loops by evaluating the partition function of a probe fundamental string and M2-brane in the dual geometry, focusing on the next-to-leading order. Along the way, we highlight a variety of issues related to the presence of a non-constant dilaton. In particular, the structure of the divergences of the one-loop partition functions takes a non-universal form in contrast to examples available in the literature. We devise a general framework to treat the divergences, successfully match the sub-leading scaling with $\lambda$ and $N$, and provide a first step towards obtaining the numerical prefactor.</description>

      <title>Classical Continuum Limit of the String Field Theory Dual to Lattice Gauge Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08552v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the classical continuum limit of the string field theory dual to the $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ lattice gauge theory and investigate various fundamental phenomena in the continuum theory at the mean-field level. Our construction of the continuum theory is based on the concept of {\it area derivative}, which can be regarded as a generalization of the ordinary derivative $\partial/\partial x^\mu$ to operators acting on functional fields $\phi[C]$ on the loop space. The resultant continuum theory has a $\mathbb{Z}_N^{}$ $1$-form global symmetry, which originates in the $\mathbb{Z}_N^{}$ center symmetry in the gauge theory. We find that the confined and deconfined phases of the gauge theory are identified by the unbroken and broken phases of the $\mathbb{Z}_N^{}$ symmetry respectively by showing the Area/Perimeter law of the classical solution. In the broken phase, the low-energy effective theory is described by a $\mathrm{BF}$-type topological field theory and has a emergent $\mathbb{Z}_N^{}$ $(D-2)$-form global symmetry. The existence of the emergent symmetry is deeply related to $(D-2)$-dimensional topological configurations (i.e. center vortex for $D=4$), and we explicitly construct such a topological defect in the continuum theory. Finally, we also comment on the upper and lower critical dimensions of the gauge theory/string field theory.</description>

Abstract: We study a conformal field theory that arises in the infinite-volume limit of a spin chain with $U_q(sl_2)$ global symmetry. Most operators in the theory are defect-ending operators which allows $U_q(sl_2)$ symmetry transformations to act on them in a consistent way. We use Coulomb gas techniques to construct correlation functions and compute all OPE coefficients of the model, as well as to prove that the properties imposed by the quantum group symmetry are indeed satisfied by the correlation functions. In particular, we treat the non-chiral operators present in the theory. Free boson realization elucidates the origin of the defects attached to the operators. We also comment on the role of quantum group in generalized minimal models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09695v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Significant progress has been made in our understanding of the analytic structure of FRW wavefunction coefficients, facilitated by the development of efficient algorithms to derive the differential equations they satisfy. Moreover, recent findings indicate that the twisted cohomology of the associated hyperplane arrangement defining FRW integrals overestimates the number of integrals required to define differential equations for the wavefunction coefficient. We demonstrate that the associated dual cohomology is automatically organized in a way that is ideal for understanding and exploiting the cut/residue structure of FRW integrals. Utilizing this understanding, we develop a systematic approach to organize compatible sequential residues, which dictates the physical subspace of FRW integrals for any $n$-site, $\ell$-loop graph. In particular, the physical subspace of tree-level FRW wavefunction coefficients is populated by differential forms associated to cuts/residues that factorize the integrand of the wavefunction coefficient into only flat space amplitudes. After demonstrating the validity of our construction using intersection theory, we develop simple graphical rules for cut tubings that enumerate the space of physical cuts and, consequently, differential forms without any calculation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12057v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a recently identified four-loop Feynman integral that contains a three-dimensional Calabi-Yau geometry and contributes to the scattering of black holes in classical gravity at fifth post-Minkowskian and second self-force order (5PM 2SF) in the conservative sector. In contrast to previously studied Calabi-Yau Feynman integrals, the higher-order differential equation that this integral satisfies in dimensional regularization exhibits $\varepsilon$-dependent apparent singularities. We introduce an appropriate ansatz which allows us to bring such cases into an $\varepsilon$-factorized form. As a proof of principle, we apply it to the integral at hand.</description>

      <title>Quantum Superspace and Bloch Electron Systems with Zeeman Effects: *-Bracket Formalism for Super Curtright-Zachos Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17030v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce supersymmetric extensions of the Hom-Lie deformation of the Virasoro algebra (super Curtright-Zachos algebra), as realized in the GL(1,1) quantum superspace, for Bloch electron systems under Zeeman effects. By examining the duality inherent in quantum superspace scaling operators, we establish a correspondence between quantum superspace and its physical realization through a novel operator mixing mechanism. For the continuous case, we construct super Curtright-Zachos algebra using magnetic translations and spin matrix bases, demonstrating explicit realizations for both N=1 and N=2 supersymmetric algebras with a natural N=2 decomposition. For the discrete case, we establish cyclic matrix representations in tight-binding models. We organize these structures through the *-bracket formalism with Z2-grading, revealing how the quantum superspace structure manifests in physical systems while preserving essential algebraic properties.</description>

      <title>Quantum field theory on curved manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09919v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper discusses how particle production from the vacuum can be explained by local analysis when the field theory is defined by differential geometry on curved manifolds. We have performed the local analysis in a mathematically rigorous way, respecting the Markov property. The exact WKB is used as a tool for extracting non-perturbative effect from the local system. After a serious application of the differential geometry and the exact WKB to particle production, we show that entanglement does not appear in the Unruh effect as far as the standard formulation by the differential geometry is valid. This result should not be attributed to a consistency problem between the ``entanglement state'' and the ``standard field theory by differential geometry'', but to the fact that the conventional calculation of the Unruh effect is done by extrapolation which is not consistent with the differential geometry. The situation is similar to that of the Dirac monopole, but topology is not relevant and the basis for building field theories in differential geometry is strongly involved.</description>

      <title>Inequivalence between the Euclidean and Lorentzian versions of the type IIB matrix model from Lefschetz thimble calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17798v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The type IIB matrix model is conjectured to describe superstring theory nonperturbatively in terms of ten $N \times N$ bosonic traceless Hermitian matrices $A_\mu$ ($\mu=0, \ldots , 9$), whose eigenvalues correspond to $(9+1)$-dimensional space-time. Quite often, this model has been investigated in its Euclidean version, which is well defined although the ${\rm SO}(9,1)$ Lorentz symmetry of the original model is replaced by the ${\rm SO}(10)$ rotational symmetry. Recently, a well-defined model respecting the Lorentz symmetry has been proposed by gauge-fixing the Lorentz symmetry nonperturbatively using the Faddeev-Popov procedure. Here we investigate the two models by Monte Carlo simulations, overcoming the severe sign problem by the Lefschetz thimble method, in the case of matrix size $N=2$ omitting fermionic contributions. We add a quadratic term $\gamma \, \mathrm{tr} (A_\mu A^\mu)$ in the action and calculate the expectation values of rotationally symmetric (or Lorentz symmetric) observables as a function of the coefficient $\gamma$. Our results exhibit striking differences between the two models around $\gamma=0$ and in the $\gamma&gt;0$ region, associated with the appearance of different saddle points, clearly demonstrating their inequivalence against naive expectations from quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>Exactly solvable multicomponent spinless fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05455v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By generalising the one to one correspondence between exactly solvable hermitian matrices $\mathcal{H}=\mathcal{H}^\dagger$ and exactly solvable spinless fermion systems $\mathcal{H}_f=\sum_{x,y}c_x^\dagger\mathcal{H}(x,y)c_y$, four types of exactly solvable multicomponent fermion systems are constructed explicitly. They are related to the multivariate Krawtcouk, Meixner and two types of Rahman like polynomials, constructed recently by myself. The Krawtchouk and Meixner polynomials are the eigenvectors of certain real symmetric matrices $\mathcal{H}$ which are related to the difference equations governing them. The corresponding fermions have nearest neighbour interactions. The Rahman like polynomials are eigenvectors of certain reversible Markov chain matrices $\mathcal{K}$, from which real symmetric matrices $\mathcal{H}$ are uniquely defined by the similarity transformation in terms of the square root of the stationary distribution. The fermions have wide range interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07592v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The triad refers to embedding of two systems of polynomials, symmetric ones and those of the Baker-Akhiezer type into a power series of the Noumi-Shiraishi type. It provides an alternative definition of Macdonald theory and its extensions. The basic triad is associated with the vector representation of the Ding-Iohara-Miki (DIM) algebra. We discuss lifting this triad to two elliptic generalizations and further to the bi-elliptic triad. At the algebraic level, it corresponds to elliptic and bi-elliptic DIM algebras. This completes the list of polynomials associated with Seiberg-Witten theory with adjoint matter in various dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07803v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We find empirically that the value of Feynman integrals follows a $\log$-$\Gamma$ distribution at large loop order. This result opens up a new avenue towards the large-order behavior in perturbative quantum field theory. Our study of the primitive contribution to the scalar $\phi^4$ beta function in four dimensions up to 17 loops provides accompanying evidence. Guided by instanton considerations, we discuss the extrapolation of this contribution to all loop orders.</description>

      <title>On non-planar ABJM anomalous dimensions from M2 branes in AdS$_{4}\times S^{7}/\mathbb{Z}_{k}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09360v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Planar parts of conformal dimensions of primary operators in $U_k(N) \times U_{-k}(N)$ ABJM theory are controlled by integrability. Strong coupling asymptotics of planar dimensions of operators with large spins can be found from the energy of semiclassical strings in AdS$_{4}\times$CP$^3$ but computing non-planar corrections requires understanding higher genus string corrections. As was pointed out in arXiv:2408.10070, there is an alternative way to find the non-planar corrections by quantizing M2 branes in AdS$_{4}\times S^7/\mathbb{Z}_{k}$ which are wrapped around the 11d circle of radius $1/k= \lambda/N$ and generalize spinning strings in AdS$_4\times$CP$^3$. Computing the 1-loop correction to the energy of M2 brane that corresponds to the long folded string with large spin $S$ in AdS$_4$ allowed to obtain a prediction for the large $\lambda$ limit of non-planar corrections to the cusp anomalous dimension. Similar predictions were found for non-planar dimensions of operators dual to M2 branes that generalize the ''short'' and ''long'' circular strings with two equal spins $J_1=J_2$ in CP$^3$. Here we consider two more non-trivial examples of 1-loop M2 brane computations that correspond to: (i) long folded string with large spin $S$ in AdS$_4$ and orbital momentum $J$ in CP$^3$ whose energy determines the generalized cusp anomalous dimension, and (ii) circular string with spin $S$ in AdS$_4$ and spin $J$ in CP$^3$. We find the leading terms of the expansion of the corresponding 1-loop M2 brane energies in $1/k$. We also discuss similar semiclassical 1-loop M2 brane computation in flat 11d background and comment on possible relation to higher genus corrections to energies in 10d string theory.</description>

      <title>Strongly Coupled Sectors in Inflation: Gapless Theories and Unparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17840v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute correlation functions of the primordial density perturbations when they couple to a gapless, strongly coupled sector of spectator fields -- ``unparticles" -- during inflation. We first derive a four-point function of conformally coupled scalars for all kinematic configurations in de Sitter, which exchanges an unparticle at tree-level, by performing direct integration using the Mellin-Barnes method. To obtain inflationary bispectra and trispectra, we apply weight-shifting operators to the conformally coupled scalar correlator. We show that the correlators solve differential equations determined by the additional symmetries enjoyed by the unparticle propagator. Based on these differential equations, we are able to discuss the spinning-unparticle exchanges, focusing on two possible cases where the currents or the stress tensor of unparticles are coupled to inflatons, with the help of spin-raising operators. Finally, we study the phenomenology of the resulting shape functions. Depending on the value of the unparticle scaling dimension, we classify three characteristic shapes for the inflationary bispectra, including near-equilateral, near-orthogonal, and a novel shape which appears when the scaling dimensions are close to half-integers. More generally, we find that the leading order squeezed limits are insufficient to conclusively determine the detection of a light particle or unparticle. Only the full shapes of bispectra and trispectra can break this degeneracy.</description>

Abstract: We construct a holographic tensor network for the double-scaled SYK model (DSSYK). The moment of the transfer matrix of DSSYK can be mapped to the matrix product state (MPS) of a spin chain. By adding the height direction as a holographic direction, we recast the MPS for DSSYK into the holographic tensor network whose building block is a 4-index tensor with the bond dimension three.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the $q=2$ SYK model with $R$-para-particles ($R$-PSYK$_2$), analyzing its thermodynamics and spectral form factor (SFF) using random matrix theory. The Hamiltonian is quadratic, with coupling coefficients randomly drawn from the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE).The model exhibits self-averaging behavior and shows a striking transition in SFF dynamics: while the fermionic SYK$_2$ displays a ramp behavior $\mathcal{K}(t) \sim e^{C_0 t}$ with $C_0 \sim \ln N$, the $R$-para-particle cases exhibit $C_0 \sim \mathcal{O}(1)$. These findings offer new insights into quantum systems with exotic statistics.</description>

      <title>Worldvolume fermion as baryon with homogeneous instantons in holographic $\mathrm{QCD}_{3}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24173v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate holographically the effective theory of the worldvolume fermion on the flavor branes in the D3/D7 model with homogeneously smeared D(-1)-branes. As a top-down approach in gauge-gravity duality, the D(-1)-branes are instantons and violate the CP symmetry in the dual theory. The background geometry of this model contains black brane (deconfined geometry) and bubble D3-brane solutions (confined geometry), all with a non-zero Romand-Romand zero form as axion. The dual theories to the backgrounds are respectively the Super Yang-Mills theory at finite temperature and three-dimensional confining Yang-Mills theory, all with a Chern-Simons term induced by instantons. In the confined geometry, we introduce a baryon vertex as a D5-brane wrapped on $S^{5}$, then identify the fermionic flux on the D7-brane as a baryonic operator. Afterwards, we study the spectrum and the holographic correlation function of the flavored fermion on the D7-branes. Remarkably, the fermionic spectrum is in agreement with the dispersion curves obtained from the confined correlation function, and the mass ratio of the lowest baryon and meson in our model is close to the associated experimental data. Moreover, the effective interaction terms of the holographic baryon and meson are derived and all the coupling constants take order of $N_{c}^{1/2}$ agreeing with the evaluation from the large N field theory. In the deconfined geometry, the holographic correlation function is also evaluated numerically while the fermion on D7-brane is identified to plasmino instead of baryon. The dispersion curves from the deconfined correlation function basically covers the results from the hard thermal loop approximation and may imply the instanton-induced interaction with spin. Overall, this work constructs a holographic theory about baryonic fermion and mesonic boson with instantons or CP violation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00416v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore a Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m Anti-de Sitter (RN-AdS) black hole with a cloud of string and quintessence to study thermodynamics and thermodynamic topology in the presence of Barrow entropy, which is currently being used widely as the horizon of a black hole may not be a smooth surface as described in classical general relativity but instead could have a more intricate fractal-like structure. Here, we study the impact of the fractal correction parameter of Barrow entropy on the thermodynamics of such BHs. We compute the first law of black hole thermodynamics and the Smarr relation for RN-AdS black hole with a cloud of string and quintessence in terms of Barrow entropy by employing the generalized formula for spherically symmetric spacetime which is directly derived from the Einstein field equation. The significance of Barrow entropy has been verified from thermodynamic topology as well. We also found that the non-zero topological charge indicates the presence of the critical point.</description>

      <title>Notes on fundamental algebraic supergeometry. Hilbert and Picard superschemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.00700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2008.00700v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: These notes aim at providing a complete and systematic account of some foundational aspects of algebraic supergeometry, namely, the extension to the geometry of superschemes of many classical notions, techniques and results that make up the general backbone of algebraic geometry, most of them originating from Grothendieck's work. In particular, we extend to algebraic supergeometry such notions as projective and proper morphisms, finiteness of the cohomology, vector and projective bundles, cohomology base change, semicontinuity theorems, relative duality, Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity, flattening, Hilbert and Quot schemes, faithfully flat descent, quotient \'etale relations (notably, Picard schemes), among others. Some results may be found elsewhere, and, in particular, there is some overlap with a recent preprint by Moosavian and Zhou. However, many techniques and constructions are presented here for the first time, notably, a first development of Grothendieck relative duality for proper morphisms of superschemes, the construction of the Hilbert superscheme in a more general situation than the one already known (which in particular allows one to treat the case of sub-superschemes of supergrassmannians), and a rigorous construction of the Picard superscheme for a locally superprojective morphism of noetherian superschemes with geometrically integral fibres. Moreover, some of the proofs given here are new as well, even when restricted to ordinary schemes. In a final section we construct a period map from an open substack of the moduli of proper and smooth supercurves to the moduli stack of principally polarized abelian superchemes.</description>

      <title>Limits on primordial non-Gaussianities from BOSS galaxy-clustering data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2201.11518v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the power spectrum and the bispectrum of BOSS galaxy-clustering data using the prediction from the Effective Field Theory of Large-Scale Structure at one-loop order for $\textit{both}$ the power spectrum $\textit{and}$ the bispectrum. With $\Lambda$CDM parameters fixed to Planck preferred values, we set limits on three templates of non-Gaussianities predicted by many inflationary models: the equilateral, the orthogonal, and the local shapes. After validating our analysis against simulations, we find $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm equil.}= 207 \pm 292\, , f_{\rm NL}^{\rm orth.}= -68 \pm 73\, , f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc.}= 52 \pm 34$, at $68\%$ confidence level. These bispectrum-based constraints from Large-Scale Structure, not far from the ones of WMAP, suggest promising results from upcoming surveys.</description>

Abstract: If sneutrinos are produced through primordial black hole (PBH) evaporation, then some interesting features of soft leptogenesis in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model with heavy right-handed neutrinos, are found. The required baryonic asymmetry could be possible from the decays of sneutrinos, for the soft SUSY breaking trilinear $A$ and bilinear $B$ parameters around the electroweak scale. The resonance condition in soft leptogenesis is not required. The allowed regions of different relevant parameters are discussed in detail. Using experimental constraints from collider searches on heavy leptons, the lower bound on the right-handed neutrino mass is found to be around $300$ GeV with Yukawa coupling lesser than about $0.4$. The allowed region of the typical mass scale of some supersymmetric particles and the $|A|$ parameter is also shown from the experimental constraint on the branching ratio for $\mu \rightarrow e \gamma$ in MEG-II search. Depending on PBH mass, bounds on the mass of gravitinos, produced from PBH evaporation, is discussed and gravitino mass around the electroweak scale is found to be possible only for unstable gravitino.</description>

      <title>Exponential distance relation (aka Titius-Bode rule) in extra solar planetary systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06070v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we present phenomenological evidence for the validity of an exponential distance relation (also known as generalized Titius-Bode law) in the 32 planetary systems (31 extra solar, plus our Solar System) containing at least 5 planets each (known up to July 2023). We produce the semi-log fittings of the data, and we check them against the statistical indicators of $R^2$ and $Median$. Then we compare them with the data of 4000 artificial planetary systems created at random. In this way, a possible origin by chance of the Titius-Bode rule (TBR) is reasonably excluded. We also point out that in some systems the fittings can be definitely improved by the insertion of new planets into specific positions. We discuss the Harmonic Resonances method and fittings, and compare them with the Titius-Bode fittings. Moreover, for some specific systems, we compare the Titius-Bode fitting against a polynomial fitting ($r\sim n^2$). Further comparisons with previous relevant works are reported in the last section. It emerges that TBR describes 25 out of the 32 planetary systems ($78\%$) with a $R^2\geq 0.95$. Further, it results to be the most economical (in terms of free parameters) and best fitting law for the description of spacing among planetary orbits. This analysis allows us to conclude that an exponential distance relation can reasonably be considered as ``valid'', or strongly corroborated, also in extra solar planetary systems.</description>

      <title>Barrow holographic dark energy with varying exponent</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15767v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct Barrow holographic dark energy with varying exponent. Such an energy-scale-dependent behavior is typical in quantum field theory and quantum gravity under renormalization group considerations, however in the present scenario it has an additional justification, since in realistic cases one expects that Barrow entropy quantum-gravitational effects to be stronger at early times and to smooth out and disappear at late times. We impose specific, redshift-dependent ans\"{a}tze for the Barrow running exponent, such as the linear, CPL-like, exponential, and trigonometric ones, and we investigate their cosmological behavior. We show that we can recover the standard thermal history of the universe, with the sequence of matter and dark energy epochs, in which the transition from deceleration to acceleration happens at $z\approx 0.65$, in agreement with observations. In the most realistic case of hyperbolic tangent ansatz, in which we can easily bound Barrow exponent inside its theoretically determined bounds 0 and 1 for all redshifts, we see that the dark-energy equation-of-state parameter can be quintessence like, or experience the phantom-divide crossing, while in the future it can either tend to the cosmological constant value or start increasing again. All these features reveal that Barrow holographic dark energy with varying exponent is not only theoretically more justified than the standard, constant-exponent case, but it leads to richer cosmological behavior too.</description>

      <title>Newton's laws of motion generating gravity-mediated entanglement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07832v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interface between quantum theory and gravity represents still uncharted territory. Recently, some works suggested promising alternative approaches aimed at witnessing quantum features to test the fundamental nature of gravity in tabletop experiments: Two masses in an initial superposition of spatially localized states are allowed to interact only through gravity and it is measured whether the final state is entangled. Here we show that one can generate the same amount of entanglement in this setup by using classical time evolution given by Newton's laws of motion. We argue that theories of quantum gravity that can be approximated by the Newtonian potential and classical time evolution given by Newton's laws of motion will generate gravity-mediated entanglement.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial Dyson-Schwinger Equations of Quartic Matrix Field Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03389v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Matrix field theory is a combinatorially non-local field theory which has recently been found to be a non-trivial but solvable QFT example. To generalize such non-perturbative structures to other models, a more combinatorial understanding of Dyson-Schwinger equations and their solutions is of high interest. To this end we consider combinatorial Dyson-Schwinger equations manifestly relying on the Hopf-algebraic structure of perturbative renormalization. We find that these equations are fully compatible with renormalization, relying only on the superficially divergent diagrams which are planar ribbon graphs, i.e. decompleted dual combinatorial maps. Still, they are of a similar kind as in realistic models of local QFT, featuring in particular an infinite number of primitive diagrams as well as graph-dependent combinatorial factors.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Collapse in Higher-Dimensional Rastall Gravity with and without Cosmological Constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09271v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a spherically symmetric homogeneous perfect fluid undergoing a gravitational collapse to singularity in the framework of higher-dimensional Rastall gravity in the cases of vanishing and nonvanishing cosmological constants. The possible final states of the collapse in any finite dimension are black hole and naked singularity, but the naked singularity formation becomes less favored when the dimension is increased. We find that there are two physically distinct solutions for the collapse evolution in the case of nonzero cosmological constant: trigonometric and exponential solutions. The effective energy density of the fluid is decreasing (increasing) in the former (latter) when the magnitude of the cosmological constant is increased, which implies that the former undergoes a slower collapse than the latter. Furthermore, we find that a temporary trapped surface is possible to emerge in the case of trigonometric solution in the naked singularity region only. Therefore, distant observers with observational time shorter than the collapse duration may conclude that a black hole is formed, although the collapse will eventually lead to a naked singularity formation.</description>

      <title>Massive Dirac-Pauli physics in lead-halide perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04450v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In standard quantum electrodynamics (QED), the so-called non-minimal (Pauli) coupling is suppressed for elementary particles and has no physical implications. Here, we show that the Pauli term naturally appears in a known family of Dirac materials -- the lead-halide perovskites, suggesting a novel playground for the study of analogue QED effects. We outline measurable manifestations of the Pauli term in the phenomena pertaining to (i) relativistic corrections to bound states (ii) the Klein paradox, and (iii) spin effects in scattering. In particular, we demonstrate that (a) the binding energy of an electron in the vicinity of a positively charged defect is noticeably decreased due to the polarizability of lead ions and the appearance of a Darwin-like term, (b) strong spin-orbit coupling due to the Pauli term affects the exciton states, and (c) scattering of an electron off an energy barrier with broken mirror symmetry produces spin polarization in the outgoing current. Our study adds to understanding of quantum phenomena in lead-halide perovskites, and paves the way for tabletop simulations of analogue Dirac-Pauli equations.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo studies of quantum cosmology by the generalized Lefschetz thimble method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17724v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum cosmology aims at elucidating the beginning of our Universe. Back in early 80's, Vilenkin and Hartle-Hawking put forward the "tunneling from nothing" and "no boundary" proposals. Recently there has been renewed interest in this subject from the viewpoint of defining the oscillating path integral for Lorentzian quantum gravity using the Picard-Lefschetz theory. Aiming at going beyond the mini-superspace and saddle-point approximations, we perform Monte Carlo calculations using the generalized Lefschetz thimble method to overcome the sign problem. In particular, we confirm that either Vilenkin or Hartle-Hawking saddle point becomes relevant if one uses the Robin boundary condition depending on its parameter. We also clarify some fundamental issues in quantum cosmology, such as an issue related to the integration domain of the lapse function and an issue related to reading off the real geometry from the complex geometry obtained at the saddle point.</description>

      <title>Strong decays of $a_0$, $f_0$, $f_2$, and $K^*_2$ resonances as dynamically generated states of two vector mesons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05302v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The two-body strong decays of the $f_0(1500)$, $f_0(1710)$, $a_0(1710)$, $f_2(1270)$, $f_2'(1525)$, and $K_2^*(1430)$ resonances are investigated, assuming them as dynamically generated states of two vector mesons via $s$-wave interactions. The partial decay widths of all the possible two-body pseudoscalar meson-pseudoscalar meson final states are calculated considering the triangular diagrams. It is found that the ratios of branching fractions are similar to the previous results for most channels, which were obtained by using the real-axis method and considering the box diagrams. However, there are also differences. In addition, our focus is on the partial decay widths. More precise experimental measurements are needed to test the model calculations and determine the nature of these scalar and tensor mesons. It is anticipated that the BES\uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral3}, Belle\uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral2} and LHCb collaborations will conduct these measurements in the future.</description>

      <title>Probing strangeness with event topology classifiers in pp collisions at energies available at the CERN Large Hadron Collider with the rope hadronization mechanism in PYTHIA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05454v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In relativistic heavy-ion collisions, the formation of a deconfined and thermalized state of partons, known as quark-gluon plasma (QGP), leads to enhanced production of strange hadrons in contrast to proton-proton (pp) collisions, which are taken as baseline. This observation is known as strangeness enhancement in heavy-ion collisions and is considered one of the important signatures that can signify the formation of QGP. However, in addition to strangeness enhancement, recent measurements hint at observing several heavy-ion-like features in high multiplicity pp collisions at energies available at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. Alternatively, event shape observables, such as transverse spherocity, transverse sphericity, charged particle flattenicity, and relative transverse activity classifiers, can fundamentally separate hard interaction-dominated jetty events from soft isotropic events. These features of event shape observables can probe the observed heavy-ion-like features in pp collisions with significantly reduced selection bias and can bring all collision systems on equal footing. In this article, we present an extensive summary of the strange particle ratios to pions as a function of different event classifiers using the PYTHIA~8 model with color reconnection and rope hadronization mechanisms to understand the microscopic origin of strangeness enhancement in pp collisions and also prescribe the applicability of these event classifiers in the context of strangeness enhancement. Charged particle flattenicity is found to be most suited for the study of strangeness enhancement, and it shows a quantitative enhancement similar to that seen for the analysis based on the number of multi-parton interactions.</description>

Abstract: Detections of gravitational waves since GW150914 has gained renewed interest in potential quantum-classical correspondences between GWs and gravitons. While a complete quantum theory of gravity remains elusive, graviton fluctuations have been hypothesized as sources of stochastic noise in gravitational interactions. Utilizing the Einstein-Langevin equation that describes graviton fluctuations, in attempt to form a correlation with GW generation, we treat the coalescing binary heuristically as a rotating, contracting Gaussian volume. This stochatic picture of GW formation implies the treatment of the contained gravitons as a Brownian bath. From the Einstein-Langevin equation, we establish a scaling relation where quanta dissipation depends inversely with the contracting volume (i.e., coalescence). Using an Euler iteration scheme, we simulate the graviton fluctuations from inspiral to merger as a Wiener process, revealing a signal that qualitatively resembles macroscopic GW waveforms. While inherently heuristic, this approach provides a computational framework for exploring graviton-scale perturbations in GW formation, with reproducible implementations in Wolfram Mathematica and equivalent Python code in the appendix.</description>

      <title>Discovery of Quasi-Integrable Equations from traveling-wave data using the Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19014v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for analyzing nonlinear partial differential equations and identifying governing equations from observational data. In this study, we apply PINNs to investigate vortex-type solutions of quasi-integrable equations in two spatial dimensions, specifically the Zakharov-Kuznetsov (ZK) and the Regularized Long-Wave (RLW) equations. These equations are toy models for geostrophic shallow water dynamics in planetary atmospheres. We first demonstrate that PINNs can successfully solve these equations in the forward process using a mesh-free approach with automatic differentiation. However, in the inverse process, substantial misidentification occurs due to the structural similarities between the ZK and the RLW equations. To address this issue, we then introduce conservation law-enhanced PINNs, initial condition variations, and a friction-based perturbation approach to improve identification accuracy. Our results show that incorporating small perturbations while preserving conservation laws significantly enhances the resolution of equation identification. These findings may contribute to the broader goal of using deep learning techniques for discovering governing equations in complex fluid dynamical systems, such as Jupiter's Great Red Spot.</description>

      <title>Ultra-Slow-Roll Inflation on the Lattice I: Backreaction and Nonlinear Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23942v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Violating the slow-roll regime during the final stages of inflation can significantly enhance curvature perturbations, a scenario often invoked in models producing primordial black holes and small-scale scalar induced gravitational waves. When perturbations are enhanced, one approaches the regime in which tree-level computations are insufficient, and nonlinear corrections may become relevant. In this work, we conduct lattice simulations of ultra-slow-roll (USR) dynamics to investigate the significance of nonlinear effects, both in terms of backreaction on the background and in the evolution of perturbations. Our systematic study of various USR potentials reveals that nonlinear corrections are significant when the tree-level curvature power spectrum peaks at $\mathcal{P}^{\rm max}_{\zeta} = {\cal O}(10^{-3})-{\cal O}(10^{-2})$, with 5%-20% corrections. Larger enhancements yield even greater differences. We find a simple universal relation between simulation and tree-level quantities $\dot\phi = \dot\phi_{\rm tree}\left(1+\sqrt{\mathcal{P}^{\rm max}_{\zeta,\rm tree}}\right)$ at the end of the USR phase, which is valid in all cases we consider. Additionally, we explore how nonlinear interactions during the USR phase affect the clustering and non-Gaussianity of scalar fluctuations, crucial for understanding the phenomenological consequences of USR, such as scalar-induced gravitational waves and primordial black holes. Our findings demonstrate the necessity of going beyond leading order perturbation theory results, through higher-order or non-perturbative computations, to make robust predictions for inflation models exhibiting a USR phase.</description>

Abstract: We set up an effective field theory formulation for the renormalization flow of matrix product states (MPS) with finite bond dimension, focusing on systems exhibiting finite-entanglement scaling close to a conformally invariant critical fixed point. We show that the finite MPS bond dimension $\chi$ is equivalent to introducing a perturbation by a relevant operator to the fixed-point Hamiltonian. The fingerprint of this mechanism is encoded in the $\chi$-independent universal transfer matrix's gap ratios, which are distinct from those predicted by the unperturbed Conformal Field Theory. This phenomenon defines a renormalization group self-congruent point, where the relevant coupling constant ceases to flow due to a balance of two effects; When increasing $\chi$, the infrared scale, set by the correlation length $\xi(\chi)$, increases, while the strength of the perturbation at the lattice scale decreases. The presence of a self-congruent point does not alter the validity of the finite-entanglement scaling hypothesis, since the self-congruent point is located at a finite distance from the critical fixed point, well inside the scaling regime of the CFT. We corroborate this framework with numerical evidences from the exact solution of the Ising model and density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations of an effective lattice model.</description>

      <title>Background-dependent and classical correspondences between $f(Q)$ and $f(T)$ gravity</title>

Abstract: $f(Q)$ and $f(T)$ gravity are based on fundamentally different geometric frameworks, yet they exhibit many similar properties. This article provides a comprehensive summary and comparative analysis of the various theoretical branches of torsional gravity and non-metric gravity, which arise from different choices of affine connection. We identify two types of background-dependent and classical correspondences between these two theories of gravity. The first correspondence is established through their equivalence within the Minkowski spacetime background. To achieve this, we develop the tetrad-spin formulation of $f(Q)$ gravity and derive the corresponding expression for the spin connection. The second correspondence is based on the equivalence of their equations of motion. Utilizing a metric-affine approach, we derive the general affine connection for static and spherically symmetric spacetime in $f(Q)$ gravity and compare its equations of motion with those of $f(T)$ gravity. Among others, our results reveal that, $f(T)$ solutions are not simply a subset of $f(Q)$ solutions; rather, they encompass a complex solution beyond $f(Q)$ gravity in black hole background.</description>

      <title>New analysis of SNeIa Pantheon Catalog: Variable speed of light as an alternative to dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05262v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In A&amp;A 412, 35 (2003) Blanchard, Douspis, Rowan-Robinson, and Sarkar (BDRS) slightly modified the primordial fluctuation spectrum and produced an excellent fit to WMAP's CMB power spectrum for an Einstein-de Sitter (EdS) universe, bypassing dark energy. Curiously, they obtained a Hubble value of $H_0\approx46$, in sharp conflict with the canonical range $H_0\sim67-73$. However, we will demonstrate that the reduced value of $H_0\approx46$ achieved by BDRS is fully compatible with the use of variable speed of light in analyzing the late-time cosmic acceleration observed in Type Ia supernovae (SNeIa). In Phys. Lett. B 862, 139357 (2025) we uncovered a hidden aspect in a generic class of scale-invariant actions: the dynamics of the dilaton can induce a variation in the speed of light as $c\propto\chi^{1/2}$, causing $c$ to vary alongside $\chi$ across spacetime. For an EdS universe with varying $c$, besides the effects of cosmic expansion, light waves emitted from distant SNeIa are further subject to a refraction effect, which alters the Lemaitre redshift relation to $1+z=a^{-3/2}$. Based on this new formula, we achieve a fit to the SNeIa Pantheon Catalog exceeding the quality of the $\Lambda$CDM model. Crucially, our approach does not require dark energy and produces $H_0=47.2$ in strong alignment with the BDRS finding of $H_0\approx46$. Hence, BDRS's analysis of the (early-time) CMB power spectrum and our variable-$c$ analysis of the (late-time) Hubble diagram of SNeIa fully agree on two counts: (i) the dark energy hypothesis is avoided, and (ii) $H_0$ is reduced to $\sim47$, which also yields an age $t_0=2/(3H_0)=13.8$ Gy for an EdS universe, without requiring dark energy. Most importantly, we will demonstrate that the late-time acceleration can be attributed to the declining speed of light in an expanding EdS universe, rather than to a dark energy component.</description>

      <title>Three-loop jet function for boosted heavy quarks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06881v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the inclusive jet function for boosted heavy quarks to $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^3)$. The jet function is defined and calculated in the framework of boosted Heavy-Quark Effective Theory (bHQET). It describes the effect of radiation collimated in narrow jets arising from energetic heavy quarks on observables probing the jet invariant mass $M$ in the region where $M^2 - m^2 \ll m^2$, with $m$ the heavy quark mass. This kinematic situation is relevant e.g. in boosted top (pair) production at high-energy colliders. We have verified that our result satisfies non-Abelian exponentiation and checked that our calculation reproduces the known cusp and non-cusp anomalous dimensions of the jet function to $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^3)$. We also confirmed that the $n_\ell^2\alpha_s^3$ contribution, where $n_\ell$ is the number of massless quark flavors, agrees with the prediction from renormalon calculus. Our computation provides the last missing piece to obtain the N$^3$LL$^\prime$ resummed (self-normalized) thrust distribution used for the calibration of the top quark mass parameter in parton-shower Monte Carlo generators. Our result also contributes to the invariant mass distribution of reconstructed top quarks at N$^3$LL$^\prime$, which can be employed for a precise top mass determination at future lepton colliders. As a by-product, we obtain the relation between the pole and short-distance jet-mass schemes at $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^3)$. Finally, we estimate the non-logarithmic contribution to the four-loop jet function based on renormalon dominance.</description>

      <title>The Role of Integration Cycles in Complex Langevin Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17137v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Complex Langevin simulations are an attempt to solve the sign (or complex-action) problem encountered in various physical systems of interest. The method is based on a complexification of the underlying degrees of freedom and an evolution in an auxiliary time dimension. The complexification, however, does not come without drawbacks, the most severe of which is the infamous 'wrong convergence' problem, stating that complex Langevin simulations sometimes fail to produce correct answers despite their apparent convergence. It has long been realized that wrong convergence may - in principle - be fixed by the introduction of a suitable kernel into the complex Langevin equation, such that the conventional correctness criteria are met. However, as we discuss in this work, complex Langevin results may - especially in the presence of a kernel - still be affected by unwanted so-called integration cycles of the theory spoiling them. Indeed, we confirm numerically that in the absence of boundary terms the complex Langevin results are given by a linear combination of such integration cycles, as put forward by Salcedo &amp; Seiler. In particular, we shed light on the way different choices of kernel affect which integration cycles are being sampled in a simulation and how this knowledge can be used to ensure correct convergence in simple toy models.</description>

      <title>Searches for Power-Law Warped Extra Dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20913v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extra dimensions with a bulk dilaton field can be power-law warped, unlike the exponential warping in the Randall-Sundrum (RS) model. We show that this mildly warped extra dimension can address the hierarchy problem with a novel Kaluza-Klein (KK) spectrum characterized by lighter feebly coupled KK modes compared to the KK modes in the RS model. We investigate the prospects of searching for signatures of such KK modes at current and future colliders, such as the LHC, CLIC, and FCC-ee using visible decays of KK gravitons. We also update the current bounds and projected limits for the RS model and the linear dilaton (LD) model. Furthermore, we explore the long-lived regime of KK gravitons at beam dump experiments, e.g., FASER2, MATHUSLA, and SHiP, as well as constraints from astrophysical and cosmological observations. We find that combining both kinds of searches will enable comprehensive coverage of the model parameter space relevant to the electroweak hierarchy problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10662v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study non-local operators for analyzing the Higgs-confinement phase transition in lattice gauge theory. Since the nature of the Higgs-confinement phase transition is topological, its order parameter is the expectation value of non-local operators, such as loop and surface operators. There exist several candidates for the non-local operators. Adopting the charge-2 Abelian Higgs model, we test numerical simulation of conventional ones, the Polyakov loop and the 't Hooft loop, and an unconventional one, the Aharonov-Bohm phase defined by the Wilson loop wrapping around a vortex line.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14891v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a semiclassical study of the Mixmaster cosmology minimally coupled to a massive scalar field in the Hamiltonian formalism, with focus on three distinct scenarios: the classical cosmology coupled to the quantized scalar field, and "effective" cosmology, with spacetime discreteness corrections, coupled to the classical scalar field, and to the quantized scalar field. We find several results: (i) the effective cosmology undergoes several small bounces before expanding, with scalar field excitations rising through the bounce; (ii) anisotropies rise and fall as the universe undergoes a bounce, a feature that is enhanced with matter; (iii) Lyapunov exponents reveal that chaos is reduced in the effective systems compared to the classical case.</description>

      <title>Nonstatic Reissner-Nordstr\"om metric in the perturbative $f(R)$ theory: Embedding in the background of the FLRW cosmology, uniqueness of solutions, the TOV equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12160v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article introduces a nonstatic Reissner-Nordstr\"om metric, a metric that does not emit electromagnetic waves but can emit gravitational waves. We first use the GR theory to study a charged spherically symmetric gravitational source (CSSGS), the obtained results are further improved in comparison with the previous studies. In particular, this article considers that the field is not necessarily static. The metric tensors $ g_{\mu\nu} $ are considered both outside and inside the gravitational source (the results show that in the first case $ g_{\mu\nu} $ are time independent, in the latter case they are time dependent). The gravitational acceleration and the event horizon of a charged black hole are investigated. The results prove that the gravitational field is always attractive. We then use the perturbative $ f(R) $ theory to consider CSSGS. The obtained results not only correct the solution of Einstein's equation in magnitude (this will describe astronomical and cosmological quantities more accurately than Einstein's equation), but also reveal new effects. Outside the gravitational source, the metric tensors can depend on time, this makes it possible for a spherically symmetric gravitational source to emit gravitational waves (Einstein's equation cannot give this effect). However, a spherically symmetric field still does not emit electromagnetic waves. Next we present a new method for embedding the spherically symmetric metrics of a star (or a black hole) in the background of the FLRW cosmological. Finally, we discuss the uniqueness of the solutions of the f(R) theory. The perturbative TOV equation is also found.</description>

      <title>Tomography of the Rho meson in the QCD Instanton Vacuum: Transverse Momentum Dependent Parton Distribution Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11959v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyse the rho meson unpolarized and polarized transverse momentum dependent parton distribution functions (TMDPDFs) in the instanton liquid model (ILM). The corresponding TMDs in ILM are approximated by a constituent quark beam function in the leading Fock state multiplied by a rapidity-dependent factor resulting from the staple-shaped Wilson lines, for fixed longitudinal momentum, transverse separation, and rapidity. At the resolution of the ILM, all of the rho meson TMDs are symmetric in parton x for fixed transverse momentum, and Gaussian-like in the transverse momentum for fixed parton x. The latter is a direct consequence of the profiling of the quark zero modes in the ILM. The evolved TMDs at higher rapidity using the Collins-Soper kernel, and higher resolution using the renormalization group (RG), show substantial skewness towards low parton x.</description>

      <title>Interpreting Cosmic Birefringence and DESI Data with Evolving Axion in $\Lambda$CDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18924v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent cosmological observations have revealed growing tensions with the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, including indications of isotropic cosmic birefringence and deviations from $w = -1$ in the dark energy equation of state, as suggested by DESI and supernova measurements. In this paper, we point out that such deviations can arise even from a subdominant energy density component. We then propose a unified framework based on a dynamical axion field that simultaneously accounts for both anomalies, providing a simple and natural extension of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. In our scenario, the axion field with $2H_0\lesssim m\lesssim 6H_0$, where $H_0$ is the current Hubble constant, induces a nonzero rotation of the CMB polarization plane and modifies the present-day dark energy equation of state. This framework accommodates recent observational data with natural parameter choices, even for a string axion with a decay constant of order $10^{17}\,$GeV.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Landscapes: black holes with linear equations of state in asymptotically safe gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23193v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study black holes with linear equation of state within the framework of asymptotically safe gravity. This study extends previous work on gravitational collapse in asymptotically safe gravity (that has been done for a dust fluid) by considering into account the pressure of stellar matter. We derive modified field equations containing the running gravitational coupling and the cosmological constant as functions of energy density. The interior space-time of collapsing star is modeled by the Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker metric, while the exterior is described by a static spherically symmetric space-time. Different equations of state from ordinary matter to exotic phantom energy are considered to investigate their impact on black hole structure and horizon formation. Our results illustrate that asymptotically safe gravity can introduce non-singular black hole solutions under specific conditions. These results provide new insights into black hole physics and the avoidance of singularities within the asymptotically safe gravity framework.</description>

      <title>Rigorous results for timelike Liouville field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02348v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Liouville field theory has long been a cornerstone of two-dimensional quantum field theory and quantum gravity, which has attracted much recent attention in the mathematics literature. Timelike Liouville field theory is a version of Liouville field theory where the kinetic term in the action appears with a negative sign, which makes it closer to a theory of quantum gravity than ordinary (spacelike) Liouville field theory. Making sense of this "wrong sign" requires a theory of Gaussian random variables with negative variance. Such a theory is developed in this paper, and is used to prove the timelike DOZZ formula for the $3$-point correlation function when the parameters satisfy the so-called "charge neutrality condition". Expressions are derived also for the $k$-point correlation functions for all $k\ge 3$, and it is shown that these functions approach the correct semiclassical limits as the coupling constant is sent to zero.</description>
