      <title>Spectrophotometry in the integrated light of multiple populations in globular clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is vast evidence from observations of multiple stellar populations (MPs) in globular clusters (GCs). To explore the issue theoretically, this work considers two subsolar metallicities, two ages, and two initial abundance patterns: a first population of standard $\alpha$-enhanced metal mixture stars and a second stellar population displaying C-N and Na-O anticorrelations chemical abundance patterns, along with an enhanced helium fraction. Analysing the predictions for these extreme compositions, we provide insights into the observability of not-resolved MPs into individual stars of GCs. We use colours and spectrophotometric indices measurable with modern facilities (e.g. Euclid, LSST, DES, JWST).</description>

      <title>Dynamical streams in the local stellar halo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Co-moving groups of stars (streams) are well known in the velocity space of the disc near the Sun. Many are thought to arise from resonances with the Galactic bar or spiral arms. In this work, we search for similar moving groups in the velocity space of the halo, at low angular momentum. From the asymmetry of the radial velocity distribution $v_R$, we identify two inward-moving streams with $v_R&lt;0$ and small $|v_\phi|$. These are projections of the `chevrons' previously discovered in radial phase space $(R,v_R)$. A test particle simulation in a realistic Milky Way potential with a decelerating bar naturally produces analogues of these features, and they are observed across a wide range of metallicity. They are therefore very likely to be dynamical streams created by trapping in the bar's resonances. Specifically, they occupy regions of phase space where orbits are trapped in the corotation and outer Lindblad resonances respectively. By tracing these streams across a range of radii in $(R,v_R)$ space, we fit resonant orbits to their tracks in a flexible potential with variable bar pattern speed. This allows us to simultaneously constrain the mass profile of the Milky Way for $r\lesssim20$ kpc and the pattern speed $\Omega_\mathrm{b}$. We estimate the mass enclosed within $r=20$ kpc to be $M_{20}=(2.17\pm0.21)\times10^{11}M_\odot$, and the pattern speed to be $\Omega_\mathrm{b}=31.9_{-1.9}^{+1.8}$ km/s/kpc. Our fitted potential is in excellent agreement with previous results, while we favour a slightly slower pattern speed than most recent estimates.</description>

      <title>The THESAN-ZOOM project: Long-term imprints of external reionization on galaxy evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of ionizing external ultraviolet (UV) radiation on low-mass haloes ($M_{h}&lt;10^{10}M_\odot$) at high redshift using $1140M_\odot$ baryonic resolution zoom-in simulations of seven regions from the THESAN-ZOOM project. We compare three simulation sets that differ in the treatment of external UV radiation: one employing a uniform UV background initiated at z=10.6 in addition to radiation transport for local sources, another with the same background starting at z=5.5, and the default configuration in which the large-scale radiation field from the parent THESAN-1 simulation box acts as a boundary condition. The multi-phase interstellar medium (ISM) model, combined with its high mass resolution, allows us to resolve all star-forming haloes and capture the back-reaction of ionizing radiation on galaxy properties during the epoch of reionization. When present, external UV radiation efficiently unbinds gas in haloes with masses below $10^9M_\odot$ and suppresses subsequent star formation. As a result, in simulations with early reionization, minihaloes fail to form stars from pristine gas, leading to reduced metal enrichment of gas later accreted by more massive haloes. Consequently, haloes with masses below $10^{10}M_\odot$ at all simulated epochs (z&gt;3) exhibit lower metallicities and altered metallicity distributions. The more accurate and realistic shielding from external UV radiation, achieved through self-consistent radiative transfer, permits the existence of a cold but low-density gas phase down to z=3. These findings highlight the importance of capturing a patchy reionization history in high-resolution simulations targeting high-redshift galaxy formation. We conclude that at minimum, a semi-numerical model that incorporates spatially inhomogeneous reionization and a non-uniform metallicity floor is necessary to accurately emulate metal enrichment in minihaloes.</description>

      <title>Understanding entropy in massive halos: The role of baryon decoupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of the work presented in this paper is to use observed entropy profiles to infer constraints on the accretion process in massive halos. We compare entropy profiles from various observational samples with those generated by an updated version of the semi-analytical models developed in the early 2000s, modified to reflect recent advancements in our understanding of large-structure formation. Our model reproduces the growing departure from self-similarity observed in data as we move inward in individual profiles and down in mass across different profiles. These deviations stem from a phase of extremely low gas content centered around $10^{13}$M$_\odot$. According to our model, halos at this mass scale are missing between 50% and 90% of their baryons, corresponding to a gas fraction ranging between 2% and 8%. Baryon decoupling, the mechanism at the heart of our model, proves effective in explaining much of the behavior we sought to understand.</description>

      <title>Much Ado About Nothing: Galaxy Formation and Galactic Outflows in Cosmic Voids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theoretical framework for calculating the volume filling fraction of galactic outflows in cosmic voids by integrating analytical models for the halo mass function (HMF), the halo occupation fraction, the stellar mass-halo mass relation, and outflow sizes. Using RAMSES, we perform a hydrodynamical zoom-in simulation of the central 25 cMpc/h region of a spherical void, identified as the lowest-density region among 1,000 random spheres in a parent 1 Gpc box simulation. This void has a diameter of 120 cMpc/h and a density contrast of $\delta \simeq -0.8$. We find that the properties of void galaxies remain stable when expanding the zoom-in region to 50 cMpc/h, though our relatively low mass resolution impacts the results. Our higher-resolution simulation aligns with the analytical HMF that accounts for the void's underdensity and size. While higher resolution improves stellar mass estimates for low-mass halos, computational constraints necessitate a theoretical framework that enables extrapolation to infinite resolution. Our analytical model, calibrated to our simulations, enables extrapolation down to the filtering mass of star-forming halos. To compare galaxy properties in this void with those in the field, we conduct a companion field simulation of the same box size. At infinite resolution, we predict wind volume filling fractions of $18.6\%$ in the field and $3.1\%$ in our void, with values dependent on cosmic variance, void size, and underdensity. Dwarf galaxies contribute minimally, and resolving halos to $M_{\rm h}=10^{10} M_\odot$ suffices for robust estimates. Applying our framework to the Local Group void ($\delta \simeq -0.5$, $R=20\ \mathrm{cMpc}$), we predict a wind volume filling fraction of $9.6\%\pm3.3\%$.</description>

      <title>Cluster Ages to Reconstruct the Milky Way Assembly (CARMA). III. NGC 288 as the first Splashed globular cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The globular clusters (GCs) system of the Milky Way (MW) comprises a mixture of both in situ and accreted clusters. Tracing the origin of GCs provides invaluable insights into the formation history of the MW. However, reconciling diverse strands of evidence is often challenging: a notable example is NGC 288, where despite significant efforts in the literature, the available chrono-chemodynamical data have yet to provide a definitive conclusion regarding its origin. On one side, all post-Gaia dynamical studies indicate an accreted origin for NGC 288 from in the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE) dwarf galaxy. On the other, NGC 288 has been found to be 2.5 Gyr older than other GSE GCs at the same metallicity, this suggesting a different, possibly in situ origin. In this work, we address the unresolved question on the origin of NGC 288 by analyzing its chrono-chemical properties in an unprecedentedly homogeneous framework. First, we compare the location of NGC 288 in the age-metallicity plane with that of other two in situ GCs at similar metallicity, namely NGC 6218 and NGC 6362. The age estimates obtained within the homogeneous framework of the CARMA collaboration show that the three clusters are coeval, this reinforcing the contrast with the dynamical interpretation. Then, we compare the abundances with the sample of in situ and accreted clusters at similar metallicity presented in Ceccarelli et al. 2024, finding again consistency with the chemistry of in situ systems. To reconcile these results with its orbital properties, we propose a scenario where NGC 288 formed in the proto-disc of the MW, and then was dynamically heated by the interaction with the GSE merger, a fate similar to that of proto-disc stars experiencing the so-called Splash event. NGC 288 therefore demonstrates the importance of a homogeneous chrono-chemodynamical information in the interpretation of the origin of MW GCs.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic AGN survey at $z$ $\sim$ 2 with NTT/SOFI for GRAVITY+ observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the advent of GRAVITY+, the upgrade to the beam combiner GRAVITY at the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI), fainter and higher redshift active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are becoming observable, opening an unprecedented opportunity to further our understanding of the cosmic coevolution of supermassive black holes and their host galaxies. To identify an initial sample of high-redshift type~1 AGNs that can be observed with GRAVITY+, we have obtained spectroscopic data with NTT/SOFI of the most promising candidates. Our goal is to measure their broad line region (BLR) fluxes and assess their physical geometries by analysing the spectral profiles of their Balmer lines. We present 29 $z$ $\sim$ 2 targets with strong H$\alpha$ emission in the $K$-band. Their line profiles are strongly non-Gaussian, with a narrow core and broad wings. This can be explained as a combination of rotation and turbulence contributing to the total profile or two physically distinct inner and outer regions. We find small H$\alpha$ virial factors, which we attribute to the low full-width-half-maximum (FWHM)/$\sigma$ ratios of their non-Gaussian profiles, noting that this can lead to discrepancies in black hole masses derived from scaling relations. We also find two targets that show tentative evidence of BLRs dominated by radial motions. Lastly, we estimate the expected differential phase signals that will be seen with GRAVITY+, which will provide guidance for the observing strategy that will be adopted.</description>

      <title>Low redshift post-starburst galaxies host abundant HI reservoirs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studying the gas content of post-starburst (PSB) galaxies can provide valuable clues regarding the process of fast quenching. Although previous works have studied the molecular gas content of PSBs, only a handful of HI measurements exist. Here, we present new Five hundred metre Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST) 21cm observations of 44 PSBs, leading to 42 detections or sensitive upper limits of HI, which we combine with 26 archival measurements, for a total sample of 68 PSB MHI measurements. HI is detected in 57/68 galaxies, with HI masses ranging from MHI ~10^8.5 up to 10^10 Msun and gas fractions (fHI = MHI/M*) from a few percent up to almost 30 percent. Post-starbursts therefore retain ample atomic gas reservoirs, despite no longer forming stars. By comparing with a stellar mass-matched sample of star-forming galaxies in xGASS, we find that PSBs have, on average, gas fractions lower by ~0.2-0.4 dex, consistent with a mild reduction compared with their progenitor population. However, PSBs show a diversity of HI properties; about half have HI gas masses within the expected scatter of the star-forming population with the remaining 50 per cent up to a factor of 10 more gas-poor. Compared with galaxies in the green valley, about two thirds of PSBs have gas fractions within the expected range, with the remaining third up to a factor of 10 more gas-rich. Our results demonstrate that quenching in PSBs is not the result of wholesale removal of the atomic gas reservoir and that the population has atomic gas fractions that span the range from star-forming to green valley galaxies. We find no correlation between HI gas mass and time since burst; even galaxies a Gyr past their burst can remain HI-normal. The significant gas reservoirs remaining in many PSBs leaves open the possibility for future rekindling of star formation.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Expanding HII Regions on Filament G37:Curved Magnetic Field and Multiple Direction Material Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Filament G37 exhibits a distinctive "caterpillar" shape, characterized by two semicircular structures within its 40\,pc-long body, providing an ideal target to investigate the formation and evolution of filaments. By analyzing multiple observational data, such as CO spectral line, the H$\alpha$\,RRL, and multi-wavelength continuum, we find that the expanding H\,{\scriptsize II} regions surrounding filament G37 exert pressure on the structure of the filament body, which kinetic process present as the gas flows in multiple directions along its skeleton. The curved magnetic field structure of filament G37 derived by employing the Velocity Gradient Technique with CO is found to be parallel to the filament body and keeps against the pressure from expanded H\,{\scriptsize II} regions. The multi-directional flows in the filament G37 could cause the accumulation and subsequent collapse of gas, resulting in the formation of massive clumps. The curved structure and star formation observed in filament G37 are likely a result of the filament body being squeezed by the expanding H\,{\scriptsize II} region. This physical process occurs over a timescale of approximately 5\,Myr. The filament G37 provides a potential candidate for end-dominated collapse.</description>

      <title>Are purely gaseous bars in dwarf-irregulars a myth?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: About two-thirds of the galactic disks exhibit a central ellipsoidal stellar component called the bar, with or without a gaseous counterpart. However, there are a few dwarf galaxies with purely gaseous bars: NGC3741, NGC2915 and DDO168. This is a puzzle as gas is a collisional medium, and a gaseous bar is expected to be ripped off by shock waves. We study the formation of gaseous bars in these galaxies by constructing dynamical models constrained by stellar photometry and HI observations already available. We first analytically study the dynamical stability of the galactic disks against global $m=2$ perturbations. Our results indicate that the stellar and the gas disks are moderately unstable against these bar modes. Using N-body + hydrodynamical simulations employing $RAMSES$, we next find that a purely gaseous bar is formed in an oblate dark matter halo of vertical-to-planar axes ratio $c/a = 0.6 - 0.8$, with a relatively high-spin parameter $\Lambda = 0.04 - 0.07$, which survives for more than ten dynamical times. Further, the low values of our calculated Mach numbers $M=2-6$ of the gaseous medium comply with the survival of the gaseous bars, unaffected by shock waves. Interestingly, our simulations show the formation of a tiny stellar bar in each case. However, the temporal evolution of the change in angular momentum $L_z$ of the different disk components indicates the exchange of $L_z$ between the gas disk and the dark matter halo only; the $L_z$ of the stellar disk remained unchanged, indicating a weak stellar bar.</description>

      <title>Chemical signature reveals co-spatial dwarf satellite of an edge-on disc galaxy with MUSE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integral field unit (IFU) spectroscopic observations of resolved galaxies provide an optimal experimental setting for determination of stellar population properties, in particular - age, metallicity and $\alpha$-enhancement, which are key to understanding evolution of galaxies across diverse physical environments. We determine these properties for the edge-on disc galaxy IC 1553, through stellar population models fitted to MUSE IFU observations. From our determined spatial distributions of metallicity and [$\alpha$/Fe], we serendipitiously identify the unique chemical signature of a dwarf galaxy that is co-spatial with the luminous disc of IC 1553. The dwarf galaxy is characterized by the presence of higher [$\alpha$/Fe] and metal-poor stellar populations relative to the disc of IC 1553. The identified dwarf is dynamically cold from its determined kinematics, consistent with being a satellite of IC 1553. From modeling the Spitzer IRAC 3.6 $\mu m$ image of IC 1553, we confirmed the presence of the dwarf galaxy and calculated its stellar mass to be $\sim1.28\times 10^{9} \rm M_{\odot}$. This is the first such identification of a dwarf galaxy from its unique chemical signature in such integrated light IFU observations, even though its hidden by the luminous body of its massive host.</description>

      <title>CO Emission and Absorption-line Survey of the M87 Nucleus Using Archival ALMA Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an M87 molecular line search from archival Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array (ALMA) imaging, covering the circumnuclear disk (CND) as well as ionized gas filaments and dusty cloud regions. We find no evidence for CO emission in the central ~kpc and place an upper limit of $M_{H_2} &lt; 2.3\times 10^5$ $M_\odot$ in the atomic gas CND, a factor of 20$\times$ lower than previous surveys. During this search, we discovered extragalactic CO absorption lines in the J = 1-0, 2-1, and 3-2 transitions against the bright (Jy-scale) active nucleus. These CO lines are narrow (~5 km s$^{-1}$) and blueshifted with respect to the galaxy's systemic velocity by -75 to -84 km s$^{-1}$. This CO absorber appears to be kinematically distinct from outflowing atomic gas seen in absorption. Assuming a diffuse molecular phase, low integrated opacities ranging from $\tau_{CO} \sim 0.02-0.06$ km s$^{-1}$ and column density $N_{CO} = 1.16\times 10^{15}$ cm$^{-2}$ translate to $N_{H_2} \sim (1-2) \times 10^{20}$ cm$^{-2}$. CO excitation temperatures spanning $T_{ex} \sim 8$ K to ~30 K do not follow local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) expectations, and non-LTE radex radiative transfer modeling suggests the CO absorber has a number density $n_{H_2} \sim 5000$ cm$^{-3}$. Taken together, the observed CO absorption lines are most consistent with a thin, pressure-confined filament seen slightly off-center from the M87 nucleus. We also use these ALMA data to explore the impact of residual telluric lines and atmospheric variability on the identification and classification of narrow extragalactic lines. Additionally, we demonstrate how bandpass calibration limitations may introduce broad but very low S/N absorption and emission signatures near such a bright continuum source.</description>

      <title>The role of turbulence in setting the phase of the ISM and implications for the star formation rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the link between star formation, turbulence and the thermal state of the multi-phase interstellar medium (ISM). We analyse a suite of stratified box simulations modelling a realistic ISM that aims to probe environments similar to those found in the Milky Way. Turbulence is injected through stellar feedback and an external large-scale driving force. We find that star formation can be either boosted or reduced when increasing the external driving strength, depending on the environment. When the density is sufficiently high, warm neutral gas naturally transitions to the cold phase, leading to high cold neutral medium (CNM) fractions of around 40\%. Under these conditions, excessive large-scale driving leads to a slight reduction of the CNM fraction and an increase in the amount of gas that is thermally unstable. What limits the star formation in this regime is a reduced fraction of dense gas due to additional turbulent support against collapse. For low density regions, overdensities in which cooling is efficient are much rarer and we find that star formation is regulated by the formation of cold gas. In such cases, turbulence can significantly boost star formation by compressing gas in shocks and increasing the CNM fraction dramatically. In our simulations we see an increase from almost no CNM to up to a fraction of 15 \% when including external turbulence driving; leading to an associated increase in the star formation rate. We provide a model to quantify this behaviour and predict the CNM fraction by combining the standard ISM cooling/heating model with the density PDF generated by turbulence. The change in the dominant limiting process for star formation between low- and intermediate-density environments provides a natural explanation for the observed break in the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation around column densities of 9\,\Msun\, pc$^{-2}$.</description>

      <title>Luminosity and stellar mass functions of faint photometric satellites around spectroscopic central galaxies from DESI Year-1 Bright Galaxy Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We measure the luminosity functions (LFs) and stellar mass functions (SMFs) of photometric satellite galaxies around spectroscopically identified isolated central galaxies (ICGs). The photometric satellites are from the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys (DR9), while the spectroscopic ICGs are selected from the DESI Year-1 BGS sample. We can measure satellite LFs down to $r$-band absolute magnitudes of $M_{r,\mathrm{sat}}\sim-7$, around ICGs as small as $7.1&lt;\log_{10}M_{\ast,\mathrm{ICG}}/\mathrm{M_\odot}&lt;7.8$, with the stellar mass of ICGs measured by the DESI Fastspecfit pipeline. The satellite SMF can be measured down to $\log_{10}M_{\ast,\mathrm{sat}}/\mathrm{M_\odot}\sim 5.5$. Interestingly, we discover that the faint/low-mass end slopes of satellite LFs/SMFs become steeper with the decrease in the stellar masses of host ICGs, with smaller and nearby host ICGs capable of being used to probe their fainter satellites.. The steepest slopes are $-2.298\pm0.656$ and $-$2.888$\pm$0.916 for satellite LF and SMF, respectively. Detailed comparisons are performed between the satellite LFs around ICGs selected from DESI BGS or from the SDSS NYU-VAGC spectroscopic Main galaxies over $7.1&lt;\log_{10}M_{\ast,\mathrm{ICG}}/\mathrm{M_\odot}&lt;11.7$, showing reasonable agreements, but we show that the differences between DESI and SDSS stellar masses for ICGs play a role to affect the results. We also compare measurements based on DESI Fastspecfit and Cigale stellar masses used to bin ICGs, with the latter including the modeling of AGN based on WISE photometry, and we find good agreements in the measured satellite LFs by using either of the DESI stellar mass catalogs.</description>

      <title>Constraints on asteroid-mass primordial black holes in dwarf galaxies using Hubble Space Telescope photometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) in the asteroid-mass range remain a viable and until now unconstrained dark matter (DM) candidate. If such PBHs exist, they could be captured by stars in DM-dominated environments with low velocity dispersion such as ultra-faint dwarf galaxies (UFDs). The capture probability increases with the stellar mass, and captured PBHs would rapidly destroy their host stars. As a result, the presence of PBHs in UFDs would alter their stellar mass functions. Using photometric observations of three ultra-faint dwarf galaxies from the Hubble Space Telescope, we show that it is unlikely that their mass functions have been significantly modified by PBHs, and we place constraints on the PBH abundance. In the ultra-faint dwarf galaxy Triangulum II, PBHs around $10^{19}$g are excluded at the $2\sigma$ ($3\sigma$) level from constituting more than $\sim55\%$ ($\sim78\%$) of the dark matter, while the possibility that PBHs represent the entirety of the DM is excluded at the $3.7\sigma$ level.</description>

      <title>PDRs4All. XII. FUV-driven formation of hydrocarbon radicals and their relation with PAHs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present subarcsecond-resolution ALMA mosaics of the Orion Bar PDR in [CI] 609 um, C2H (4-3), and C18O (3-2) emission lines, complemented by JWST images of H2 and aromatic infrared band (AIB) emission. The rim of the Bar shows very corrugated structures made of small-scale H2 dissociation fronts (DFs). The [CI] 609 um emission peaks very close (~0.002 pc) to the main H2-emitting DFs, suggesting the presence of gas density gradients. These DFs are also bright and remarkably similar in C2H emission, which traces 'hydrocarbon radical peaks' characterized by very high C2H abundances, reaching up to several x10^-7. The high abundance of C2H and of related hydrocarbon radicals, such as CH3, CH2, and CH, can be attributed to gas-phase reactions driven by elevated temperatures, the presence of C+ and C, and the reactivity of FUV-pumped H2. The hydrocarbon radical peaks roughly coincide with maxima of the 3.4/3.3 um AIB intensity ratio, a proxy for the aliphatic-to-aromatic content of PAHs. This implies that the conditions triggering the formation of simple hydrocarbons also favor the formation (and survival) of PAHs with aliphatic side groups, potentially via the contribution of bottom-up processes in which abundant hydrocarbon radicals react in situ with PAHs. Ahead of the DFs, in the atomic PDR zone (where [H]&gt;&gt;[H2]), the AIB emission is brightest, but small PAHs and carbonaceous grains undergo photo-processing due to the stronger FUV field. Our detection of trace amounts of C2H in this zone may result from the photoerosion of these species. This study provides a spatially resolved view of the chemical stratification of key carbon carriers in a PDR. Overall, both bottom-up and top-down processes appear to link simple hydrocarbon molecules with PAHs in molecular clouds; however, the exact chemical pathways and their relative contributions remain to be quantified.</description>

      <title>A helical magnetic field in quasar NRAO150 revealed by Faraday rotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are some of the most luminous and extreme environments in the Universe. The central engines of AGN, believed to be super-massive black-holes, are fed by accretion discs threaded by magnetic fields within a dense magneto-ionic medium. We report our findings from polarimetric Very-long-baseline Interferometry (VLBI) observations of quasar NRAO150 taken in October 2022 using a combined network of the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) and Effelsberg 100-m Radio Telescope. These observations are the first co-temporal multi-frequency polarimetric VLBI observations of NRAO150 at frequencies above 15GHz. We use the new VLBI polarization calibration procedure, GPCAL, with polarization observations of frequencies of 12GHz, 15GHz, 24GHz, and 43GHz of NRAO150. From these observations, we measure Faraday rotation. Using our measurement of Faraday rotation, we also derive the intrinsic electric vector position angle (EVPA0) for the source. As a complementary measurement we determine the behavior of polarization as a function of observed frequency. The polarization from NRAO150 only comes from the core region, with a peak polarization intensity occurring at 24GHz. Across the core region of NRAO150 we see clear gradients in Faraday rotation and EVPA0 values that are aligned with the direction of the jet curving around the core region. We find that for the majority of the polarized region the polarization fraction is greater at higher frequencies, with intrinsic polarization fractions in the core 3%. The Faraday rotation gradients and circular patterns in EVPA0 are strong evidence for a helical/toroidal magnetic field, and the presence of low intrinsic polarization fractions indicate that the polarized emission and hence the helical/toroidal magnetic field, occur within the innermost jet.</description>

      <title>A new way to measure the distance to NGC1052-DF2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ a new way to measure the distance to NGC1052-DF2 via internal stellar velocity dispersions ($\sigma$) of its globular clusters (GCs). We obtained deep (15.1h), R=18,200, Ca Triplet integrated-light spectra for 10 GCs in NGC1052-DF2 using FLAMES GIRAFFE on VLT. For five GCs we measure $\sigma$, along with precision velocities for the whole sample. We also present a new photometric analysis based on 40 orbits of archival Hubble Space Telescope imaging for 16 spectroscopically confirmed GCs. Assuming that the NGC1052-DF2 GCs obey the $M_V$ -- log($\sigma$) relation followed by the Milky Way and M31 GCs, the NGC1052-DF2 GCs give a distance, $d=16.2\pm1.3$ (stat.) $\pm1.7$ (sys.) Mpc. By contrast, using a literature distance of $d=21.7$ Mpc from forward modelling of the TRGB, the GCs lie above the Milky Way + M31 relation by $\sim0.6$ magnitudes. For a shorter literature distance of 13 Mpc, the GCs fall below the relation by $\sim0.4$ mag. At $d = 16.2$ Mpc, we obtain mean dynamical $M/L_V = 1.61\pm0.44 M_\odot/L_\odot$, and median half-light radii, $r_h =3.0\pm0.5$ pc. This is entirely consistent with Milky Way GCs, with mean $M/L_V = 1.77\pm0.10 M_\odot/L_\odot$, median $r_h =3.2\pm0.6$ pc. For the further distance of 21.7 Mpc, we obtain low $M/L_V$ ratios ($M/L_V = 1.19\pm0.33 M_\odot/L_\odot$) which could suggest ages of $\sim6$ Gyr.. Such young ages are inconsistent with our MUSE stellar population (companion paper, Fahrion et al.) analysis of the NGC1052-DF2 GCs which indicates they are $\sim10$ Gyr old. For $d = 16.2$ Mpc, coupled with our new photometry, we find that the properties of the GCs in NGC1052-DF2 appear entirely consistent with those in the Milky Way and other Local Group galaxies. In order to reconcile the further distance with our results, a mass function more dwarf-depleted than the Milky Way GCs must be invoked for the GCs of NGC1052-DF2.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the globular clusters of NGC1052-DF2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ultra-diffuse galaxy (UDG) NGC1052-DF2 has captured the interest of astronomers ever since the low velocity dispersion measured from ten globular clusters (GCs) suggested a low dark matter fraction. Also, its GC system was found to be unusually bright, with a peak of the GC luminosity function at least one magnitude brighter than expected for a galaxy at a distance of 20 Mpc. In this work, we present an updated view of the GC system of NGC1052-DF2. We analysed archival MUSE data of NGC1052-DF2 to confirm the membership of four additional GCs based on their radial velocities, thereby raising the number of spectroscopically confirmed GCs to 16. We measured the ages and metallicities of eleven individual GCs, finding them to be old ($&gt; 9$ Gyr) with a range of metallicities from [M/H] = $-0.7$ to $-1.8$ dex. The majority of GCs are found to be more metal-poor than the host galaxy, with some metal-rich GCs sharing the metallicity of the host ([M/H] = $-$1.09$^{+0.09}_{-0.07}$ dex). The host galaxy shows a flat age and metallicity gradient out to 1 $R_\text{e}$. Using a distance measurement based on the internal GC velocity dispersions ($D = 16.2$ Mpc; Beasley et al. 2025), we derived photometric GC masses and found that the peak of the GC mass function compares well with that of the Milky Way. From updated GC velocities, we estimated the GC system velocity dispersion of NGC1052-DF2 with a simple kinematic model and found $\sigma_\text{GCS} = 14.86^{+3.89}_{-2.83}$ km s$^{-1}$. However, this value is reduced to $\sigma_\text{GCS} = 8.63^{+2.88}_{-2.14}$ km s$^{-1}$, when the one GC that has the highest relative velocity based on a low S/N spectrum is considered as an interloper. We discuss the possible origin of NGC1502-DF2 considering the lower distance, spread of GC metallicities, flat stellar population profiles, and dynamical mass estimate.</description>

      <title>Self-Consistent JWST Census of Star Formation and AGN activity at z=5.5-13.5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cosmic star formation history (CSFH) and cosmic active galactic nuclei (AGN) luminosity history (CAGNH) are self consistently presented at $z = 5.5-13.5$. This is achieved by analyzing galaxies detected by the James Webb Space Telescope from $\approx 400 \, \mathrm{arcmin^{2}}$ fields from the PEARLS, CEERS, NGDEEP, JADES and PRIMER surveys. In particular, the combination of spectral energy distribution fitting codes, EAZY and ProSpect, are employed to estimate the photometric redshifts and astrophysical quantities of 3947 distant galaxies, from which we compute the stellar mass, star formation rate and AGN luminosity distribution functions in four redshift bins. Integrating the distribution functions, we find that the CAGNH tentatively rises by $\approx 2.2$ dex over $z = 5.5-13.5$ compared to $\approx 1.8$ dex for the CSFH, indicating that the growth of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) tends to outpace the assembly of stellar mass. We connect our results of the CSFH and CAGNH at $z=5.5-13.5$ to that from $z= 0-5$ to determine the summary of $\gtrsim 13$ Gyr of star formation and AGN activity, from the very onset of galaxy formation to the present day.</description>

      <title>The dwarf irregular galaxy NGC 6822. II. Young, intermediate and old stellar populations: comparison between theory and observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a quantitative analysis of the stellar content in the Local Group dwarf irregular galaxy NGC 6822 by comparing stellar evolution models and observations in color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) and color-color diagrams (CC-Ds). Our analysis is based on optical ground-based g,r,i photometry, and deep archive HST photometry of two fields in the galaxy disk. We compared young, intermediate-age, and old stellar populations with isochrones from the BaSTI-IAC library and found that NGC 6822 hosts a quite metal-rich ([Fe/H] = -0.7 to -0.4) young component with an age ranging from 20 to 100 Myr. The intermediate-age population experienced a modest chemical enrichment between 4 and 8 Gyr ago while stars older than 11 Gyr have a low metal abundance ([Fe/H] ~ -1.70). We also identified the AGB clump population with a luminosity peak at i ~ 23.35 mag. Our analysis of both the CMD and the optical-NIR-MIR CC-Ds of AGB oxygen- and carbon-rich stars, using the PARSEC+COLIBRI isochrones with and without circumstellar dust, reveal that this stellar component exhibits a spread in age from 1 to 2 Gyr and in metallicity between [Fe/H]=-1.30 and -1.70. The stellar models we used reproduce very well the two distinct color sequences defined by AGB O- and C-rich stars in the various optical-NIR-MIR CC-Ds, suggesting that they are reliable diagnostics to identify and characterise intermediate-age stellar populations. However, we also find that evolutionary prescriptions in the optical i-(r-i) CMDs predict, at fixed color, systematically lower luminosities than observed AGB stars.</description>

      <title>Uncovering Extraplanar Gas in UGCA 250 with the Ultra-deep MHONGOOSE Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) observations of the edge-on galaxy UGCA 250, taken as part of the MeerKAT HI Observations of Nearby Galactic Objects - Observing Southern Emitters (MHONGOOSE) survey to investigate the amount, morphology, and kinematics of extraplanar gas. The combination of high column density sensitivity and high spatial resolution of the survey over a large field of view is ideal for studying the underlying physics governing the extraplanar gas. These data reveal 9 additional detections within the field of view along with UGCA 250, with 8 of them being within $\sim$ 200 km s$^{-1}$ of the galaxy's systemic velocity. The galaxy seems to have a tail-like feature extending away from it in the southern direction up to $\sim$ 41 kpc (in projection). We also detect a cloud at anomalous velocities, but we did not find any optical counterpart. We construct a detailed tilted ring model for this edge-on galaxy to gain a deeper understanding of the vertical structure of its neutral hydrogen. The model that best matches the data features a thick disc with a scale height of $\sim$ 3$\pm$1 kpc and an HI mass of about 15$\%$ of the total HI mass. This extraplanar gas is detected for the first time in UGCA 250. Our analysis favours a mixed origin for the extraplanar gas in UGCA 250, likely arising from a combination of internal stellar feedback and external tidal interactions.</description>

      <title>The Dust Polarisation and Magnetic Field Structure in the Centre of NGC253 with ALMA</title>

Abstract: Magnetic fields have an impact on galaxy evolution at multiple scales. They are particularly important for starburst galaxies, where they play a crucial role in shaping the interstellar medium (ISM), influencing star formation processes and interacting with galactic outflows. The primary aim of this study is to obtain a parsec scale map of dust polarisation and B-field structure within the central starburst region of NGC253. This includes examining the relationship between the morphology of B-fields, galactic outflows and the spatial distribution of super star clusters (SSC), to understand their combined effects on the galaxy's star formation and ISM. We used ALMA full polarisation data in Bands 4 (145 GHz) and 7 (345 GHz) with resolution of 25 and 5 pc scale, respectively. According to our SED fitting analysis, the observed Band 4 emission is a combination of dust, synchrotron and free-free, while Band 7 traces only dust. The polarisation fraction (PF) of the synchrotron component is 2%, while that of the dust component is 0.3%. The B-fields orientation maps in both bands at common resolution show that the same B-fields structure is traced by dust and synchrotron emission at scales of 25 pc. The B-field morphology suggests a coupling with the multiphase outflow, while the distribution of PF in Band 7 showed to be correlated with the presence of SSC. We observed a significant anti-correlation between polarisation fraction and column density in both Bands 4 and 7. A negative correlation between PF and dispersion angle function was observed in Band 4 but was nearly absent in Band 7 at native resolution, suggesting that the tangling of B-field geometry along the plane of the sky is the main cause of depolarisation at 25 pc scales, while other factors play a role at 5 pc scales.</description>

      <title>Gas excitation in galaxies and active galactic nuclei with He II{\lambda}4686 and X-ray emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of He II emission in galaxies remains a debated topic, requiring ionizing photons with energies exceeding 54 eV. While massive stars, such as Wolf-Rayet stars, have been considered potential sources, their UV flux often fails to fully explain the observed He II emission. Recent studies suggest that X-ray binaries (XRBs) might contribute significantly to this ionization. We explore the relationship between X-ray and $\rm He~II \lambda4686$ emission in a statistically significant sample of galaxies, investigating whether X-ray sources, including active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and XRBs, serve as the primary mechanism for He II ionization across different galactic environments. We cross-matched a sample of known well-detected He II galaxies with the Chandra Source Catalog, yielding 165 galaxies with X-ray and $\rm He~II \lambda4686$ detections. The sources were classified into star-forming galaxies (SFGs) and AGNs based on the BPT diagram and a classification scheme defined for He II galaxies. We find a strong, linear correlation between X-ray and He II luminosity across AGNs and SFGs spanning over seven orders of magnitude. AGNs generally exhibit higher He II\H$\beta$ flux ratios, stronger extinction, and harder X-ray spectra. The O32 ratio of SFGs is tightly correlated with the H$\beta$ equivalent width ($\rm EW_{H\beta}$) but not with the He II/H$\beta$ ratio, suggesting a different excitation mechanism. We derive an O32--$\rm EW_{H\beta}$ line above which only AGNs of our sample reside. The tight correlation between X-ray and He II luminosity supports X-rays as the primary driver of He II excitation. While AGNs have one common ionization source, the central black hole, in SFGs low-energy species are mainly excited by UV emission related to star-forming activity, however, high-energy species like He II require the presence of XRBs.</description>

      <title>Exploring the physical properties of Type II Quasar candidates at intermediate redshifts with CIGALE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) significantly influence galaxy evolution. Specific sources such as obscured AGNs, especially Type II quasars (QSO2), still remain understudied. We characterise 366 QSO2 candidates in the redshift desert (median z~1.1) identified via machine learning from SDSS/WISE photometry, analysing their spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and deriving their physical properties. Using CIGALE, we estimated star formation rate (SFR), stellar mass (M), AGN luminosity, and AGN fraction. We compared these with SPRITZ simulations and the literature, placing results in the galaxy evolution context. Our QSO2 candidates show diverse evolutionary stages. The SFR-M diagram reveals high-SFR sources above the main sequence, linking AGN activity to enhanced star formation. Quenched galaxies may indicate obscured star formation or AGN feedback. Additionally, the physical properties align with SPRITZ composite systems and AGN2, endorsing our obscured AGN classification. This study validates machine learning for identifying AGN-host galaxies, beyond traditional colour-colour selections. Diverse candidate properties highlight this method's ability to identify complex AGN systems. This advances our understanding of AGN-driven galaxy evolution with new target selection.</description>

      <title>New routes for PN destruction and formation in the ISM via neutral-neutral gas-phase reactions and an extended database for reactions involving phosphorus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phosphorus plays an essential role in the chemistry of living organisms, being present in several fundamental biomolecules. The investigation of chemical reactions taking place in different astronomical environments involving phosphorus-containing molecules is essential for understanding how these species are produced and destroyed. Phosphorus monoxide (PO) and phosphorus nitride (PN) are key reservoirs of phosphorus in the Interstellar Medium (ISM). This work presents a computational study of the CPN system to identify viable reaction pathways involving atom-diatom collisions and to explore a potential destruction route for PN in the ISM. We explore the potential energy landscape of the C($\mathrm{^3P}$) + PN($^1\Sigma^+$), N($\mathrm{^4S}$) + CP($^2\Sigma^+$) and P($\mathrm{^4S}$) + CN($^2\Sigma^+$) reactions by performing high-accuracy ab initio calculations and provide their rate coefficients over a wide range of temperatures. The temperature-dependent rate coefficients were fitted to the modified Arrhenius equation: $k(T)=\alpha(T/300)^{\beta}\mathrm{exp}(-\gamma/T)$. An updated chemical network for P-bearing species was used to model the time-dependent abundances and reaction contributions of P, PO, PN, and PH during the chemical evolution of diffuse/translucent and dense clouds. The only neutral-neutral reaction capable of destroying PN without an activation energy seems to be the PN+C one. We have also shown that reactions between CP and N can yield CN and PN barrierless. Chemical models indicate that PO is a crucial species driving the gas-phase formation of PN. Typically, PO/PN ratios exceed 1, though their chemistry is influenced by photon- and cosmic-ray-induced processes. Over time in simulated dense clouds, neutral-neutral reactions such as PO + N, PH + N, P + OH, and PH + O play a significant role in determining the relative abundances of PO and PN.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Dynamics in Galaxy Clusters: The Hidden Role of Low-Luminosity Galaxies in Coma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the Coma cluster, one of the richest and most well-known systems at low redshifts, to explore the importance of low-flux objects in the identification of cluster substructures. In addition, we conduct a study of the infall flow around Coma, considering the presence or absence of low-flux objects across the projected phase space of the cluster. Our results indicate that low-luminosity galaxies play a fundamental role in understanding the dynamical state of galaxy clusters. These galaxies, often overlooked because of their faint nature, serve as sensitive tracers of substructure dynamics and provide crucial insights into the cluster's evolutionary history. We show that not considering the low-flux objects present in clusters can lead to significant underestimates of the numbers of substructures, both in most central parts, in the infall regions, and beyond, connecting to the large-scale structure up to a distance of approximately $8 R_{200}$ from the center of Coma.</description>

      <title>The $M_{*}-M_{\rm BH}$ Relation Evolution from z $\sim$ 6 to the Present Epoch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ratio between the stellar mass of a galaxy, $M_{*}$, and that of its central supermassive black hole (SMBH), $M_\bullet$, the ``Magorrian'' relationship, traces their coevolution. JWST observations have suggested significant evolution in $M_\bullet/M_{*}$ relative to local scaling relationships both in low-mass galaxies and in quasars at z $\ge$ 4. We test this possibility by (1) determining the preferred $M_\bullet/M_{*}$ scaling relation among those proposed locally; and (2) providing uniform host galaxy stellar mass estimates. These steps reduce the prominence of the reported evolution. We then apply Monte Carlo simulations to account for observational biases. We still find a significant increase over the local scaling relation in $M_\bullet/M_{*}$ for z $\ge$ 4 SMBHs in very low-mass galaxies ($\log(M_*/M_{\odot})&lt;10$). However, similarly high values of $M_\bullet/M_{*}$ are also found in low mass galaxies at $z \sim$ 0.5 to 3 that may be common at cosmic noon. Nonetheless, galaxies with similar behavior are rare locally and not accounted for in the local scaling relations. In contrast, z $\sim$ 6 quasars can have $M_\bullet/M_{*}$ well above the local relation value, but they can be explained as extreme cases still within the scaling relation for their higher mass host galaxies. Black holes in some of them and in the low-mass systems may be undergoing very high accretion episodes that result in high $M_\bullet/M_{*}$ but that will be followed by quiescent periods when growth of the host drives the systems toward more typical $M_\bullet/M_{*}$ values.</description>

      <title>Connecting the dots: Tracing the evolutionary pathway of Polar Ring Galaxies in the cases of NGC 3718, NGC 2685, and NGC 4262</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polar Ring Galaxies (PRGs) are a unique class of galaxies characterised by a ring of gas and stars orbiting nearly orthogonal to the main body. This study delves into the evolutionary trajectory of PRGs using the exemplary trio of NGC 3718, NGC 2685, and NGC 4262. We investigate the distinct features of PRGs by analysing their ring and host components to reveal their unique characteristics through Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) fitting. Using CIGALE, we performed SED fitting to independently analyse the ring and host spatially resolved regions, marking the first decomposed SED analysis for PRGs, which examines stellar populations using high-resolution observations from AstroSat UVIT at a resolved scale. The UV-optical surface profiles provide an initial idea that distinct patterns in the galaxies, with differences in FUV and NUV, suggest three distinct stages of ring evolution in the selected galaxies. The study of resolved-scale stellar regions reveals that the ring regions are generally younger than their host galaxies, with the age disparity progressively decreasing along the evolutionary sequence from NGC 3718 to NGC 4262. Star formation rates (SFR) also exhibit a consistent pattern, with higher SFR in the ring of NGC 3718 compared to the others, and a progressive decrease through NGC 2685 and NGC 4262. Finally, the representation of the galaxies in the HI gas fraction versus the NUV- r plane supports the idea that they are in three different evolutionary stages of PRG evolution, with NGC 3718 in the initial stage, NGC 2685 in the intermediate stage, and NGC 4262 representing the final stage. NGC 3718, NGC 2685, and NGC 4262 represent different stages of this evolution, highlighting the dynamic nature of PRGs and emphasising the importance of studying their evolutionary processes to gain insights into galactic formation and evolution.</description>

      <title>MaNGA AGN dwarf galaxies (MAD) -- III. The role of mergers and environment in AGN activity in dwarf galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Investigating whether and how galaxy mergers affect black hole growth can be determinant for black hole-galaxy evolution models and, in particular, for understanding how early Universe seed black holes grew to become supermassive. However, while mergers have been observed to enhance the active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity, and thus black hole growth in massive galaxies, it is yet not known how this relation and the role of the environment translates to dwarf galaxies (the most likely hosts of the early seed black holes), since there are scarce and mixed results in the literature. We want to assess the impact of galaxy mergers and the environment on AGN triggering in dwarf galaxies. We use a sample of 3280 dwarf galaxies with integral-field spectroscopic data from the MaNGA survey to study the AGN fraction throughout the merger process and how it is affected by the environment (characterized by galaxy isolation, being in a void, and group richness). We also compare the fraction of interacting galaxies in AGN and non-AGN dwarf galaxies. We find that dwarf galaxy mergers can ignite AGNs at separations below 20 kpc. The AGN fraction increases notoriously after the first pass and remains enhanced until the final stage. Despite this, mergers are not the dominant AGN triggering mechanism. We also find that the environment has a non-negligible impact on AGN activity in dwarf galaxies, as the AGN fraction increases when moving to lower density environments. These findings provide the most statistically robust constraints to date on the effects of dwarf galaxy mergers and environment on AGN activity and black hole growth.</description>

      <title>Evidence for a hot galactic halo around the Andromeda Galaxy using fast radio bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration radio transients that serve as unique probes of extragalactic matter. We report on the discovery and localization of two FRBs piercing the Andromeda Galaxy (M31) by the realfast fast transient detection system at the Very Large Array. Their unique sightlines allow constraints on M31's electron density distribution. We localized FRB 20230903A to its host galaxy at a redshift $z=0.09$ and FRB 20230506C to a host galaxy at a redshift $z=0.39$. After accounting for the dispersion contribution from the Milky Way, the host galaxy and the intergalactic medium along the line of sight of the FRBs, we estimate that M31 alone will likely contribute between 21-217 $\mathrm{pc~cm^{-3}}$ along FRB 20230903A and between 43-338 $\mathrm{pc~cm^{-3}}$ along FRB 20230506C with a 90% confidence. We also modeled the M31 disk's contribution to the DM to determine the halo contribution. We find that the halo of M31 will contribute between 9-145 $\mathrm{pc~cm^{-3}}$ along FRB 20230903A and between 28-286 $\mathrm{pc~cm^{-3}}$ along FRB 20230506C with 90% confidence. The measured values of $\rm DM_{M31,halo}$ are consistent with the predictions from the modified Navarro-Frenk-White profile of M31's halo for a given impact parameter. The ions of the cool halo alone cannot account for the calculated $\rm DM_{M31,halo}$ and therefore this measurement presents indirect evidence of the hot halo of M31. We also suggest a possible intersection of the line of sight of FRB 20230506C with a hot baryon bridge between M31 and the Milky Way</description>

      <title>Gaia Net: Towards robust spectroscopic parameters of stars of all evolutionary stages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new processing of XP spectra for 220 million stars released in Gaia DR3. The new data model is capable of handling objects with Teff between 2000 and 50,000 K, and with log g between 0 and 10, including objects of multitude of masses and evolutionary stages. This includes for the first time ever robust processing of spectroscopic parameters for pre-main sequence stars, with log g sensitivity towards their age. Through this analysis we examine the distribution of young low mass stars with ages of up to 20 Myr in the solar neighborhood, and we identify a new massive (&gt;1000 stars) population, Ophion, which is found east of Sco Cen. This population appears to be fully disrupted, with negligible kinematic coherence. Nonetheless, due its young age it appears to still persist as a spacial overdensity. Through improved determination of ages of the nearby stars, it may be possible to better recover star forming history of the solar neighborhood outside of the moving groups.</description>

      <title>Discovery of Radio Recombination Lines from Proplyds in the Orion Nebula Cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present new Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations that, for the first time, detect hydrogen and helium radio recombination lines from a protoplanetary disk. We imaged the Orion Nebula Cluster at 3.1 mm with a spectral setup that covered the $n=42 \rightarrow 41$ transitions of hydrogen (H41$\alpha$) and helium (He41$\alpha$). The unprecedented sensitivity of these observations enables us to search for radio recombination lines toward the positions of ${\sim}200$ protoplanetary disks. We detect H41$\alpha$ from 17 disks, all of which are HST-identified `proplyds.' The detected H41$\alpha$ emission is spatially coincident with the locations of proplyd ionization fronts, indicating that proplyd H41$\alpha$ emission is produced by gas that has been photoevaporated off the disk and ionized by UV radiation from massive stars. We measure the fluxes and widths of the detected H41$\alpha$ lines and find line fluxes of ${\sim}30-800$ mJy km s$^{-1}$ and line widths of ${\sim}30-90$ km s$^{-1}$. The derived line widths indicate that the broadening of proplyd H41$\alpha$ emission is dominated by outflowing gas motions associated with external photoevaporation. The derived line fluxes, when compared with measurements of 3.1 mm free-free flux, imply that the ionization fronts of H41$\alpha$-detected proplyds have electron temperatures of ${\sim}6,000-11,000$ K and electron densities of ${\sim}10^6-10^7$ cm$^{-3}$. Finally, we detect He41$\alpha$ towards one H41$\alpha$-detected source and find evidence that this system is helium-rich. Our study demonstrates that radio recombination lines are readily detectable in ionized photoevaporating disks, providing a new way to measure disk properties in clustered star-forming regions.</description>

Abstract: While molecular outflows have been studied in details with radio interferometry, observations of the hotter gas in protostellar outflows at a comparable physical scale is often challenging. Combined with ALMA, JWST allows us to investigate the cold and hot gas with unprecedented spatial resolution and sensitivity. We present a detailed comparison between the gas distributions probed with ALMA and JWST in the primary outflow of IRAS 15398$-$3359. At 2000 au scale, the southwestern outflow shows four shell structures in 5--10 micron continuum, whereas the submillimeter H$_2$CO emission traces two of the four shells closest to the protostar. Submillimeter emission from CS, CCH, c-C$_3$H$_2$, and CH$_3$OH shows the same two shells, and the $^{12}$CO emission covers most of the outflow region. SO and SiO only trace a condensation at the edge of the shell closest to the protostar. None of these lines observed with ALMA show the outermost shell. At 500 au scale, we find hot H$_2$ gas inside the outflow cavity with JWST. The derived temperature of H$_2$ is 1147$\pm$198 K within a 0\farcs5 aperture at the protostar. The foreground mass column density of dust is (1.4--2.0)$\times$10$^{-3}$ g$\cdot$cm$^{-2}$ (A$_{\rm v}$ = 47--66 mag) in the outflow, using the dust model from Weingartner &amp; Draine (2001). We also find an 8$^{\circ}$ difference between the directions toward the [Fe II] knot and the outermost shell in the MIRI image, which may be interpreted as the precession of the [Fe II] jet. The dynamical timescale of the [Fe II] knot is 10 yrs, suggesting a current event.</description>

      <title>StarFlow: Leveraging Normalizing Flows for Stellar Age Estimation in SDSS-V DR19</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the ages of stars is crucial for unraveling the formation history and evolution of our Galaxy. Traditional methods for estimating stellar ages from spectroscopic data often struggle with providing appropriate uncertainty estimations and are severely constrained by the parameter space. In this work, we introduce a new approach using normalizing flows, a type of deep generative model, to estimate stellar ages for evolved stars with improved accuracy and robust uncertainty characterization. The model is trained on stellar masses for evolved stars derived from asteroseismology and predicts the relationship between the carbon and nitrogen abundances of a given star and its age. Unlike standard neural network techniques, normalizing flows enable the recovery of full likelihood distributions for individual stellar ages, offering a richer and more informative perspective on uncertainties. Our method yields age estimations for 378,720 evolved stars and achieves a typical absolute age uncertainty of approximately 2 Gyr. By intrinsically accounting for the coverage and density of the training data, our model ensures that the resulting uncertainties reflect both the inherent noise in the data and the completeness of the sampled parameter space. Applying this method to data from the SDSS-V Milky Way Mapper, we have produced the largest stellar age catalog for evolved stars to date.</description>

      <title>The relation between black hole spin, star formation rate, and black hole mass for supermassive black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Both theoretical models and observational evidence indicate that jets and/or outflows driven by central active supermassive black holes exert a significant feedback effect on the overall properties of their host galaxies. Theoretical models suggest that the spin of supermassive black holes drives relativistic jets. Therefore, we investigate the relationship between black hole spin, star formation rate, and black hole mass using a sample of 48 low-redshift supermassive black holes. By performing multiband fitting of spectral energy distribution, we derive the star formation rates and stellar masses of the host galaxies harbouring these supermassive black holes. Our main results are as follows: (i) For black holes with masses \(M_{\rm BH} \lesssim 10^{6.5} M_{\odot}\), the spin increases with increasing black hole mass, suggesting that black hole growth is primarily driven by gas accretion, particularly in the coherent gas accretion regime. Conversely, for black holes with masses \(M_{\rm BH} \gtrsim 10^{7.5} M_{\odot}\), the spin decreases with increasing black hole mass, indicating that growth occurs mainly through mergers, inducing chaotic accretion. (ii) At low star formation rates, black hole spin increases with increasing star formation rates, consistent with gas accretion. However, at high star formation rates, black hole spin decreases with increasing star formation rates, suggesting black hole mergers. The value of the black hole spin may be used to diagnose the star formation rate of the host galaxies through active galactic nuclei activities. (iii) Our data and analysis confirm the well-known relation between stellar mass and black hole mass, with the fitting function $\log M_{\rm BH}=0.57\log M_{*}+1.94$.</description>

      <title>Photometric-Metallicity and Distance Estimates for $\sim$70,000 RR Lyrae Stars from the Zwicky Transient Facility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Utilizing Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) data and existing RR Lyrae stars (RRLs) catalogs, this study achieves the first calibration of the $P - \phi_{31} - R_{21} - \text{[Fe/H]}$ and $P-\phi_{31}-A_{2}-A_{1}-\text{[Fe/H]}$ relations in the ZTF photometric system for RRab and RRc stars. We also re-calibrate the period-absolute magnitude-metallicity (PMZ) and period-Wesenheit-metallicity (PWZ) relations in the ZTF $gri$-bands for RRab and RRc stars. Based on nearly 4100 stars with precise measurements of $P$, $\phi_{31}$, $A_{2}$, and $A_{1}$, and available spectroscopic-metallicity estimates, the photometric-metallicity relations exhibit strong internal consistency across different bands, supporting the use of a weighted averaging method for the final estimates. The photometric-metallicity estimates of globular clusters based on RR Lyrae members also show excellent agreement with high-resolution spectroscopic measurements, with typical scatter of 0.15 dex for RRab stars and 0.14 dex for RRc stars, respectively. Using hundreds of local RRLs with newly derived photometric metallicities and precise Gaia Data Release 3 parallaxes, we establish the PMZ and PWZ relations in multiple bands. Validation with globular cluster RR Lyrae members reveals typical distance errors of 3.1% and 3.0% for the PMZ relations, and 3.1% and 2.6% for the PWZ relations for RRab and RRc stars, respectively. Compared to PMZ relations, the PWZ relations are tighter and almost unbiased, making them the recommended choice for distance calculations. We present a catalog of 73,795 RRLs with precise photometric metallicities; over 95% of them have accurate distance measurements. Compared to Gaia DR3, approximately 25,000 RRLs have precise photometric metallicities and distances derived for the first time.</description>

      <title>Chemical abundance inventory in phosphorus-rich stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide an overview of the latest advances in the study of phosphorus-rich stars, covering their detailed chemical abundance analyses and innovative mining approaches. Following the discovery of 16 low-mass and low-metallicity stars rich in P, we expanded this sample by demonstrating that a recently identified group of Si-rich giants is also P-rich. A detailed abundance analysis was conducted on the nearinfrared spectra from APOGEE-2 DR17, encompassing 13 elements. Subsequently, a similar analysis was performed on the optical UVES spectra of four P-rich stars, resulting in the abundance determination of 48 light and heavy elements. This comprehensive analysis further refined the chemical fingerprint of these peculiar stars, which was employed to evaluate the plausibility of various nucleosynthetic formation scenarios. In order to obtain a statistically more reliable chemical fingerprint in the future, we explored the use of unsupervised machine learning algorithms to identify additional P-rich stars in extensive spectroscopic surveys, such as APOGEE-2. The primary objective of this research is to identify the progenitor of these stars and determine whether current nucleosynthetic models require revision or if a completely new source of P in the Galaxy is responsible for the existence of the P-rich stars.</description>

      <title>First Light And Reionisation Epoch Simulations (FLARES) XVI: Size Evolution of Massive Dusty Galaxies at Cosmic Dawn from UV to IR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11037v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the First Light And Reionisation Epoch Simulations (FLARES) to study the evolution of the rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) and far-infrared (FIR) sizes for a statistical sample of massive ($\gtrsim10^{9}$M$_{\odot}$) high redshift galaxies (z $\in$ [5,10]). Galaxies are post-processed using the SKIRT radiative transfer code, to self-consistently obtain the full spectral energy distribution and surface brightness distribution. We create mock observations of the galaxies for the Near Infrared Camera (NIRCam) to study the rest-frame UV 1500 $\unicode{xC5}$ morphology. We also generate mock rest-frame FIR (50 $\mu$m) photometry and mock ALMA (158 $\mu$m) (0.01"-0.03" and $\approx$0.3" angular resolution) observations to study the dust-continuum. We find the effect of dust on observed sizes reduces with increasing wavelength from the UV to optical ($\sim$0.6 times the UV at 0.4$\mu$m), with no evolution in FIR sizes. Observed sizes vary within 0.4-1.2 times the intrinsic sizes at different signal to noise ratios (SNR = 5-20) across redshifts. The effect of PSF and noise makes bright structures prominent, whereas fainter regions blend with noise, leading to an underestimation (factor of 0.4-0.8) of sizes at SNR=5. At SNR=15-20, the underestimation reduces (factor of 0.6-0.9) at z=5-8 but due to PSF, at z=9-10, bright cores are dominant, resulting in an overestimation (factor of 1.0-1.2). For ALMA, low resolution sizes are effected by noise which acts as extended emission. The size evolution in UV broadly agrees with current observational samples and other simulations. This work is one of the first to analyse the panchromatic sizes of a statistically significant sample of simulated high-redshift galaxies, complementing a growing body of research highlighting the importance of conducting an equivalent comparison between observed galaxies and their simulated counterparts in the early Universe.</description>

      <title>The distant Milky Way halo from the Southern hemisphere: Characterization of the LMC-induced dynamical-friction wake</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00114v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The infall of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) into the Milky Way's halo impacts the distribution of stars and dark matter in our Galaxy. Mapping the observational consequences of this encounter can inform us about the properties of both galaxies, details of their interaction, and possibly distinguish between different dark matter models. N-body simulations predict a localized overdensity trailing the LMC's orbit both in baryonic and dark matter, known as the wake. We collected wide-field, deep near-infrared, and optical photometry using VIRCAM and DECam across four fields along the expected wake, covering the sky region expected to span most of its predicted density contrast. We identify over 400 stars comprising two different tracers - near main sequence turn-off stars and red giants - that map the halo between 60-100 kpc, deriving stellar halo densities as a function of sky position and Galactocentric radius. We detect (1) a break in the halo radial density profile at 70 kpc not seen in Northern halo studies, and (2) a clear halo overdensity starting also at 70 kpc, with density contrast increasing steadily toward the expected current location of the wake. If this overdensity is the LMC wake, its peak density contrast is as pronounced as the most massive LMC model considered. Contamination from unidentified substructures may bias our wake detections, so wider-area surveys with similar depth are needed for confirmation.</description>

      <title>The S2 orbit and tidally disrupted binaries: indications for collisional depletion in the Galactic center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07491v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The properties of the stellar cluster surrounding Sagittarius A* can be assessed indirectly through the motion of the S-stars. Specifically, the current accuracy to which the prograde precession of the S2 star is measured allows to place significant constraints on the extended mass enclosed by its orbit. We suggest that high velocity destructive collisions (DCs) offer a natural mechanism for depleting the mass inside the S2 orbit, thus allowing to reconcile the measured precession and the existence of a dense stellar cluster. Such a solution is especially necessary when considering that stars are supplied to the inner part of the cluster by both dynamical relaxation and by stars being captured in tight orbits during tidal disruption of binaries. We use analytic arguments and results from simulations to demonstrate that in order to obtain a precession that is consistent with observations, collisional depletion is necessary if the capture rate is greater than a few $10^{-6} yr^{-1}$. We also show that fluctuations arising from the finite number of stars cannot serve as an alternative to DCs for generating consistency with the observed S2 precession. We conclude that astrometric observations of the S-stars provide a meaningful indication that the inner part of our galactic center is shaped by collisional depletion, supporting the hypothesis that DCs occur in galactic nuclei at an astrophysically significant rate.</description>

      <title>Effects of galactic environment on size and dark matter content in low-mass galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04084v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We utilize the cosmological volume simulation, FIREbox, to investigate how a galaxy's environment influences its size and dark matter content. Our study focuses on approximately 1,200 galaxies (886 central and 332 satellite halos) in the low-mass regime, with stellar masses between $10^6$ to $10^9$ $M_{\odot}$. We analyze the size-mass relation ($r_{50} - M_{\star}$), inner dark matter mass-stellar mass ($M^{50}_{\rm DM} - M_{\star}$) relation, and the halo mass-stellar mass ($M_{\rm halo} - M_{\star}$) relation. At fixed stellar mass, we find the galaxies experiencing stronger tidal influences, indicated by higher Perturbation Indices (PI $&gt;$ 1) are generally larger and have lower masses relative to their counterparts with lower Perturbation Indices (PI $&lt;$ 1). Applying a Random Forest regression model, we show that both the environment (PI) and halo mass ($M_{rm halo}$) are significant predictors of a galaxy's relative size and dark matter content. Notably, because $M_{\rm halo}$ is also strongly affected by the environment, our findings indicate that environmental conditions not only influence galactic sizes and relative inner dark matter content directly, but also indirectly through their impact on halo mass. Our results highlight a critical interplay between environmental factors and halo mass in shaping galaxy properties, affirming the environment as a fundamental driver in galaxy formation and evolution.</description>

      <title>Strong nebular HeII emission induced by He$^+$ ionizing photons escaping through the clumpy winds of massive stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08376v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The origin of nebular HeII-emission in both local and high-redshift galaxies remains an unsolved problem. Various theories have been proposed to explain it, including HeII-ionization by high mass X-ray binaries, ultra-luminous X-ray sources, or "stripped" He stars, shock ionization, and hidden AGNs. All these theories have shortcomings, however, leaving the cause of nebular HeII emission unclear. We investigate the hypothesis that the photons responsible for driving nebular HeII emissions are produced by the evolution of single massive stars and/or WR stars. We combine models of stellar evolution with population synthesis and nebular models to identify the most favorable scenarios for producing nebular HeII via this channel. We find that, if WR winds are clumpy enough to become close to optically thin, stellar populations with a wide range of metallicities and rotation rates can produce HeII ionizing photons at rates sufficient to explain the observed nebular $I(HeII)/I(\mathrm{H}\beta)$ ratio $\sim 0.004-0.07$ found in HeII-emitting galaxies. Metal-poor, rapidly rotating stellar populations ($[\mathrm{Fe}/\mathrm{H}]=-2.0$, $v/v_\mathrm{crit}=0.4$) also reach these levels of HeII production even for partially clumpy winds. These scenarios also yield HeII, H$\beta$, and "Blue-Bump" line equivalent widths comparable to those observed in HeII emitters. Only for laminar, non-clumpy winds, do we fail to find combinations of metallicity and stellar rotation rate that yield $I(HeII)/I(\mathrm{H}\beta)$ values as high as those observed in HeII-emitters. Contrary to previous findings, we conclude that single WR stars can be a strong source for nebular HeII emission if their winds are sufficiently clumpy allowing significant escape of hard ionizing photons.</description>

      <title>Ly-$\alpha$ processing of solid-state Ethanolamine: Potential Precursors to Sugar and Peptide Derivatives</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07970v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ethanolamine (EA), a key component of phospholipids, has recently been detected in the interstellar medium within molecular clouds. To understand this observation, laboratory studies of its formation and destruction are essential and should be complemented by astrochemical models. This study investigates the photostability of EA ice under Lyman (Ly)-$\alpha$ (10.2 eV) irradiation at 10 K, and explores its potential role in the formation of simple and complex organic molecules in molecular clouds. The UV destruction cross section of EA was estimated to be ($4.7\pm0.3)\times10^{-18}$ cm$^2$, providing insight into its half-life of $6.5\times10^{7}$ yr in dense interstellar clouds. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and quadrupole mass spectrometry were used to identify various photoproducts, with their formation pathways discussed. Ethylene glycol and serine were tentatively detected during the warming up process following irradiation, suggesting that EA could contribute to the formation of prebiotic molecules such as sugars, peptides and their derivatives. High mass signals detected in the mass spectrometer suggest the presence of several complex organic molecules, and further analysis of residues at room temperature is planned for future work. The results suggest that EA could contribute to the formation of prebiotic molecules in space, with implications for the origin of life.</description>

      <title>A Spectroastrometric Study of the Low-velocity Wind from DG Tau A</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02433v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We obtained high spectral resolution spectra ($\Delta v$ $\sim$ 2.5 km s$^{-1}$) for DG Tau A from 4800 \r{A} to 7500 \r{A} using Subaru High Dispersion Spectrograph (HDS) for the first time. The low-velocity components (LVCs, |$v$| &lt; 100 km s$^{-1}$) were observed in the [O I] 5577, 6300, 6364 \r{A}, [S II] 6716, 6731 \r{A} lines. The offset position spectra observed in the LVCs show a "negative velocity gradient", supporting the presence of a wide-angled wind associated with the LVC emission. The offset position spectra observed in a component within the LVC velocity range between -16 km s$^{-1}$ to -41 km s$^{-1}$, namely, LVC-M, show a "negative velocity gradient'', supporting the presence of a wide-angled wind. With 12-70 au wind lengths measured using spectroastrometry, we estimate a lower limit to the wind mass-loss rate of $\sim$10$^{-8}$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. In addition to the LVCs, we identify two high-velocity components (HVCs, |$v$| &gt; 100 km s$^{-1}$) associated with the collimated jet in 26 lines ([N I], [N II], [O I], [O II], [O III], [S II], [Ca II], [Fe II], H$\alpha$, H$\beta$, He I). The one with a clear spatial offset from the star ($n_e$ $\sim$10$^4$ cm$^{-3}$, HVC1) is associated with an internal shock surface of the jet, while the other at the base ($n_e$ $\sim$10$^6$ cm$^{-3}$, HVC2) may be a stationary shock component. We find that the observed line profiles and the spatial scales of the LVC emission do not agree with the existing predictions for photoevaporative or magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) disk winds. These could be explained by the X-wind model, but synthetic observations are required for detailed comparisons.</description>
