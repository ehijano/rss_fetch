      <title>Multi-Galileons in Curved Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the probe brane construction of higher derivative effective field theories, extended to higher co-dimensions and curved spaces, we construct galileon and DBI theories on de Sitter space with N fields and an so(N) internal symmetry, non-linearly realizing the symmetries of a higher dimensional de Sitter space. In some cases, the theory admits a non-trivial vacuum that spontaneously breaks the so(N) symmetry, and around this vacuum the Goldstone modes have vanishing kinetic terms and become infinitely strongly coupled. This gives an example of a scalar effective field theory with two de Sitter vacua, one of which appears to have Boulware-Deser-like ghosts, and one of which does not.</description>

      <title>Simplified self-dual electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new formulation of self-dual nonlinear electrodynamics in which interactions are determined by an auxiliary-field potential, with causality ensuring a unique solution to the auxiliary-field equation. For `symmetric' potentials the weak-field expansion is `analytic' and the Lagrangian can be linearised in quadratic field-strength scalars by the introduction of an additional pseudoscalar auxiliary field.</description>

      <title>On the three-point functions in timelike N=1 Liouville CFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use analytic (super-)conformal bootstrap methods to derive explicit expressions for the structure constants of $\mathcal{N}=1$ Liouville CFT in the `timelike' regime of the superconformal central charge. The obtained expressions take the form of inverses of the appropriate spacelike counterparts, which we explain concretely by elucidating the analytic properties of the corresponding shift relations in the NS- and R-sectors for the normalization-independent bootstrap data on the sphere. In a particular normalization, the timelike structure constants are shown to agree with the OPE coefficients of $\mathcal{N}=1$ Minimal Models when specified at degenerate values of the momenta, exactly as in the non-supersymmetric case. We discuss possible applications of our results, with emphasis on the construction of the $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetric analog of the Virasoro Minimal String.</description>

      <title>Towards the super Virasoro minimal string</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The (bosonic) Virasoro minimal string, which relates worldsheet string theory to a deformation of the JT gravity matrix model, provides an interesting example of a tractable matrix/string duality. We explore its $\mathcal{N} =1$ supersymmetric generalization, the super Virasoro minimal string, which we expect to be dual to a deformation of the $\mathcal{N} =1$ JT supergravity matrix model. The worldsheet theory is characterized by two copies of super Liouville theory, one with central charge $c &gt; \frac{27}{2}$ (the spacelike regime) and another with $c &lt; \frac{3}{2}$ (the timelike regime), coupled to worldsheet supergravity and subject to diagonal (Type 0A/B) GSO projection. As a first step, we define the timelike theory, which has hitherto not been bootstrapped, by obtaining its spectrum and structure constants. Furthermore, we also outline the matrix model's predictions for the worldsheet observables. Curiously, all perturbative amplitudes are predicted to vanish in the 0B theory, while all tree-level amplitudes vanish in the 0A case. Using the worldsheet description, we explicitly verify this prediction (modulo an assumption) only for the simplest of the worldsheet observables, the sphere three-point function. A detailed study of other observables and verification of the duality is deferred for the future.</description>

      <title>Entangled universes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a generalization of the RT and HRT holographic entanglement entropy formulas to spacetimes with asymptotically Minkowski as well as asymptotically AdS regions. We postulate that such spacetimes represent entangled states in a tensor product of Hilbert spaces, each corresponding to one asymptotic region. We show that our conjectured formula has the same general properties and passes the same general tests as the standard HRT formula. We provide further evidence for it by showing that in many cases the Minkowski asymptotic regions can be replaced by AdS ones using a domain wall. We illustrate the use of our formula by calculating entanglement entropies between asymptotic regions in Brill-Lindquist spacetimes, finding phase transitions similar to those known to occur in AdS. We construct networks of universes by gluing together Brill-Lindquist spaces along minimal surfaces. Finally, we discuss a variety of possible extensions and generalizations, including to universes with asymptotically de Sitter regions; in the latter case, we identify an ambiguity in the homology condition, leading to two different versions of the HRT formula which we call ``orthodox'' and ``heterodox'', with different physical interpretations.</description>

      <title>Aspects of massive gauge fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive gauge fields whose mass is introduced by hand form very intriguing theories. They depart from their massless counterparts by a straightforward modification. Yet, taking the limit when the same vanishes poses a non-trivial challenge. In these notes, with a focus on vector and two-form fields, we will discuss several aspects that arise when one explores the massless limit. We will study new connections among different theories, and at times raise a question about the already established ones.</description>

      <title>Extreme Compactness, Extreme Gravity: Higher-Derivative Corrections to ECOs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Higher-derivative gravity theories offer insights into the behavior of extremely compact objects (ECOs). Focusing on Gauss-Bonnet (GB) and Einstein-dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet (EdGB) gravity, we derive the compactness scale in these models and demonstrate how higher-curvature corrections lead to deviations from the standard ECO compactness scale. The corrections are of order $\alpha/r_0^2$ in EGB gravity and $\alpha^2/r_0^4$ in EdGB gravity, where $\alpha$ is the coupling constant and $r_0$ is the horizon radius corresponding to the mass of the ECO. Observational constraints suggest these effects could be significant in certain astrophysical systems, providing a new perspective on the nature of extremely compact objects in models of modified gravity.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium scalar fields at finite temperature and density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study propagators in bosonic field theories at finite temperature and chemical potential using the Schwinger-Keldysh real-time formalism. The system is considered in contact with a thermal reservoir, allowing for a consistent treatment of both equilibrium and non-equilibrium situations. The chemical potential, associated with conserved charges, modifies the structure of the propagators and introduces features that require detailed analysis.
  We focus on how a finite chemical potential affects the analytic structure of the bosonic propagators, including changes in the position of poles and the structure of branch cuts. In our setup, the chemical potential enters the theory as a constant background field, which alters both the dynamics and the boundary conditions. This work provides a basis for understanding the behavior of bosonic fields in thermal and dense environments.</description>

      <title>Manifestly Covariant Canonical Formalism of Quadratic Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the manifestly covariant quantization of quadratic gravity or higher-derivative gravity in the de Donder gauge condition (or harmonic gauge condition) for general coordinate invariance on the basis of the BRST transformation. We explicitly calculate various equal-time commutation relations (ETCRs), in particlular, the ETCRs between the metric tensor and its time derivatives in detail, and show that they are identically vanishing. We also clarify global symmetries, the physical content of quadratic gravity, and clearly show that this theory is not unitary and has a massive scalar, massive ghost and massless graviton as physical modes. Finally, we comment on confinement of the massive ghost, thereby recovering the unitarity of the physical S-matrix in quadratic gravity.</description>

      <title>Island rules for the noncommutative black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of noncommutative black holes, we reconsider the island rule and reproduce the Page curve. Since the radiation entropy of the noncommutative black hole will eventually diverge in the absence of islands, it is crucial to include the contribution of islands in the radiation process to recover the Page curve. When cutoff surface is far from event horizon, we find that the existence of islands helps to improve the radiation entropy and avoid its divergence at the late stage, while the radiation entropy for the commutative black hole with islands is still divergent in this case. When cutoff surface is close to event horizon, the existence of islands can lead to the radiation process consistent with the Page curves for both the commutative and noncommutative black holes, but it is interesting to obtain a significantly delay Page time for the noncommutative case, allowing us to avoid considering the contribution of islands for a sufficiently long period of time.</description>

      <title>A localising AdS$_3$ sigma model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a CFT with $\mathfrak{sl}(2,\mathbb{R})_k$ symmetry at the `tensionless' point $k=3$, which is distinct from the usual $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})_{k=3}$ WZW model. This new CFT is much simpler than the generic WZW model: in particular its three-point functions feature momentum-conserving delta functions, and its higher-point functions localise to covering map configurations in moduli space. We establish the consistency of the theory by explicitly deriving the four-point function from the three-point data via a sum over conformal blocks. The main motivation for our construction comes from holography, and we show that various simple supersymmetric holographic dualities for $k_{\rm s}=1$ ($k=3$) can be constructed by replacing the $\mathrm{AdS}_3$ factor on the worldsheet with this alternative theory. This includes in particular the prototypical case of $\mathrm{AdS}_3 \times \mathrm{S}^3 \times \mathbb{T}^4$, as well as the recently discussed example of $\mathrm{AdS}_3 \times \mathrm{S}^3 \times \mathrm{S}^3 \times \mathrm{S}^1$. However, our analysis does not require supersymmetry and also applies to bosonic ${\rm AdS}_3$ backgrounds (at $k=3$).</description>

      <title>The exact WKB for dynamical and geometric exponents in generalized and non-linear Landau-Zener transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The geometric phases and exponents introduced by Berry have been discussed in wide areas, while the exact WKB is a mathematical method that treats perturbative expansion with respect to the Planck constant as a singular perturbation. This method, initiated by Voros, is a powerful computational tool that can replace conventional approximations with exact results and makes the analytical computation much easier for mathematical software. Using the exact WKB, we analyze the derivation of the dynamical and the geometric exponents in generalized Landau-Zener models, highlighting the differences from the other calculational methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a probabilistic construction of imaginary Liouville Field Theory based on a real (non-compactified) Gaussian Free Field. We argue that our theory is the first explicit Lagrangian field theory that reproduces the imaginary DOZZ structure constants without requiring a neutrality constraint. Our proposal is supported by exact results for the imaginary Gaussian Multiplicative Chaos on the circle, and by numerical simulations on the sphere. In particular, we show that the three-point functions of the theory agree remarkably well with the imaginary DOZZ structure constants.</description>

      <title>Chiral higher-spin theories from twistor space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reformulate chiral higher-spin Yang-Mills and gravity on $\mathbb{R}^4$ as 'CR-holomorphic' theories of Chern-Simons type; in the most general case, these are Moyal deformed to become non-commutative. They are defined on the space of non-projective twistors of unit length. These spaces carry $S^7$, $S^3\times \mathbb{R}^4$ or AdS$_{3+4}$ metrics but are also endowed with a Cauchy-Riemann structure, an odd-dimensional analogue of a complex structure, with respect to which the theories are holomorphic. They are circle bundles over standard projective twistor spaces and the higher spin fields arise naturally as Kaluza-Klein modes. We give a perturbative analysis to identify the spectrum and three-point vertices on spacetime and, for flat space, in momentum space. These vertices can have helicities $(+++)$, $(++-)$ or $(+--)$, but are nevertheless all of $\overline{\text{MHV}}$ type in the sense that they are supported on momenta with proportional anti-self-dual spinors. On reduction to spacetime, there are higher valence vertices but these appear to be a gauge artifact. Further generalizations are discussed.</description>

      <title>Shadow Celestial Operator Product Expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The linearized massless wave equation in four-dimensional asymptotically flat spacetimes is known to admit two families of solutions that transform in highest-weight representations of the Lorentz group ${\rm SL}(2, \mathbb{C})$. The two families are related to each other by a two-dimensional shadow transformation. The scattering states of one family are constructed from standard momentum eigenstates by a Mellin transformation with respect to energy. Their operator product expansion (OPE) is directly related to collinear limits of momentum space amplitudes. The scattering states of the other family are a priori non-local on the celestial sphere and lack a standard notion of OPE. Such states appear naturally in the context of asymptotic symmetries, but their properties as operators remain largely unexplored. Here we initiate a study, to be continued in a forthcoming companion paper, of a definition of an OPE for shadow operators. We present a useful technical ingredient: the transformation of the OPE coefficients associated to collinear limits under a shadow. Our results can be used to find the coefficients of all three-point functions involving any combination of celestial and shadow primaries. An OPE block is used to account for the contribution from a primary together with its global conformal descendants, all of which contribute when deriving the shadowed OPE coefficients. Applications involving $U(1)$ currents and stress tensors as well as a chiral current algebra of soft gluons are discussed.</description>

      <title>Virasoro Blocks and Trouble at the Euclidean Horizon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the semi-classical ($c \rightarrow \infty$) limit, 4-point HLLH correlators in 2D CFTs exhibit periodic Euclidean singularities. Periodic singularities in Euclidean time are a general feature of thermal correlators, even at weak coupling. Therefore, the bulk significance of this observation (in particular, the role of the horizon) is somewhat obscure. Explicit numerical computations of finite-$c$ Virasoro blocks furthermore suggest that their departure from semi-classical blocks may begin already at half the period. In this paper, we provide a bulk understanding of these facts and clarify the role of the horizon. We present a bulk geodesic Witten diagram calculation of semi-classical Virasoro blocks in coordinates that are naturally adapted to the BTZ black hole. This allows a bulk geometric interpretation for boundary time separation. In this language, half of a thermal time period is the boundary timescale at which the light operator geodesic straddles the Euclidean horizon, capturing both the role of the horizon and the associated timescale. This timescale arises in a calculation that does not involve a periodic thermal circle on the bulk or the boundary.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermodynamical features depending on magnetic field of the previously found five-dimensional anisotropic holographic solution for heavy quarks supported by Einstein-dilaton-three-Maxwell action with extended warp factor and improved coupling function for the Maxwell field providing chemical potential are studied. Direct/inverse magnetic catalysis behavior is considered. Phase diagram, composed of the 1-st order phase transition and temporal Wilson loops, corresponding to the stable direct magnetic catalysis scenario is presented. String tension behavior in magnetic field is discussed.</description>

      <title>On the structure of compact strong HKT manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the geometry of compact strong HKT and, more generally, compact BHE manifolds. We prove that any compact BHE manifold with full holonomy must be K\"ahler and we establish a similar result for strong HKT manifolds. Additionally, we demonstrate a rigidity theorem for strong HKT structures on solvmanifolds and we completely classify those with parallel Bismut torsion. Finally, we introduce the Ricci foliation for hypercomplex manifolds and analyze its properties for compact, simply connected, 8-dimensional strong HKT manifolds, proving that they are always Hopf fibrations over a compact $4$-dimensional orbifold.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I share fond memories of my former PhD advisor Alexei Starobinsky with whom I was closely associated for nearly 45 years. I reflect upon my early years in Moscow when I worked with him on my thesis, and touch upon the seminal work on inflation which he did during that period. Alexei visited India often and actively interacted with Indian scientists and students on issues relating to inflation, large scale structure and dark energy. This extensive collaboration, which lasted several decades, resulted in the publication of over a dozen important papers, several PhD's, and the development of the Statefinder and Om diagnostics, which I briefly discuss.</description>

      <title>On the universality of late-time ringdown tail</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The late time response of vacuum black holes in General Relativity is notoriously governed by power law tails arising from the wave scattering off the curved spacetime geometry far from the black hole. While it is known that such tails are universal to a certain extent, a precise characterization of their key ingredients is missing. Here we provide an analytical proof that the tail fall-off is universal for any effective potential asymptotically decaying as $1/r^2$, while the power law decay is different if the potential decays as $1/r^\alpha$ with $1&lt;\alpha&lt;2$. This result extends and revises some previous work and is in agreement with numerical analyses. Our proof is based on an analytical evaluation of the branch cut contribution to the Green function, and includes charged black holes, different kinds of perturbations, Teukolsky equation for the Kerr metric, exotic compact objects, extensions of General Relativity, and environmental effects. In the latter case, our results indicate that tails are largely insensitive to a wide range of physically motivated matter distributions around black holes, including the Navarro Frenk White profile commonly used to model dark matter.</description>

      <title>Quantized six-vertex model on a torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the integrability of the quantized six-vertex model with four parameters on a torus. It is a three-dimensional integrable lattice model in which a layer transfer matrix, depending on two spectral parameters associated with the homology cycles of the torus, can be defined not only on the square lattice but also on more general graphs. For a class of graphs that we call admissible, we establish the commutativity of the layer transfer matrices by introducing four types of tetrahedron equations and two types of inversion relations. Expanding in the spectral parameters yields a family of commuting quantum Hamiltonians. The quantized six-vertex model can also be reformulated in terms of (quantized) dimer models, and encompasses known integrable systems as special cases, including the free parafermion model and the relativistic Toda chain.</description>

      <title>Black hole mimickers: from theory to observation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The black hole paradigm, while remarkably successful, raises fundamental questions-both classical and quantum-about the nature of spacetime, horizons, and singularities. Black hole mimickers, horizonless ultra-compact objects, have emerged as potential alternatives that seek to resolve some of these puzzles while remaining consistent with current observational constraints. Recent breakthroughs in gravitational-wave astronomy and horizon-scale electromagnetic imaging have opened new avenues to test this paradigm-making this an opportune moment to systematically investigate such alternatives.
  This vision document presents a snapshot of the field as discussed at the Black Hole Mimickers: From Theory to Observation workshop, where experts from gravitational wave astronomy, very long baseline interferometry, numerical and mathematical relativity, and high-energy physics converged to assess the current frontiers. By highlighting key open questions and proposing concrete pathways forward, this document aims to guide future efforts to probe the nature of compact objects. As the field stands at the crossroads of theoretical innovation and observational breakthroughs, we outline strategies to harness upcoming observational capabilities to fundamentally test the black hole paradigm.</description>

      <title>Dictionary revision for mapping boundary data to bound states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The correspondence between gravitational observables derived from scattering processes and adiabatic invariants in bound orbits, within the framework of the Post-Minkowskian (PM) expansion, has garnered significant attention in the study of bound orbital systems. However, the existing dictionary for this correspondence produces complex-valued quantities of bound orbits that contravene physical principles in 4PM calculations, thus revealing deficiencies in the dictionary. Our research identifies a critical issue: the Fourier transform of the scattering amplitude incorporates a factor of $(p_\infty^2)^{-n/2}$ in 4PM order. This factor introduces singularities at $p_\infty^2 = 0$, thereby rendering the original dictionary become ineffective, as it assumes the possibility of connecting both scattering states and bound states at the singular point. We propose a rigorous modification by employing Hawking's method for black hole radiation, specifically analytical continuing $p_\infty^2 \rightarrow p_\infty^2 e^{-i \pi}$. We also evaluate the new dictionary by comparing the binding energy calculated using effective one-body (EOB) theory with numerical relativity (NR) simulations data from the SXS collaboration. Our findings indicate that the binding energy-angular momentum relationship to the innermost stable circular orbit derived from EOB theory is in remarkable agreement with NR data. This revised dictionary enhances the applicability of gravitational observables derived from scattering processes to bound orbits and effectively fulfills the objectives envisioned by the pioneers who proposed this correspondence.</description>

      <title>Charmed Meson Structure across Crossover from SU(4) Polyakov Quark Meson Model with Isospin Asymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Polyakov Quark Meson (PQM) model is extended to SU(4) flavor symmetry by incorporating the charm quark and introducing a finite isospin asymmetry. This model incorporates the light, strange, and charm chiral condensates, along with the Polyakov-loop variables, to describe the confinement--deconfinement phase transition in a thermal and dense QCD medium. The inclusion of the charm quark condensate enhances the capability of the SU(4) PQM model to explore the spatial and thermal resolution of the chiral phase structure, particularly in the crossover and high-temperature regimes. We construct the QCD phase diagram ($T/T_\chi-\mu_I/m_\pi$) plane, indicating a decrease in the pseudo-critical temperature as the isospin chemical potential increases and explore thermodynamic quantities related to the QCD equation of state at very high temperatures. Fluctuations of quark flavors, conserved charges and baryon-charm correlations are studied across a wide temperature range. The SU(4) PQM model exhibits good qualitative agreement with lattice QCD calculations. Additionally, we calculate the meson mass spectrum at zero and finite temperature, showing that the charm sector remains thermally stable over a wide temperature range. Overall, this study highlights the capability of the SU(4) PQM model to describe key features of QCD matter at high temperatures and its relevance to heavy-ion collisions and astrophysical studies.</description>

      <title>Signatures of asymmetry: Gravitational wave memory and the parity violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Einstein's equivalence principle suggests a deep connection between matter and spacetime, prompting the question: if matter violates parity, must gravity? This essay explores the detection of parity violation in gravity using gravitational wave (GW) memory. Gravitational parity violation could be observable through GW amplitude birefringence and large-scale structure correlations. With improved sensitivity, next-generation GW detectors offer unprecedented opportunities to probe these effects. We propose that the integrated cosmological memory (ICM) of GWs, amplified over cosmological distances, can enhance faint parity-violating signatures. Specifically, if GWs from astrophysical events have differing polarization amplitudes, as in Chern-Simons gravity, ICM significantly amplifies this disparity. ICM uniquely and independently allows us to test fundamental symmetries, constrain gravity parameters, and gain insights into the interplay of particle physics, cosmology and gravity.</description>

      <title>Magnetized Letelier black hole in AdS spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the motion of charged, neutral, and light-like particles in a magnetized black hole solution surrounded by a cloud of strings in an anti-de Sitter (AdS) background. This spacetime admits several well-known solutions as special cases, including the Letelier-AdS black hole, the Melvin spacetime, and the Schwarzschild-AdS black hole. We demonstrate that key parameters characterizing the geometry-such as the cloud of strings parameter, the magnetic field strength, and the AdS radius-significantly affect the trajectories of these particles. Our analysis shows that increasing the cloud of strings parameter weakens the gravitational influence, while the magnetic field introduces additional attractive components that can destabilize particle orbits. We examine the photon sphere and calculate the black hole shadow, showing that the shadow radius decreases with increasing magnetic field parameter but increases with the cloud of strings parameter. These findings provide potential observables for distinguishing between different black hole models in realistic astrophysical environments.</description>

      <title>Exotic Encounters: Buchdahl's Conditions and Physical Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Black holes are among the most well-known astrophysical objects, yet their physical realisation remains conceptually subtle. We analyse physical black holes -- light-trapping regions that form in finite time as seen by a distant observer -- and investigate the properties of the matter required to support them. Taking Buchdahl's theorem as a benchmark, we show that these configurations necessarily violate at least two of its four original conditions, and the post-formation state violates them all. These violations are substantial: they include the null energy condition, non-monotonic energy profiles, and strong pressure anisotropies. Thus, the requirement of truly forming a horizon places physical black holes in a class of solutions that are more exotic than exotic compact objects.</description>

      <title>Quantum Entanglement Theory and Its Generic Searches in High Energy Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new formalism for quantum entanglement (QE), and study its generic searches at the colliders. For a general quantum system with $N$ particles, we show that the quantum space (the total spin polarization parameter space) is complex projective space, and the classical space (the spin polarization parameter space for classical theory) is the cartesian product of the complex projective spaces. Thus, the quantum entanglement space is the difference of these two spaces. For the $ff$, $AA$, $Af$, $fff$, and $ffA$ systems, we propose their discriminants $\Delta_i$. The corresponding classical spaces are the discriminant locus $\Delta=0$ for $ff$ system, and intersections of the discriminant loci $\Delta_i=0$ for $AA$, $Af$, $fff$, and $ffA$ systems in the quantum space. We show that our criterion $\Delta\not=0$ for quantum entanglement is equivalent to the original Peres-Horodecki criterion for $ff$ system. With the collider searches, we can reconstruct the discriminants from various measurements, and probe the quantum entanglement spaces via a fundamental approach at exact level. In addition, for the specific approach, we present a comprehensive framework to detect quantum entanglement in high-energy multi-particle systems, spanning fermion pairs (\(t\bar{t}\), \(\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\)), bosonic pairs (\(W^{-}W^{+}\)), and hybrid or three-body systems (\(W^{-}t\), \(ttt\), \(t\bar{t}W^{-}\)). We derive diverse observables through angular correlations in decay products and establish key criteria for QE by calculating the exact quantum ranges and classical ranges, which can be used to detect QE at colliders. These results establish model-independent methodologies for probing QE across collider experiments, bridging quantum information principles with high-energy phenomenology, while offering novel pathways to explore exotic particles and quantum properties in multi-particle systems.</description>

      <title>Eddington-inspired Born-Infeld gravity: Constraints from the generalized parton distributions (GPDs)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Eddington-inspired Born-Infeld (EiBI) theory of gravity modifies general relativity in high-density regimes. It offers an alternative framework that avoids cosmological singularities and remodels gravitational dynamics within compact objects. An important feature of EiBI gravity is its additional parameter, $\kappa$, which governs deviations from standard gravitational behavior. In this study, we investigate constraints on $\kappa$ using the internal pressure distribution of the proton, derived from gravitational form factor (GFF) $ D(t) $ obtained through a QCD analysis of generalized parton distributions (GPDs). By comparing pressure profiles extracted from skewness-dependent GPDs with previous determinations based on deeply virtual Compton scattering (DVCS) data, we establish updated bounds on $\kappa$. Our results show that the choice of proton pressure model significantly impacts the constraints, with the strongest limits ($|\kappa| \leq 0.10\text{--}0.3\, \text{m}^5\, \text{kg}^{-1}\, \text{s}^{-2}$). We further demonstrate that constraints obtained based on the first and second moments of the pressure distribution yield competitive bounds compared to those derived from peak pressures or those derived from just the first moment. These findings highlight the importance of precise experimental and theoretical determinations of the proton's mechanical properties in testing alternative theories of gravity. The present study motivates future improvements in GPD reconstructions for stronger constraints on EiBI gravity and related modifications.</description>

      <title>Near-horizon behavior of nonequatorial accelerated particle motion and high energy particle collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider motion of a particle in the background of a stationary axially symmetric generic black hole. A particle experiences the action of a force of unspecified nature. We require the force to remain finite in a comoving frame. The result is expressed in terms of several integers characterizing the Taylor expansion of the metric coefficients near the horizon. We show that the polar component of the four-velocity remains finite. As a result, the scenarios of high-energy particle collisions, found previously in the context of the BSW effect for equatorial motion, do not change qualitatively in the nonequatorial case. The fact that the polar component is finite, also enables us to fill some gaps in the description of the BSW effect in previous works. Our results have a quite general character and can be used not only in description of high energy particle collisions but also in diverse astrophysical problems for which motion is not constrained by the equatorial plane.</description>

      <title>Quantum signatures in black hole accretion: Pair production in dynamical magnetic fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accretion disks around black holes host extreme conditions where general relativity and magnetohydrodynamics dominate. These disks exhibit two distinct dynamical regimes -- Standard and Normal Evolution (SANE) and Magnetically Arrested Disk (MAD). In the MAD regime, these systems exhibit magnetic fields up to $10^8$ G and variability on gravitational timescales $t_g \sim 10^{-4}$ s for stellar-mass black holes. While classical magnetohydrodynamics has been extensively applied, quantum effects in these high-energy environments remain unexplored. Here, we employ quantum field theory in background gauge fields (QFTBGF) to demonstrate that the dynamic magnetic fields of MADs drive significant pair production via the Schwinger mechanism. The resulting pairs emit non-thermal (synchrotron) radiation with a peak frequency tunable across $ \sim 1 - 3000$ MHz, depending on the magnetic field strength (peaking at higher frequencies for stronger fields). For $ B \sim 10^8 $ G, our model predicts a peak spectral flux density of $ \sim 1 - 100$ mJy, detectable with next-generation radio telescopes (e.g., SKA, ngVLA). This work provides a direct and observable signatures of quantum effects in black hole accretion disks.</description>

      <title>Large Momentum EFT and Lightcone Quantization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.13171v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop methods for computing the effective action at infinite momentum for $1+1d$ QFTs at finite volume which do not rely on the theory having a Lagrangian description. We do this by taking the infinite momentum limit of equal-time quantization and integrating out all except for the chiral modes of the theory. Our main application of this method is to the Ising Field Theory (IFT), with an energy and magnetic deformation, where we compute the effective lightcone Hamiltonian numerically and check it against results from TCSA. Remarkably, in the low-temperature phase, the Lorentz invariant effective Hamiltonian at infinite momentum takes a very compact form and depends on the volume only through the finite volume vacuum expectation value of $\langle\sigma\rangle$, the spin operator.</description>

      <title>Generalized entropy of photons in AdS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12851v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work analyzes the quantum corrections to holographic entanglement entropy at first subleading order in $G_{N}$ due to photon excited states in AdS. We compute the vacuum-subtracted von Neumann entropy of a $U(1)$ current excited state for a polar cap region on the cylinder in any large-$N$, strongly-coupled CFT$_{d}$ holographically dual to weakly-coupled Einstein gravity for any dimension $d&gt;2$. We then quantize a Maxwell field in AdS$_{d+1}$ dual to the $U(1)$ current and consider a photon excited state whose vacuum-subtracted generalized entropy for the entanglement wedge is calculated. In order to factorise the Maxwell Hilbert space in AdS, we construct an extended Hilbert space and the corresponding electromagnetic edge modes. We find exact agreement between the CFT entanglement entropy and AdS generalized entropy without the inclusion of entropy of the edge modes. Finally, we show via explicit calculation that the contribution to the vacuum-subtracted von Neumann entropy from electromagnetic edge modes indeed vanishes, which is crucial for consistency with known holographic entropy formulas.</description>

      <title>Conformal Blocks in Two and Four Dimensions from Oscillator Representations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19436v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The explicit computation of higher-point conformal blocks in any dimension is usually a challenging task. For two-dimensional conformal field theories in Euclidean signature, the oscillator formalism proves to be very efficient. We demonstrate this by reproducing the general $n$-point global conformal block in the comb channel in an elegant and direct manner. Exploiting similarities to the representation theory of two-dimensional CFTs, we extend the oscillator formalism to the computation of higher-point conformal blocks in four Euclidean dimensions. As a proof of concept, we explicitly compute the scalar four-point block with scalar exchange within this framework and discuss the extension to the higher-point case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14324v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note, we show that several self-dual spacetimes previously studied in the context of celestial and twisted holography arise as limits of a certain Taub-NUT AdS$_4$ metric, the Pedersen metric, in which their Mass, NUT charge and cosmological constant obey a self-duality relation. In particular, self-dual Taub-NUT, a singular double cover of Eguchi-Hanson space, Euclidean AdS$_4$, and non-compact $\mathbb{CP}^2$, which is conformally equivalent to Burns space, arise as special limits of the Pedersen metric. The Pedersen metric can be derived from a curved twistor space which we conjecture to arise from a backreaction of self-dual gravity in the presence of a cosmological constant when coupled to a defect operator wrapping a certain $\mathbb{CP}^1$ at infinity. The curved twistor space gives rise to a $2$-parameter deformation of the celestial symmetry algebra $Lw_\wedge$ which reduces to previously studied algebras in various limits.</description>

      <title>On the physical and mathematical foundations of quantum physics via functional integrals</title>

Abstract: In order to preserve the leading role of the action principle in formulating all field theories one needs quantum field theory, with the associated BRST symmetry, and Feynman-DeWitt-Faddeev-Popov ghost fields. Such fields result from the fibre-bundle structure of the space of histories, but the physics-oriented literature used them formally because a rigorous theory of measure and integration was lacking. Motivated by this framework, this paper exploits previous work of Gill and Zachary, where the use of Banach spaces for the Feynman integral was proposed. The Henstock-Kurzweil integral is first introduced, because it makes it possible to integrate functions like the exponential of (i times x squared). The Lebesgue measure on R(infinity) is then built and used to define the measure on every separable Hilbert space. The subsequent step is the construction of a new Hilbert space KS2, which contains square-integrable functions on R**n as a continuous dense embedding, and contains both the test functions and their dual, the Schwartz space of distributions, as continuous embeddings. This space allows us to construct the Feynman path integral in a manner that maintains its intuitive and computational advantages. We also extend this space to KS2[H], where H is any separable Banach space. Last, the existence of a unique universal definition of time, tau(h), that we call historical time, is proved. We use tau(h) as the order parameter for our construction of Feynman's time ordered operator calculus, which in turn is used to extend the path integral in order to include all time dependent groups and semigroups with a kernel.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10624v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give the full representation theory of the gravitational extended corner symmetry group in two-dimensions. This includes projective representations, which correspond to representations of the quantum corner symmetry group. We find that they are described by one-dimensional conformal fields with an additional index in the Fock space of the harmonic oscillator. We begin with a review of Mackey's theory of induced representations and then proceed to its application to the corner symmetries. The field representations, induced from the irreducible representations of the special linear group are worked out first. The little group method is then applied to the extended corner symmetry group to obtain the irreducible unitary representations. Finally, we focus on projective representations and their application to the description of local subsystems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14329v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The particle with first-order dynamics proposed by Dunne, Jackiw and Trugenberger (DJT) to justify the ``Peierls substitution" is obtained by reduction from both of the planar two-parameter centrally extended Galilean and Carroll systems. In the latter case the extension parameters $\kappa_{exo}$ and $\kappa_{mag}$ generate non-commutativity of the coordinates resp. behave as an internal magnetic field. The position and momentum follow uncoupled anomalous Hall motions. Consistently with partial immobility, one of the Carroll boost generators is broken but the other remains a symmetry. Switching off $\kappa_{exo}$, the immobility of unextended Carroll particles is recovered. The Carroll system is dual to an uncharged anyon on the horizon of a black hole which exhibits the spin-Hall effect. Physical applications are shortly reviewed.</description>

      <title>Toolkit for General 2d Scalar Potential in LCT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12255v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present efficient algorithms for obtaining the Hamiltonian in Lightcone Conformal Truncation (LCT) for a 2d scalar field with a generic potential. We apply this method to the sine-Gordon and sinh-Gordon models in $1+1d$, and find precise agreement with integrability results when the scaling dimension $\Delta$ of the deforming cosine/cosinh potential is in the range $ \Delta \leq 1$. The agreement provides additional evidence for a recent conjecture for how to compute the effective lightcone Hamiltonian in this class of models. In addition, to high precision, we provide the first direct confirmation for the conjectured self-duality of the sinh-Gordon model ($\Delta &lt; 0)$, which relates $\Delta \leftrightarrow 4/\Delta$. As the dimension approaches the upper limit $\Delta=1$ from below, we show analytically that the Hamiltonian matrix elements exactly reproduce those of a free Majorana fermion, demonstrating how bosonization is manifested in the LCT basis. We comment on the possible extension of the approach to $\Delta &gt; 1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09264v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate unitarily inequivalent representations of the algebra of operators in quantum field theory in the cases where there is a Fock representation of the commutation relations. We examine more closely the operational definition of a measurement device, discussing the Unruh-DeWitt and Glauber models of quantum detectors. The transition probability per unit of proper time of both detectors in different non-inertial frames of reference in Minkowski spacetime is evaluated. We first study detectors traveling in a stationary worldline with a constant proper acceleration, i.e., a hyperbolic motion, interacting with the field prepared in the Poincar\'e invariant Fock vacuum state. Next, we study the Unruh-DeWitt detector at rest in a non-uniformly accelerated frame, with a time dependent acceleration interacting with the field in the Poincar\'e invariant Fock vacuum state. We evaluate the positive frequency Wightman function for the non-uniformly accelerated frame in a finite time interval and find that it is similar to the two-point correlation function of a system in equilibrium with a thermal bath. Calculating the transition rate, the non-uniformly accelerated Unruh-DeWitt detector can be excited even if the scalar field is prepared in the vacuum state.</description>

      <title>Formulating the Weak Gravity Conjecture in AdS Space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05862v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a version of the Weak Gravity Conjecture that applies to AdS spacetime. We find that the condition on the charge-to-mass ratio of a charged particle in AdS$_D$ spacetime is corrected compared to the one in Minkowski spacetime by contributions that depends on the AdS scale and the horizon radius of the extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole charged under the same gauge theory. It is maximized when we consider the largest possible extremal black hole in AdS. We motivate our proposal from the viewpoint of extremal black hole decay and show that the bound on the particle spectrum is given by the critical charge-to-mass ratio beyond which the Schwinger effect can take place. This quantum effect shares the same condition as requiring a particle to satisfy a repulsive force condition at the black hole horizon, so that the extremal black hole can decay without reabsorbing the particle. We discuss the relation of our proposed weak gravity bound with the near-horizon Breitenlohner-Freedman bound. We also comment on the generalization in the case of multiple U(1) gauge theories, providing evidence for a convex hull condition in AdS background.</description>

Abstract: Quantum complexity quantifies the difficulty of preparing a state or implementing a unitary transformation with limited resources. Applications range from quantum computation to condensed matter physics and quantum gravity. We seek to bridge the approaches of these fields, which define and study complexity using different frameworks and tools. We describe several definitions of complexity, along with their key properties. In quantum information theory, we focus on complexity growth in random quantum circuits. In quantum many-body systems and quantum field theory (QFT), we discuss a geometric definition of complexity in terms of geodesics on the unitary group. In dynamical systems, we explore a definition of complexity in terms of state or operator spreading, as well as concepts from tensor-networks. We also outline applications to simple quantum systems, quantum many-body models, and QFTs including conformal field theories (CFTs). Finally, we explain the proposed relationship between complexity and gravitational observables within the holographic anti-de Sitter (AdS)/CFT correspondence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05199v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the scattering amplitudes of massive Kaluza-Klein (KK) states in compactified five-dimensional warped gauge and gravity theories. Focusing on tree-level $2\to2$ processes, we analyze the leading-order amplitudes involving bulk KK matter fields and KK gauge/gravitational Goldstone bosons. By imposing the gauge theory equivalence theorem (GAET) and the gravitational equivalence theorem (GRET) within warped KK theories, we systematically reconstruct the leading-order amplitudes for physical KK gauge bosons and gravitons, thereby circumventing the intricate energy cancellations inherent in physical amplitudes. Within this framework, the correspondence between GAET and GRET arises as a direct manifestation of the leading-order double-copy relation in the high-energy expansion. This connection provides a foundation for extending the BCJ double-copy construction to four-point amplitudes involving bulk KK matter fields, and further generalizes to arbitrary $N$-point cases, enabling a systematic derivation of the corresponding gravitational amplitudes with consistent incorporation of KK matter fields at leading order.</description>

      <title>Topological Manipulations On $\mathbb{R}$ Symmetries Of Abelian Gauge Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03700v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Performing topological manipulations is a fruitful way to understand global aspects of Quantum Field Theory (QFT). Such modifications are controlled by the notion of Topological QFT (TQFT) coupling across different codimensions. Motivated by the recent developments involving non-compact TQFTs as the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT) for continuous symmetries, we explore topological manipulations on global $\mathbb{R}$ symmetries in the simple contexts of abelian gauge theories. We do so by turning on $\mathbb{R}$ background fields in these models, which are then inserted into a BF theory with a conjugate field valued either in $\mathbb{R}$ or $U(1)$, depending on the manipulation. When the conjugate field is $\mathbb{R}$-valued, it gives a flat gauging prescription of the $\mathbb{R}$ global symmetry. For certain cases, this gauging can be used to establish path-integral dualities, with which one can construct topological duality defects and condensation defects. The defects being defined by employing self-duality under $\mathbb{R}$ gauging, they are anticipated to obey a Tambara-Yamagami like fusion algebra. Due to the challenges arising from the non-compactness of $\mathbb{R}$, we do not rigorously establish this expectation. For the TQFT coupling with $U(1)$ valued conjugate field, we demonstrate a $2\pi \mathbb{Z} \subset \mathbb{R}$ subgroup gauging, which we connect to the results obtained from SymTFT recently. Executing this gauging in the 2d real scalar and the 4d $\mathbb{R}$ Maxwell, we respectively obtain the 2d compact scalar and the 4d $U(1)$ Maxwell theory. Finally, we give an exposition on the $\mathbb{R}$ gauging ideas applied to $(-1)-$form and $(d-1)-$form $\mathbb{R}$ symmetries. In particular, using the SymTFT picture, we identify the possible manipulations and realize them explicitly in the context of $p$-form gauge theory in $d=p+1$ dimensions.</description>

Abstract: The Lukash metric is a homogeneous gravitational wave which at late times approximates the behaviour of a generic class of spatially homogenous cosmological models with monotonically decreasing energy density. The transcription from Brinkmann to Baldwin-Jeffery-Rosen (BJR) to Bianchi coordinates is presented and the relation to a Sturm-Liouville equation is explained. The 6-parameter isometry group is derived. In the Bianchi VII range of parameters we have two BJR transciptions. However using either of them induces a mere relabeling of the geodesics and isometries. Following pioneering work of Siklos, we provide a self-contained account of the geometry and global structure of the spacetime. The latter contains a Killing horizon to the future of which the spacetime resembles an anisotropic version of the Milne cosmology and to the past of which it resemble the Rindler wedge.</description>

Abstract: We define an action of the Weyl group W of a simple Lie algebra g on a completion of the ring Y, which is the codomain of the q-character homomorphism of the corresponding quantum affine algebra U_q(g^). We prove that the subring of W-invariants of Y is precisely the ring of q-characters, which is isomorphic to the Grothendieck ring of the category of finite-dimensional representations of U_q(g^). This resolves an old puzzle in the theory of q-characters. We also identify the screening operators, which were previously used to describe the ring of q-characters, as the subleading terms of simple reflections from W in a certain limit. Our results have already found applications to the study of the category O of representations of the Borel subalgebra of U_q(g^) in arXiv:2312.13256 and to the categorification of cluster algebras in arXiv:2401.04616.</description>

Abstract: Unlike a single Carroll particle, a multiparticle Carroll system can move under suitable conditions, as we demonstrate it explicitly for two particles with a momentum-dependent interaction: the center-of-mass remains fixed, however relative motion is possible, confirming previous statements made by Bergshoeff, Casalbuoni, and their collaborators. Analogous results are obtained for electric dipoles with the roles of the center-of-mass and the relative position interchanged.</description>

      <title>Rotational mass of anisotropic neutron stars within Rastall gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01837v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to rotation, the mass correction of neutron stars arises and causes the rotational mass to be larger than the static mass. In this work, we extend the formulation of the rotational mass of anisotropic neutron stars within Rastall gravity. We apply numerical simulation on the formulation we obtained. We refer to mass of J0740+6620, GW170817, and GW190814 as the mass constraints of the neutron stars. For the free parameters, we use three values of Rastall's parameter, i.e. $\lambda=0.00019$, $\lambda=0.00038$, $\lambda=0.00071$; and three values of anisotropic strength, i.e. $\zeta=-1.15$, $\zeta=-1.50$, and $\zeta=-2.00$. We have found that both $\lambda$ and $\zeta$ impact on the increment of the NS's rotational mass within the compact regimes, and also impact on the decrease of the NS's rotational mass within the loose regimes. All mass constraints are satisfied by the NS with $\zeta=-2.00$. In term of the moment of inertia $I$ of the neutron stars, all numerical results match with the constraint range which is based on radio observations of heavy pulsars; while in term of the angular velocity of the stars relative to the distant observers $\Omega$, the mass correction $\delta M$ significantly increases when $\Omega$ increases.</description>

      <title>Reduced geometry and its role in explicit spacetime symmetry violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19264v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The incompatibility of explicit diffeomorphism violation with Riemannian geometry within the gravitational Standard-Model Extension (SME) is revisited. We review two methods of how to deal with this problem. The first is based on an approach proposed originally by St\"{u}ckelberg and the latter is to restrict spacetime geometry via the dynamical field equations and the second Bianchi identities. Moreover, a third technique is introduced in this work, which relies on isometries of a gravitational system. Our conclusion is that an SME background field configuration compatible with Riemannian geometry is more likely to be determined the more diffeomorphisms are isometries of the particular system. The proposal is demonstrated to work for cosmological time evolution with the SME backgrounds $u$ and $s^{\mu\nu}$ present. This finding has the potential to provide an alternative treatment of explicit spacetime symmetry violation in gravity.</description>

      <title>The pole inflation from broken non-compact isometry in Weyl gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16944v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose the microscopic origin of the pole inflation from the scalar fields of broken non-compact isometry in Weyl gravity. We show that the $SO(1,N)$ isometry in the field space in combination with the Weyl symmetry relates the form of the non-minimal couplings to the one of the potential in the Jordan frame. In the presence of an explicit breaking of the $SO(1,N)$ symmetry in the coefficient of the potential, we realize the pole inflation near the pole of the inflaton kinetic term. Applying our results to the Higgs or PQ inflation models, we find that there is one parameter family of the solutions for the pole inflation, depending on the overall coefficient of the Weyl covariant derivatives for scalar fields. The same coefficient not only makes the predictions of the pole inflation varying, being compatible with the Planck data, but also determines the mass of the Weyl gauge field. We also show that the isocurvature perturbations of the axion can be suppressed sufficiently during the PQ pole inflation, and the massive Weyl gauge field produced during reheating serves as a dark matter candidate.</description>

Abstract: We describe the scattering of particles by a sandwich gravitational wave generated during a flyby using an analytical approach. The derivative-of-the-Gaussian profile proposed by Gibbons and Hawking is approximated by the hyperbolic scarf potential, which allows for an exact analytic solution via the Nikiforov-Uvarov method. Our results confirm the prediction of Zel'dovich and Polnarev about certain ``magical" amplitudes of the potential.</description>

      <title>Robustness of dark energy phenomenology across different parameterizations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04929v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent evidence for dynamical dark energy from DESI, in combination with other cosmological data, has generated significant interest in understanding the nature of dark energy and its underlying microphysics. However, interpreting these results critically depends on how dark energy is parameterized. This paper examines the robustness of conclusions about the viability of particular kinds of dynamical dark energy models to the choice of parameterization, focusing on four popular two-parameter models: the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL), Jassal-Bagla-Padmanabhan (JBP), Barboza-Alcaniz (BA), and exponential (EXP) parameterizations. We find that conclusions regarding the viability of minimally and non-minimally coupled quintessence models are independent of the parameterization adopted. We demonstrate this both by mapping these dark energy models into the $(w_0, w_a)$ parameter space defined by these various parameterizations and by showing that all of these parameterizations can equivalently account for the phenomenology predicted by these dark energy models to a high degree of accuracy.</description>

      <title>Weak mixing angle under $\text{U}(1, 3)$ colored gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11236v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Colored gravity, based on $\text{U}(1,3)$ symmetry, emerges naturally in the complexification of Lorentzian manifolds and integrates U(1) electromagnetism as a subcase. This work explores the viability of also including strong and electroweak interactions under the $\text{U}(1,3)$ gauge group of colored gravity. We identify specific generators linked to leptonic and quark interactions and embed the standard Higgs mechanism. Crucially, the weak mixing angle ($\sin^2\theta_W$) is predicted to exhibit about $\sim0.231$ for lepton-lepton interactions (close to observations) and $\sim0.222$ for hadron-lepton interactions, which is in 3$\sigma$ tension with some observations. These findings open pathways for reconciling experimental data with colored gravity and suggest avenues for quantum correction studies.</description>

      <title>Critical Unstable Qubits: an Application to $B^0\bar{B}^0$-Meson System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15625v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend our previous work on a novel class of unstable qubits which we have identified recently and called them Critical Unstable Qubits (CUQs). The characteristic property of CUQs is that the energy-level and decay-width vectors, ${\bf E}$ and ${\bf \Gamma}$, are orthogonal to one another, and the key parameter $r = |{\bf \Gamma}|/|2{\bf E}|$ is less than 1. Most remarkably, CUQs exhibit two atypical behaviours: (i) they display coherence-decoherence oscillations in a co-decaying frame of the system described by a unit Bloch vector ${\bf b}$, and (ii) the unit Bloch vector ${\bf b}$ describing a pure CUQ sweeps out unequal areas during equal intervals of time, while rotating about the vector ${\bf E}$. The latter anharmonic phenomenon emerges beyond the usual oscillatory pattern due to the energy-level difference of the two-level quantum system, which governs an ordinary qubit. By making use of a Fourier series decomposition, we define anharmonicity observables that quantify the degree of non-sinusoidal oscillation of a CUQ. We apply the results of our formalism to the $B^0\bar{B}^0$-meson system and derive, for the first time, generic upper limits on these new observables.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10205v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an exact analytic solution for incompressible turbulent mixing described by 3D NS equations, with a passive scalar (concentration, temperature, or other scalar field) driven by the turbulent velocity field. Using our recent solution of decaying turbulence in terms of the Euler ensemble, we represent the correlation functions of a passive scalar as statistical averages over this ensemble. The statistical limit, corresponding to decaying turbulence, can be computed in quadrature by a multi-dimensional Mellin-Barnes integral representation. We find the decay spectrum and the scaling functions of the pair correlation. Full comparison with physical and real experiments is postponed till the future detailed computation of the spectrum in our solution.</description>

      <title>Beyond Robertson-Schr\"odinger: A General Uncertainty Relation Unveiling Hidden Noncommutative Trade-offs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20404v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report a universal strengthening of the Robertson-Schr\''odinger uncertainty relation, revealing a previously overlooked trade-off of genuinely quantum origin, particularly as the state becomes more mixed. Remarkably, this generalized bound supplements the standard commutator term and the covariance term with an additional positive contribution that depends on the commutator of observables. The relation also rigorously proves and extends a conjectured uncertainty relation previously proposed in [Phys. Rev. A 110, 062215 (2024)]. For two-level quantum systems, the inequality becomes an exact equality for any state and any pair of observables, establishing that the bound is tight in the strongest possible sense.</description>

      <title>Innermost stable circular orbit of arbitrary-mass compact binaries at fourth post-Newtonian order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01278v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute by means of post-Newtonian (PN) methods the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) of arbitrary-mass (in particular, comparable-mass) compact binaries. Two methods are used with equivalent results: dynamical perturbation of the conservative equations of motion in harmonic coordinates, and dynamical perturbation of the conservative Hamiltonian in ADM coordinates. The perturbation of the non-local tail term at 4PN order in both approaches is carefully investigated. Our final gauge invariant result for the location of the ISCO at 4PN order is close to the numerical value of the ISCO shift computed by the gravitational self-force (GSF) approach in the small mass-ratio limit, and is also in good agreement with the full numerical-relativity calculation in the case of equal masses. The PN method followed here is considered in standard Taylor-expanded form, without any resummation techniques applied. As a complement, we also compute explicitly the gauge transformation from harmonic coordinates to ADM coordinates up to 4PN order, including the tail contribution therein.</description>

      <title>Exponential improvement in quantum simulations of bosons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02553v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hamiltonian quantum simulation of bosons on digital quantum computers requires truncating the Hilbert space to finite dimensions. The method of truncation and the choice of basis states can significantly impact the complexity of the quantum circuit required to simulate the system. For example, a truncation in the Fock basis where each boson is encoded with a register of $Q$ qubits, can result in an exponentially large number of Pauli strings required to decompose the truncated Hamiltonian. This, in turn, can lead to an exponential increase in $Q$ in the complexity of the quantum circuit. For lattice quantum field theories such as Yang-Mills theory and QCD, several Hamiltonian formulations and corresponding truncations have been put forward in recent years. There is no exponential increase in $Q$ when resorting to the orbifold lattice Hamiltonian, while we do not know how to remove the exponential complexity in $Q$ in the commonly used Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonian. Specifically, when using the orbifold lattice Hamiltonian, the continuum limit, or, in other words, the removal of the ultraviolet energy cutoff, is obtained with circuits whose resources scale like $Q$, while they scale like $\mathcal{O}(\exp(Q))$ for the Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonian: this can be seen as an exponential speed up in approaching the physical continuum limit for the orbifold lattice Hamiltonian formulation. We show that the universal framework, advocated by three of the authors (M.~H., S.~M., and E.~R.) and collaborators provides a natural avenue to solve the exponential scaling of circuit complexity with $Q$, and it is the reason why using the orbifold lattice Hamiltonian is advantageous. We also point out that Hamiltonian formulations based on a gauge-invariant Hilbert space require an exponential increase in the resource requirement with respect to using an extended Hilbert space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05272v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the addition to the Standard Model of a scalar $SU(2)$ multiplet $\Delta_n$ with dimension $n$ going from $1$ to $6$. The multiplet $\Delta_n$ is assumed to have null vacuum expectation value and an arbitrary (free) hypercharge. We determine the shape of the phase space for the new terms that appear in the scalar potential (SP); we observe in particular that, in the case of a 6-plet, the phase space is slightly concave along one of its boundaries. We determine the bounded-from-below and vacuum stability conditions on the SP for each value of $n$.</description>
