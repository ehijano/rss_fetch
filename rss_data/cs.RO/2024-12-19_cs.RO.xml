      <title>ManiSkill-HAB: A Benchmark for Low-Level Manipulation in Home Rearrangement Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-quality benchmarks are the foundation for embodied AI research, enabling significant advancements in long-horizon navigation, manipulation and rearrangement tasks. However, as frontier tasks in robotics get more advanced, they require faster simulation speed, more intricate test environments, and larger demonstration datasets. To this end, we present MS-HAB, a holistic benchmark for low-level manipulation and in-home object rearrangement. First, we provide a GPU-accelerated implementation of the Home Assistant Benchmark (HAB). We support realistic low-level control and achieve over 3x the speed of previous magical grasp implementations at similar GPU memory usage. Second, we train extensive reinforcement learning (RL) and imitation learning (IL) baselines for future work to compare against. Finally, we develop a rule-based trajectory filtering system to sample specific demonstrations from our RL policies which match predefined criteria for robot behavior and safety. Combining demonstration filtering with our fast environments enables efficient, controlled data generation at scale.</description>

      <title>Physics-model-guided Worst-case Sampling for Safe Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-world accidents in learning-enabled CPS frequently occur in challenging corner cases. During the training of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) policy, the standard setup for training conditions is either fixed at a single initial condition or uniformly sampled from the admissible state space. This setup often overlooks the challenging but safety-critical corner cases. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a physics-model-guided worst-case sampling strategy for training safe policies that can handle safety-critical cases toward guaranteed safety. Furthermore, we integrate the proposed worst-case sampling strategy into the physics-regulated deep reinforcement learning (Phy-DRL) framework to build a more data-efficient and safe learning algorithm for safety-critical CPS. We validate the proposed training strategy with Phy-DRL through extensive experiments on a simulated cart-pole system, a 2D quadrotor, a simulated and a real quadruped robot, showing remarkably improved sampling efficiency to learn more robust safe policies.</description>

      <title>C2F-TP: A Coarse-to-Fine Denoising Framework for Uncertainty-Aware Trajectory Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately predicting the trajectory of vehicles is critically important for ensuring safety and reliability in autonomous driving. Although considerable research efforts have been made recently, the inherent trajectory uncertainty caused by various factors including the dynamic driving intends and the diverse driving scenarios still poses significant challenges to accurate trajectory prediction. To address this issue, we propose C2F-TP, a coarse-to-fine denoising framework for uncertainty-aware vehicle trajectory prediction. C2F-TP features an innovative two-stage coarse-to-fine prediction process. Specifically, in the spatial-temporal interaction stage, we propose a spatial-temporal interaction module to capture the inter-vehicle interactions and learn a multimodal trajectory distribution, from which a certain number of noisy trajectories are sampled. Next, in the trajectory refinement stage, we design a conditional denoising model to reduce the uncertainty of the sampled trajectories through a step-wise denoising operation. Extensive experiments are conducted on two real datasets NGSIM and highD that are widely adopted in trajectory prediction. The result demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposal.</description>

      <title>Scene Modeling of Autonomous Vehicles Avoiding Stationary and Moving Vehicles on Narrow Roads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Navigating narrow roads with oncoming vehicles is a significant challenge that has garnered considerable public interest. These scenarios often involve sections that cannot accommodate two moving vehicles simultaneously due to the presence of stationary vehicles or limited road width. Autonomous vehicles must therefore profoundly comprehend their surroundings to identify passable areas and execute sophisticated maneuvers. To address this issue, this paper presents a comprehensive model for such an intricate scenario. The primary contribution is the principle of road width occupancy minimization, which models the narrow road problem and identifies candidate meeting gaps. Additionally, the concept of homology classes is introduced to help initialize and optimize candidate trajectories, while evaluation strategies are developed to select the optimal gap and most efficient trajectory. Qualitative and quantitative simulations demonstrate that the proposed approach, SM-NR, achieves high scene pass rates, efficient movement, and robust decisions. Experiments conducted in tiny gap scenarios and conflict scenarios reveal that the autonomous vehicle can robustly select meeting gaps and trajectories, compromising flexibly for safety while advancing bravely for efficiency.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Motion Planning For Differential Drive Robots Through Stationary State Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-Agent Motion Planning (MAMP) finds various applications in fields such as traffic management, airport operations, and warehouse automation. In many of these environments, differential drive robots are commonly used. These robots have a kinodynamic model that allows only in-place rotation and movement along their current orientation, subject to speed and acceleration limits. However, existing Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF)-based methods often use simplified models for robot kinodynamics, which limits their practicality and realism. In this paper, we introduce a three-level framework called MASS to address these challenges. MASS combines MAPF-based methods with our proposed stationary state search planner to generate high-quality kinodynamically-feasible plans. We further extend MASS using an adaptive window mechanism to address the lifelong MAMP problem. Empirically, we tested our methods on the single-shot grid map domain and the lifelong warehouse domain. Our method shows up to 400% improvements in terms of throughput compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Exploring Transformer-Augmented LSTM for Temporal and Spatial Feature Learning in Trajectory Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate vehicle trajectory prediction is crucial for ensuring safe and efficient autonomous driving. This work explores the integration of Transformer based model with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based technique to enhance spatial and temporal feature learning in vehicle trajectory prediction. Here, a hybrid model that combines LSTMs for temporal encoding with a Transformer encoder for capturing complex interactions between vehicles is proposed. Spatial trajectory features of the neighboring vehicles are processed and goes through a masked scatter mechanism in a grid based environment, which is then combined with temporal trajectory of the vehicles. This combined trajectory data are learned by sequential LSTM encoding and Transformer based attention layers. The proposed model is benchmarked against predecessor LSTM based methods, including STA-LSTM, SA-LSTM, CS-LSTM, and NaiveLSTM. Our results, while not outperforming it's predecessor, demonstrate the potential of integrating Transformers with LSTM based technique to build interpretable trajectory prediction model. Future work will explore alternative architectures using Transformer applications to further enhance performance. This study provides a promising direction for improving trajectory prediction models by leveraging transformer based architectures, paving the way for more robust and interpretable vehicle trajectory prediction system.</description>

      <title>Planning Human-Robot Co-manipulation with Human Motor Control Objectives and Multi-component Reaching Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For successful goal-directed human-robot interaction, the robot should adapt to the intentions and actions of the collaborating human. This can be supported by musculoskeletal or data-driven human models, where the former are limited to lower-level functioning such as ergonomics, and the latter have limited generalizability or data efficiency. What is missing, is the inclusion of human motor control models that can provide generalizable human behavior estimates and integrate into robot planning methods. We use well-studied models from human motor control based on the speed-accuracy and cost-benefit trade-offs to plan collaborative robot motions. In these models, the human trajectory minimizes an objective function, a formulation we adapt to numerical trajectory optimization. This can then be extended with constraints and new variables to realize collaborative motion planning and goal estimation. We deploy this model, as well as a multi-component movement strategy, in physical collaboration with uncertain goal-reaching and synchronized motion tasks, showing the ability of the approach to produce human-like trajectories over a range of conditions.</description>

      <title>Efficient Language-instructed Skill Acquisition via Reward-Policy Co-Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to autonomously explore and resolve tasks with minimal human guidance is crucial for the self-development of embodied intelligence. Although reinforcement learning methods can largely ease human effort, it's challenging to design reward functions for real-world tasks, especially for high-dimensional robotic control, due to complex relationships among joints and tasks. Recent advancements large language models (LLMs) enable automatic reward function design. However, approaches evaluate reward functions by re-training policies from scratch placing an undue burden on the reward function, expecting it to be effective throughout the whole policy improvement process. We argue for a more practical strategy in robotic autonomy, focusing on refining existing policies with policy-dependent reward functions rather than a universal one. To this end, we propose a novel reward-policy co-evolution framework where the reward function and the learned policy benefit from each other's progressive on-the-fly improvements, resulting in more efficient and higher-performing skill acquisition. Specifically, the reward evolution process translates the robot's previous best reward function, descriptions of tasks and environment into text inputs. These inputs are used to query LLMs to generate a dynamic amount of reward function candidates, ensuring continuous improvement at each round of evolution. For policy evolution, our method generates new policy populations by hybridizing historically optimal and random policies. Through an improved Bayesian optimization, our approach efficiently and robustly identifies the most capable and plastic reward-policy combination, which then proceeds to the next round of co-evolution. Despite using less data, our approach demonstrates an average normalized improvement of 95.3% across various high-dimensional robotic skill learning tasks.</description>

      <title>TelePhantom: A User-Friendly Teleoperation System with Virtual Assistance for Enhanced Effectiveness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dexterous manipulation is a critical area of robotics. In this field, teleoperation faces three key challenges: user-friendliness for novices, safety assurance, and transferability across different platforms. While collecting real robot dexterous manipulation data by teleoperation to train robots has shown impressive results on diverse tasks, due to the morphological differences between human and robot hands, it is not only hard for new users to understand the action mapping but also raises potential safety concerns during operation. To address these limitations, we introduce TelePhantom. This teleoperation system offers real-time visual feedback on robot actions based on human user inputs, with a total hardware cost of less than $1,000. TelePhantom allows the user to see a virtual robot that represents the outcome of the user's next movement. By enabling flexible switching between command visualization and actual execution, this system helps new users learn how to demonstrate quickly and safely. We demonstrate its superiority over other teleoperation systems across five tasks, emphasize its ease of use, and highlight its ease of deployment across diverse input sensors and robotic platforms. We will release our code and a deployment document on our website: https://telephantom.github.io/.</description>

      <title>NPC: Neural Predictive Control for Fuel-Efficient Autonomous Trucks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fuel efficiency is a crucial aspect of long-distance cargo transportation by oil-powered trucks that economize on costs and decrease carbon emissions. Current predictive control methods depend on an accurate model of vehicle dynamics and engine, including weight, drag coefficient, and the Brake-specific Fuel Consumption (BSFC) map of the engine. We propose a pure data-driven method, Neural Predictive Control (NPC), which does not use any physical model for the vehicle. After training with over 20,000 km of historical data, the novel proposed NVFormer implicitly models the relationship between vehicle dynamics, road slope, fuel consumption, and control commands using the attention mechanism. Based on the online sampled primitives from the past of the current freight trip and anchor-based future data synthesis, the NVFormer can infer optimal control command for reasonable fuel consumption. The physical model-free NPC outperforms the base PCC method with 2.41% and 3.45% more significant fuel saving in simulation and open-road highway testing, respectively.</description>

      <title>Learning Quadrupedal Robot Locomotion for Narrow Pipe Inspection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Various pipes are extensively used in both industrial settings and daily life, but the pipe inspection especially those with narrow sizes are still very challenging with tremendous time and manufacturing consumed. Quadrupedal robots, inspired from patrol dogs, can be a substitution of traditional solutions but always suffer from navigation and locomotion difficulties. In this paper, we introduce a Reinforcement Learning (RL) based method to train a policy enabling the quadrupedal robots to cross narrow pipes adaptively. A new privileged visual information and a new reward function are defined to tackle the problems. Experiments on both simulation and real world scenarios were completed, demonstrated that the proposed method can achieve the pipe-crossing task even with unexpected obstacles inside.</description>

      <title>Policy Decorator: Model-Agnostic Online Refinement for Large Policy Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in robot learning have used imitation learning with large models and extensive demonstrations to develop effective policies. However, these models are often limited by the quantity, quality, and diversity of demonstrations. This paper explores improving offline-trained imitation learning models through online interactions with the environment. We introduce Policy Decorator, which uses a model-agnostic residual policy to refine large imitation learning models during online interactions. By implementing controlled exploration strategies, Policy Decorator enables stable, sample-efficient online learning. Our evaluation spans eight tasks across two benchmarks-ManiSkill and Adroit-and involves two state-of-the-art imitation learning models (Behavior Transformer and Diffusion Policy). The results show Policy Decorator effectively improves the offline-trained policies and preserves the smooth motion of imitation learning models, avoiding the erratic behaviors of pure RL policies. See our project page (https://policydecorator.github.io) for videos.</description>

      <title>A Constraint Embedding Approach for Dynamics Modeling of Parallel Kinematic Manipulators with Hybrid Limbs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parallel kinematic manipulators (PKM) are characterized by closed kinematic loops, due to the parallel arrangement of limbs but also due to the existence of kinematic loops within the limbs. Moreover, many PKM are built with limbs constructed by serially combining kinematic loops. Such limbs are called hybrid, which form a particular class of complex limbs. Design and model-based control requires accurate dynamic PKM models desirably without model simplifications. Dynamics modeling then necessitates kinematic relations of all members of the PKM, in contrast to the standard kinematics modeling of PKM, where only the forward and inverse kinematics solution for the manipulator (relating input and output motions) are computed. This becomes more involved for PKM with hybrid limbs. In this paper a modular modeling approach is employed, where limbs are treated separately, and the individual dynamic equations of motions (EOM) are subsequently assembled to the overall model. Key to the kinematic modeling is the constraint resolution for the individual loops within the limbs. This local constraint resolution is a special case of the general \emph{constraint embedding} technique. The proposed method finally allows for a systematic modeling of general PKM. The method is demonstrated for the IRSBot-2, where each limb comprises two independent loops.</description>

      <title>4D Radar-Inertial Odometry based on Gaussian Modeling and Multi-Hypothesis Scan Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 4D millimeter-wave (mmWave) radars are sensors that provide robustness against adverse weather conditions (rain, snow, fog, etc.), and as such they are increasingly being used for odometry and SLAM applications. However, the noisy and sparse nature of the returned scan data proves to be a challenging obstacle for existing point cloud matching based solutions, especially those originally intended for more accurate sensors such as LiDAR. Inspired by visual odometry research around 3D Gaussian Splatting, in this paper we propose using freely positioned 3D Gaussians to create a summarized representation of a radar point cloud tolerant to sensor noise, and subsequently leverage its inherent probability distribution function for registration (similar to NDT). Moreover, we propose simultaneously optimizing multiple scan matching hypotheses in order to further increase the robustness of the system against local optima of the function. Finally, we fuse our Gaussian modeling and scan matching algorithms into an EKF radar-inertial odometry system designed after current best practices. Experiments show that our Gaussian-based odometry is able to outperform current baselines on a well-known 4D radar dataset used for evaluation.</description>

      <title>Learning to Control an Android Robot Head for Facial Animation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to display rich facial expressions is crucial for human-like robotic heads. While manually defining such expressions is intricate, there already exist approaches to automatically learn them. In this work one such approach is applied to evaluate and control a robot head different from the one in the original study. To improve the mapping of facial expressions from human actors onto a robot head, it is proposed to use 3D landmarks and their pairwise distances as input to the learning algorithm instead of the previously used facial action units. Participants of an online survey preferred mappings from our proposed approach in most cases, though there are still further improvements required.</description>

      <title>A Skeleton-Based Topological Planner for Exploration in Complex Unknown Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The capability of autonomous exploration in complex, unknown environments is important in many robotic applications. While recent research on autonomous exploration have achieved much progress, there are still limitations, e.g., existing methods relying on greedy heuristics or optimal path planning are often hindered by repetitive paths and high computational demands. To address such limitations, we propose a novel exploration framework that utilizes the global topology information of observed environment to improve exploration efficiency while reducing computational overhead. Specifically, global information is utilized based on a skeletal topological graph representation of the environment geometry. We first propose an incremental skeleton extraction method based on wavefront propagation, based on which we then design an approach to generate a lightweight topological graph that can effectively capture the environment's structural characteristics. Building upon this, we introduce a finite state machine that leverages the topological structure to efficiently plan coverage paths, which can substantially mitigate the back-and-forth maneuvers (BFMs) problem. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method in comparison with state-of-the-art methods. The source code will be made publicly available at: \url{https://github.com/Haochen-Niu/STGPlanner}.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Parallel Manipulators with Hybrid Complex Limbs -- Modular Modeling and Parallel Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parallel manipulators, also called parallel kinematics machines (PKM), enable robotic solutions for highly dynamic handling and machining applications. The safe and accurate design and control necessitates high-fidelity dynamics models. Such modeling approaches have already been presented for PKM with simple limbs (i.e. each limb is a serial kinematic chain). A systematic modeling approach for PKM with complex limbs (i.e. limbs that possess kinematic loops) was not yet proposed despite the fact that many successful PKM comprise complex limbs. This paper presents a systematic modular approach to the kinematics and dynamics modeling of PKM with complex limbs that are built as serial arrangement of closed loops. The latter are referred to as hybrid limbs, and can be found in almost all PKM with complex limbs, such as the Delta robot. The proposed method generalizes the formulation for PKM with simple limbs by means of local resolution of loop constraints, which is known as constraint embedding in multibody dynamics. The constituent elements of the method are the kinematic and dynamic equations of motions (EOM), and the inverse kinematics solution of the limbs, i.e. the relation of platform motion and the motion of the limbs. While the approach is conceptually independent of the used kinematics and dynamics formulation, a Lie group formulation is employed for deriving the EOM. The frame invariance of the Lie group formulation is used for devising a modular modeling method where the EOM of a representative limb are used to derived the EOM of the limbs of a particular PKM. The PKM topology is exploited in a parallel computation scheme that shall allow for computationally efficient distributed evaluation of the overall EOM of the PKM. Finally, the method is applied to the IRSBot-2 and a 3\underline{R}R[2RR]R Delta robot, which is presented in detail.</description>

      <title>Unified Understanding of Environment, Task, and Human for Human-Robot Interaction in Real-World Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To facilitate human--robot interaction (HRI) tasks in real-world scenarios, service robots must adapt to dynamic environments and understand the required tasks while effectively communicating with humans. To accomplish HRI in practice, we propose a novel indoor dynamic map, task understanding system, and response generation system. The indoor dynamic map optimizes robot behavior by managing an occupancy grid map and dynamic information, such as furniture and humans, in separate layers. The task understanding system targets tasks that require multiple actions, such as serving ordered items. Task representations that predefine the flow of necessary actions are applied to achieve highly accurate understanding. The response generation system is executed in parallel with task understanding to facilitate smooth HRI by informing humans of the subsequent actions of the robot. In this study, we focused on waiter duties in a restaurant setting as a representative application of HRI in a dynamic environment. We developed an HRI system that could perform tasks such as serving food and cleaning up while communicating with customers. In experiments conducted in a simulated restaurant environment, the proposed HRI system successfully communicated with customers and served ordered food with 90\% accuracy. In a questionnaire administered after the experiment, the HRI system of the robot received 4.2 points out of 5. These outcomes indicated the effectiveness of the proposed method and HRI system in executing waiter tasks in real-world environments.</description>

      <title>TH\"OR-MAGNI Act: Actions for Human Motion Modeling in Robot-Shared Industrial Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate human activity and trajectory prediction are crucial for ensuring safe and reliable human-robot interactions in dynamic environments, such as industrial settings, with mobile robots. Datasets with fine-grained action labels for moving people in industrial environments with mobile robots are scarce, as most existing datasets focus on social navigation in public spaces. This paper introduces the TH\"OR-MAGNI Act dataset, a substantial extension of the TH\"OR-MAGNI dataset, which captures participant movements alongside robots in diverse semantic and spatial contexts. TH\"OR-MAGNI Act provides 8.3 hours of manually labeled participant actions derived from egocentric videos recorded via eye-tracking glasses. These actions, aligned with the provided TH\"OR-MAGNI motion cues, follow a long-tailed distribution with diversified acceleration, velocity, and navigation distance profiles. We demonstrate the utility of TH\"OR-MAGNI Act for two tasks: action-conditioned trajectory prediction and joint action and trajectory prediction. We propose two efficient transformer-based models that outperform the baselines to address these tasks. These results underscore the potential of TH\"OR-MAGNI Act to develop predictive models for enhanced human-robot interaction in complex environments.</description>

      <title>Immersive Human-in-the-Loop Control: Real-Time 3D Surface Meshing and Physics Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces the TactiMesh Teleoperator Interface (TTI), a novel predictive visual and haptic system designed explicitly for human-in-the-loop robot control using a head-mounted display (HMD). By employing simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM)in tandem with a space carving method (CARV), TTI creates a real time 3D surface mesh of remote environments from an RGB camera mounted on a Barrett WAM arm. The generated mesh is integrated into a physics simulator, featuring a digital twin of the WAM robot arm to create a virtual environment. In this virtual environment, TTI provides haptic feedback directly in response to the operator's movements, eliminating the problem with delayed response from the haptic follower robot. Furthermore, texturing the 3D mesh with keyframes from SLAM allows the operator to control the viewpoint of their Head Mounted Display (HMD) independently of the arm-mounted robot camera, giving a better visual immersion and improving manipulation speed. Incorporating predictive visual and haptic feedback significantly improves teleoperation in applications such as search and rescue, inspection, and remote maintenance.</description>

      <title>Designing an LLM-Based Copilot for Manufacturing Equipment Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective decision-making in automation equipment selection is critical for reducing ramp-up time and maintaining production quality, especially in the face of increasing product variation and market demands. However, limited expertise and resource constraints often result in inefficiencies during the ramp-up phase when new products are integrated into production lines. Existing methods often lack structured and tailored solutions to support automation engineers in reducing ramp-up time, leading to compromises in quality. This research investigates whether large-language models (LLMs), combined with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), can assist in streamlining equipment selection in ramp-up planning. We propose a factual-driven copilot integrating LLMs with structured and semi-structured knowledge retrieval for three component types (robots, feeders and vision systems), providing a guided and traceable state-machine process for decision-making in automation equipment selection. The system was demonstrated to an industrial partner, who tested it on three internal use-cases. Their feedback affirmed its capability to provide logical and actionable recommendations for automation equipment. More specifically, among 22 equipment prompts analyzed, 19 involved selecting the correct equipment while considering most requirements, and in 6 cases, all requirements were fully met.</description>

      <title>UA-MPC: Uncertainty-Aware Model Predictive Control for Motorized LiDAR Odometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate and comprehensive 3D sensing using LiDAR systems is crucial for various applications in photogrammetry and robotics, including facility inspection, Building Information Modeling (BIM), and robot navigation. Motorized LiDAR systems can expand the Field of View (FoV) without adding multiple scanners, but existing motorized LiDAR systems often rely on constant-speed motor control, leading to suboptimal performance in complex environments. To address this, we propose UA-MPC, an uncertainty-aware motor control strategy that balances scanning accuracy and efficiency. By predicting discrete observabilities of LiDAR Odometry (LO) through ray tracing and modeling their distribution with a surrogate function, UA-MPC efficiently optimizes motor speed control according to different scenes. Additionally, we develop a ROS-based realistic simulation environment for motorized LiDAR systems, enabling the evaluation of control strategies across diverse scenarios. Extensive experiments, conducted on both simulated and real-world scenarios, demonstrate that our method significantly improves odometry accuracy while preserving the scanning efficiency of motorized LiDAR systems. Specifically, it achieves over a 60\% reduction in positioning error with less than a 2\% decrease in efficiency compared to constant-speed control, offering a smarter and more effective solution for active 3D sensing tasks. The simulation environment for control motorized LiDAR is open-sourced at: \url{https://github.com/kafeiyin00/UA-MPC.git}.</description>

      <title>RoboMIND: Benchmark on Multi-embodiment Intelligence Normative Data for Robot Manipulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing robust and general-purpose robotic manipulation policies is a key goal in the field of robotics. To achieve effective generalization, it is essential to construct comprehensive datasets that encompass a large number of demonstration trajectories and diverse tasks. Unlike vision or language data that can be collected from the Internet, robotic datasets require detailed observations and manipulation actions, necessitating significant investment in hardware-software infrastructure and human labor. While existing works have focused on assembling various individual robot datasets, there remains a lack of a unified data collection standard and insufficient diversity in tasks, scenarios, and robot types. In this paper, we introduce RoboMIND (Multi-embodiment Intelligence Normative Data for Robot manipulation), featuring 55k real-world demonstration trajectories across 279 diverse tasks involving 61 different object classes. RoboMIND is collected through human teleoperation and encompasses comprehensive robotic-related information, including multi-view RGB-D images, proprioceptive robot state information, end effector details, and linguistic task descriptions. To ensure dataset consistency and reliability during policy learning, RoboMIND is built on a unified data collection platform and standardized protocol, covering four distinct robotic embodiments. We provide a thorough quantitative and qualitative analysis of RoboMIND across multiple dimensions, offering detailed insights into the diversity of our datasets. In our experiments, we conduct extensive real-world testing with four state-of-the-art imitation learning methods, demonstrating that training with RoboMIND data results in a high manipulation success rate and strong generalization.

      <description>arXiv:2412.13912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To support future spatial machine intelligence applications, lifelong simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) has drawn significant attentions. SLAM is usually realized based on various types of mobile robots performing simultaneous and continuous sensing and communication. This paper focuses on analyzing the energy efficiency of robot operation for lifelong SLAM by jointly considering sensing, communication and mechanical factors. The system model is built based on a robot equipped with a 2D light detection and ranging (LiDAR) and an odometry. The cloud point raw data as well as the odometry data are wirelessly transmitted to data center where real-time map reconstruction is realized based on an unsupervised deep learning based method. The sensing duration, transmit power, transmit duration and exploration speed are jointly optimized to minimize the energy consumption. Simulations and experiments demonstrate the performance of our proposed method.</description>

      <title>Towards Generalist Robot Policies: What Matters in Building Vision-Language-Action Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundation Vision Language Models (VLMs) exhibit strong capabilities in multi-modal representation learning, comprehension, and reasoning. By injecting action components into the VLMs, Vision-Language-Action Models (VLAs) can be naturally formed and also show promising performance. Existing work has demonstrated the effectiveness and generalization of VLAs in multiple scenarios and tasks. Nevertheless, the transfer from VLMs to VLAs is not trivial since existing VLAs differ in their backbones, action-prediction formulations, data distributions, and training recipes. This leads to a missing piece for a systematic understanding of the design choices of VLAs. In this work, we disclose the key factors that significantly influence the performance of VLA and focus on answering three essential design choices: which backbone to select, how to formulate the VLA architectures, and when to add cross-embodiment data. The obtained results convince us firmly to explain why we need VLA and develop a new family of VLAs, RoboVLMs, which require very few manual designs and achieve a new state-of-the-art performance in three simulation tasks and real-world experiments. Through our extensive experiments, which include over 8 VLM backbones, 4 policy architectures, and over 600 distinct designed experiments, we provide a detailed guidebook for the future design of VLAs. In addition to the study, the highly flexible RoboVLMs framework, which supports easy integrations of new VLMs and free combinations of various design choices, is made public to facilitate future research. We open-source all details, including codes, models, datasets, and toolkits, along with detailed training and evaluation recipes at: robovlms.github.io.</description>

      <title>Learning from Massive Human Videos for Universal Humanoid Pose Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scalable learning of humanoid robots is crucial for their deployment in real-world applications. While traditional approaches primarily rely on reinforcement learning or teleoperation to achieve whole-body control, they are often limited by the diversity of simulated environments and the high costs of demonstration collection. In contrast, human videos are ubiquitous and present an untapped source of semantic and motion information that could significantly enhance the generalization capabilities of humanoid robots. This paper introduces Humanoid-X, a large-scale dataset of over 20 million humanoid robot poses with corresponding text-based motion descriptions, designed to leverage this abundant data. Humanoid-X is curated through a comprehensive pipeline: data mining from the Internet, video caption generation, motion retargeting of humans to humanoid robots, and policy learning for real-world deployment. With Humanoid-X, we further train a large humanoid model, UH-1, which takes text instructions as input and outputs corresponding actions to control a humanoid robot. Extensive simulated and real-world experiments validate that our scalable training approach leads to superior generalization in text-based humanoid control, marking a significant step toward adaptable, real-world-ready humanoid robots.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in autonomous vehicles (AVs) use Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform well in normal driving scenarios. However, ensuring safety in dynamic, high-risk environments and managing safety-critical long-tail events remain significant challenges. To address these issues, we propose SafeDrive, a knowledge- and data-driven risk-sensitive decision-making framework to enhance AV safety and adaptability. The proposed framework introduces a modular system comprising: (1) a Risk Module for quantifying multi-factor coupled risks involving driver, vehicle, and road interactions; (2) a Memory Module for storing and retrieving typical scenarios to improve adaptability; (3) a LLM-powered Reasoning Module for context-aware safety decision-making; and (4) a Reflection Module for refining decisions through iterative learning. By integrating knowledge-driven insights with adaptive learning mechanisms, the framework ensures robust decision-making under uncertain conditions. Extensive evaluations on real-world traffic datasets, including highways (HighD), intersections (InD), and roundabouts (RounD), validate the framework's ability to enhance decision-making safety (achieving a 100% safety rate), replicate human-like driving behaviors (with decision alignment exceeding 85%), and adapt effectively to unpredictable scenarios. SafeDrive establishes a novel paradigm for integrating knowledge- and data-driven methods, highlighting significant potential to improve safety and adaptability of autonomous driving in high-risk traffic scenarios.</description>

      <title>When Should We Prefer State-to-Visual DAgger Over Visual Reinforcement Learning?</title>

Abstract: Learning policies from high-dimensional visual inputs, such as pixels and point clouds, is crucial in various applications. Visual reinforcement learning is a promising approach that directly trains policies from visual observations, although it faces challenges in sample efficiency and computational costs. This study conducts an empirical comparison of State-to-Visual DAgger, a two-stage framework that initially trains a state policy before adopting online imitation to learn a visual policy, and Visual RL across a diverse set of tasks. We evaluate both methods across 16 tasks from three benchmarks, focusing on their asymptotic performance, sample efficiency, and computational costs. Surprisingly, our findings reveal that State-to-Visual DAgger does not universally outperform Visual RL but shows significant advantages in challenging tasks, offering more consistent performance. In contrast, its benefits in sample efficiency are less pronounced, although it often reduces the overall wall-clock time required for training. Based on our findings, we provide recommendations for practitioners and hope that our results contribute valuable perspectives for future research in visual policy learning.</description>

      <title>Heuristic Planner for Communication-Constrained Multi-Agent Multi-Goal Path Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In robotics, coordinating a group of robots is an essential task. This work presents the communication-constrained multi-agent multi-goal path planning problem and proposes a graph-search based algorithm to address this task. Given a fleet of robots, an environment represented by a weighted graph, and a sequence of goals, the aim is to visit all the goals without breaking the communication constraints between the agents, minimizing the completion time. The resulting paths produced by our approach show how the agents can coordinate their individual paths, not only with respect to the next goal but also with respect to all future goals, all the time keeping the communication within the fleet intact.</description>

      <title>SimADFuzz: Simulation-Feedback Fuzz Testing for Autonomous Driving Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous driving systems (ADS) have achieved remarkable progress in recent years. However, ensuring their safety and reliability remains a critical challenge due to the complexity and uncertainty of driving scenarios. In this paper, we focus on simulation testing for ADS, where generating diverse and effective testing scenarios is a central task. Existing fuzz testing methods face limitations, such as overlooking the temporal and spatial dynamics of scenarios and failing to leverage simulation feedback (e.g., speed, acceleration and heading) to guide scenario selection and mutation. To address these issues, we propose SimADFuzz, a novel framework designed to generate high-quality scenarios that reveal violations in ADS behavior. Specifically, SimADFuzz employs violation prediction models, which evaluate the likelihood of ADS violations, to optimize scenario selection. Moreover, SimADFuzz proposes distance-guided mutation strategies to enhance interactions among vehicles in offspring scenarios, thereby triggering more edge-case behaviors of vehicles. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that SimADFuzz outperforms state-of-the-art fuzzers by identifying 32 more unique violations, including 4 reproducible cases of vehicle-vehicle and vehicle-pedestrian collisions. These results demonstrate SimADFuzz's effectiveness in enhancing the robustness and safety of autonomous driving systems.</description>

      <title>CAD-Assistant: Tool-Augmented VLLMs as Generic CAD Task Solvers?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose CAD-Assistant, a general-purpose CAD agent for AI-assisted design. Our approach is based on a powerful Vision and Large Language Model (VLLM) as a planner and a tool-augmentation paradigm using CAD-specific modules. CAD-Assistant addresses multimodal user queries by generating actions that are iteratively executed on a Python interpreter equipped with the FreeCAD software, accessed via its Python API. Our framework is able to assess the impact of generated CAD commands on geometry and adapts subsequent actions based on the evolving state of the CAD design. We consider a wide range of CAD-specific tools including Python libraries, modules of the FreeCAD Python API, helpful routines, rendering functions and other specialized modules. We evaluate our method on multiple CAD benchmarks and qualitatively demonstrate the potential of tool-augmented VLLMs as generic CAD task solvers across diverse CAD workflows.</description>

      <title>SurgSora: Decoupled RGBD-Flow Diffusion Model for Controllable Surgical Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Medical video generation has transformative potential for enhancing surgical understanding and pathology insights through precise and controllable visual representations. However, current models face limitations in controllability and authenticity. To bridge this gap, we propose SurgSora, a motion-controllable surgical video generation framework that uses a single input frame and user-controllable motion cues. SurgSora consists of three key modules: the Dual Semantic Injector (DSI), which extracts object-relevant RGB and depth features from the input frame and integrates them with segmentation cues to capture detailed spatial features of complex anatomical structures; the Decoupled Flow Mapper (DFM), which fuses optical flow with semantic-RGB-D features at multiple scales to enhance temporal understanding and object spatial dynamics; and the Trajectory Controller (TC), which allows users to specify motion directions and estimates sparse optical flow, guiding the video generation process. The fused features are used as conditions for a frozen Stable Diffusion model to produce realistic, temporally coherent surgical videos. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that SurgSora outperforms state-of-the-art methods in controllability and authenticity, showing its potential to advance surgical video generation for medical education, training, and research.</description>

      <title>Joint Perception and Prediction for Autonomous Driving: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Perception and prediction modules are critical components of autonomous driving systems, enabling vehicles to navigate safely through complex environments. The perception module is responsible for perceiving the environment, including static and dynamic objects, while the prediction module is responsible for predicting the future behavior of these objects. These modules are typically divided into three tasks: object detection, object tracking, and motion prediction. Traditionally, these tasks are developed and optimized independently, with outputs passed sequentially from one to the next. However, this approach has significant limitations: computational resources are not shared across tasks, the lack of joint optimization can amplify errors as they propagate throughout the pipeline, and uncertainty is rarely propagated between modules, resulting in significant information loss. To address these challenges, the joint perception and prediction paradigm has emerged, integrating perception and prediction into a unified model through multi-task learning. This strategy not only overcomes the limitations of previous methods, but also enables the three tasks to have direct access to raw sensor data, allowing richer and more nuanced environmental interpretations. This paper presents the first comprehensive survey of joint perception and prediction for autonomous driving. We propose a taxonomy that categorizes approaches based on input representation, scene context modeling, and output representation, highlighting their contributions and limitations. Additionally, we present a qualitative analysis and quantitative comparison of existing methods. Finally, we discuss future research directions based on identified gaps in the state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>Event-based Photometric Bundle Adjustment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We tackle the problem of bundle adjustment (i.e., simultaneous refinement of camera poses and scene map) for a purely rotating event camera. Starting from first principles, we formulate the problem as a classical non-linear least squares optimization. The photometric error is defined using the event generation model directly in the camera rotations and the semi-dense scene brightness that triggers the events. We leverage the sparsity of event data to design a tractable Levenberg-Marquardt solver that handles the very large number of variables involved. To the best of our knowledge, our method, which we call Event-based Photometric Bundle Adjustment (EPBA), is the first event-only photometric bundle adjustment method that works on the brightness map directly and exploits the space-time characteristics of event data, without having to convert events into image-like representations. Comprehensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate EPBA's effectiveness in decreasing the photometric error (by up to 90%), yielding results of unparalleled quality. The refined maps reveal details that were hidden using prior state-of-the-art rotation-only estimation methods. The experiments on modern high-resolution event cameras show the applicability of EPBA to panoramic imaging in various scenarios (without map initialization, at multiple resolutions, and in combination with other methods, such as IMU dead reckoning or previous event-based rotation estimation methods). We make the source code publicly available. https://github.com/tub-rip/epba</description>

      <title>Attention-driven Next-best-view Planning for Efficient Reconstruction of Plants and Targeted Plant Parts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.10274v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Robots in tomato greenhouses need to perceive the plant and plant parts accurately to automate monitoring, harvesting, and de-leafing tasks. Existing perception systems struggle with the high levels of occlusion in plants and often result in poor perception accuracy. One reason for this is because they use fixed cameras or predefined camera movements. Next-best-view (NBV) planning presents an alternate approach, in which the camera viewpoints are reasoned and strategically planned such that the perception accuracy is improved. However, existing NBV-planning algorithms are agnostic to the task-at-hand and give equal importance to all the plant parts. This strategy is inefficient for greenhouse tasks that require targeted perception of specific plant parts, such as the perception of leaf nodes for de-leafing. To improve targeted perception in complex greenhouse environments, NBV planning algorithms need an attention mechanism to focus on the task-relevant plant parts. In this paper, the role of attention in improving targeted perception using an attention-driven NBV planning strategy was investigated. Through simulation experiments using plants with high levels of occlusion and structural complexity, it was shown that focusing attention on task-relevant plant parts can significantly improve the speed and accuracy of 3D reconstruction. Further, with real-world experiments, it was shown that these benefits extend to complex greenhouse conditions with natural variation and occlusion, natural illumination, sensor noise, and uncertainty in camera poses. The results clearly indicate that using attention-driven NBV planning in greenhouses can significantly improve the efficiency of perception and enhance the performance of robotic systems in greenhouse crop production.</description>

      <title>Semantics-Aware Next-best-view Planning for Efficient Search and Detection of Task-relevant Plant Parts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.09801v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Searching and detecting the task-relevant parts of plants is important to automate harvesting and de-leafing of tomato plants using robots. This is challenging due to high levels of occlusion in tomato plants. Active vision is a promising approach in which the robot strategically plans its camera viewpoints to overcome occlusion and improve perception accuracy. However, current active-vision algorithms cannot differentiate between relevant and irrelevant plant parts and spend time on perceiving irrelevant plant parts. This work proposed a semantics-aware active-vision strategy that uses semantic information to identify the relevant plant parts and prioritise them during view planning. The proposed strategy was evaluated on the task of searching and detecting the relevant plant parts using simulation and real-world experiments. In simulation experiments, the semantics-aware strategy proposed could search and detect 81.8% of the relevant plant parts using nine viewpoints. It was significantly faster and detected more plant parts than predefined, random, and volumetric active-vision strategies that do not use semantic information. The strategy proposed was also robust to uncertainty in plant and plant-part positions, plant complexity, and different viewpoint-sampling strategies. In real-world experiments, the semantics-aware strategy could search and detect 82.7% of the relevant plant parts using seven viewpoints, under complex greenhouse conditions with natural variation and occlusion, natural illumination, sensor noise, and uncertainty in camera poses. The results of this work clearly indicate the advantage of using semantics-aware active vision for targeted perception of plant parts and its applicability in the real world. It can significantly improve the efficiency of automated harvesting and de-leafing in tomato crop production.</description>

      <title>MOT-DETR: 3D Single Shot Detection and Tracking with Transformers to build 3D representations for Agro-Food Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15674v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the current demand for automation in the agro-food industry, accurately detecting and localizing relevant objects in 3D is essential for successful robotic operations. However, this is a challenge due the presence of occlusions. Multi-view perception approaches allow robots to overcome occlusions, but a tracking component is needed to associate the objects detected by the robot over multiple viewpoints. Most multi-object tracking (MOT) algorithms are designed for high frame rate sequences and struggle with the occlusions generated by robots' motions and 3D environments. In this paper, we introduce MOT-DETR, a novel approach to detect and track objects in 3D over time using a combination of convolutional networks and transformers. Our method processes 2D and 3D data, and employs a transformer architecture to perform data fusion. We show that MOT-DETR outperforms state-of-the-art multi-object tracking methods. Furthermore, we prove that MOT-DETR can leverage 3D data to deal with long-term occlusions and large frame-to-frame distances better than state-of-the-art methods. Finally, we show how our method is resilient to camera pose noise that can affect the accuracy of point clouds. The implementation of MOT-DETR can be found here: https://github.com/drapado/mot-detr</description>

      <title>Deep hybrid models: infer and plan in a dynamic world</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10088v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In order to determine an optimal plan for a complex task, one often deals with dynamic and hierarchical relationships between several entities. Traditionally, such problems are tackled with optimal control, which relies on the optimization of cost functions; instead, a recent biologically-motivated proposal casts planning and control as an inference process. Active inference assumes that action and perception are two complementary aspects of life whereby the role of the former is to fulfill the predictions inferred by the latter. In this study, we present a solution, based on active inference, for complex control tasks. The proposed architecture exploits hybrid (discrete and continuous) processing, and it is based on three features: the representation of potential body configurations related to the objects of interest; the use of hierarchical relationships that enable the agent to flexibly expand its body schema for tool use; the definition of potential trajectories related to the agent's intentions, used to infer and plan with dynamic elements at different temporal scales. We evaluate this deep hybrid model on a habitual task: reaching a moving object after having picked a moving tool. We show that the model can tackle the presented task under different conditions. This study extends past work on planning as inference and advances an alternative direction to optimal control.</description>

      <title>Multi-Robot Task Allocation using Global Games with Negative Feedback: The Colony Maintenance Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15621v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we address the multi-robot task allocation problem, where robots must cooperatively assign themselves to accomplish a set of tasks. We consider the colony maintenance problem as an example, where a team of robots are tasked with continuously maintaining the energy supply of a central colony. We model this as a global game, where each robot measures the energy level of the colony, and the current number of assigned robots, to determine whether or not to forage for energy sources. The key to our approach is introducing a negative feedback term into the robots' utility, which also eliminates the trivial solution where foraging or not foraging are strictly dominant strategies. We compare our approach qualitatively to existing an global games approach, where a positive positive feedback term admits threshold-based decision making that encourages many robots to forage. We discuss how positive feedback can lead to a cascading failure when robots are removed from the system, and we demonstrate the resilience of our approach in simulation.</description>

      <title>FFHFlow: A Flow-based Variational Approach for Learning Diverse Dexterous Grasps with Shape-Aware Introspection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15161v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Synthesizing diverse dexterous grasps from uncertain partial observation is an important yet challenging task for physically intelligent embodiments. Previous works on generative grasp synthesis fell short of precisely capturing the complex grasp distribution and reasoning about shape uncertainty in the unstructured and often partially perceived reality. In this work, we introduce a novel model that can generate diverse grasps for a multi-fingered hand while introspectively handling perceptual uncertainty and recognizing unknown object geometry to avoid performance degradation. Specifically, we devise a Deep Latent Variable Model (DLVM) based on Normalizing Flows (NFs), facilitating hierarchical and expressive latent representation for modeling versatile grasps. Our model design counteracts typical pitfalls of its popular alternative in generative grasping, i.e., conditional Variational Autoencoders (cVAEs) whose performance is limited by mode collapse and miss-specified prior issues. Moreover, the resultant feature hierarchy and the exact flow likelihood computation endow our model with shape-aware introspective capabilities, enabling it to quantify the shape uncertainty of partial point clouds and detect objects of novel geometry. We further achieve performance gain by fusing this information with a discriminative grasp evaluator, facilitating a novel hybrid way for grasp evaluation. Comprehensive simulated and real-world experiments show that the proposed idea gains superior performance and higher run-time efficiency against strong baselines, including diffusion models. We also demonstrate substantial benefits of greater diversity for grasping objects in clutter and a confined workspace in the real world.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15919v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Imitation learning (IL) algorithms typically distil experience into parametric behavior policies to mimic expert demonstrations. With limited experience previous methods often struggle and cannot accurately align the current state with expert demonstrations, particularly in tasks that are characterised by partial observations or dynamic object deformations. We consider imitation learning in deformable mobile manipulation with an ego-centric limited field of view and introduce a novel IL approach called DeMoBot that directly retrieves observations from demonstrations. DeMoBot utilizes vision foundation models to identify relevant expert data based on visual similarity and matches the current trajectory with demonstrated trajectories using trajectory similarity and forward reachability constraints to select suitable sub-goals. A goal-conditioned motion generation policy shall guide the robot to the sub-goal until the task is completed. We evaluate DeMoBot using a Spot robot in several simulated and real-world settings, demonstrating its effectiveness and generalizability. DeMoBot outperforms baselines with only 20 demonstrations, attaining high success rates in gap covering (85% simulation, 80% real-world) and table uncovering (87.5% simulation, 70% real-world), while showing promise in complex tasks like curtain opening (47.5% simulation, 35% real-world).

      <title>Incorporating Task Progress Knowledge for Subgoal Generation in Robotic Manipulation through Image Edits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11013v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the progress of a task allows humans to not only track what has been done but also to better plan for future goals. We demonstrate TaKSIE, a novel framework that incorporates task progress knowledge into visual subgoal generation for robotic manipulation tasks. We jointly train a recurrent network with a latent diffusion model to generate the next visual subgoal based on the robot's current observation and the input language command. At execution time, the robot leverages a visual progress representation to monitor the task progress and adaptively samples the next visual subgoal from the model to guide the manipulation policy. We train and validate our model in simulated and real-world robotic tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the CALVIN manipulation benchmark. We find that the inclusion of task progress knowledge can improve the robustness of trained policy for different initial robot poses or various movement speeds during demonstrations.

      <title>MarineFormer: A Spatio-Temporal Attention Model for USV Navigation in Dynamic Marine Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13973v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Navigating autonomously in marine environments including dynamic and static obstacles, and strong flow disturbances, such as in high-flow rivers, poses significant challenges for USVs. To address these challenges, we propose a novel methodology that leverages two types of attention: spatial attention, which learns to integrate diverse environmental factors and sensory information into navigation decisions, and temporal attention within a transformer framework to account for the dynamic, continuously changing nature of the environment. We devise MarineFormer, a Trans${\bf \text{former}}$-based navigation policy for dynamic ${\bf \text{Marine}}$ environments, trained end-to-end through reinforcement learning (RL). At its core, MarineFormer uses graph attention to capture spatial information and a transformer architecture to process temporal sequences in an environment that simulates a 2D turbulent marine condition involving multiple static and dynamic obstacles. We extensively evaluate the performance of the proposed method versus the state-of-the-art methods, as well as other classical planners. Our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art by nearly $20\%$ in episode completion success rate and additionally enhances the USV's path length efficiency.</description>

      <title>ManipGPT: Is Affordance Segmentation by Large Vision Models Enough for Articulated Object Manipulation?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10050v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Visual actionable affordance has emerged as a transformative approach in robotics, focusing on perceiving interaction areas prior to manipulation. Traditional methods rely on pixel sampling to identify successful interaction samples or processing pointclouds for affordance mapping. However, these approaches are computationally intensive and struggle to adapt to diverse and dynamic environments. This paper introduces ManipGPT, a framework designed to predict optimal interaction areas for articulated objects using a large pre-trained vision transformer (ViT). We created a dataset of 9.9k simulated and real images to bridge the sim-to-real gap and enhance real-world applicability. By fine-tuning the vision transformer on this small dataset, we significantly improved part-level affordance segmentation, adapting the model's in-context segmentation capabilities to robot manipulation scenarios. This enables effective manipulation across simulated and real-world environments by generating part-level affordance masks, paired with an impedance adaptation policy, sufficiently eliminating the need for complex datasets or perception systems.</description>

      <title>Audio Array-Based 3D UAV Trajectory Estimation with LiDAR Pseudo-Labeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12698v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) become increasingly prevalent, there is growing concern regarding their impact on public safety and privacy, highlighting the need for advanced tracking and trajectory estimation solutions. In response, this paper introduces a novel framework that utilizes audio array for 3D UAV trajectory estimation. Our approach incorporates a self-supervised learning model, starting with the conversion of audio data into mel-spectrograms, which are analyzed through an encoder to extract crucial temporal and spectral information. Simultaneously, UAV trajectories are estimated using LiDAR point clouds via unsupervised methods. These LiDAR-based estimations act as pseudo labels, enabling the training of an Audio Perception Network without requiring labeled data. In this architecture, the LiDAR-based system operates as the Teacher Network, guiding the Audio Perception Network, which serves as the Student Network. Once trained, the model can independently predict 3D trajectories using only audio signals, with no need for LiDAR data or external ground truth during deployment. To further enhance precision, we apply Gaussian Process modeling for improved spatiotemporal tracking. Our method delivers top-tier performance on the MMAUD dataset, establishing a new benchmark in trajectory estimation using self-supervised learning techniques without reliance on ground truth annotations.</description>

      <title>I Know Your Feelings Before You Do: Predicting Future Affective Reactions in Human-Computer Dialogue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.00146v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current Spoken Dialogue Systems (SDSs) often serve as passive listeners that respond only after receiving user speech. To achieve human-like dialogue, we propose a novel future prediction architecture that allows an SDS to anticipate future affective reactions based on its current behaviors before the user speaks. In this work, we investigate two scenarios: speech and laughter. In speech, we propose to predict the user's future emotion based on its temporal relationship with the system's current emotion and its causal relationship with the system's current Dialogue Act (DA). In laughter, we propose to predict the occurrence and type of the user's laughter using the system's laughter behaviors in the current turn. Preliminary analysis of human-robot dialogue demonstrated synchronicity in the emotions and laughter displayed by the human and robot, as well as DA-emotion causality in their dialogue. This verifies that our architecture can contribute to the development of an anticipatory SDS.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Vision-Language Models with Scene Graphs for Traffic Accident Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05910v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recognizing a traffic accident is an essential part of any autonomous driving or road monitoring system. An accident can appear in a wide variety of forms, and understanding what type of accident is taking place may be useful to prevent it from reoccurring. This work focuses on classification of traffic scenes into specific accident types. We approach the problem by representing a traffic scene as a graph, where objects such as cars can be represented as nodes, and relative distances and directions between them as edges. This representation of a traffic scene is referred to as a scene graph, and can be used as input for an accident classifier. Better results are obtained with a classifier that fuses the scene graph input with visual and textual representations. This work introduces a multi-stage, multimodal pipeline that pre-processes videos of traffic accidents, encodes them as scene graphs, and aligns this representation with vision and language modalities before executing the classification task. When trained on 4 classes, our method achieves a balanced accuracy score of 57.77% on an (unbalanced) subset of the popular Detection of Traffic Anomaly (DoTA) benchmark, representing an increase of close to 5 percentage points from the case where scene graph information is not taken into account.</description>

      <title>Adaptive bias for dissensus in nonlinear opinion dynamics with application to evolutionary division of labor games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13964v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of adaptively controlling the bias parameter in nonlinear opinion dynamics (NOD) to allocate agents into groups of arbitrary sizes for the purpose of maximizing collective rewards. In previous work, an algorithm based on the coupling of NOD with an multi-objective behavior optimization was successfully deployed as part of a multi-robot system in an autonomous task allocation field experiment. Motivated by the field results, in this paper we propose and analyze a new task allocation model that synthesizes NOD with an evolutionary game framework. We prove sufficient conditions under which it is possible to control the opinion state in the group to a desired allocation of agents between two tasks through an adaptive bias using decentralized feedback. We then verify the theoretical results with a simulation study of a collaborative evolutionary division of labor game.</description>

      <title>Online Intrinsic Rewards for Decision Making Agents from Large Language Model Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23022v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automatically synthesizing dense rewards from natural language descriptions is a promising paradigm in reinforcement learning (RL), with applications to sparse reward problems, open-ended exploration, and hierarchical skill design. Recent works have made promising steps by exploiting the prior knowledge of large language models (LLMs). However, these approaches suffer from important limitations: they are either not scalable to problems requiring billions of environment samples, due to requiring LLM annotations for each observation, or they require a diverse offline dataset, which may not exist or be impossible to collect. In this work, we address these limitations through a combination of algorithmic and systems-level contributions. We propose \oni, a distributed architecture that simultaneously learns an RL policy and an intrinsic reward function using LLM feedback. Our approach annotates the agent's collected experience via an asynchronous LLM server, which is then distilled into an intrinsic reward model. We explore a range of algorithmic choices for reward modeling with varying complexity, including hashing, classification, and ranking models. By studying their relative tradeoffs, we shed light on questions regarding intrinsic reward design for sparse reward problems. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across a range of challenging, sparse reward tasks from the NetHack Learning Environment in a simple unified process, solely using the agent's gathered experience, without requiring external datasets. We make our code available at \url{https://github.com/facebookresearch/oni}.</description>

      <title>ManiBox: Enhancing Spatial Grasping Generalization via Scalable Simulation Data Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01850v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning a precise robotic grasping policy is crucial for embodied agents operating in complex real-world manipulation tasks. Despite significant advancements, most models still struggle with accurate spatial positioning of objects to be grasped. We first show that this spatial generalization challenge stems primarily from the extensive data requirements for adequate spatial understanding. However, collecting such data with real robots is prohibitively expensive, and relying on simulation data often leads to visual generalization gaps upon deployment. To overcome these challenges, we then focus on state-based policy generalization and present \textbf{ManiBox}, a novel bounding-box-guided manipulation method built on a simulation-based teacher-student framework. The teacher policy efficiently generates scalable simulation data using bounding boxes, which are proven to uniquely determine the objects' spatial positions. The student policy then utilizes these low-dimensional spatial states to enable zero-shot transfer to real robots. Through comprehensive evaluations in simulated and real-world environments, ManiBox demonstrates a marked improvement in spatial grasping generalization and adaptability to diverse objects and backgrounds. Further, our empirical study into scaling laws for policy performance indicates that spatial volume generalization scales with data volume in a power law. For a certain level of spatial volume, the success rate of grasping empirically follows Michaelis-Menten kinetics relative to data volume, showing a saturation effect as data increases. Our videos and code are available in https://thkkk.github.io/manibox.</description>

Abstract: Compact UAV systems, while advancing delivery and surveillance, pose significant security challenges due to their small size, which hinders detection by traditional methods. This paper presents a cost-effective, unsupervised UAV detection method using spatial-temporal sequence processing to fuse multiple LiDAR scans for accurate UAV tracking in real-world scenarios. Our approach segments point clouds into foreground and background, analyzes spatial-temporal data, and employs a scoring mechanism to enhance detection accuracy. Tested on a public dataset, our solution placed 4th in the CVPR 2024 UG2+ Challenge, demonstrating its practical effectiveness. We plan to open-source all designs, code, and sample data for the research community github.com/lianghanfang/UnLiDAR-UAV-Est.</description>

      <title>SafeAgentBench: A Benchmark for Safe Task Planning of Embodied LLM Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13178v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the integration of large language models (LLMs), embodied agents have strong capabilities to execute complicated instructions in natural language, paving a way for the potential deployment of embodied robots. However, a foreseeable issue is that those embodied agents can also flawlessly execute some hazardous tasks, potentially causing damages in real world. To study this issue, we present SafeAgentBench -- a new benchmark for safety-aware task planning of embodied LLM agents. SafeAgentBench includes: (1) a new dataset with 750 tasks, covering 10 potential hazards and 3 task types; (2) SafeAgentEnv, a universal embodied environment with a low-level controller, supporting multi-agent execution with 17 high-level actions for 8 state-of-the-art baselines; and (3) reliable evaluation methods from both execution and semantic perspectives. Experimental results show that the best-performing baseline gets 69% success rate for safe tasks, but only 5% rejection rate for hazardous tasks, indicating significant safety risks. More details and codes are available at https://github.com/shengyin1224/SafeAgentBench.</description>
