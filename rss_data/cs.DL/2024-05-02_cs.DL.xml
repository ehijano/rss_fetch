      <title>Clustering Running Titles to Understand the Printing of Early Modern Books</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel computational approach to automatically analyze the physical process behind printing of early modern letterpress books via clustering the running titles found at the top of their pages. Specifically, we design and compare custom neural and feature-based kernels for computing pairwise visual similarity of a scanned document's running titles and cluster the titles in order to track any deviations from the expected pattern of a book's printing. Unlike body text which must be reset for every page, the running titles are one of the static type elements in a skeleton forme i.e. the frame used to print each side of a sheet of paper, and were often re-used during a book's printing. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we manually annotate the running title clusters on about 1600 pages across 8 early modern books of varying size and formats. Our method can detect potential deviation from the expected patterns of such skeleton formes, which helps bibliographers understand the phenomena associated with a text's transmission, such as censorship. We also validate our results against a manual bibliographic analysis of a counterfeit early edition of Thomas Hobbes' Leviathan (1651).</description>

      <title>Callico: a Versatile Open-Source Document Image Annotation Platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents Callico, a web-based open source platform designed to simplify the annotation process in document recognition projects. The move towards data-centric AI in machine learning and deep learning underscores the importance of high-quality data, and the need for specialised tools that increase the efficiency and effectiveness of generating such data. For document image annotation, Callico offers dual-display annotation for digitised documents, enabling simultaneous visualisation and annotation of scanned images and text. This capability is critical for OCR and HTR model training, document layout analysis, named entity recognition, form-based key value annotation or hierarchical structure annotation with element grouping. The platform supports collaborative annotation with versatile features backed by a commitment to open source development, high-quality code standards and easy deployment via Docker. Illustrative use cases - including the transcription of the Belfort municipal registers, the indexing of French World War II prisoners for the ICRC, and the extraction of personal information from the Socface project's census lists - demonstrate Callico's applicability and utility.</description>
