      <title>Invariant graphs and dynamics of a family of continuous piecewise linear planar maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the family of piecewise linear maps $$F_{a,b}(x,y)=\left(|x| - y + a, x - |y| + b\right),$$ where $(a,b)\in \mathbb{R}^2$. This family belongs to a wider one that has deserved some interest in the recent years as it provides a framework for generalized Lozi-type maps. Among our results, we prove that for $a\ge 0$ all the orbits are eventually periodic and moreover that there are at most three different periodic behaviors formed by at most seven points. For $a&lt;0$ we prove that for each $b\in\mathbb{R}$ there exists a compact graph $\Gamma,$ which is invariant under the map $F$, such that for each $(x,y)\in \mathbb{R}^2$ there exists $n\in\mathbb{N}$ (that may depend on $x$) such that $F_{a,b}^n(x,y)\in \Gamma.$ We give explicitly all these invariant graphs and we characterize the dynamics of the map restricted to the corresponding graph for all $(a,b)\in\mathbb{R}^2$ obtaining, among other results, a full characterization of when $F_{a,b}|_{\Gamma}$ has positive or zero entropy.</description>

      <title>Finite and infinite degree Thurston maps with a small postsingular set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop the theory of Thurston maps that are defined everywhere on the topological sphere $S^2$ with a possible exception of a single essential singularity. We establish an analog of the celebrated W. Thurston's characterization theorem for a broad class of such Thurston maps having four postsingular values. To achieve this, we analyze the corresponding pullback maps defined on the one-complex dimensional Teichm\"uller space. This analysis also allows us to derive various properties of Hurwitz classes of the corresponding Thurston maps.</description>

      <title>Discretizations of Teichm\"uller Geodesic Flow and Enumeration of Pseudo-Anosov Diffeomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this thesis, we study the Teichm\"uller geodesic flow on the space of translation surfaces by introducing two related discrete-time dynamical systems. First, we discuss the Rauzy-Veech induction, highlighting its connections to interval exchange transformations and continued fraction expansions. While effective for addressing ergodic properties, this method faces challenges in counting closed orbits. Second, we introduce diagonal changes, a discretization better suited for counting and enumeration problems, initially applied to hyperelliptic components - subsets of translation surfaces with additional symmetries. Understanding closed orbits is significant due to the one-to-one correspondence with pseudo-Anosov mapping classes. After detailing this connection, we demonstrate how diagonal changes can produce a complete list of pseudo-Anosov mapping classes ordered by dilatation, and explain how to extend the algorithm to general components of strata.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Hopf bifurcations in Gaudin models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that su(2) rational and trigonometric Gaudin models, or in other words, generalised coupled angular momenta systems, have singularities that undergo Hamiltonian Hopf bifurcations. In particular, we find a normal form for the Hamiltonian Hopf bifurcation up to sixth order, letting us determine when the bifurcation is degenerate or not. Furthermore, in the non-degenerate case we may use the fourth order terms to determine whether the bifurcation is supercritical or subcritical; whether a flap appears in the image of the momentum map or not. Finally, figures illustrating some of the bifurcations taking place in su(2) Gaudin models are presented, showing that there are more bifurcations occurring than only Hamiltonian Hopf ones.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For an abelian group $G$,
  $\vec{g}=(g_1,\ldots,g_d)\in G^d$ and $\epsilon=(\epsilon(1),\ldots,\epsilon(d))\in \{0,1\}^d$, let $\vec{g}\cdot \epsilon=\prod_{i=1}^{d}g_i^{\epsilon(i)}$. In this paper, it is shown that for a minimal system $(X,G)$ with $G$ being abelian, $(x,y)\in \mathbf{RP}^{[d]}$ if and only if there exists a sequence $\{\vec{g}_n\}_{n\in \mathbb{N}}\subseteq G^d$ and points $z_{\epsilon}\in X,\epsilon\in \{0,1\}^d$ with $z_{\vec{0}}=y$ such that for every $\epsilon\in \{0,1\}^d\backslash\{ \vec{0}\}$, \[ \lim_{n\to\infty}(\vec{g}_n\cdot\epsilon)x= z_\epsilon\quad \mathrm{and} \quad \lim_{n\to\infty}(\vec{g}_n\cdot\epsilon)^{-1}z_{\vec{1}}=z_{\vec{1}-\epsilon}, \] where $\mathbf{RP}^{[d]}$ is the regionally proximal relation of order $d$.</description>

      <title>URP, comparison, mean dimension, and sharp shift embeddability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a free action $G \curvearrowright X$ of an amenable group on a compact metrizable space, we study the Uniform Rokhlin Property (URP) and the conjunction of Uniform Rokhlin Property and comparison (URPC). We give several equivalent formulations of the latter and show that it passes to extensions. We introduce technical conditions called property FCSB and property FCSB in measure, both of which reduce to the marker property if $G$ is abelian. Our first main result is that for any amenable group $G$ property FCSB in measure is equivalent to URP, and for a large class of amenable groups property FCSB is equivalent to URPC. In the latter case, it follows that if the action is moreover minimal then the C$^*$-crossed product $C(X) \rtimes G$ has stable rank one, satisfies the Toms-Winter conjecture, and is classifiable if $\mathrm{mdim}(G \curvearrowright X) = 0$.
  Our second main result is that if a system $G \curvearrowright X$ has URPC and $\mathrm{mdim}(G \curvearrowright X) &lt; M/2$, then it is embeddable into the $M$-cubical shift $\left([0, 1]^M\right)^G$. Combined with the first main result, we recover the Gutman-Qiao-Tsukamoto sharp shift embeddability theorem as a special case. Notably, the proof avoids the use of either Euclidean geometry or signal analysis and directly extends the theorem to all abelian groups.
  Finally, we show that if $G$ is a nonamenable group that contains a free subgroup on two generators and $G \curvearrowright X$ is a topologically amenable action, then it is embeddable into $[0, 1]^G$.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Modelling and Robust Observer Synthesis using the Koopman Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a robust nonlinear observer synthesis method for a population of systems modelled using the Koopman operator. The Koopman operator allows nonlinear systems to be rewritten as infinite-dimensional linear systems. A finite-dimensional approximation of the Koopman operator can be identified directly from data, yielding an approximately linear model of a nonlinear system. The proposed observer synthesis method is made possible by this linearity that in turn allows uncertainty within a population of Koopman models to be quantified in the frequency domain. Using this uncertainty model, linear robust control techniques are used to synthesize robust nonlinear Koopman observers. A population of several dozen motor drives is used to experimentally demonstrate the proposed method. Manufacturing variation is characterized in the frequency domain, and a robust Koopman observer is synthesized using mixed $\mathcal{H}_2$-$\mathcal{H}_\infty$ optimal control.</description>

      <title>Interior of certain sums and continuous images of very thin Cantor sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that for all Cantor set $K_1$ on ${\mathbb R}^d$, it is always possible to find another Cantor set $K_2$ so that the sum $g(K_1)+ K_2$ (where $g$ is a $C^1$ local diffeomorphism) has non-empty interior, and the existence of the interior is robust under small perturbation of the mapping. More generally, we can also show that the image set $H(\alpha, K_1,K_2)$, where $H$ is some $C^1$ function on ${\mathbb R}^N\times{\mathbb R}^d\times{\mathbb R}^d$ with non-vanishing Jacobian, have non-empty interior for $\alpha$ all in an open ball of ${\mathbb R}^N$. This result allows us to show that all Cantor sets are not topologically universal using $C^1$ local diffeomorphism, proving a stronger version of the topological Erd\H{o}s similarity conjecture. Moreover, we are also able to construct a Cantor set of dimension $d$ on ${\mathbb R}^{2d}$, whose distance set has an interior.</description>

      <title>Extending Contextual Self-Modulation: Meta-Learning Across Modalities, Task Dimensionalities, and Data Regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contextual Self-Modulation (CSM) is a potent regularization mechanism for the Neural Context Flow (NCF) framework which demonstrates powerful meta-learning of physical systems. However, CSM has limitations in its applicability across different modalities and in high-data regimes. In this work, we introduce two extensions: $i$CSM, which expands CSM to infinite-dimensional tasks, and StochasticNCF, which improves scalability. These extensions are demonstrated through comprehensive experimentation on a range of tasks, including dynamical systems with parameter variations, computer vision challenges, and curve fitting problems. $i$CSM embeds the contexts into an infinite-dimensional function space, as opposed to CSM which uses finite-dimensional context vectors. StochasticNCF enables the application of both CSM and $i$CSM to high-data scenarios by providing an unbiased approximation of meta-gradient updates through a sampled set of nearest environments. Additionally, we incorporate higher-order Taylor expansions via Taylor-Mode automatic differentiation, revealing that higher-order approximations do not necessarily enhance generalization. Finally, we demonstrate how CSM can be integrated into other meta-learning frameworks with FlashCAVIA, a computationally efficient extension of the CAVIA meta-learning framework (Zintgraf et al. 2019). FlashCAVIA outperforms its predecessor across various benchmarks and reinforces the utility of bi-level optimization techniques. Together, these contributions establish a robust framework for tackling an expanded spectrum of meta-learning tasks, offering practical insights for out-of-distribution generalization. Our open-sourced library, designed for flexible integration of self-modulation into contextual meta-learning workflows, is available at \url{github.com/ddrous/self-mod}.</description>

      <title>Unitary Representations of the Isometry Groups of Urysohn Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain a complete classification of the continuous unitary representations of the isometry group of the rational Urysohn space $\mathbb{Q}\mathbb{U}$. As a consequence, we show that Isom$(\mathbb{Q}\mathbb{U})$ has property (T). We also derive several ergodic theoretic consequences from this classification: $(i)$ every probability measure-preserving action of Isom$(\mathbb{Q}\mathbb{U})$ is either essentially free or essentially transitive, $(ii)$ every ergodic Isom$(\mathbb{Q}\mathbb{U})$-invariant probability measure on $[0,1]^{\mathbb{Q}\mathbb{U}}$ is a product measure. We obtain the same results for isometry groups of variations of $\mathbb{Q}\mathbb{U}$, such as the rational Urysohn sphere $\mathbb{Q}\mathbb{U}_1$, the integral Urysohn space $\mathbb{Z}\mathbb{U}$, etc.</description>

      <title>Collective rhythm design in coupled mixed-feedback systems through dominance and bifurcations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04324v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The theory of mixed-feedback systems provides an effective framework for the design of robust and tunable oscillations in nonlinear systems characterized by interleaved fast positive and slow negative feedback loops. The goal of this paper is to extend the mixed-feedback oscillation design framework to networks. To this aim, we introduce a network model of coupled mixed-feedback systems, ask under which conditions it exhibits a collective oscillatory rhythm, and if, and how, this rhythm can be shaped by network design. In the proposed network model, node dynamics are nonlinear and defined by a tractable realization of the mixed-feedback structure. Coupling between nodes is also nonlinear and defined by a tractable abstraction of synaptic coupling between neurons. We derive constructive conditions under which the spectral properties of the network adjacency matrix fully and explicitly determine both the emergence of a stable network rhythm and its detailed rhythmic profile, i.e., the pattern of relative oscillation amplitudes and phase differences. Our theoretical developments are grounded on ideas from dominant systems and bifurcation theory. They provide a new framework for the analysis and design of nonlinear network rhythms.</description>

      <title>Existence and Uniqueness of Solutions of the Koopman--von Neumann Equation on Bounded Domains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.13504v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Koopman--von Neumann equation describes the evolution of a complex-valued wavefunction corresponding to the probability distribution given by an associated classical Liouville equation. Typically, it is defined on the whole Euclidean space. The investigation of bounded domains, particularly in practical scenarios involving quantum-based simulations of dynamical systems, has received little attention so far. We consider the Koopman--von Neumann equation associated with an ordinary differential equation on a bounded domain whose trajectories are contained in the set's closure. Our main results are the construction of a strongly continuous semigroup together with the existence and uniqueness of solutions of the associated initial value problem. To this end, a functional-analytic framework connected to Sobolev spaces is proposed and analyzed. Moreover, the connection of the Koopman--von Neumann framework to transport equations is highlighted.</description>

      <title>Generalized Lyapunov conditions for k-contraction: analysis and feedback design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18388v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, the concept of k-contraction has been introduced as a promising generalization of contraction for dynamical systems. However, the study of k-contraction properties has faced significant challenges due to the reliance on complex mathematical objects called matrix compounds. As a result, related control design methodologies have yet to appear in the literature. In this paper, we overcome existing limitations and propose new sufficient conditions for k-contraction which do not require matrix compounds computation. Notably, these conditions are also necessary in the linear time-invariant framework. Leveraging on these findings, we propose a feedback design methodology for both the linear and the nonlinear scenarios which can be used to enforce k-contractivity properties on the closed-loop dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14284v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study surface subgroups of $\mathrm{SL}(4,\mathbb R)$ acting convex cocompactly on $\mathbb R \textrm P^3$ with image in the coaffine group. The boundary of the convex core is stratified, and the one dimensional strata form a pair of bending laminations. We show that the bending data on each component consist of a convex $\mathbb R \textrm P^2$ structure and an affine measured lamination depending on the underlying convex projective structure on $S$ with (Hitchin) holonomy $\rho: \pi_1S \to \mathrm{SL}(3,\mathbb R)$. We study the space $\mathcal {ML}^\rho(S)$ of bending data compatible with $\rho$ and prove that its projectivization is a sphere of dimension $6g-7$.</description>

Abstract: Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODEs) often struggle to adapt to new dynamic behaviors caused by parameter changes in the underlying system, even when these dynamics are similar to previously observed behaviors. This problem becomes more challenging when the changing parameters are unobserved, meaning their value or influence cannot be directly measured when collecting data. To address this issue, we introduce Neural Context Flow (NCF), a robust and interpretable Meta-Learning framework that includes uncertainty estimation. NCF uses higher-order Taylor expansion to enable contextual self-modulation, allowing context vectors to influence dynamics from other domains while also modulating themselves. After establishing convergence guarantees, we empirically test NCF and compare it to related adaptation methods. Our results show that NCF achieves state-of-the-art Out-of-Distribution performance on 5 out of 6 linear and non-linear benchmark problems. Through extensive experiments, we explore the flexible model architecture of NCF and the encoded representations within the learned context vectors. Our findings highlight the potential implications of NCF for foundational models in the physical sciences, offering a promising approach to improving the adaptability and generalization of NODEs in various scientific applications.
