      <title>Multi-view biomedical foundation models for molecule-target and property prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundation models applied to bio-molecular space hold promise to accelerate drug discovery. Molecular representation is key to building such models. Previous works have typically focused on a single representation or view of the molecules. Here, we develop a multi-view foundation model approach, that integrates molecular views of graph, image and text. Single-view foundation models are each pre-trained on a dataset of up to 200M molecules and then aggregated into combined representations. Our multi-view model is validated on a diverse set of 18 tasks, encompassing ligand-protein binding, molecular solubility, metabolism and toxicity. We show that the multi-view models perform robustly and are able to balance the strengths and weaknesses of specific views. We then apply this model to screen compounds against a large (&gt;100 targets) set of G Protein-Coupled receptors (GPCRs). From this library of targets, we identify 33 that are related to Alzheimer's disease. On this subset, we employ our model to identify strong binders, which are validated through structure-based modeling and identification of key binding motifs.</description>

      <title>A Transformer Based Generative Chemical Language AI Model for Structural Elucidation of Organic Compounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14719v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For over half a century, computer-aided structural elucidation systems (CASE) for organic compounds have relied on complex expert systems with explicitly programmed algorithms. These systems are often computationally inefficient for complex compounds due to the vast chemical structural space that must be explored and filtered. In this study, we present a proof-of-concept transformer based generative chemical language artificial intelligence (AI) model, an innovative end-to-end architecture designed to replace the logic and workflow of the classic CASE framework for ultra-fast and accurate spectroscopic-based structural elucidation. Our model employs an encoder-decoder architecture and self-attention mechanisms, similar to those in large language models, to directly generate the most probable chemical structures that match the input spectroscopic data. Trained on ~ 102k IR, UV, and 1H NMR spectra, it performs structural elucidation of molecules with up to 29 atoms in just a few seconds on a modern CPU, achieving a top-15 accuracy of 83%. This approach demonstrates the potential of transformer based generative AI to accelerate traditional scientific problem-solving processes. The model's ability to iterate quickly based on new data highlights its potential for rapid advancements in structural elucidation.</description>
