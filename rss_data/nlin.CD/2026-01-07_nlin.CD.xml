      <title>Dynamic Synchronization of Driven Self-Oscillators: Modeling and Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synchronization of self-sustained oscillators under fixed-frequency and amplitude forcing is well understood, but how time-varying forcing mangles phase locking has been much less explored. Theory predicts that slow, deterministic modulation of the drive amplitude or frequency can lead to a peculiar synchronization regime characterized by intermittent locking of the oscillation phase beyond the Arnold-tongue boundaries associated with fixed harmonic forcing. We test these predictions in a controllable aeroacoustic self oscillator, i.e, a whistle, that exhibits a robust limit cycle and is subject to external acoustic forcing with programmable frequency and amplitude modulation. Under both slowly varying frequency or amplitude of the forcing, three regimes are observed: (i) strict synchronization (ii) intermittent synchronization, characterized by alternating phase locking and brief phase slip episodes and (iii) no synchronization, with regular phase slips. Particularly in strict synchronization regime, the phase of the oscillator will follow arbitrary slowly-varying drive phase and under amplitude modulation its amplitude fluctuations are strongly suppressed.</description>

      <title>Simple chemical systems with chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A number of simple chaotic three-dimensional dynamical systems (DSs) with quadratic polynomials on the right-hand sides are reported in the literature, containing exactly 5 or 6 monomials of which only 1 or 2 are quadratic. However, none of these simple systems are chemical dynamical systems (CDSs) - a special subset of polynomial DSs that model the dynamics of mass-action chemical reaction networks (CRNs). In particular, only a small number of three-dimensional quadratic CDSs with chaos are reported, all of which have at least 9 monomials and at least 3 quadratics, with CRNs containing at least 7 reactions and at least 3 quadratic ones. To bridge this gap, in this paper we prove some basic properties of chaotic CDSs, including that those in three dimensions have at least 6 monomials, at least one of which is negative and quadratic. We then use these results to computationally find 20 chaotic three-dimensional CDSs with 6 monomials and as few as 4 quadratics, or 7 monomials and as few as 2 quadratics. At the CRN level, some of these systems have 4 reactions of which only 3 are quadratic, or 5 reactions with only 2 being quadratic. These results quantify structural complexity of chaotic CDSs, and indicate that they are ubiquitous.</description>

      <title>Instant cost and delayed reward. Demographic eco-evolutionary game dynamics under the impact of the delay resulting from the offspring maturation time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend the demographic eco-evolutionary game approach, based on explicit birth and death dynamics instead of abstract "fitness" interpreted as an abstract "Malthusian parameter", by the introduction of the delay resulting from the juvenile maturation time. This leads to the application of the Delay Differential Equations (DDE). We show that delay seriously affects the resulting dynamics and may lead to the loss of stability of equilibria when critical delay is exceeded. We provide theoretical tools for the assessment of the critical delays and the parameter values when this may happen. Our results emphasize the importance of the mechanisms of density dependence. We analyze the impact of three different suppression modes based on: adult mortality, juvenile recruitment survival after the maturation period (without delay), and juvenile recruitment at birth (with the delay). The last mode leads to extreme patterns such as bifurcations, complex cycles, and chaotic dynamics. However, surprisingly, this mode leads to extension of the duration of the temporary transient metastable states known as "ghost attractors". In addition, we also focus on the problem of resilience of the analyzed systems against external periodic perturbations and feedback-driven factors such as additional predator pressure.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Modeling of Global Bifurcations and Chaos in a Mechanical System under Delayed and Quantized Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We illustrate how the recent theory of Spectral Submanifolds (SSM) can capture global bifurcations and complex dynamics in mechanical systems even under delay and spatial discretization. Specifically, we build a parameter-dependent SSM-reduced model that predicts global heteroclinic and local bifurcations in a Furuta pendulum under control with delay, and verify these predictions numerically. Under additional spatial discretization of the digital controller, we also obtain an SSM-reduced model that correctly reproduces a numerically and experimentally observed microchaotic attractor in the system.</description>

      <title>Chaos and Regularity in an Anisotropic Soft Squircle Billiard</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20270v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A hard-wall billiard is a mathematical model describing the confinement of a free particle that collides specularly and instantaneously with boundaries and discontinuities. Soft billiards are a generalization that includes a smooth boundary whose dynamics are governed by Hamiltonian equations and overcome overly simplistic representations. We study the dynamical features of an anisotropic soft-wall squircle billiard. This curve is a geometric figure that seamlessly blends the angularity of a square with the smooth curves of a circle. We characterize the billiard's emerging trajectories, exhibiting the onset of chaos and its alternation with regularity in the parameter space. We characterize the transition to chaos and the stabilization of the dynamics by revealing the nonlinearity of the parameters (squarness, ellipticity, and hardness) via the computation of Poincar\'e surfaces of section and the Lyapunov exponent across the parameter space. We expect our work to introduce a valuable tool to increase understanding of the onset of chaos in soft billiards.</description>

      <title>The Role of Phase and Spatial Modes in Wave-Induced Plasma Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15729v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive a two-dimensional symplectic map for particle motion at the plasma edge by modeling the electrostatic potential as a superposition of integer spatial harmonics with relative phase shift, then reduce it to a two-wave model to study the transport dependence on the perturbation amplitudes, relative phase, and spatial-mode choice. Using particle transmissivity as a confinement criterion, identical-mode pairs exhibit phase-controlled behavior: anti-phase waves produce destructive interference and strong confinement while in-phase waves add constructively and drive chaotic transport. Mode-mismatched pairs produce richer phase-space structure with higher-order resonances and sticky regions; the transmissivity boundaries become geometrically complex. Box-counting dimensions quantify this: integer dimension smooth boundaries for identical modes versus non-integer fractal-like dimension for distinct modes, demonstrating that phase and spectral content of waves jointly determine whether interference suppresses or promotes transport.</description>
