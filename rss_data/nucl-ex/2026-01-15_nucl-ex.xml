      <title>Energy spectra of light charged particles emitted following muon nuclear capture on $^\mathrm{nat}$Si</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Charged-particle emission following muon nuclear capture (muNC) provides important information on the de-excitation dynamics of highly excited nuclei, particularly on the interplay between preequilibrium and evaporation processes. While proton emission has been relatively well studied, experimental data on composite charged particles remain limited, especially in the low-energy region for alpha particles. Purpose: This work aims to measure comprehensive energy spectra of charged particles emitted following muNC on silicon and to provide experimental constraints on theoretical models of charged-particle emission. Method: An experiment was performed at the RIKEN-RAL Muon Facility. Charged particles were identified using DeltaE-E telescopes and digital pulse-shape analysis with nTD-Si detectors. The initial energy spectra were reconstructed through an unfolding procedure and compared with calculations based on the microscopic and evaporation model (MEM) and the PHITS code with surface coalescence and meson-exchange-current extensions. Results: Energy spectra of protons, deuterons, tritons, and alpha particles were extracted over a broad energy range. In particular, the low-energy alpha-particle spectrum was measured for the first time. Proton spectra are reasonably reproduced by both MEM and PHITS. For alpha particles, the low-energy evaporation component is described by both models, while discrepancies remain at higher energies. For deuterons and tritons, MEM reproduces the spectral shapes well, whereas PHITS significantly underestimates the yields, especially at high energies. Conclusion: The results demonstrate clear particle-species-dependent differences in charged-particle emission following muNC. The measured energy spectra provide important constraints on preequilibrium and evaporation processes and indicate the need for improved modeling of composite-particle emission.</description>

      <title>Breakeven in Nuclear Fusion via Electron-Free Target</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nuclear fusion promises a nearly limitless energy source, but achieving breakeven-where fusion output exceeds input-requires extreme plasma conditions and complex confinement systems. Here we propose an alternative approach based on beam-target interactions, introducing a simple energy-based criterion that compares fusion energy generation with energy loss. By creating electron-free targets, stopping power is drastically reduced, enabling conditions where fusion energy surpasses beam energy deposition under practical scenarios. This approach offers a viable alternative pathway to fusion energy without high-temperature plasma confinement and warrants further experimental investigation.</description>

      <title>Long Range Outlook for Short-Range Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Short range correlated (SRC) N N pairs are pairs of nucleons with high relative momentum (prel &gt; kF where kF ~ 250 MeV/c is the Fermi momentum in medium to heavy nuclei) and lower center of mass momentum. The motivation for studying SRC pairs ranges from a desire to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of the many-body nuclear wave-function at high-resolution to searching for explicit QCD-dynamics effects within the nuclear medium, not to mention connections to many other open problems in nuclear physics.
  Exploring short-range correlations was one of the physics motivations for building CEBAF (now Jefferson Lab). Scientists used the high luminosity and high energy of this cutting-edge machine to find kinematics that cleanly showed the signals of short-range correlations. This paved the way in the last two decades for tremendous progress understanding these correlations. This paper reviews recent progress and highlights outstanding questions and areas that need further study.</description>

      <title>Hybrid-Contact Planar HPGe Process Vehicle Toward Ring-Contact Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rare-event searches including dark matter, coherent elastic neutrino--nucleus scattering (CE$\nu$NS), and neutrinoless double-beta decay (0$\nu\beta\beta$) require high-purity germanium (HPGe) detectors with ultralow noise, stable backgrounds, and electrode geometries that can scale to larger single-crystal masses. Ring-contact (ring-and-groove) designs address scalability by shaping the electric field to preserve low-capacitance readout, but their nonplanar topology motivates a lithium-contact process that is compatible with conformal deposition and robust high-voltage operation. As a process demonstration toward future ring-contact prototypes, we fabricate and characterize a hybrid-contact planar HPGe device, KL01. Here, ``hybrid'' denotes an $n^{+}$ contact formed by an in-house lithium-suspension paint followed by controlled thermal diffusion, combined with an AJA-developed a-Ge/Al $p^{+}$ contact and a-Ge sidewall passivation. At 77~K the device exhibits pA-scale leakage current under kV bias, a depletion plateau near $V_{\mathrm{dep}}\approx 1300$~V, and energy resolutions of 1.57~keV FWHM at 59.5~keV and 2.57~keV FWHM at 662~keV. These results validate the compatibility of the paint-and-diffuse lithium process with thin-film a-Ge/Al contacts and establish a practical fabrication workflow to be extended to ring-and-groove electrodes for next-generation rare-event HPGe modules.</description>

      <title>Comments on Baryon Transition Form Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss in rather general terms the properties of space-like baryon transition form factors. In particular, we argue why these are necessarily complex-valued, what can be deduced from the respective phase motion and why dealing with real valued transition form factors in general leads to misleading results. For illustration the transition form factors for the Roper resonance as derived in the J\"ulich-Bonn-Washington framework are discussed.</description>

      <title>The ePIC Silicon Vertex Tracker: Design and Status</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ePIC collaboration is developing a multidetector system to explore the fundamental properties of the strong interaction at the future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC), to be built at Brookhaven National Laboratory. A key component of the ePIC detector is the Silicon Vertex Tracker (SVT), which provides high-precision tracking and microvertex reconstruction. The SVT consists of the Inner Barrel (IB), the Outer Barrel (OB), and the Forward/Backward Disks, all based on Monolithic Active Pixel Sensors (MAPS) that combine high granularity, low power consumption, and minimal material budget. This paper presents a concise overview of the SVT design and its development status.</description>

      <title>Shell and cluster structures in $^{20}$Ne in the variation of multiple bases of the antisymmetrized molecular dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the structures of $^{20}$Ne in the variation of the multiple bases of the antisymmetrized molecular dynamics (AMD). In this method, the multiple AMD bases are superposed and optimized simultaneously in the total-energy variation. This scheme is beneficial for describing the various configurations in $^{20}$Ne. In the results, we confirm the shell and cluster structures in the $K^\pi=0^+_{1-4}$ bands, such as the deformed states in the $K^\pi=0^+_{1,4}$ bands with the $\alpha$ cluster development, and the spherical shell-like states in the $K^\pi=0^+_2$ band, the latter of which is difficult to describe in the previous AMD calculations imposing the quadrupole deformation. We evaluate the monopole and quadrupole transitions in these states. The negative parity states of $^{20}$Ne with $K^\pi=0^-$ and $2^-$ are discussed in relation to the shell and cluster structures. As a result, six kinds of the $K^\pi$ bands in $^{20}$Ne are described comprehensively in the microscopic framework of nuclei.</description>

      <title>Deeply virtual $\phi$-meson production near threshold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12343v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss exclusive $\phi$-meson electroproduction off the proton near threshold within the GPD factorization framework. We propose the `threshold approximation' in which only the leading term of the conformal partial wave expansion of the meson production amplitudes is kept in both the quark and gluon exchange channels. We test the validity of this approximation to next-to-leading order in QCD and demonstrate the strong sensitivity of the cross section to the gluon and strangeness gravitational form factors. We also perform realistic event generator simulations both for Jefferson Lab and EIC kinematics and demonstrate the capabilities of future facilities for measuring near-threshold $\phi$ electroproduction.</description>

      <title>Insights into Meson and Baryon Structure using Continuum Schwinger Function Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08046v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The bulk of visible mass is supposed to emerge from nonperturbative dynamics within quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Following years of development and refinement, continuum and lattice Schwinger function methods have recently joined in revealing the three pillars that support this emergent hadron mass (EHM); namely, a nonzero gluon mass-scale, a process-independent effective charge, and dressed-quarks with running masses that take constituent-like values at infrared momenta. One may argue that EHM and confinement are inextricably linked; and theory is now working to expose their manifold expressions in hadron observables and highlight the types of measurements that can be made in order to validate the paradigm. This contribution sketches these ideas via the unified explanation of pion and proton electromagnetic and gravitational form factors.</description>
