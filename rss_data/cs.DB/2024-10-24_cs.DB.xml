      <title>NexusIndex: Integrating Advanced Vector Indexing and Multi-Model Embeddings for Robust Fake News Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of fake news on digital platforms has underscored the need for robust and scalable detection mechanisms. Traditional methods often fall short in handling large and diverse datasets due to limitations in scalability and accuracy. In this paper, we propose NexusIndex, a novel framework and model that enhances fake news detection by integrating advanced language models, an innovative FAISSNexusIndex layer, and attention mechanisms. Our approach leverages multi-model embeddings to capture rich contextual and semantic nuances, significantly improving text interpretation and classification accuracy. By transforming articles into high-dimensional embeddings and indexing them efficiently, NexusIndex facilitates rapid similarity searches across extensive collections of news articles. The FAISSNexusIndex layer further optimizes this process, enabling real-time detection and enhancing the system's scalability and performance. Our experimental results demonstrate that NexusIndex outperforms state-of-the-art methods in efficiency and accuracy across diverse datasets.</description>

      <title>MoMQ: Mixture-of-Experts Enhances Multi-Dialect Query Generation across Relational and Non-Relational Databases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The improvement in translating natural language to structured query language (SQL) can be attributed to the advancements in large language models (LLMs). Open-source LLMs, tailored for specific database dialects such as MySQL, have shown great performance. However, cloud service providers are looking for a unified database manager service (e.g., Cosmos DB from Azure, Amazon Aurora from AWS, Lindorm from AlibabaCloud) that can support multiple dialects. This requirement has led to the concept of multi-dialect query generation, which presents challenges to LLMs. These challenges include syntactic differences among dialects and imbalanced data distribution across multiple dialects. To tackle these challenges, we propose MoMQ, a novel Mixture-of-Experts-based multi-dialect query generation framework across both relational and non-relational databases. MoMQ employs a dialect expert group for each dialect and a multi-level routing strategy to handle dialect-specific knowledge, reducing interference during query generation. Additionally, a shared expert group is introduced to address data imbalance, facilitating the transfer of common knowledge from high-resource dialects to low-resource ones. Furthermore, we have developed a high-quality multi-dialect query generation benchmark that covers relational and non-relational databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, Cypher for Neo4j, and nGQL for NebulaGraph. Extensive experiments have shown that MoMQ performs effectively and robustly even in resource-imbalanced scenarios.</description>

      <title>Output-sensitive Conjunctive Query Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07847v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Join evaluation is one of the most fundamental operations performed by database systems and arguably the most well-studied problem in the Database community. A staggering number of join algorithms have been developed, and commercial database engines use finely tuned join heuristics that take into account many factors including the selectivity of predicates, memory, IO, etc. However, most of the results have catered to either full join queries or non-full join queries but with degree constraints (such as PK-FK relationships) that make joins \emph{easier} to evaluate. Further, most of the algorithms are also not output-sensitive.
  In this paper, we present a novel, output-sensitive algorithm for the evaluation of acyclic Conjunctive Queries (CQs) that contain arbitrary free variables. Our result is based on a novel generalization of the Yannakakis algorithm and shows that it is possible to improve the running time guarantee of the Yannakakis algorithm by a polynomial factor. Importantly, our algorithmic improvement does not depend on the use of fast matrix multiplication, as a recently proposed algorithm does. The upper bound is complemented with matching lower bounds conditioned on two variants of the $k$-clique conjecture. The application of our algorithm recovers known prior results and improves on known state-of-the-art results for common queries such as paths and stars.</description>

      <title>Lightweight Correlation-Aware Table Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14066v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The growing adoption of data lakes for managing relational data necessitates efficient, open storage formats that provide high scan performance and competitive compression ratios. While existing formats achieve fast scans through lightweight encoding techniques, they have reached a plateau in terms of minimizing storage footprint. Recently, correlation-aware compression schemes have been shown to reduce file sizes further. Yet, current approaches either incur significant scan overheads or require manual specification of correlations, limiting their practicability. We present $\texttt{Virtual}$, a framework that integrates seamlessly with existing open formats to automatically leverage data correlations, achieving substantial compression gains while having minimal scan performance overhead. Experiments on data-gov datasets show that $\texttt{Virtual}$ reduces file sizes by up to 40% compared to Apache Parquet.</description>
