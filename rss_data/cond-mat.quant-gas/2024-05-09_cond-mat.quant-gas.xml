      <title>Characterizing Asymptotic Expansions of Quantum Fermi Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize in a novel manner the physical properties of the low temperature Fermi gas in the degenerate domain as a function of temperature and chemical potential. For the first time we obtain low temperature $T$ results in the domain where several fermions are found within a de Broglie spatial cell. In this regime, the usual high degeneracy Sommerfeld expansion fails. The other known semi-classical Boltzmann domain applies when fewer than one particle is found in the de Broglie cell. The relative errors of the three approximate methods (Boltzmann limit, Sommerfeld expansion, and the new domain of several particles in the de Broglie cell) are quantified. In order to extend the understanding of the Sommerfeld expansion, we developed a novel characterization of the Fermi distribution allowing the separation of the finite and zero temperature phenomena.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Higher-Order Topology via Polarized Topological Charges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-space topological invariants were widely used to characterize chiral-symmetric higher-order topological phases (HOTPs). However, a momentum-space characterization to these HOTPs, which essentially reveals their intrinsic bulk-boundary correspondence and facilitates their detection in quantum simulation systems, is still lacking. Here, we propose an experimentally observable momentum-space characterization to the chiral-symmetric HOTPs by the concept of polarized topological charges. It makes a unified description to the HOTPs caused by the closing and reopening of band gap not only of the bulk states but also the edge states. Remarkably, these polarized topological charges can also be identified by measuring the pseudospin structures. A feasible scheme to detect the HOTPs in the $^{87}$Rb atomic system is given. Our work opens an avenue for characterization and experimental detection of the HOTPs in momentum space.</description>

      <title>Systematic analysis of relative phase extraction in one-dimensional Bose gases interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05528v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spatially resolved relative phase measurement of two adjacent 1D Bose gases is enabled by matter-wave interference upon free expansion. However, longitudinal dynamics is typically ignored in the analysis of experimental data. We provide an analytical formula showing a correction to the readout of the relative phase due to longitudinal expansion and mixing with the common phase. We numerically assess the error propagation to the estimation of the gases' physical quantities such as correlation functions and temperature. Our work characterizes the reliability and robustness of interferometric measurements, directing us to the improvement of existing phase extraction methods necessary to observe new physical phenomena in cold-atomic quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Many-Body Mobility Edge in Quantum Sun models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.01073v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum sun model is an interacting model that exhibits sharp signatures of ergodicity breaking phase transition. Here, we show that the model exhibits a many-body mobility edge. We provide analytical arguments for its existence, complemented by the state-of-the-art numerical simulations analysing gap ratios, Thouless times as well as entanglement entropy of eigenstates. We also introduce the quantum sun model with particle number conservation, and we argue that it shares many similarities with his unrestricted predecessor.</description>

      <title>Optical Snake States in Photonic Graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12695v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an optical analogue of electron snake states based on artificial gauge magnetic field in photonic graphene with effective strain implemented by varying distance between pillars. We develop an intuitive and exhaustive continuous model based on tight-binding approximation and compare it with numerical simulations of a realistic photonic structure. The allowed lateral propagation direction is shown to be strongly coupled to the valley degree of freedom and the proposed photonic structure may be used a valley filter.</description>

      <title>Comparison of two different integration methods for the (1+1)-Dimensional Schr\"odinger-Poisson Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04924v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compare two different numerical methods to integrate in time spatially delocalized initial densities using the Schr\"odinger-Poisson equation system as the evolution law. The basic equation is a nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with an auto-gravitating potential created by the wave function density itself. The latter is determined as a solution of Poisson's equation modelling, e.g., non-relativistic gravity. For reasons of complexity, we treat a one-dimensional version of the problem whose numerical integration is still challenging because of the extreme long-range forces (being constant in the asymptotic limit). Both of our methods, a Strang splitting scheme and a basis function approach using B-splines, are compared in numerical convergence and effectivity. Overall, our Strang-splitting evolution compares favourably with the B-spline method. In particular, by using an adaptive time-stepper rather large one-dimensional boxes can be treated. These results give hope for extensions to two spatial dimensions for not too small boxes and large evolution times necessary for describing, for instance, dark matter formation over cosmologically relevant scales.</description>
