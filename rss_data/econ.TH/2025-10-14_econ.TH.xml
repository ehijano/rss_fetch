      <title>Emergence of Homophily under Contextual Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a tractable model to study incentive-compatible homophily under both external environments--such as exogenous shocks or policy constraints--and internal micromotives based on interactive attributes. We propose a set of invariants that capture main features of homophily and the well-defined partition dynamics leading to perfect global homophily. The criteria for homophily formation are characterized via isomorphism. Within this framework, we demonstrate the emergence of macro-complementarity coupled with micro-substitution, where local individuals' utility function is nonlinear and submodular. We discuss two types of financial networks and their differences: hierarchical structure emerges from short-term liquidity transactions, whereas core-periphery structure is based on a stock-based perspective.</description>

      <title>Token is All You Price</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We build a mechanism design framework where a platform designs GenAI models to screen users who obtain instrumental value from the generated conversation and privately differ in their preference for latency. We show that the revenue-optimal mechanism is simple: deploy a single aligned (user-optimal) model and use token cap as the only instrument to screen the user. The design decouples model training from pricing, is readily implemented with token metering, and mitigates misalignment pressures.</description>

      <title>The Strength of Local Structures in Decentralized Network Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I study dynamic network formation games in which agents assign arbitrary values to network structures. Any such game admits an equivalent representation in terms of the values agents assign to its sub-structures, linking local valuations to equilibrium behavior. The game is a potential game precisely when all participants in a structure value it equally, yielding a closed-form stationary distribution. When valuations are restricted to a finite set of repeated sub-structures, or motifs, the model exhibits phase transitions: small changes in motif values cause discontinuous shifts in network density.</description>

      <title>Job insecurity and equilibrium determinacy in a rational expectations, New Keynesian model with asymmetric information. A theoretical analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the importance of this variable in the macroeconomic context, current research on job insecurity remains mainly confined to its non-systemic dimension. The research aim of this paper is to identify the short-run and long-run macroeconomic determinants of job insecurity in the presence of asymmetric information between public and private agents, informative shocks, and different degrees of institutional communication transparency. To accomplish this goal, a small-scale, rational expectations, New Keynesian model is proposed in which limitedly informed households and firms receive a potentially noisy informative signal about the unobservables from fully informed government and central bank. It is found that, notwithstanding the fulfillment of the Taylor principle, if public agents transfer all the available information to the private agents without communication ambiguities, the model admits a unique, stable equilibrium path along which the 'Paradox of Transparency' can emerge. Otherwise, the model's dynamics become unpredictable in terms of equilibrium existence and multiplicity, and job insecurity plays a potentially fundamental role in equilibrium determinacy. Appropriate policy recommendations are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a two-player model of conflict with multiple battlefields -- the novel element is that each of the players has their own network of spillovers so that resources allocated to one battle can be utilized in winning neighboring battles. There exists a unique equilibrium in which the relative probability of a player winning a battle is the product of the ratio of the centrality of the battlefield in the two respective competing networks and the ratio of the relative cost of efforts of the two players. We study the design of networks and characterize networks that maximize total efforts and maximize total utility. Finally, we characterize the equilibrium of a game in which players choose both networks and efforts in the battles.</description>

      <title>Anonymity and strategy-proofness on a domain of single-peaked and single-dipped preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03387v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the problem of locating a public facility on a line in a society where agents have either single-peaked or single-dipped preferences. We consider the domain analyzed in Alcalde-Unzu et al. (2024), where the type of preference of each agent is public information, but the location of her peak/dip as well as the rest of the preference are unknown. We characterize all strategy-proof and type-anonymous rules on this domain. Building on existing results, we provide a two-step characterization": first, the median between the peaks and a collection of fixed values is computed (Moulin, 1980), resulting in either a single alternative or a pair of contiguous alternatives. If the outcome of the median is a pair, we apply a double-quota majority method" in the second step to choose between the two alternatives in the pair (Moulin, 1983). We also show the additional conditions that type-anonymity imposes on the strategy-proof rules characterized by Alcalde-Unzu et al. (2024). Finally, we show the equivalence between the two characterizations.</description>

      <title>Blackwell without Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08709v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a fully prior-free model of experimentation in which the decision maker observes the entire distribution of signals generated by a known experiment under an unknown distribution of the state of the world. One experiment is robustly more informative than another if the decision maker's maxmin expected utility after observing the output of the former is always at least her maxmin expected utility after observing the latter. We show that this ranking holds if and only if the less informative experiment is a linear transformation of the more informative experiment; equivalently, the null space of the more informative experiment is a subset of the null space of the less informative experiment. Our criterion is implied by Blackwell's order but does not imply it, and we show by example that our ranking admits strictly more comparable pairs of experiments than the classical ranking.</description>

      <title>Axiomatic and Probabilistic Foundations for the Hodge-Theoretic Shapley Value</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.15094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.15094v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper establishes a complete theoretical foundation for the Hodge-theoretic extension of the Shapley value introduced by Stern and Tettenhorst (2019). We show that a set of five axioms--efficiency, linearity, symmetry, a modified null-player condition, and an independency principle--uniquely characterize this value across all coalitions, not just the grand coalition. In parallel, we derive a probabilistic representation interpreting each player's value as the expected cumulative marginal contribution along a random walk on the coalition graph. These dual axiomatic and probabilistic results unify fairness and stochastic interpretation, positioning the Hodge-theoretic value as a canonical generalization of Shapley's framework.</description>

      <title>Stablecoins and the Emerging Hybrid Monetary Ecosystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10997v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With market capitalization exceeding USD250 billion by mid-2025, stablecoins have evolved from a crypto-focused innovation into a vital component of the global monetary structure. This paper identifies the characteristics of stablecoins from an analytical perspective and investigates the role of stablecoins in forming a hybrid monetary ecosystem where public (fiat, CBDC) and private (USDC, USDT, DAI) monies coexist. Through a number of econometric analysis models, we find that stablecoins maintain strong peg stability, while each type exhibiting distinctive responses to market variables such as trading volume and capitalization depending on the mechanisms behind. We also introduce a hybrid system design that proposes a two-layer structure, which private stablecoin issuers are backed by central bank reserves, ensuring uniformity, security, and programmability. This model takes advantages of both decentralized finance and payment innovation, while utilizing the Federal Reserve's institutional trust. A case study on the SVB-USDC de-peg event in 2023 illustrates how such a hybrid system could have prevented panic-induced instability through transparent reserves, secured liquidity, and interoperable assets. Through examination of the Dybvig model and simulation, we conclude that a hybrid monetary model not only enhances financial inclusivity, scalability, and dollar utility in digital ecosystems, but it also strengthens systemic resilience, offering a credible blueprint for future digital dollar architectures.</description>
