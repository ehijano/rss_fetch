      <title>Single-site and multi-site solitons of bright matter-waves in optical lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the experimental observation of discrete bright matter-wave solitons with attractive interaction in an optical lattice. Using an accordion lattice with adjustable spacing, we prepare a Bose-Einstein condensate of cesium atoms across a defined number of lattice sites. By quenching the interaction strength and the trapping potential, we generate both single-site and multi-site solitons. Our results reveal the existence and characteristics of these solitons across a range of lattice depths and spacings. We identify stable regions of the solitons, based on interaction strength and lattice properties, and compare these findings with theoretical predictions. Our results provide insights into the quench dynamics and collapse mechanisms, paving the way for further studies on transport and dynamical properties of matter-wave solitons in lattices.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically exact formulas for the stripe domains period in ultrathin ferromagnetic films with out-of-plane anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20373v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive asymptotically exact formulas for the equilibrium magnetic stripe period in ultrathin films with out-of-plane anisotropy that include the full domain wall magnetic dipolar energy. Starting with the reduced two-dimensional micromagnetic model valid for thin films, we obtain the leading order approximation for the energy per unit volume in the vanishing film thickness limit in the case of Bloch and N\'eel wall rotations. Its minimization in the stripe period leads to an analytical expression for the equilibrium period with a prefactor proportional to the Bloch wall width. The constant in the prefactor, related to the long-range dipolar interactions, is carefully evaluated. This results in a remarkable agreement of the stripe domain energy density and stripe period predicted by our analytical formulas with micromagnetic simulations. Our formula can be used to accurately deduce magnetic parameters from the experimental measurements of the stripe period and to systematically predict the equilibrium stripe periods in ultrathin films.</description>

      <title>Spatial moment dynamics and biomass density equations provide complementary, yet limited, descriptions of pattern formation in individual-based simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23125v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spatial patterning is common in ecological systems and has been extensively studied via different modeling approaches. Individual-based models (IBMs) accurately describe nonlinear interactions at the organism level and the stochastic spatial dynamics that drives pattern formation, but their computational cost scales quickly with system complexity, limiting their practical use. Population-level approximations such as spatial moment dynamics (SMD) -- which describe the moments of organism distributions -- and coarse-grained biomass density models have been developed to address this limitation. However, the extent to which these approximated descriptions accurately capture the spatial patterns and population sizes emerging from individual-level simulations remains an open question. We investigate this issue considering a prototypical population dynamics IBM with long-range dispersal and intraspecific competition, for which we derive both its SMD and coarse-grained density approximations. We systematically compare the performance of these two approximations at predicting IBM population abundances and spatial patterns. Our results highlight that SMD and density-based approximations complement each other by correctly capturing these two population features within different parameter regimes. Importantly, we identify regions of the parameter space in which neither approximation performed well, which should encourage the development of more refined IBM approximation approaches.</description>
