      <title>Toricness and smoothness criteria for spherical varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove equivalent numerical conditions for a complete spherical variety to admit a toric structure, and for the smoothness of an arbitrary spherical variety along any given G-orbit. The conditions are in terms of spherical skeletons, a coarse ''subset'' of the Luna-Vust data of a spherical variety. Our smoothness criterion improves upon classical criteria by removing the dependency on external reference tables.</description>

      <title>Regions surrounded by cylinders of real algebraic manifolds and natural decompositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The author has been interested in regions surrounded by cylinders of real algebraic hypersurfaces and their shapes and polynomials associated to them. Here, we formulate and investigate natural decompositions into such cylinders of real algebraic hypersurfaces. Especially, intersections of these cylinders of real algebraic hypersurfaces, which give important information on regions, are investigated via singularity theory.
  This is a kind of natural problems on real geometry. This also comes from construction of explicit real algebraic maps onto explicit regions in real affine spaces on real algebraic manifolds. More generally, we are interested in difficulty in explicit construction of real algebraic objects, where existence and approximation has been well-known, since pioneering studies by Nash and Tognoli, in the latter half of 20th century. This also comes from interest in singularity theory of differentiable, smooth or real algebraic functions and maps, especially, explicit construction.</description>

      <title>Minimal reduction type in classical cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove Yun's minimal reduction conjecture for all classical groups. More precisely, for any topologically nilpotent regular semisimple element $\gamma$, we show that the associated minimal reduction set $\mathrm{RT}_{\mathrm{min}}(\gamma)$ consists of a single nilpotent orbit. This result confirms and extends Yun's earlier work in types A and C, and resolves the remaining cases in types B and D. Moreover, we provide an explicit and effective procedure for determining $\mathrm{RT}_{\mathrm{min}}(\gamma)$.</description>

      <title>Algebraic topology of the Lagrange inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lagrange inversion formula for power series is one of the classical formulas from analysis and combinatorics. A nice geometric interpretation of this formula in terms of the Stasheff polytopes was discovered by Loday. We show that it also admits a natural topological interpretation in terms of the Chern numbers of the complex projective space. The proof is based on our earlier work on the Chern-Dold character in complex cobordism theory and leads to a new derivation of the Lagrange inversion formula. We provide a similar interpretation of the multiplicative inversion formulas in terms of Chern numbers of the smooth theta divisors. We discuss also the general related problem when all Chern numbers of an algebraic variety are divisible by its Euler characteristic.</description>

      <title>The Brauer-Manin obstruction of Symmetric products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article focuses on smooth, projective, and geometrically integral varieties $X$ over a field $k$, whose geometric Picard group $Pic(X_{\overline{k}})$ is torsion-free. We establish an isomorphism$Br(X)/Br(k) \simeq Br_{nr}\bigl(Sym_{X/k}^{n}\bigr)/Br(k)$, where $Sym_{X/k}^{n}$ denotes the $n$-th symmetric product. Using this isomorphism, we investigate the relationship between the Brauer--Manin obstruction to the Hasse principle and weak approximation for rational points on the smooth proejctive model $Sym_{X/k}^{n,sm}$, and the corresponding obstruction for $0$-cycles of degree $n$ on $X$.</description>

      <title>The motivic class of the space of genus $0$ maps to the flag variety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\operatorname{Fl}_{n+1}$ be the variety of complete flags in $\mathbb{A}^{n+1}$ and let $\Omega^{2}_{\beta}(\operatorname{Fl}_{n+1})$ be the space of based maps $f:\mathbb{P}^{1}\to \operatorname{Fl}_{n+1}$ in the class $f_{*}[\mathbb{P}^{1}]=\beta$. We show that under a mild positivity condition on $\beta$, the class of $\Omega^{2}_{\beta}(\operatorname{Fl}_{n+1})$ in $K_{0}(\operatorname{Var})$, the Grothendieck group of varieties, is given by \[ [\Omega^{2}_{\beta}(\operatorname{Fl}_{n+1})] = [\operatorname{GL}_{n}\times \mathbb{A}^{a}]. \]
  The proof of this result was obtained in conjunction with Google Gemini and related tools. We briefly discuss this research interaction, which may be of independent interest. However, the treatment in this paper is entirely human-authored (aside from excerpts in an appendix which are clearly marked as such).</description>

      <title>Irregularities of special C-pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies irregularity-type invariants of special C-pairs, or "geometric orbifolds" in the sense of Campana. Under mild assumptions on the singularities, we show that the augmented irregularity of a C-pair (X,D) is bounded by its dimension. This generalizes earlier results of Campana, and strengthens known results even in the classic case where X is a projective manifold and D = 0. The proof builds on new extension results for adapted forms, analysis of foliations on Albanese varieties, and constructions of Bogomolov sheaves using strict wedge subspaces of adapted forms.</description>

      <title>Pro-\'etale motives and solid rigidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce coefficient systems of pro-\'etale motives and pro-\'etale motivic spectra with coefficients in any condensed ring spectrum and show that they afford the six operations. Over locally \'etale bounded schemes, \'etale motivic spectra embed into pro-\'etale motivic spectra. We then use the framework of condensed category theory to define a solidification process for any $\widehat{\mathbb{Z}}$-linear condensed category. Pro-\'etale motives naturally enhance to a condensed category and we show that their solidification is very close to the category of solid sheaves defined by Fargues-Scholze, suitably modified to work on schemes: this is a rigidity result. As a consequence, we obtain that in contrast with the rigid-analytic setting, solid sheaves on schemes afford the six operations, and we obtain a solid realization functor of motives, extending the $\ell$-adic realization functor. The solid realization functor is compatible with change of coefficients, which allows one to recover the $\mathbb{Q}_\ell$-adic realization functor while remaining in a setting of presentable categories.</description>

      <title>Non-commutative cluster Lagrangians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The space Loc(m,S) of rank m flat bundles on a closed surface S is K_2-symplectic. A threefold M bounding S gives rise a K_2-Lagrangian in Loc(m,S) given by the flat bundles on S extending to M. We generalize this, replacing the zero section in the cotangent bundle to M by certain singular Lagrangians.
  First, we introduce Q-diagrams in threefolds. They are collections Q of smooth cooriented surfaces, intersecting transversally everywhere but in a finite set of quadruple crossing points. We require that shifting any surface of the collection from such a point in the direction of its coorientation creates a simplex with the cooriented out faces. The Q-diagrams are 3d analogs of bipartite ribbon graphs.
  Let L be the Lagrangian in the cotangent bundle to M given by the union of the zero section and the conormal bundles to the cooriented surfaces of Q. Let X(L) be the stack of admissible dg-sheaves on M with the microlocal support in L, whose microlocalization at the conormal bundle to each cooriented surface of Q is a rank one local system.
  We introduce the boundary dL of L. It is a singular Lagrangian in a symplectic space, providing a symplectic stack X(dL), and a restriction functor from X(L) to X(dL). The image of the latter is Lagrangian. We show that, under mild conditions on Q, this Lagrangian has a cluster description, and so it is a K_2-Lagrangian. It also has a simple description in the non-commutative setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the topology of the real algebraic hypersurfaces in $\mathbb{P}^n$ that can be constructed via combinatorial patchworking using triangulations that are dilations by two of other triangulations. By examining the real critical points of the polynomials that define such hypersurfaces, we find some asymptotical upper bounds on various sums of their Betti numbers. We then discuss the sharpness of those bounds.</description>

      <title>On curves of degree 10 with 12 triple points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct an irreducible rational curve of degree 10 in $CP^2$ which has 12 triple points. This gives a counter-example to a conjecture by Dimca, Harbourne, and Sticlaru. We also prove that there exists an analytic family $C_u$ of such curves which converges as $u\to 0$ to the union of the dual Hesse arrangement of lines (9 lines with 12 triple points) with an additional line. We hope that our approach to the proof of the latter fact could be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>The Geometric Origin of the Cayley-Hamilton Theorem: A Constructive Proof via Dimensional Syzygy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the Cayley-Hamilton theorem is a derived consequence of a more fundamental dimensional constraint: the syzygy formed by the tensor product of two Levi-Civita symbols, which vanishes identically in m-dimensional space. By shifting perspective from the tensor A to the isotropic operators that induce A's invariants through contraction, we reveal that the Cayley-Hamilton identity emerges when this vanishing operator acts on the m-fold tensor product of A. The intrinsic tensorial form of the theorem--invariant coefficients multiplying tensor powers--is inherited from the contraction structure rather than imposed ad hoc. We provide explicit verification for two-dimensional space and a dimension-independent proof using Laplace expansion combined with Newton-Girard identities. This framework clarifies why the theorem's structure depends on ambient dimension and suggests extensions to higher-order tensors where classical characteristic polynomial methods fail.</description>

More precisely, we show that, in positive characteristic, homogeneous Herzog ideals define $F$-anti-nilpotent rings, and we inquire, in characteristic 0, on a surprising relationship between being Herzog ideals after a change of coordinates and defining rings of dense open $F$-pure type.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.06532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hurwitz spaces which parametrize branched covers of the line play a prominent role in inverse Galois theory. This paper surveys fifty years of works in this direction with emphasis on recent advances. Based on the Riemann-Hurwitz theory of covers, the geometric and arithmetic setup is first reviewed, followed by the semi-modern developments of the 1990--2010 period: large fields, compactification, descent theory, modular towers. The second half of the paper highlights more recent achievements that have reshaped the arithmetic of Hurwitz spaces, notably via the systematic study of the ring of components. These include the construction of components defined over ${\mathbb Q}$, and the Ellenberg-Venkatesh-Westerland approach to rational points over finite fields, applied to the Cohen-Lenstra heuristics and the Malle conjecture over function fields ${\mathbb F}_q(T)$.</description>

      <title>Fixed points and holomorphic structures on line bundles over the quantum projective line $\mathbb{C}\mathrm{P}_q^1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has recently been observed that, in contrast to the classical case, holomorphic structures on line bundles over the quantum projective line $\mathbb{C}\mathrm{P}_q^1$ are not uniquely determined by degree. In this work, we develop a fixed-point-theoretic framework for the analysis of flat $\overline\partial$-connections that define holomorphic structures on line bundles over the quantum projective line. Within this framework, we establish sufficient conditions ensuring the gauge equivalence of holomorphic connections. Furthermore, we obtain a necessary and sufficient criterion characterising when two such holomorphic connections are gauge equivalent. This criterion is formulated in terms of the existence of fixed points, lying in the open unit ball, of certain nonlinear maps acting on an appropriate Banach space.</description>

Abstract: Deep level Deligne--Lusztig representations, which are natural analogues of classical Deligne--Lusztig representations, recently play an important role in geometrization of irreducible supercuspidals of $p$-adic groups. In this paper, we propose a construction of deep level Deligne--Lusztig varieties/representations in the tamely ramified case, extending previous constructions in the unramified case. As an application, under a mild assumption on the residue field, we show that each regular irreducible supercuspidal is the compact induction of a deep level Deligne--Lusztig representation, and generally, each irreducible supercuspidal is a direct summand of the compact induction of the cohomology of a deep level Deligne--Lusztig variety.</description>

      <title>Center-freeness of finite-step solvable groups arising from anabelian geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anabelian geometry suggests that, for suitably geometric objects, their \'etale fundamental group determines the object up to isomorphism. From a group-theoretic viewpoint, this philosophy requires rigidity properties of the associated \'etale fundamental groups, which often follow from their center-freeness. In fact, some profinite groups arising from anabelian geometry are center-free. In the present paper, we investigate how such center-freeness behaves when passing to maximal $m$-step solvable quotients for any integer $m\geq 2$. In particular, we show that the maximal $m$-step solvable quotient of the geometric \'etale fundamental group of a hyperbolic curve over a field of characteristic $0$ is center-free. Furthermore, we show that this implies the injectivity statement, i.e., the rigidity property, of the $m$-step solvable Grothendieck conjecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a discussion of Jordan decompositions in the Lie algebra, and the dual Lie algebra, of a reductive group in as uniform a way as possible. We give a counterexample to the claim that Jordan decompositions on the dual Lie algebra are unique, and state an upper bound on how non-unique they can be. We also prove some Chevalley-restriction-type claims about GIT quotients for the adjoint and co-adjoint actions of $G$.</description>

      <title>A Coherent Version of Geometric Satake Equivalence for Type A</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we prove a coherent version of geometric Satake equivalence proposed in Cautis-Williams' work arXiv:2306.03023 for type A. In their work, they studied an abelian version of the classical limit Satake category, namely, the Koszul perverse heart of the categorified Coulomb branch for adjoint representations. In this paper we study a subcategory generated by a collection of simple objects. We endow this subcategory with a neutral Tannakian structure and identify it with the finite dimensional representation category $\mathrm{Rep}({\check{G}})$ for the Langlands dual group ${\check{G}}$. Our method uses tools in Cautis-Williams theory and a Hodge module description of the coherent IC extensions of differential sheaves in Xin's work arXiv:2503.14890.</description>

      <title>Frobenius Number Of Almost Symmetric Numerical Generalized Almost Arithmetic Semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let a, k, h, c be positive integers and d a non zero integer. Recall that a numerical generalized almost arithmetic semigroup S is a semigroup minimally generated by relatively prime positive integers a, ha + d, ha + 2d, . . . , ha + kd, c, that is its embedding dimension is k + 2. In a previous work, the authors described the Ap{\'e}ry set and a Gr{\"o}bner basis of the ideal defining S under one technical assumption, the complete version will be published in a forthcoming paper. In this paper we continue with this assumption and we describe the Pseudo Frobenius set. As a consequence we give a complete description of S when it is symmetric or almost symmetric as well as generalize and extend the previous results of Ignacio Garc{\'i}a-Marco, J. L. Ram{\'i}rez Alfons{\'i}n and O. J. R{{\o}}dseth; we also find a quadratic formula for its Frobenius number that generalizes some results of J.C. Rosales, and P.A. Garc{\'i}a-S{\'a}nchez. Moreover, for given numbers a, d, k, h, c, a simple algorithm allows us to determine if S is almost symmetric or not and furthermore to find its type and Frobenius number.</description>

      <title>Geometry of low nonnegative rank matrix completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study completion of partial matrices with nonnegative entries to matrices of nonnegative rank at most $r$ for some $r \in \mathbb{N}$. Most of our results are for $r \leq 3$. We show that a partial matrix with nonnegative entries has a nonnegative rank-1 completion if and only if it has a rank-1 completion. This is not true in general when $r \geq 2$. For $3 \times 3$ matrices, we characterize all the patterns of observed entries when having a rank-2 completion is equivalent to having a nonnegative rank-2 completion. If a partial matrix with nonnegative entries has a rank-$r$ completion that is nonnegative, where $r \in \{1,2\}$, then it has a nonnegative rank-$r$ completion. We will demonstrate examples for $r=3$ where this is not true. We do this by introducing a geometric characterization for nonnegative rank-$r$ completion employing families of nested polytopes which generalizes the geometric characterization for nonnegative rank introduced by Cohen and Rothblum (1993).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study an Aganagic-Vafa brane supported on a special Lagrangian submanifold $\mathcal{L}$ in a non-compact toric Calabi-Yau threefold $\mathcal{X}$. From the perspective of geometric engineering, the Aganagic-Vafa branes give rise to a special class of half-BPS codimension-two defects in 5d $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetric field theories in the presence of $\Omega$-background. We propose that the defect partition functions give generating functions of refined, non-negative, integral open BPS invariants of the pair $(\mathcal{X},\mathcal{L})$, across different K\"{a}hler moduli chambers they are expanded in. In the Nekrasov-Shatashvili limit, the partition function provides a partially resummed solution to a $q$-difference equation that quantizes the mirror curve of $\mathcal{X}$ in an unambiguous fashion, in a polarization determined by the discrete labels of the Aganagic-Vafa brane. We demonstrate our method at examples of $\mathbb{C}^3$, resolved conifold, resolved $A_1$-singularity, local $F_0$, and local $F_1$.</description>

      <title>Moduli of vector bundles on primitive multiple schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.12569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.12569v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A primitive multiple scheme is a Cohen-Macaulay scheme $Y$ such that the associated reduced scheme $X=Y_{red}$ is smooth, irreducible, and that $Y$ can be locally embedded in a smooth variety of dimension $\dim(X)+1$. If $n$ is the multiplicity of $Y$, there is a canonical filtration $X=X_1\subset X_2\subset\cdots\subset X_n=Y$, such that $X_i$ is a primitive multiple scheme of multiplicity $i$. The simplest example is the trivial primitive multiple scheme of multiplicity $n$ associated to a line bundle $L$ on $X$: it is the $n$-th infinitesimal neighborhood of $X$, embedded in the line bundle $L^*$ by the zero section.
  The main subject of this paper is the construction and properties of fine moduli spaces of vector bundles on primitive multiple schemes. Suppose that $Y=X_n$ is of multiplicity $n$, and can be extended to $X_{n+1}$ of multiplicity $n+1$, and let $M_n$ a fine moduli space of vector bundles on $X_n$. With suitable hypotheses, we construct a fine moduli space $M_{n+1}$ for the vector bundles on $X_{n+1}$ whose restriction to $X_n$ belongs to $M_n$. It is an affine bundle over the subvariety $N_n\subset M_n$ of bundles that can be extended to $X_{n+1}$. In general this affine bundle is not banal. This applies in particular to Picard groups.
  We give also many new examples of primitive multiple schemes $Y$ such that the dualizing sheaf $\omega_Y$ is trivial.</description>

      <title>Relative tensor products and Koszul duality in monoidal oo-categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.11861v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This semi-expository work covers central aspects of the theory of relative tensor products as developed in Higher Algebra, as well as their application to Koszul duality for algebras in monoidal oo-categories. Part of our goal is to expand on the rather condensed account of loc. cit. Along the way, we generalize various aspects of the theory. For instance, given a monoidal oo-category Cc, an oo-category Mm which is left-tensored over Cc, and an algebra A in Cc, we construct an action of A-A-bimodules N in Cc on left A-modules M in Mm by an "external relative tensor product" N \otimes_A M. (Up until now, even the special ("internal") case Cc = Mm appears to have escaped the literature.
  As an application, we generalize the Koszul duality of loc. cit. to include modules. Our straightforward approach requires that we at this point assume certain compatibilities between tensor products and limits; these assumptions have recently been shown to be unnecessary in work by Brantner, Campos and Nuiten (arXiv:2104.03870).</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we first prove that every Mori dream surface $X$ satisfies the bounded cohomology property (BCP for short). Namely, there exists a constant $c_X&gt;0$ such that $h^1(\mathcal O_X(C))\le c_Xh^0(\mathcal O_X(C))$ for every curve $C$ on $X$. We then prove that there is a positive constant $m(Y)$ such that $l_C:=(K_Y\cdot C)(C^2)^{-1}\le m(Y)$ for every ample curve $C$ on a geometrically ruled surface $Y$ over a curve of genus $g$, and $Y$ satisfies the BCP if $g\le1$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01363v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $C$ be a completely algebraic closed non-archimedean field over $\mathbb{Q}_p$ and $\alpha,r$ be two positive integers. Denote by $B_\alpha$ the ring $\mathbb{B}_{\mathrm{dR}}^+(C)/(\ker\theta)^\alpha$. This paper first constructs a sheafified $p$-adic Riemann--Hilbert correspondence. Specifically, we construct a canonical sheaf isomorphism on $X_{\mathrm{\acute{e}t}}$, \[ R^1\nu_*\big( \mathrm{GL}_r(\mathbb{B}_{\mathrm{dR}}^+/(\ker\theta)^\alpha) \big) \cong \mathrm{MIC}_{r}(X)\{-1\}, \] where the first term is identified with the sheaf of isomorphism classes of $v$-vector bundles with coefficients in $\mathbb{B}_{\mathrm{dR}}^+/(\ker\theta)^{\alpha}$, and the second term is defined as the sheaf of isomorphism classes of integrable connections of rank $r$.
  We then define the moduli space of integrable connections on $X$ and the moduli space of $v$-vector bundles on $X$ with coefficients in $\mathbb{B}_{\mathrm{dR}}^+/(\ker\theta)^{\alpha}$, and prove that they are small $v$-stacks in the sense of Scholze.
  These constructions generalize Heuer's work on $p$-adic Simpson correspondence.</description>

      <title>Compactly supported $\mathbb{A}^1$-Euler characteristics of symmetric powers of cellular varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08486v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The compactly supported $\mathbb{A}^1$-Euler characteristic, introduced by Hoyois and later refined by Levine and others, is an anologue in motivic homotopy theory of the classical Euler characteristic of complex topological manifolds. It is an invariant on the Grothendieck ring of varieties $\mathrm{K}_0(\mathrm{Var}_k)$ taking values in the Grothendieck-Witt ring $\mathrm{GW}(k)$ of the base field $k$. The former ring has a natural power structure induced by symmetric powers of varieties. In a recent preprint, Pajwani and P\'al construct a power structure on $\mathrm{GW}(k)$ and show that the compactly supported $\mathbb{A}^1$-Euler characteristic respects these two power structures for $0$-dimensional varieties, or equivalently \'etale $k$-algebras. In this paper, we define the class $\mathrm{Sym}_k$ of symmetrisable varieties to be those varieties for which the compactly supported $\mathbb{A}^1$-Euler characteristic respects the power structures and study the algebraic properties of $\mathrm{K}_0(\mathrm{Sym}_k)$. We show that it includes all cellular varieties, and even linear varieties as introduced by Totaro. Moreover, we show that it includes non-linear varieties such as elliptic curves. As an application of our main result, we compute the compactly supported $\mathbb{A}^1$-Euler characteristics of symmetric powers of Grassmannians and certain del Pezzo surfaces.</description>

      <title>A Hodge-Tate decomposition with rigid analytic coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07366v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a smooth proper rigid analytic space over a complete algebraically closed field extension $K$ of $\mathbb{Q}_p$. We establish a Hodge--Tate decomposition for $X$ with $G$-coefficients, where $G$ is any commutative locally $p$-divisible rigid group. This generalizes the Hodge--Tate decomposition of Faltings and Scholze, which is the case $G=\mathbb{G}_a$. For this, we introduce geometric analogs of the Hodge--Tate spectral sequence with general locally $p$-divisible coefficients. We prove that these spectral sequences degenerate at $E_2$. Our results apply more generally to a class of smooth families of commutative adic groups over $X$ and in the relative setting of smooth proper morphisms $X\rightarrow S$ of smooth rigid spaces. We deduce applications to analytic Brauer groups and the geometric $p$-adic Simpson correspondence.</description>

      <title>On Almost Strong Approximation in Reductive Algebraic Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00696v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a slight weakening of the classical property of strong approximation, which we call almost strong approximation, for connected reductive algebraic groups over global fields with respect to special sets of valuations. While nonsimply connected groups (in particular, all algebraic tori) always fail to have strong approximation -- and even almost strong approximation -- with respect to any finite set of valuations, we show that under appropriate assumptions they do have almost strong approximation with respect to certain infinite sets of valuations that can be characterized in terms of Dirichlet density and include tractable sets of valuations, i.e. those sets that contain all archimedean valuations and a generalized arithmetic progression minus a set of Dirichlet density zero. Almost strong approximation is likely to have a variety of applications, and as an example we use almost strong approximation in tori with respect to tractable sets to extend the essential part of the result of Radhika and Raghunathan on the congruence subgroup problem for inner forms of type $\textsf{A}_n$ to all absolutely almost simple simply connected groups. This version of the paper has been updated to reflect recent results of Y. Cao and Y. Wang (arXiv:2511.00824).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15042v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We generalize the equivariant intermediate Jacobian torsor obstruction over $\mathbb{C}$ to algebraically closed fields of characteristic zero. It is an obstruction to the (projective) linearizability problem of finite group actions on threefolds. In addition, we calculate automorphism groups of general smooth Fano threefolds of No. 2.18. As an application, we prove that a general smooth Fano threefold X of No. 2.18 is linearizable for its automorphism group.</description>

      <title>The modified diagonal cycles of Hypergeometric curves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06008v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For each $N\geq 2$, Asakura and Otsubo have recently introduced a smooth family of algebraic curves $\{X_{N,\lambda}\}_{\lambda \in \mathbb{P}^1\setminus \{0, 1, \infty\}}$ in characteristic 0 that is closely related to hypergeometric functions and the Fermat curve of degree $N$. In this paper, we study the Gross-Kudla-Schoen modified diagonal 1-cycles of these curves. We prove that if $p \ge 3$ is a prime, then for every $\lambda$ the Griffiths Abel-Jacobi image of the modified diagonal cycle of $X_{p,\lambda}$ is nontrivial for every cuspidal choice of a base point. On the other hand, we show that the modified diagonal cycle and hence the Ceresa cycle of $X_{3,\lambda}$ is torsion in the Chow group for every $\lambda$ and every choice of a base point.</description>

      <title>The $\mathbb{A}^1$-Euler characteristic of symmetric powers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06922v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $\mathbb{A}^1$-Euler characteristic is a refinement in algebraic geometry of the classical topological Euler characteristic, which can be constructed using motivic homotopy theory. This invariant is a quadratic form rather than an integer, which carries a lot of information, but is difficult to compute in practice. In this survey, we discuss a conjectural way for computing the $\mathbb{A}^1$-Euler characteristic of the symmetric powers of a variety in terms of the $\mathbb{A}^1$-Euler characteristic of the variety itself formulated using the theory of power structures. We discuss evidence towards the conjecture so far, techniques to approach it, and applications.</description>

      <title>Monomial algebras and G_a^n-equivariant embeddings into toric varieties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22820v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An induced additive action on a projective variety $X\subseteq\BP^n$ is a regular action of the group $\BG_a^n$ on $X$ with an open orbit that can be extended to a regular action on~$\BP^n$. Such actions are known to correspond to pairs $(A, U)$, where $A$ is a local algebra and~$U$ is a generating subspace lying in the maximal ideal. This paper studies additive actions on projective toric varieties, with a particular focus on toric surfaces. We prove that for any linearly normal toric variety equipped with a torus-normalized additive action, the associated pair consists of a monomial algebra and a subspace spanned by variables. Also we describe pairs that correspond to additive actions on toric surfaces in low-dimensional projective spaces.</description>

Abstract: We study the collection of measures obtained via push-forward along a map between smooth varieties over p-adic fields. We investigate when the stalks of this collection are finite-dimensional. We provide an algebro-geometric criterion ensuring this property. This criterion is formulated in terms of a canonical subvariety of the cotangent bundle of the source of the map.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a notion of restricted pyramid configurations for computing the 1-leg Donaldson-Thomas $\mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_2$-vertex. We study a special type of restricted pyramid configurations with the prescribed 1-leg partitions, and find one unique class of them satisfying the symmetric interlacing property. This leads us to obtain an explicit formula for a class of 1-leg Donaldson-Thomas $\mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_2$-vertex through establishing its connection with 1-leg Donaldson-Thomas $\mathbb{Z}_4$-vertex using the vertex operator methods of Okounkov-Reshetikhin-Vafa and Bryan-Young.</description>

      <title>Infinitesimal Variations of Hodge Structure for Singular Curves I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04410v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the infinitesimal variation of Hodge structure associated with families of reduced algebraic curves with singularities. The analysis applies to curves beyond the nodal case and is not restricted to plane curves, encompassing curves lying on smooth projective surfaces as well as families with more general isolated singularities. Using deformation-theoretic and residue-theoretic methods, we describe how the infinitesimal period map decomposes into local contributions supported at singular points, together with global constraints arising from the geometry of the normalization. While nodal singularities give rise to nontrivial rank-one contributions, other singularities may contribute only through higher-order local data or may be invisible at the infinitesimal level. As a consequence, we obtain sharp criteria for maximal infinitesimal variation in terms of numerical invariants of the curve, notably when the number of nodes satisfies the inequality $\delta \ge g$, where $g$ denotes the genus of the normalization.
  We extend these results to curves on very general surfaces in projective three-space, showing that maximal variation persists on Picard-rank-one surfaces but fails for sufficiently large genus in the presence of higher ADE singularities. These results extend classical maximality phenomena in infinitesimal Hodge theory to a broader singular and geometric setting.</description>

      <title>A Nomizu-van Est theorem in Ekedahl's derived $\ell$-adic setting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.09744v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A theorem of Nomizu and van Est computes the cohomology of a compact nilmanifold, or equivalently the group cohomology of an arithmetic subgroup of a unipotent linear algebraic group over $\mathbb{Q}$. We prove a similar result for the cohomology of a compact open subgroup of a unipotent linear algebraic group over $\mathbb{Q}_{\ell}$ with coefficients in a complex of continuous $\ell$-adic representations. We work with the triangulated categories defined by Ekedahl which play the role of ``derived categories of continuous $\ell$-adic representations''. This is motivated by Pink's formula computing the derived direct image of an $\ell$-adic local system on a Shimura variety in its minimal compactification, and its application to automorphic perverse sheaves on Shimura varieties. The key technical result is the computation of the cohomology with coefficients in a unipotent representation with torsion coefficients by an explicit complex of polynomial cochains which is of finite type.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17343v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For each integer $d\geq 2$, let $M_d$ denote the moduli space of maps $f: \mathbb{P}^1\to \mathbb{P}^1$ of degree $d$. We study the geometric configurations of subsets of postcritically finite (or PCF) maps in $M_d$. A complex-algebraic subvariety $Y \subset M_d$ is said to be PCF-special if it contains a Zariski-dense set of PCF maps. Here we prove that there are only finitely many positive-dimensional irreducible PCF-special subvarieties in $M_d$ with degree $\leq D$. In addition, there exist constants $N = N(D,d)$ and $B = B(D,d)$ so that for any complex algebraic subvariety $X \subset M_d$ of degree $\leq D$, the Zariski closure $\overline{X\cap\mathrm{PCF}}~$ has at most $N$ irreducible components, each with degree $\leq B$. We also prove generalizations of these results for points with small critical height in $M_d(\bar{\mathbb{Q}})$.</description>

Abstract: Let $\mathbbm{P}^{1,an}$ be the Berkovich projective line over a complete, algebraically closed, non-Archimedean field. Let $\phi$ be a degree $\geq 2$ rational map with potential good reduction, acting on $\mathbbm{P}^{1,an}$. In this article, we study the topology of the fixed locus of $\phi$. we show that the reduction of $\phi$ at its type~II totally ramified fixed point dictates the topological structure of the fixed locus of $\phi$. We give an easily verifiable equivalent criterion for the fixed locus of $\phi$ to be connected as well as an equivalent criterion for the fixed locus of $\phi$ to be finite. Moreover, we provide a sharp upper bound for the number of connected components of the fixed locus of a rational map with potential good reduction.</description>

      <title>The Euler characteristic of $\ell$-adic local systems on $\mathcal{A}_n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00656v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Euler characteristic of $\ell$-adic local systems on the moduli stack $\mathcal{A}_n$ of principally polarized abelian varieties of dimension $n$ associated to algebraic representations of $\mathbf{GSp}_{2n}$, as virtual representations of the absolute Galois group of $\mathbb{Q}$ and the unramified Hecke algebra of $\mathbf{GSp}_{2n}$. To this end we take the last steps of the Ihara-Langlands-Kottwitz method to compute the intersection cohomology of minimal compactifications of Siegel modular varieties in level one, following work of Kottwitz and Morel, proving an unconditional reformulation of Kottwitz' conjecture in this case. This entails proving the existence of $\mathrm{GSpin}$-valued Galois representations associated to certain level one automorphic representations for $\mathbf{PGSp}_{2n}$ and $\mathbf{SO}_{4n}$. As a consequence we prove the existence of $\mathrm{GSpin}$-valued Galois representations associated to level one Siegel eigenforms, a higher genus analogue of theorems of Deligne (genus one) and Weissauer (genus two). Using Morel's work and Franke's spectral sequence we derive explicit formulas expressing the Euler characteristic of compactly supported cohomology of automorphic $\ell$-adic local systems on Siegel modular varieties in terms of intersection cohomology. Specializing to genus three and level one, we prove an explicit conjectural formula of Bergstr\"om, Faber and van der Geer for the compactly supported Euler characteristic in terms of spin Galois representations associated to level one Siegel cusp forms. Specializing to trivial local systems we give explicit formulas for the number of points of $\mathcal{A}_n$ over finite fields for all $n \leq 7$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17666v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The wild de Rham spaces parameterize isomorphism classes of (stable) meromorphic connections, defined on principal bundles over wild Riemann surfaces. Working on the Riemann sphere, we will deformation-quantize the standard open part of de Rham spaces, which corresponds to the moduli of linear ordinary differential equations with meromorphic coefficients. We treat the general untwisted/unramified case with nonresonant semisimple formal residue, for any polar divisor and reductive structure group. The main ingredients are: (i) constructing the quantum Hamiltonian reduction of a (tensor) product of quantized coadjoint orbits in dual truncated-current Lie algebras, involving the corresponding category-O Verma modules; and (ii) establishing sufficient conditions on the coadjoint orbits, so that generically all meromorphic connections are stable, and the (semiclassical) moment map for the gauge-group action is faithfully flat.</description>

      <title>The splitting field and generators of the elliptic surface $Y^2=X^3 +t^{360} +1$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.25009v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The splitting field of an elliptic surface $\mathcal{E}/\mathbb{Q}(t)$ is the smallest finite extension $\mathcal{K} \subset \mathbb{C}$ such that all $\mathbb{C}(t)$-rational points are defined over $\mathcal{K}(t)$. In this paper, we provide a symbolic algorithmic approach to determine the splitting field and a set of $68$ linearly independent generators for the Mordell--Weil lattice of Shioda's elliptic surface $Y^2=X^3 +t^{360} +1$. This surface is noted for having the largest known rank 68 for an elliptic curve over $\mathbb{C}(t)$.
  Our methodology utilizes the known decomposition of the Mordell-Weil Lattice of this surface into Lattices of ten rational elliptic surfaces and one $K3$ surface. We explicitly compute the defining polynomials of the splitting field, which reach degrees of 1728 and 5760, and verify the results via height pairing matrices and specialized symbolic software packages.</description>
