      <title>The Climatological Relationship Between United States Tornadoes and Extratropical Cyclones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tornadoes have caused billions of dollars in damage and are one of the leading causes of weather-related deaths in the United States each year. Tornadoes are known to frequently form in the warm sector of extratropical cyclones (ETCs), yet relatively little research exists quantifying the climatological relationship between the two phenomena and their covariability. This work analyzes the climatology of F/EF1+ tornadoes relative to ETCs (ETCTORs) using historical databases of tornadoes and hourly ETC centers for 1980-2022. Most tornadoes (72\%) occurred broadly to the southeast of an ETC center within 2000km, with a median distance of approximately 500km. Of those tornadoes, 69\% occurred in outbreaks of 6+ tornadoes. The spatial and ETC-relative distributions are similar across all intensity levels. Through the seasonal cycle, tornadoes shift north and south along with ETCs and the jet stream, and they are much more strongly (weakly) associated with ETCs in the winter (76\%; summer 38\%) when the jet stream and ETCs are strongest (weakest). Finally, median tornado and tornado-producing ETC locations covary strongly with one another interannually. A long-term eastward trend in tornado-producing ETCs mirrors the eastward trend in tornadoes found in recent work, suggesting that this shift may be driven by spatial shifts in ETC tracks. This work identifies a strong link between tornado and ETC activity over the U.S. that warrants deeper analysis of their role in generating tornadic environments in a warming world.</description>

      <title>EarthLink: A Self-Evolving AI Agent for Climate Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17311v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern Earth science is at an inflection point. The vast, fragmented, and complex nature of Earth system data, coupled with increasingly sophisticated analytical demands, creates a significant bottleneck for rapid scientific discovery. Here we introduce EarthLink, the first AI agent designed as an interactive copilot for Earth scientists. It automates the end-to-end research workflow, from planning and code generation to multi-scenario analysis. Unlike static diagnostic tools, EarthLink can learn from user interaction, continuously refining its capabilities through a dynamic feedback loop. We validated its performance on a number of core scientific tasks of climate change, ranging from model-observation comparisons to the diagnosis of complex phenomena. In a multi-expert evaluation, EarthLink produced scientifically sound analyses and demonstrated an analytical competency that was rated as comparable to specific aspects of a human junior researcher's workflow. Additionally, its transparent, auditable workflows and natural language interface empower scientists to shift from laborious manual execution to strategic oversight and hypothesis generation. EarthLink marks a pivotal step towards an efficient, trustworthy, and collaborative paradigm for Earth system research in an era of accelerating global change. The system is accessible at our website https://earthlink.intern-ai.org.cn.</description>

      <title>Causal Mechanisms of Subpolar Gyre Variability in CMIP6 Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16541v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The subpolar gyre is at risk of crossing a tipping point under future climate change associated with the collapse of deep convection. As such tipping can have significant climate impacts, it is important to understand the mechanisms at play and how they are represented in modern climate models. In this study we use causal inference to investigate the representation of several proposed mechanisms of subpolar gyre variability in CMIP6 models. As expected, an increase in sea surface salinity or a decrease in sea surface temperature leads to an increase in mixed layer depth in nearly all CMIP6 models due to an intensification of deep convection. However, the effect of convection to modify sea surface temperature due to re-stratification is less clear. In most models the deepening of the mixed layer caused by an increase of sea surface salinity, does result in a cooling of the water at intermediate depths. The feedback from the subsurface temperature through density to the strength of the subpolar gyre circulation is more ambiguous, with fewer models indicating a significant link. Those that do show a significant link, do not agree on its sign. The CMIP6 models that have the expected sign for the links from density to the subpolar gyre strength and on to sea surface salinity, are also the models in which abrupt shifts in the subpolar gyre region have been found in climate change scenario runs. One model (CESM2) contains all proposed mechanisms, with both a negative and delayed positive feedback loop being significant.</description>

      <title>A Physically Driven Long Short Term Memory Model for Estimating Snow Water Equivalent over the Continental United States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20129v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Snow is an essential input for various land surface models. Seasonal snow estimates are available as snow water equivalent (SWE) from process-based reanalysis products or locally from in situ measurements. While the reanalysis products are computationally expensive and available at only fixed spatial and temporal resolutions, the in situ measurements are highly localized and sparse. To address these issues and enable the analysis of the effect of a large suite of physical, morphological, and geological conditions on the presence and amount of snow, we build a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, which is able to estimate the SWE based on time series input of the various physical/meteorological factors as well static spatial/morphological factors. Specifically, this model breaks down the SWE estimation into two separate tasks: (i) a classification task that indicates the presence/absence of snow on a specific day and (ii) a regression task that indicates the height of the SWE on a specific day in the case of snow presence. The model is trained using physical/in situ SWE measurements from the SNOw TELemetry (SNOTEL) snow pillows in the western United States. We will show that trained LSTM models have a classification accuracy of $\geq 93\%$ for the presence of snow and a coefficient of correlation of $\sim 0.9$ concerning their SWE estimates. We will also demonstrate that the models can generalize both spatially and temporally to previously unseen data.</description>
