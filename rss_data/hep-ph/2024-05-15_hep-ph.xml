      <title>Chiral properties of the nucleon interpolating current and $\theta$-dependent observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the chiral properties of nucleon interpolating currents, and show that of the two leading order currents $j_1$ and $j_2$, only two linear combinations $j_1\pm j_2$ transform covariantly under the anomalous $U(1)_A$ symmetry. As a result, calculations of quantities which vanish by symmetry in the chiral limit may produce unphysical results if carried out with different linear combinations of the currents. This includes observables such as electric dipole moments, induced by the QCD parameter $\theta$, and the $\theta$-dependence of the nucleon mass. For completeness, we also exhibit the leading order results for nucleon electric dipole moments ($d_{n,p}$) induced by $\theta$, and the nucleon magnetic moments ($\mu_{n,p}$), when calculated using QCD sum rules for both the covariant choices of the nucleon interpolating current. The results in each channel, conveniently expressed as the ratios, $d_{n,p}/\mu_{n,p}$, are numerically consistent, and reflect the required physical dependence on $\theta$.</description>

      <title>Discovering Electroweak Interacting Dark Matter at Muon Colliders using Soft Tracks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Minimal Dark Matter models feature one neutral particle that serves as a thermal relic dark matter candidate, as well as quasi-degenerate charged states with TeV masses. When the charged states are produced at colliders, they can decay into dark matter and a low-momentum (soft) charged particle, which is challenging to reconstruct at hadron colliders. We demonstrate that a 3 TeV Muon Collider is capable of detecting these soft tracks, enabling the discovery of thermal Higgsinos and similar dark matter candidates which constitute highly motivated scenarios for future collider searches.</description>

      <title>Multifield Stochastic Dynamics in GUT Hybrid Inflation and Gravitational Wave Signatures of GUT Higgs Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the hybrid inflation model within the framework of the Grand Unified Theory (GUT), focusing on cases where the waterfall phase transition extends over several e-foldings to dilute monopoles. Considering the stochastic effects of quantum fluctuations, we demonstrate that the waterfall fields (i.e., GUT Higgs) maintain a nonzero vacuum expectation value around the waterfall phase transition. By accurately accounting for the number of degrees of freedom of the GUT Higgs field, we establish that these fluctuations can produce observable gravitational waves without leading to an overproduction of primordial black holes. The amplitude of these gravitational waves is inversely proportional to the degrees of freedom of the waterfall fields, thereby providing a unique method to probe the representation of the GUT Higgs.</description>

      <title>HepLean: Digitalising high energy physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce HepLean, an open-source project to digitalise definitions, theorems, proofs, and calculations in high energy physics using the interactive theorem prover Lean 4. HepLean has the potential to benefit the high energy physics community in four ways: making it easier to find existing results, allowing the creation of new results using artificial intelligence and automated methods, allowing easy review of papers for mathematical correctness, and providing new ways to teach high energy physics. We will discuss these in detail. We will also demonstrate the digitalisation of three areas of high energy physics in HepLean: Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrices in flavour physics, local anomaly cancellation, and Higgs physics.</description>

      <title>Numerical Analysis of Resonant Axion-Photon Mixing: Part I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many present-day axion searches attempt to probe the mixing of axions and photons, which occurs in the presence of an external magnetic field. While this process is well-understood in a number of simple and idealized contexts, a strongly varying or highly inhomogeneous background can impact the efficiency and evolution of the mixing in a non-trivial manner. In an effort to develop a generalized framework for analyzing axion-photon mixing in arbitrary systems, we focus in this work on directly solving the axion-modified form of Maxwell's equations across a simulation domain with a spatially varying background. We concentrate specifically on understanding resonantly enhanced axion-photon mixing in a highly magnetized plasma, which is a key ingredient for developing precision predictions of radio signals emanating from the magnetospheres of neutron stars. After illustrating the success and accuracy of our approach for simplified limiting cases, we compare our results with a number of analytic solutions recently derived to describe mixing in these systems. We find that our numerical method demonstrates a high level of agreement with one, but only one, of the published results. Interestingly, our method also recovers the mixing between the axion and magnetosonic-t and Alfv\'{e}n modes; these modes cannot escape from the regions of dense plasma, but could non-trivially alter the dynamics in certain environments. Future work will focus on extending our calculations to study resonant mixing in strongly variable backgrounds, mixing in generalized media (beyond the strong magnetic field limit), and the mixing of photons with other light bosonic fields, such as dark photons.</description>

      <title>A Dark Matter Fermionic Quantum Fluid from Standard Model Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a model of dark matter as a superconducting fluid of Cooper pairs of right handed neutrinos or of vector-like quarks. The superconducting dark matter is induced by attractive channels in the Standard Model Higgs and color sectors of the Standard Model, respectively. We show that, for each case, the solution to the gap equation provides viable dark matter candidates for suitable chemical potential values. The mechanism yields an ultra-light neutrino condensate with a mass of $m_{\rm DM} \sim 10^{-19} \text{eV}$ or a vector-like quark condensate with wide range of possible masses. Both cosmological and particle physics constraints on the model lead to a connection between the number of effective relativistic species $N_{\rm eff}$, and the chemical potential and CMB temperature at the time of fermion creation. We also find a relation between the superconducting fermion and baryon densities, with implications for the coincidence between the dark matter and baryon densities in standard cosmology. Given the natural $\text{eV}$ scale of neutrinos, this mechanism may have implications for the Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>Probing Heavy Neutrino Magnetic Moments at the LHC using Long-Lived Particle Searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore long-lived particle (LLP) searches using non-pointing photons at the LHC as a probe for sterile-to-sterile and active-to-sterile transition magnetic dipole moments of sterile neutrinos. We consider heavy sterile neutrinos with masses ranging from a few~GeV to several hundreds of GeV. We discuss transition magnetic dipole moments using the Standard Model effective field theory and low-energy effective field theory extended by sterile neutrinos ($N_R$SMEFT and $N_R$LEFT) and also provide a simplified UV complete model example. LLP searches at the LHC using non-pointing photons will probe sterile-to-sterile dipole moments two orders of magnitude below the current best constraints from LEP, while an unprecedented sensitivity to sterile neutrino mass of about 700 GeV is expected for active-to-sterile dipole moments. For the UV-model example with one-loop transition magnetic moments, the searches for charged lepton flavour violating processes in synergy with LLP searches at the LHC can probe new physics at several TeV mass scales and provide valuable insights into the lepton flavour structure of new physics couplings.</description>

      <title>Direct CKM determination from W decays at future lepton colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We project the reach of future lepton colliders for measuring CKM elements from direct observations of $W$ decays. We focus our attention to $|V_{cs}|$ and $|V_{cb}|$ determinations, using FCC-ee as case study. We employ state-of-the-art jet flavor taggers to obtain the projected sensitivity, and scan over tagger performances to show their effect. We conclude that future lepton collider can sizeably improve the sensitivity on $|V_{cs}|$ and $|V_{cb}|$, albeit the achievable reach will strongly depend on the level of systematic uncertainties on tagger parameters.</description>

      <title>Radiative Corrections to Light Thermal Pseudo-Dirac Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light thermal dark matter has emerged as an attractive theoretical possibility and a promising target for discovery at experiments in the near future. Such scenarios generically invoke mediators with very small couplings to the Standard Model, but moderately strong couplings within the dark sector, calling into question theoretical estimates based on the lowest order of perturbation theory. As an example, we focus on a scenario in which (pseudo)-Dirac fermion dark matter is connected to the standard model via a dark photon charged under a new $U(1)^{\prime}$ extension of the standard model, and we investigate the impact of the next-to-leading order corrections to annihilation and scattering. We find that radiative corrections can significantly impact model predictions for the relic density and scattering cross-section, depending on the strength of the dark sector coupling and ratio of the dark matter to mediator mass. We also show why factorization into the yield parameter $Y$ typically presented in literature leads to imprecision. Our results are necessary to accurately map experimental searches into the model parameter space and assess their ability to reach thermal production targets.</description>

      <title>Incorporating Physical Priors into Weakly-Supervised Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new machine-learning-based anomaly detection strategy for comparing data with a background-only reference (a form of weak supervision). The sensitivity of previous strategies degrades significantly when the signal is too rare or there are many unhelpful features. Our Prior-Assisted Weak Supervision (PAWS) method incorporates information from a class of signal models in order to significantly enhance the search sensitivity of weakly supervised approaches. As long as the true signal is in the pre-specified class, PAWS matches the sensitivity of a dedicated, fully supervised method without specifying the exact parameters ahead of time. On the benchmark LHC Olympics anomaly detection dataset, our mix of semi-supervised and weakly supervised learning is able to extend the sensitivity over previous methods by a factor of 10 in cross section. Furthermore, if we add irrelevant (noise) dimensions to the inputs, classical methods degrade by another factor of 10 in cross section while PAWS remains insensitive to noise. This new approach could be applied in a number of scenarios and pushes the frontier of sensitivity between completely model-agnostic approaches and fully model-specific searches.</description>

      <title>Preheating with deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply deep learning techniques to the late-time turbulent regime in a post-inflationary model where a real scalar inflaton field and the standard model Higgs doublet interact with renormalizable couplings between them. After inflation, the inflaton decays into the Higgs through a trilinear coupling and the Higgs field subsequently thermalizes with gauge bosons via its $SU(2)\times U(1)$ gauge interaction. Depending on the strength of the trilinear interaction and the Higgs self-coupling, the effective mass squared of Higgs can become negative, leading to the tachyonic production of Higgs particles. These produced Higgs particles would then share their energy with gauge bosons, potentially indicating thermalization. Since the model entails different non-perturbative effects, it is necessary to resort to numerical and semi-classical techniques. However, simulations require significant costs in terms of time and computational resources depending on the model used. Particularly, when $SU(2)$ gauge interactions are introduced, this becomes evident as the gauge field redistributes particle energies through rescattering processes, leading to an abundance of UV modes that disrupt simulation stability. This necessitates very small lattice spacings, resulting in exceedingly long simulation runtimes. Furthermore, the late-time behavior of preheating dynamics exhibits a universal form by wave kinetic theory. Therefore, we analyze patterns in the flow of particle numbers and predict future behavior using CNN-LSTM (Convolutional Neural Network combined with Long Short-Term Memory) time series analysis. In this way, we can reduce our dependence on simulations by orders of magnitude in terms of time and computational resources.</description>

      <title>Modular Invariant Hilltop Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we show that it is possible to achieve successful hilltop inflation in which the inflaton is identified as the modulus field in a modular invariant theory. The dilaton plays a crucial role in shaping the potential. Modular invariant gaugino condensation provides the mechanism for the modulus stabilisation after inflation. The inflationary trajectory lies on the lower boundary of the fundamental domain of the modulus field $\tau$. Inflation starts near the fixed point $\tau ={\rm i}$, and ends at a point near $\tau = \omega$, which is the global de Sitter vacuum. We investigate the allowed parameter space for successful modular invariant hilltop inflation.</description>

      <title>Tetraquarks from Intrinsic Heavy Quarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A number of new four-quark states containing from one to four charm or anti-charm quarks have been observed recently. Many of these new states have been discovered at the LHC. The production of these states via intrinsic charm in the proton is investigated. The tetraquark masses obtained in this approach, while dependent on the internal transverse momenta of the partons in the state, are shown to agree well with the measured masses. These calculations can provide some insight into the nature of the tetraquark candidates, whether as a bound meson pair or as a looser configuration of four individual partons. The kinematic distributions of these states as a function of rapidity and transverse momentum are also studied. The possible cross sections for these states are finally considered.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Signatures and Phase Transitions in High-Energy Au-Au Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we systematically investigate the dynamics of various hadrons namely \( \pi^+ \), \( \pi^- \), \( K^+ \), \( K^- \), \( p \), \( \bar{p} \), \( \Lambda \), \( \bar{\Lambda} \), \( \Xi^- \) and \( \bar{\Xi}^+ \) produced in central Au-Au collisions. We analyze data of AGS and RHIC, which span a broad range of collision energies, ranging from \( \sqrt{s_{NN}}\) = 1.9 to 200 GeV. To analyze the transverse momentum (\( p_T \)) and transverse mass (\( m_T \)) distributions, we employ a two-component standard distribution function, achieving a very good representation of the experimental data across these energy regimes. We extract key thermodynamic parameters, including the effective temperature \( T \), the mean transverse momentum \( \langle p_T \rangle \), and the initial temperature \( T_i \), and analyze their dependence on the values of collision energy and particle mass. Our findings reveal a distinct transition behaviour around \( \sqrt{s_{NN}} = 19.6 \) GeV. Below \( \sqrt{s_{NN}} = 19.6 \) GeV, the values of \( T \), \( \langle p_T \rangle \), and \( T_i \) increase monotonically for all hadrons due to higher energy transfer into the system. Above this energy threshold, these extracted parameters plateau, suggesting that the additional energy is utilized as latent heat for phase transition rather than increasing the system's temperature. These observations delineate two distinct regions: a hadron-dominated region at lower energies and a parton-dominated region at higher energies, each potentially indicative of different phases of matter, with the latter possibly signalling the onset of a Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP). The study thus provides critical insights into the complex interplay of thermodynamics, phase transitions, and particle interactions in high-energy Au-Au collisions.</description>

      <title>Mass spectra of strange double charm pentaquarks with strangeness $S=-1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The observation of the $T_{c\bar{s}}(2900)$ indicates the potential existence of strange double charm pentaquarks based on the heavy antidiquark symmetry. We systematically study the mass spectra of strange double charm pentaquarks with strangeness $S=-1$ in both molecular and compact structures for quantum numbers $J^{P}=1/2^{-}$, $3/2^{-}$, $5/2^{-}$. By constructing the interpolating currents, the mass spectra can be extracted from the two-point correlation functions in the framework of QCD sum rule method. In the molecular picture, we find that the $\Xi_c^+D^{\ast +}$, $\Xi_c^{'+}D^{\ast +}$, $\Xi_{c}^{\ast +}D^{\ast +}$, $\Xi_{cc}^{\ast ++}K^{\ast 0}$ and $\Omega_{cc}^{\ast ++}\rho^0$ may form molecular strange double charm pentaquarks. In both pictures, the masses of the $J^P=1/2^-, 3/2^-$ pentaquarks locate within the $4.2-4.6~\mathrm{GeV}$ and $4.2-4.5~\mathrm{GeV}$ regions, respectively. As all of them are above the thresholds of their strong decay channels, they behave as a broad state, making them challenging to be detected in experiment. On the contrary, the mass of the $J^P=5/2^-$ strange double charm pentaquark is located at $4.3~\mathrm{GeV}$ and below its strong decay channel. This makes it as a narrow state and easy to be identified in experiment. The best observed channel is its semi-leptonic decay to double charm baryon. As the result, we strongly suggest experiments to search for $J^P=5/2^-$ strange double charm pentaquarks as a first try.</description>

      <title>Quantum tomography with $\tau$ leptons at the FCC-ee</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Future Circular Collider (FCC) -- in its first incarnation as a lepton collider -- will produce, according to the proposed design, more than 100 billion pairs of $\tau$ leptons after working for four years at the energy of the $Z$-boson resonance. The $\tau$ lepton is special because its relatively long lifetime makes it possible to reconstruct the momenta of neutrinos emitted in the single pion decay mode. The resulting large number of events is an ideal source for a full quantum tomography of the process that will test quantum entanglement and the violation of Bell inequality with unprecedented precision. In addition, the study of polarizations and spin correlations can provide a competitive determination of the Weinberg angle $ \theta_W$ and constrain possible anomalous couplings in the neutral electroweak current. We utilize analytic results and Monte Carlo simulations to explore to what extent these goals might be accomplished.</description>

      <title>Evidence of the low-lying baryon $\Sigma^*(1/2^-)$ in the process $\Lambda_c^+\to \eta\pi^+\Lambda$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the Belle measurements of the process $\Lambda_c^+\to \eta\pi^+\Lambda$, we investigate this process by considering the contributions from the $\Lambda(1670)$, $a_0(980)$, and $\Sigma(1385)$. In addition, we also consider the predicted low-lying baryon $\Sigma^*(1/2^-)$. Our results involving the $\Sigma^*(1/2^-)$ are favored by fitting to the Belle data of the $\eta\Lambda$ and $\pi^+\Lambda$ invariant mass distributions. Furthermore, we predict the $\eta\pi^+$ invariant mass distribution and the angular distribution $d\Gamma/d{\rm cos}\theta$, which are significantly different depending on whether or not the contribution from the $\Sigma^*(1/2^-)$ is considered. Finally, we show that, with the contribution from the $\Sigma^*(1/2^-)$, the calculated Dalizt plot agrees with the Belle measurements. Future precise measurements of the process $\Lambda_c^+\to \eta\pi^+\Lambda$ could shed further light on the existence of the low-lying $\Sigma^*(1/2^-)$.</description>

      <title>Tentative estimates of $\mathcal{B}(X(3872)\to\pi^0\pi^0\chi_{c1})$ and $\mathcal{B}(X(3872)\to\pi^+\pi^-\chi_{c1})$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rates of the $X(3872)\to\pi^0\pi^0\chi_{c1}$ and $X(3872)\to \pi^+\pi^-\chi_{c1}$ decays are estimated in the model of the triangle loop diagrams with charmed $D^*\bar DD$ and $\bar D^*D\bar D$ mesons in the loops. There are the triangle logarithmic singularities in the physical region of the $X(3872)\to\pi^0\pi^0 \chi_{c1}$ decay which manifest themselves as narrow peaks in the $\pi^0\chi_{c1}$ mass spectrum near the $D^0\bar D^0$ threshold. The model predicts approximately the same branching fractions of the $X(3872)\to\pi^0\pi^0 \chi_{c1}$ and $X(3872)\to\pi^+\pi^-\chi_{c1}$ decays at the level of about (0.8-1.7)$\times10^{-4}$. A distinct prediction of the model is the value of the ratio $\mathcal{R}= \mathcal{B}(X(3872)\to\pi^+\pi^-\chi_{c1})/\mathcal{B}(X(3872) \to\pi^0\pi^0\chi_{c1})\approx1.1$. It weakly depends on the $X(3872)$ resonance parameters and indicates a significant violation of the isotopic symmetry according to which one would expect $\mathcal{R}=2$.</description>

      <title>Origin and detection of nontopological soliton dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Macroscopic dark matter like nontopological solitons can form either via the fusion and accumulation of free particles or during cosmological phase transitions. Both mechanisms can create dark matter with large masses ranging from TeV to solar mass. This can lead to interesting targets in direct detection, astrophysical, and cosmological searches.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore how the electric conductivity and associated relaxation time are modified near the QCD critical point and the phase transition to a color superconducting phase using the two-flavor Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model with finite current quark masses. We give a comprehensive account of the nature of the soft modes associated with these phase transitions and how they affect the photon self-energy when the system approaches these phase transitions in a combined way with an emphasis on the common and different aspects in the two transitions. The formalism developed for describing the paraconductivity in metallic superconductors is used for the analysis of the photon self-energy. We show that the transport coefficients calculated from the self-energy show anomalous enhancements in both cases with different critical exponents for the individual transitions. We briefly discuss the possibility of detecting the enhancements in the relativistic heavy-ion collisions
  in the present and future facilities.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a general form of the UV-completed Friedberg-Lee-Sirlin (FLS) model. As can be seen from the mechanical interpretation, UV-completion allows thin-wall approximation for non-topological solitons. The 1-loop renormalized effective potential for the UV-completed FLS model is constructed under the assumption of mass hierarchy. By special choice of parameters, we studied how the Coleman-Weinberg mechanism induces a new mass scale $\omega_{-}$ in the classical FLS model. It can be expounded in terms of a stable condensate. As a consequence, the asymptotic of a non-topological soliton's energy at large charge is changed from $\sim Q^{3/4}$ to the linear law.</description>

      <title>How to fit PDFs in the presence of new physics?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interpretation of LHC data, and the assessment of possible hints of new physics, require the precise knowledge of the proton structure in terms of parton distribution functions (PDFs). I present a methodology designed to determine whether and how global PDF fits might inadvertently 'fit away' signs of new physics in the high-energy tails of the distributions. I showcase a scenario for the High-Luminosity LHC, in which the PDFs may completely absorb such signs of new physics, thus biasing theoretical predictions and interpretations. I discuss strategies to single out the effects in this scenario and disentangle the inconsistencies that stem from them. This study brings to light the synergy between the high luminosity programme at the LHC and present and future low-energy non-LHC measurements of large-sea quark distributions. I also present the potential of fitting simultaneously the PDFs and the new physics signals.</description>

      <title>Tri-resonant leptogenesis from modular symmetry neutrino models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we have studied the consequences of some representative modular symmetry neutrino models for tri-resonant leptogenesis (which is realized by having three nearly degenerate right-handed neutrinos). To be specific, we have considered modular ${\rm A}^{}_4$, ${\rm S}^{}_4$ and ${\rm A}^{}_5$ symmetry models that have a right-handed neutrino mass matrix $M^{}_{\rm R}$ as shown in Eq.~(\ref{5}) which gives three degenerate right-handed neutrino masses and consequently prohibits the leptogenesis mechanism to work. For these models, we have considered two minimal ways to generate the desired small mass splittings among the three right-handed neutrinos: one scenario is to modify $M^{}_{\rm R}$ to a form as shown in Eq.~(\ref{7}), while another scenario is to consider the renormalization-group corrections for the right-handed neutrino masses. In the former scenario, for the considered models, the observed value of $\eta^{}_{\rm B}$ can always be successfully reproduced for appropriate values of $\mu$. But in the latter scenario not all the considered models can successfully reproduce the observed value of $\eta^{}_{\rm B}$.</description>

Abstract: We perform the analysis of elastic scattering $pp$ and $\bar{p}p$ data at low momentum transfer $|t|&lt;0.1$ GeV$^2$ within large collider energy interval $\sqrt{s}=50$ GeV - 13 TeV in order to evaluate quantitatively the possible Odderon contribution. We use the two-channel eikonal model, which naturally accounts for the screening of the Odderon amplitude by $C$-even (Pomeron) exchanges.</description>

      <title>Refined determination of the weak mixing angle at low energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The weak mixing angle is a fundamental parameter of the electroweak theory of the standard model whose measurement in the low-energy regime is still not precisely determined. Different probes are sensitive to its value, among which atomic parity violation, coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering and parity-violating electron scattering on different nuclei. In this work, we attempt for the first time to combine all these various determinations by performing a global fit that also keeps into account the unavoidable dependence on the experimentally poorly known neutron distribution radius of the nuclei employed, for which a new measurement using proton-cesium elastic scattering became available. By using all present direct determinations of the neutron distribution radius of cesium we find $\sin^2\!\vartheta_{W} =0.2396^{+0.0020}_{-0.0019}$, which should supersede the previous value determined from atomic parity violation on cesium. When including electroweak only, but also indirect, determinations of the neutron distribution radius of cesium the uncertainty reduces to 0.0017 maintaining the same central value, showing an excellent agreement independently of the method used.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exact analytic form of cross sections including initial state radiation with Kuraev-Fadin radiative function are obtained for $e^+e^-$ annihilation around a resonance. Despite accounting for vacuum polarization and center-of-mass energy spread effects, the precision remains below 0.1\%, meeting the accuracy requirements of quantum electrodynamics corrections up to $\mathcal{O}(\alpha^2)$. The analytic forms lead to an enhancement in the precision of experimental measurements of physical parameters, such as branching fractions, and demonstrate significantly improved computational efficiency in the regression procedures.</description>

      <title>Study of possible $DND^*$ bound states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We start from a recently favored picture in which the $\Lambda_c(2940)$ and $\Lambda_c(2910)$ correspond mostly to $ND^*$ bound states with $J^P = 1/2^-,\, 3/2^-$ and then add a $D$ as a third particle, looking for the possible binding of the $DND^*$ three body system within the framework of the Fixed Center Approximation. We find that the system is bound with respect to the corresponding $\Lambda_c^* D$ threshold with a binding of about $60$ MeV and a width of about $90$ MeV. Alternatively we assume a cluster of $ND$ and a $D^*$ meson interacting with the cluster and we find similar results. The observation of these states of $J^P = 1/2^+,\, 3/2^+$ would provide new and valuable information concerning the $DN$ and $D^* N$ interaction, an issue of current debate.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic properties of a relativistic Bose gas under rigid rotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the thermodynamic properties of a rigidly rotating relativistic Bose gas. First, we derive the solution of the equation of motion corresponding to a free rotating complex Klein-Gordon field and determine the free propagator of this model utilizing the Fock-Schwinger proper-time method. Using this propagator, we then obtain the thermodynamic potential of this model in the zeroth and first perturbative level. In addition, we compute the nonperturbative ring contribution to this potential. Our focus is on the dependence of these expressions on the angular velocity, which effectively acts as a chemical potential. Using this thermodynamic potential, we calculate several quantities, including the pressure, angular momentum and entropy densities, heat capacity, speed of sound, and moment of inertia of this rigidly rotating Bose gas as functions of temperature ($T$), angular velocity ($\Omega$), and the coupling constant ($\alpha$). We show that certain thermodynamic instabilities appear at high temperatures and large couplings. They are manifested as zero and negative values of the above quantities, particularly the moment of inertia and heat capacity. Zero moment of inertia leads to the phenomenon of supervorticity at certain $T$ or $\alpha$. Supervortical temperatures (couplings) decrease with increasing coupling (temperature). We also observe superluminal sound velocities at high $T$ and for large $\alpha$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of processes involving the weak decays of the charm quark offers unique possibilities to test the Standard Model from the up-type sector and to probe different New Physics scenarios. In here we focus on the rare decays $D^0\to\pi^+\pi^-\ell^+\ell^-$. The effectiveness of the Glashow-Iliopoulos-Maiani mechanism in charm results in a series of observables that serve as null tests of the Standard Model. Simultaneously, the dominant Standard Model contribution to such decays comes from long-distance dynamics. Following previous literature we describe this with the mediation of resonances. Motivated by recent experimental results on analogous semileptonic decays we investigate the effect of the $S$-wave of the pion pair by considering the scalar resonance $f_0(500)$. The experimental mass distributions and angular observables are described well with our model and there is a significant improvement on the agreement when accounting for $f_0(500)$, which amounts to around 20\% of the total branching ratio. Furthermore, we propose and estimate the size of a series of additional observables to be measured, which can help probe the $S$-wave and act as complementary null tests of the Standard Model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The structure of hadronic form factors at high energies and their deviations from perturbative quantum chromodynamics provide insight on nonperturbative dynamics. Using an approach that is consistent with dispersion relations, we construct a model that simultaneously accounts for the pion wave function, gluonic exchanges, and quark Reggeization. In particular, we find that quark Reggeization can be investigated at high energies by studying scaling violation of the form factor.</description>

Abstract: Inspired by the recent finding that semi-inclusive detections of heavy hadrons exhibit fair stabilization patterns in high-energy resummed distributions against (missing) higher-order corrections, we review and extend our studies on the hadroproduction of light and heavy hadrons tagged in forward and far-forward rapidity ranges. We analyze the NLL/NLO+ behavior of rapidity rates and angular multiplicities via the JETHAD method, where the resummation of next-to-leading energy logarithms and beyond is consistently embodied in the collinear picture. We explore kinematic regions that are within LHC typical acceptances, as well as novel sectors accessible thanks the combined tagging of a far-forward light or heavy hadron at future Forward Physics Facilities and a of central particle at LHC experiments via a precise timing-coincidence setup.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the asymptotic safety landscape stemming from ultraviolet-complete photon-graviton flows in a field theoretic setup, and we confront it with the weak gravity conjecture and, for the first time, with positivity bounds. At fourth order in derivatives, we find two gravitational fixed points providing viable ultraviolet completions for the theory. One of them comes with a single relevant direction, which sets the scale of quantum gravity. The corresponding sub-landscape is a single point. The second fixed point yields a richer sub-landscape of effective theories, most of which is described by an approximately straight line in the space of dimensionless Wilson coefficients. We additionally discover that: (i) the two sub-landscapes are continuously connected via a small "candy cane" regime, and the whole asymptotic safety landscape falls onto a plane; this is consistent with earlier findings and could be a universal feature in Asymptotic Safety; (ii) in such a field-theoretic setup, the Euler coupling plays a special role, as it is unconstrained by quantum scale invariance, but can enter off-shell bounds such as entropy-based positivity constraints; (iii) Planck-scale-suppressed violations of both weak gravity and positivity bounds occur across the landscape. The latter result resonates with expectations grounded on effective field theory arguments.</description>

Abstract: Positivity bounds are bounds on the Wilson coefficients of an effective field theory. They hold, if the ultraviolet completion satisfies unitarity, microcausality, locality and Lorentz symmetry; accordingly their violation signals a violation of at least one of these properties of the ultraviolet completion. We explore whether positivity bounds on four-photon-couplings hold, when the ultraviolet completion is an asymptotically safe gravity-photon theory. By working at sixth order in an expansion in the electromagnetic field strength, we discover indications that positivity bounds hold for effective field theories that are UV completed by the asymptotically safe Reuter fixed point. We also perform various tests of the robustness of our result. This amounts to a nontrivial and critical indication of the physical viability of asymptotically safe gravity.</description>

      <title>The DNA of Calabi-Yau Hypersurfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We implement Genetic Algorithms for triangulations of four-dimensional reflexive polytopes which induce Calabi-Yau threefold hypersurfaces via Batryev's construction. We demonstrate that such algorithms efficiently optimize physical observables such as axion decay constants or axion-photon couplings in string theory compactifications. For our implementation, we choose a parameterization of triangulations that yields homotopy inequivalent Calabi-Yau threefolds by extending fine, regular triangulations of two-faces, thereby eliminating exponentially large redundancy factors in the map from polytope triangulations to Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces. In particular, we discuss how this encoding renders the entire Kreuzer-Skarke list amenable to a variety of optimization strategies, including but not limited to Genetic Algorithms. To achieve optimal performance, we tune the hyperparameters of our Genetic Algorithm using Bayesian optimization. We find that our implementation vastly outperforms other sampling and optimization strategies like Markov Chain Monte Carlo or Simulated Annealing. Finally, we showcase that our Genetic Algorithm efficiently performs optimization even for the maximal polytope with Hodge numbers $h^{1,1} = 491$, where we use it to maximize axion-photon couplings.</description>

      <title>A power spectrum approach to search for Axion-like Particles from resolved galaxy clusters using CMB as a backlight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Axions or ALPs are hypothetical particles predicted by BSM theories, which make one of the dark matter candidates. These particles can convert into photons and vice-versa in the presence of magnetic field, with a probability decided by its coupling strength $\mathrm{g_{a\gamma}}$. One of the ways to detect these particles is using the CMB as a backlight. As the CMB photons pass through a galaxy cluster, they can get converted into ALPs in the mass range $10^{-15}$ eV to $10^{-11}$ eV through resonant conversion in the presence of cluster magnetic fields. This leads to a polarized spectral distortion ($\alpha$-distortion) in the CMB as the photon polarization parallel to the magnetic field in the galaxy cluster is involved in the conversion. The fluctuations in the magnetic field and electron density in a galaxy cluster lead to spatially varying $\alpha$-distortion around the cluster, with a power spectrum that is different from the lensed CMB polarization power spectrum for the standard model of cosmology. By measuring the difference in the polarization power spectrum around a galaxy cluster from the all-sky signal, one can find new $\alpha$-distortion in the sky. For galaxy clusters resolvable in multiple EM bands, one can measure the coupling strength $\mathrm{g_{a\gamma}}$ from the ALP power spectrum. Using multi-frequency techniques like ILC to clean the foregrounds, we show that the new power spectrum-based approach of the resolved galaxy clusters from upcoming CMB experiments such as Simons Observatory and CMB-S4 can detect (or put constraints) on the ALP-photon coupling strength of $\mathrm{g_{a\gamma} &lt; 5.24 \times 10^{-12} \, GeV^{-1}}$ and $\mathrm{g_{a\gamma} &lt; 3.61 \times 10^{-12} \, GeV^{-1}}$ at 95\% C.I. respectively for ALPs of masses $10^{-13}$ eV or for smaller $\mathrm{g_{a\gamma}}$ for lighter ALP masses (Abridged).</description>

      <title>A Diffused Background from Axion-like Particles in the Microwave Sky</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nature of dark matter is an unsolved cosmological problem and axions are one of the weakly interacting cold dark matter candidates. Axions or ALPs (Axion-like particles) are pseudo-scalar bosons predicted by beyond-standard model theories. The weak coupling of ALPs with photons leads to the conversion of CMB photons to ALPs in the presence of a transverse magnetic field. If they have the same mass as the effective mass of a photon in a plasma, the resonant conversion would cause a polarized spectral distortion leading to temperature fluctuations with the distortion spectrum. The probability of resonant conversion depends on the properties of the cluster such as the magnetic field, electron density, and its redshift. We show that this kind of conversion can happen in numerous unresolved galaxy clusters up to high redshifts, which will lead to a diffused polarised anisotropy signal in the microwave sky. The spectrum of the signal and its shape in the angular scale will be different from the lensed CMB polarization signal. This new polarised distortion spectrum will be correlated with the distribution of clusters in the universe and hence, with the large-scale structure. The spectrum can then be probed using its spectral and spatial variation with respect to the CMB and various foregrounds. An SNR of $\sim$ 4.36 and $\sim$ 93.87 are possible in the CMB-S4 145 GHz band and CMB-HD 150 GHz band respectively for a photon-ALPs coupling strength of $\mathrm{g_{a \gamma} = 10^{-12} \, GeV^{-1}}$ using galaxy clusters beyond redshift z $= 1$. The same signal would lead to additional RMS fluctuations of $\sim \mathrm{7.5 \times 10^{-2} \, \mu K}$ at 145 GHz. In the absence of any signal, future CMB experiments such as Simons Observatory (SO), CMB-S4, and CMB-HD can put constraints on coupling strength better than current bounds from particle physics experiment CERN Axion Solar Telescope (CAST).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Seasonal variations of atmospheric muons are traditionally interpreted in terms of an effective temperature that relates the atmospheric temperature profile at a given time to the dependence of muon production on atmospheric depth. This paper aims to review and generalize the treatment of muon production and effective temperature that has been used to interpret seasonal variations of atmospheric muons by many experiments. The formalism is developed both in integral form -- for application to compact detectors at a fixed depth that record all muons with $E_\mu &gt; E_\mu^\mathrm{min}$ -- and in differential form -- for application to extended detectors like IceCube, KM3NeT, and Baikal-GVD, where the rates are proportional to energy-dependent effective areas.</description>

      <title>Vacuum energy in the effective field theory of general relativity with a scalar field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A consistency condition of general relativity as an effective field theory in Minkowskian background uniquely fixes the value of the cosmological constant. In two-loop calculations, including the interaction of gravitons with matter fields, it has been shown that this value of the cosmological constant leads to vanishing vacuum energy, under the assumption that the energy-momentum tensor of the gravitational field is given by the pseudotensor of Landau-Lifshitz's classic textbook. Here, we demonstrate that this result also holds when the self-interaction of a scalar field is taken into account. That is, our two-loop-order calculation suggests that in an effective field theory of metric and scalar fields, one arrives at a consistent theory with massless gravitons if the cosmological constant is fixed from the condition of vanishing vacuum energy. Vice versa, imposing the consistency condition in Minkowskian background leads to a vanishing vacuum energy.</description>

      <title>Exponential Quintessence: curved, steep and stringy?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the possibility that our universe's current accelerated expansion is explained by a quintessence model with an exponential scalar potential, $V =V_0\, e^{-\lambda\, \phi}$, keeping an eye towards $\lambda \geq \sqrt{2}$ and an open universe, favorable to a string theory realisation and with no cosmological horizon. We work out the full cosmology of the model, including matter, radiation, and optionally negative spatial curvature, for all $\lambda&gt;0$, performing an extensive analysis of the dynamical system and its phase space. The minimal physical requirements of a past epoch of radiation domination and an accelerated expansion today lead to an upper bound $\lambda \lesssim \sqrt{3}$, which is driven slightly up in the presence of observationally allowed spatial curvature. Cosmological solutions start universally in a kination epoch, go through radiation and matter dominated phases and enter an epoch of acceleration, which is only transient for $\lambda&gt;\sqrt{2}$. Field distances traversed between BBN and today are sub-Planckian. We discuss possible string theory origins and phenomenological challenges, such as time variation of fundamental constants. We provide theoretical predictions for the model parameters to be fitted to data, most notably the varying dark energy equation of state parameter, in light of recent results from DES-Y5 and DESI.</description>

      <title>Revealing the Production Mechanism of High-Energy Neutrinos from NGC 1068</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection of high-energy neutrino signals from the nearby Seyfert galaxy NGC 1068 provides us with an opportunity to study nonthermal processes near the center of supermassive black holes. Using the IceCube and latest Fermi-LAT data, we present general multimessenger constraints on the energetics of cosmic rays and the size of neutrino emission regions. In the photohadronic scenario, the required cosmic-ray luminosity should be larger than about 1-10% of the Eddington luminosity and the emission radius should be 15 Schwarzschild radii in low-beta plasma and 3 Schwarzschild radii in high-beta plasma. The leptonic scenario overshoots the NuSTAR or Fermi-LAT data for any emission radii we consider, and the required gamma-ray luminosity is much larger than the Eddington luminosity. The beta decay scenario also violates not only the energetics requirement but also gamma-ray constraints especially when the Bethe-Heitler and photomeson production processes are consistently considered. Our results rule out the leptonic and beta decay scenarios in a nearly model-independent manner, and support hadronic mechanisms in magnetically-powered coronae if NGC 1068 is a source of high-energy neutrinos.</description>

      <title>Orbital Stability Study of the Taiji Space Gravitational Wave Detector</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Space-based gravitational wave detection is extremely sensitive to disturbances. The Keplerian configuration cannot accurately reflect the variations in spacecraft configuration. Planetary gravitational disturbances are one of the main sources. Numerical simulation is an effective method to investigate the impact of perturbation on spacecraft orbits. This study shows that, in the context of the Taiji project, Earth's gravity is an essential factor in the change in heliocentric formation configuration, contributing to the relative acceleration between spacecrafts in the order of $\mathcal O(10^{-6})\,{\rm m\cdot s^{-2}}$. Considering 00:00:00 on 27 October 2032 as the initial orbiting moment, under the influence of Earth's gravitational perturbation, the maximum relative change in armlengths and variation rates of armlengths for Taiji is $1.6\times 10^{5}\,{\rm km}$, $32\,{\rm m\cdot s^{-1}}$, respectively, compared with the unperturbed Keplerian orbit. Additionally, by considering the gravitational perturbations of Venus and Jupiter, the armlength and relative velocity for Taiji are reduced by $16.01\%$ and $17.45\%$, respectively, compared with when only considering that of Earth. The maximum amplitude of the formation motion indicator changes with the orbit entry time. Results show that the relative velocity increase between the spacecrafts is minimal when the initial orbital moment occurs in July. Moreover, the numerical simulation results are inconsistent when using different ephemerides. The differences between ephemerides DE440 and DE430 are smaller than those between DE440 and DE421.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the improvement of muon acceleration technology, it has received great interest to exploit high-energy muon beams for collision or target experiments. We investigate possible charged Lepton Flavor Violation (cLFV) processes mediated by an extra massive neutral gauge boson Z0 in electron muon interactions, either at a proposed electron muon collider or in a fixed target experiment with high-energy muon beam hitting electrons in the target. Based on Monte Carlo calculations and fast detector simulations, we study in detail our signal and possible backgrounds, giving the sensitivity results of cLFV signals at the 90% confidence level. Compared with current and prospective limits set by other experiments, electron muon interactions demonstrate significant advantages in the cLFV coupling strength sensitivity with tau in the final states. In addition, a special cLFV coupling combination, lambda_emu * lambda_mumu, can also be probed in our proposal.</description>

      <title>Constraining UV freeze-in of light relics with current and next-generation CMB observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmological observations allow to measure the abundance of light relics produced in the early Universe. Most studies focus on the thermal freeze-out scenario, yet light relics produced by freeze-in are generic for models in which new light degrees of freedom do not couple strongly enough to the Standard Model (SM) plasma to allow for full thermalization in the early Universe. In ultraviolet (UV) freeze-in scenarios, rates for light relic production associated with non-renormalizable interactions typical of beyond the SM (BSM) models grow with temperature more quickly than the Hubble rate. Thus, relatively small couplings to the SM can be probed by current and next-generation cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments. We investigate several representative benchmark BSM models, such as axion-like particles from Primakoff production, massless dark photons and light right-handed neutrinos. We calculate contributions to the effective number of neutrino species, $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$, in corners of parameter space not previously considered and discuss the sensitivity of CMB experiments compared to other probes. In contrast to freeze-out scenarios, $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ from UV freeze-in is more dependent on both the specific BSM physics model and the reheating temperature. Depending on the details of the BSM scenario, we find that the sensitivity of next-generation CMB experiments can complement or surpass the current astrophysical, laboratory or collider constraints on the couplings of the SM to the light relic.</description>

      <title>Robust inference of gravitational wave source parameters in the presence of noise transients using normalizing flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) detection is of paramount importance in fundamental physics and GW astronomy, yet it presents formidable challenges. One significant challenge is the removal of noise transient artifacts known as ``glitches," which greatly impact the search and identification of GWs. Recent research has achieved remarkable results in data denoising, often using effective modeling methods to remove glitches. However, for glitches from uncertain or unknown sources, current methods cannot completely eliminate them from the GW signal. In this work, we leverage the inherent robustness of machine learning to obtain reliable posterior parameter distributions directly from GW data contaminated by glitches. Our network model provides reasonable and rapid parameter inference even in the presence of glitches, without needing to remove them. We also investigate various factors affecting the rationality of parameter inference in our normalizing flow network, including glitch and GW parameters. The results demonstrate that the normalizing flow can reasonably infer the source parameters of GWs even with unknown contamination. We find that the nature of the glitch itself is the only factor that can affect the rationality of the inferred results. With improvements to our model, we anticipate accelerating the localization of electromagnetic counterparts and providing priors for more accurate deglitching, thereby speeding up subsequent data processing procedures.</description>

      <title>On the absence of the Chiral Magnetic Effect in equilibrium QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the chiral magnetic effect (CME): the generation of an electric current due to a homogeneous background magnetic field and a homogeneous chiral imbalance in QCD. We demonstrate that the leading coefficient describing the CME vanishes in equilibrium, both for free fermions as well as in full QCD. Our full QCD results are based on continuum extrapolated lattice simulations using dynamical staggered quarks with physical masses as well as quenched Wilson quarks. We show that it is crucial that a gauge invariant ultraviolet regularization is used to compute the CME and elaborate on why some of the existing in-equilibrium calculations of this effect gave a nonzero result. We stress that our findings imply the absence of a time-independent CME current flowing in equilibrium QCD, but do not concern the CME as an out-of-equilibrium, time-dependent effect.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.04324v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the $B^- \to K^- \eta \eta_c$ decay by taking into account the $S$-wave contributions from the pseudoscalar meson-pseudoscalar meson interactions within the unitary coupled-channel approach, where the $D\bar{D}$ bound state is dynamically generated. In addition, the contribution from the intermediate resonance $K_0^*(1430)^-$, with $K_0^*(1430)^- \to K^-\eta$, is also considered. Our results show that there is a clear peak around $3720$~MeV in the $\eta \eta_c$ invariant mass distribution, which could be associated with the $D \bar{D}$ bound state. The future precise measurements of the $B^- \to K^- \eta \eta_c$ process at the Belle II and LHCb experiments could be, therefore, used to check the existence of the $D \bar{D}$ bound state, and to deepen our understanding of the hadron-hadron interactions.</description>

      <title>Absorption of Fermionic Dark Matter via the Scalar Portal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.00309v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The absorption of fermionic dark matter has recently been studied as a signature for the direct detection of dark matter. We construct the first UV completion of the scalar effective operator associated with this signature. We calculate the constraints on the model and demonstrate there is viable parameter space which can be probed by a next-generation experiment such as XLZD. We also consider the cosmological history of our model and show that the correct relic abundance can be obtained via freeze-out in the dark sector. However, within this minimal model, we find that the absorption signal is highly suppressed in the parameter space that yields the correct relic abundance.</description>

      <title>The colourful antenna subtraction method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.19757v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a general subtraction scheme for NNLO calculations in massless QCD: the \textit{colourful antenna subtraction method}. It is a reformulation of the antenna subtraction approach designed to address some of the limitations of the traditional framework, especially aiming at high-multiplicity processes. In the context of the new formalism, structures needed to locally subtract the infrared-divergent behaviour of real emission corrections are systematically inferred from virtual subtraction terms, relying on the cancellation of infrared singularities and on the correspondence between integrated and unintegrated antenna functions. We illustrate in detail how the colourful antenna subtraction method works up to NNLO. The algorithm is particularly suited to be fully automated for the generation of NNLO subtraction terms for generic processes. We employ the new formalism to assemble the subtraction terms required for the calculation of the NNLO correction to hadronic three-jet production and describe their validation procedure.</description>

      <title>Precision three-dimensional imaging of nuclei using recoil-free jets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.02150v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the azimuthal angle decorrelation of lepton-jet pairs in e-p and e-A collisions as a means for precision measurements of the three-dimensional structure of bound and free nucleons. Utilizing soft-collinear effective theory, we perform the first-ever resummation of this process in e-p collisions at NNLL accuracy using a recoil-free jet axis. Our results are validated against Pythia simulations. In e-A collisions, we address the complex interplay between three characteristic length scales: the medium length $L$, the mean free path of the energetic parton in the medium $\lambda$, and the hadronization length $L_h$. We demonstrate that in the thin-dilute limit, where $L \ll L_h$ and $L \sim \lambda$, this process can serve as a robust probe of the three-dimensional structure for bound nucleons. We conclude by offering predictions for future experiments at the Electron-Ion Collider within this limit.</description>

      <title>${\rm \overline{B}}_{d,s}\to \rm K^{*0}\overline{K}^{*0}$ decays, a serious problem for the Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07198v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We underline the theoretical and experimental interest of the vector-vector penguin decays ${\rm \overline{B}}_{d,s} \to {\rm K^{*0} \overline{K}^{*0}}$ for which the data show a strong U-spin violation. Indeed, with the latest LHCb data one has for these two modes very different longitudinal polarization fractions, $f_L^{exp}({\rm \overline{B}}_s \to {\rm K^{*0} \overline{K}^{*0}} ) = 0.24 \pm 0.04$ and $f_L^{exp}({\rm \overline{B}}_d \to {\rm K^{*0} \overline{K}^{*0}} ) = 0.74 \pm 0.05$. This feature is very striking because both modes are related by the exchange $s \leftrightarrow d$, i.e. they are related by U-spin symmetry as pointed out in earlier work by other authors. We illustrate this phenomenon by computing different observables for these modes within the QCD Factorization scheme, and we find, as expected, rather close values for the longitudinal fractions, with central values $f_L^{th}({\rm \overline{B}}_s \to {\rm K^{*0} \overline{K}^{*0}} ) \simeq 0.42$ and $f_L^{th}({\rm \overline{B}}_d \to {\rm K^{*0} \overline{K}^{*0}} ) \simeq 0.49$ and rather small errors. Furthermore, due to the $V-A$ nature of the weak currents and the heavy quark limit, one expects $(f_\parallel/f_\perp)_{th}\simeq 1$, which in the $\rm B_s$ case is in contradiction with the data $(f_\parallel/f_\perp)_{\rm exp}\simeq 0.44\pm 0.06$.}</description>

      <title>Quark-lepton mass relations from modular flavor symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09255v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The so-called Golden Mass Relation provides a testable correlation between charged-lepton and down-type quark masses, that arises in certain flavor models that do not rely on Grand Unification. Such models typically involve broken family symmetries. In this work, we demonstrate that realistic fermion mass relations can emerge naturally in modular invariant models, without relying on ad hoc flavon alignments. We provide a model-independent derivation of a class of mass relations that are experimentally testable. These relations are determined by both the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients of the specific finite modular group and the expansion coefficients of its modular forms, thus offering potential probes of modular invariant models. As a detailed example, we present a set of viable mass relations based on the $\Gamma_4\cong S_4$ symmetry, which have calculable deviations from the usual Golden Mass Relation.</description>

Abstract: We present a new global SMEFT analysis of LHC data in the top sector. After updating our set of measurements, we show how public ATLAS likelihoods can be incorporated in an external global analysis and how our analysis benefits from the additional information. We find that, unlike for the Higgs and electroweak sector, the SMEFT analysis of the top sector is mostly limited by the correlated theory uncertainties.</description>

Abstract: As a tribute to Steven Weinberg, we summarize the immense impact that he had on the understanding of the mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking and on the physics of the Higgs boson. In particular, four landmark contributions to this field are highlighted. A first one is his early work with Goldstone and Salam on spontaneously broken continuous symmetries that paved the way to the Higgs mechanism. A second towering breakthrough is his model of leptons which later became the Standard Model of particle physics and for which he was awarded the Nobel prize with Glashow and Salam. A third seminal work is the so-called Weinberg-Linde lower bound on the Higgs boson mass that was derived from the requirement of the stability of the electroweak vacuum. Finally, we will summarize his important contributions in model-building of new physics with extended Higgs sectors and their possible impact in flavor physics and CP-violation. The historical aspects as well as the contemporary way of viewing these four major topics are summarized and their impact on today Higgs physics, and more generally particle physics, is highlighted.</description>

      <title>Violation of the equivalence principle induced by oscillating rest mass and transition frequency, and its detection in atom interferometers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14742v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a theoretical investigation of the expected experimental signals produced by freely falling atoms with time oscillating mass and transition frequency. These oscillations could be produced in a variety of models, in particular, models of scalar dark matter (DM) non universally coupled to the standard matter (SM) such as axion-like particles (ALP) and dilatons. Performing complete and rigorous calculations, we show that, on one hand, two different atomic species would accelerate at a different rate, and on the other hand, they would produce a non-zero differential phase shift in atom interferometers (AI). The former would produce observable signals in equivalence principle tests like the recent MICROSCOPE mission, and we provide a corresponding sensitivity estimate, showing that MICROSCOPE can reach beyond the best existing searches in the ALP case. We also compare the expected sensitivity of two future AI experiments, namely the AION-10 gradiometer and an isotope differential AI considered for MAGIS-100, that we will refer to as SPID. We show that the SPID setup would be more sensitive to these dark matter fields compared to the gradiometer one, assuming equivalent experimental parameters.</description>

Abstract: We revisit the neutron lifetime puzzle, a discrepancy between beam and bottle measurements of the weak neutron decay. Since both types of measurements are realized at different times after the nuclear production of free neutrons, we argue that the existence of an excited state could be responsible for the different lifetimes. We elaborate on the required properties of such a state and under what circumstances it is possible that it has not been experimentally identified yet.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01222v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first theoretical calculation of nonfactorizable charm-quark loop contributions to the $B_s\to \gamma l^+l^-$ amplitude. We calculate the relevant form factors, $H_{A,V}^{\rm NF}(k'^2,k^2)$, and provide convenient parametrizations of our results in the form of fit functions of two variables, $k'^2$ and $k^2$, applicable in the region below hadron resonances, $k'^2 &lt; M_{J/\psi}^2$ and $k^2 &lt; M_{\phi}^2$. We report that factorizable and nonfactorizable charm contributions to the $B_s\to\gamma l^+l^-$ amplitude have opposite signs. To compare the charm and the top contributions, it is convenient to express the NF charming loop contribution as a non-universal (i.e., dependent on the reaction) $q^2$-dependent correction $\Delta^{\rm NF}C_7(q^2)$ to the Wilson coefficient $C_7$. For the $B_s\to\gamma l^+l^-$ amplitude, the correction is found to be positive, $\Delta^{\rm NF} C_7(q^2)/C_7 &gt; 0$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17636v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider an effective theory for a shift-symmetric, quadratically-coupled, ultralight spin-0 field. The leading CP-conserving interactions with Standard Model fields in the effective theory arise at dimension 8. We discuss the renormalization group evolution and positivity bounds on these operators, as well as their possible UV origins. Assuming that the spin-0 field is associated with an ultralight dark matter candidate, we discuss the effects of the dimension-8 operators on experiments searching for the oscillation of fundamental constants and Lorentz violation. We find that the direct bounds on these two effects are of similar strength but rather weak, corresponding to a UV cutoff scale of keV order, as they are mediated by dimension-8 operators.</description>

      <title>Dark Universe Phenomenology from Yukawa Potential?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.11492v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We argue that the effect of cold dark matter in the cosmological setup can be explained by the coupling between the baryonic matter particles in terms of the long-range force having a graviton mass $m_g$ via the Yukawa gravitational potential. Such a quantum-corrected Yukawa-like gravitational potential is characterized by the coupling parameter $\alpha$, the wavelength parameter $\lambda$, which is related to the graviton mass via $m_g=\hbar/(\lambda c)$, that determines the range of the force and, finally, a Planck length quantity $l_0$ that makes the potential regular at the centre. The corrected Friedmann equations are obtained using Verlinde's entropic force interpretation of gravity based on the holographic scenario and the equipartition law of energy. The parameter $\alpha$ modifies Newton's constant as $G_{\rm eff}\rightarrow G(1+\alpha)$. We argue that dark matter is an apparent effect as no dark matter particle exists in this picture. Furthermore, the dark energy is also related to graviton mass and $\alpha$; in particular, we point out that the cosmological constant can be viewed as a self-interaction effect between gravitons. We further show that there exists a precise correspondence with Verlinde's emergent gravity theory, and due to the long-range force, the theory can be viewed as a non-local gravity theory. To this end, we performed the phase space analyses and estimated $\lambda\simeq 10^3 $[Mpc] and $\alpha \in (0.0385,0.0450)$, respectively. Finally, from these values, for the graviton mass, we get $m_g\simeq 10^{-68}$ kg, and cosmological constant $\Lambda \simeq 10^{-52}\rm m^{-2}$. Further, we argue how this theory reproduces the MOND phenomenology on galactic scales via the acceleration of Milgrom $a_0 \simeq 10^{-10}\rm m/s^2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.02366v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study an inflation model with a flat scalar potential supported by observations and find that slow-roll inflation can emerge after a quasi-cyclic phase of the Universe, where it undergoes repeated expansions and contractions for a finite time period. The initial conditions and the positive spatial curvature required for such nontrivial dynamics align with the quantum creation of the Universe. The key ingredients that trigger inflation are dissipative interactions of the inflaton, which are necessary to reheat the Universe after inflation and thus give us an observational handle on pre-inflationary physics. Our discovery implies that inflation occurs more robustly after the creation.</description>

Abstract: Inflationary models, especially those with plateau-type potentials, are consistent with the cosmological data, but inflation itself does not resolve the initial singularity. This singularity is resolved, for example, by the idea of the quantum creation of the Universe from nothing such as the tunneling and no-boundary proposals. The simplest one predicts a closed Universe. Motivated by these facts, we investigate the classical dynamics of a closed universe with a plateau-type potential. Depending on the initial inflaton field value, the universe can undergo a variety of events: an immediate big crunch, a bounce or cyclic phase, and inflation. Although the non-inflationary solutions may appear irrelevant to our Universe, they can be turned into single or multiple bounces followed by inflation, taking into account the interactions necessary for the reheating of the Universe after inflation. Thus, the dissipative mechanism in our setup explains both the graceful entry to and exit from inflation and gives us an indirect observational handle on the Universe just after creation. We also comment on the implications of these solutions for probabilistic interpretations of the wave function of the Universe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.02998v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The prospects are presented for precise measurements of the branching ratios of the purely leptonic $B_c^+ \to \tau^+ \nu_\tau$ and $B^+ \to \tau^+ \nu_\tau$ decays at the Future Circular Collider (FCC). This work is focused on the hadronic $\tau^{+} \to \pi^+ \pi^+ \pi^- \bar{\nu}_\tau$ decay in both $B_c^+ \to \tau^+ \nu_\tau$ and $B^+ \to \tau^+ \nu_\tau$ processes. Events are selected with two Boosted Decision Tree algorithms to optimise the separation between the two signal processes as well as the generic hadronic $Z$ decay backgrounds. The range of the expected precision for both signals are evaluated in different scenarios of non-ideal background modelling. This paper demonstrates, for the first time, that the $B^+ \to \tau^+ \nu_\tau$ decay can be well separated from both $B_c^+ \to \tau^+ \nu_\tau$ and generic $Z\to b\bar{b}$ processes in the FCC-ee collision environment and proposes the corresponding branching ratio measurement as a novel way to determine the CKM matrix element $|V_{ub}|$. The theoretical impacts of both $B^+ \to \tau^+ \nu_\tau$ and $B_c^+ \to \tau^+ \nu_\tau$ measurements on New Physics cases are discussed for interpretations in the generic Two-Higgs-doublet model and leptoquark models.</description>

Abstract: The Roman Space Telescope's Galactic Bulge Time Domain Survey will constitute the most sensitive microlensing survey of the Galactic Bulge to date, opening up new opportunities to search for dark matter (DM). Many extensions of the Standard Model predict the formation of extended DM substructures, such as DM subhalos, boson/axion stars, and halo-dressed primordial black holes. We demonstrate that for such targets, Roman will be sensitive to a broad parameter space up to four orders of magnitude below existing constraints. Our analysis can be readily applied to other extended DM configurations as well.</description>

      <title>Large fluctuations in the Sky</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07343v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Renormalization of quantum loop effects generated from large fluctuations is a hugely debatable topic of research these days which rules out the Primordial Black Hole (PBH) formation within the framework of single-field inflation. In this article, we briefly discuss that the correct implementation of regularization, renormalization, and resummation techniques in a setup described by an ultra-slow-roll phase sandwiched between two slow-roll phases in the presence of smooth or sharp transitions can lead to a stringent constraint on the PBH mass (i.e. ${\cal O}(10^{2}{\rm gm}$)), which we advertise as a new No-go theorem. Finally, we will give some of the possible way-outs using which one can evade this proposed No-go theorem and produce solar/sub-solar mass PBHs.</description>

      <title>Conservative Black Hole Scattering at Fifth Post-Minkowskian and First Self-Force Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07781v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the 5PM order contributions to the scattering angle and impulse of classical black hole scattering in the conservative sector at first self-force order (1SF) using the worldline quantum field theory formalism. This challenging four-loop computation required the use of advanced integration-by-parts and differential equation technology implemented on high-performance computing systems. Use of partial fraction identities allowed us to render the complete integrand in a fully planar form. The resulting function space is simpler than expected: in the scattering angle we see only multiple polylogarithms up to weight three, and a total absence of the elliptic integrals that appeared at 4PM order. All checks on our result, both internal - cancellation of dimensional regularization poles, preservation of the on-shell condition - and external - matching the slow-velocity limit with the post-Newtonian (PN) literature up to 5PN order and matching the tail terms to the 4PM loss of energy - are passed.</description>
