      <title>Matrix Ordering through Spectral and Nilpotent Structures in Totally Ordered Complex Number Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Matrix inequalities play a pivotal role in mathematics, generalizing scalar inequalities and providing insights into linear operator structures. However, the widely used L\"owner ordering, which relies on real-valued eigenvalues, is limited to Hermitian matrices, restricting its applicability to non-Hermitian systems increasingly relevant in fields like non-Hermitian physics. To overcome this, we develop a total ordering relation for complex numbers, enabling comparisons of the spectral components of general matrices with complex eigenvalues. Building on this, we introduce the Spectral and Nilpotent Ordering (SNO), a partial order for arbitrary matrices of the same dimensions. We further establish a theoretical framework for majorization ordering with complex-valued functions, which aids in refining SNO and analyzing spectral components. An additional result is the extension of the Schur--Ostrowski criterion to the complex domain. Moreover, we characterize Jordan blocks of matrix functions using a generalized dominance order for nilpotent components, facilitating systematic analysis of non-diagonalizable matrices. Finally, we derive monotonicity and convexity conditions for functions under the SNO framework, laying a new mathematical foundation for advancing matrix analysis.</description>

      <title>Quasi-linear maps and image transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conic quasi-linear maps are nonlinear operators from $C_0(X)$ to a normed linear space $E$ which preserve nonnegative linear combinations on positive cones generated by single functions; quasi-linear maps are linear on singly generated subalgebras. While nonlinear, a quasi-linear map is bounded iff it is continuous. $E = \mathbb{R}$ gives quasi-integrals, which correspond to (deficient) topological measures - nonsubadditive set functions generalizing measures. Like image measures $\mu \circ u^{-1}$, (d-) image transformations move (deficient) topological measures from one space to another, generalizing $u^{-1}$. We give criteria for a (d-) image transformation to be $u^{-1}$ for some proper continuous function. We study the interrelationships between (conic) quasi-linear maps, quasi-integrals, (deficient) topological measures and (d-) image transformations when $E = C_0(Y), X, Y$ are locally compact. (Conic) quasi-homomorphisms behave like homomorphisms on singly generated subalgebras or cones. We show that (conic) quasi-homomorphisms are in 1-1 correspondence with (d-) image transformations and with certain continuous proper functions. We give criteria for a (conic) quasi-linear map to be a (conic) quasi-homomorphism, and for the latter to be an algebra homomorphism. Any conic quasi-linear map or bounded quasi-linear map is a composition of an algebra homomorphism with the basic quasi-linear map, and we give criteria for the latter to be linear. We study the adjoints of (d-) image transformations and (conic) quasi-linear maps; for (conic) quasi-homomorphisms they give Markov-Feller operators with nonlinear duals.</description>

      <title>A unified approach to a family of optimization problems in Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our principal aim is to illustrate that the concept Birkhoff-James orthogonality can be applied effectively to obtain a unified approach to a large family of optimization problems in Banach spaces. We study such optimization problems from the perspective of Birkhoff-James orthogonality in certain suitable Banach spaces. In particular, we demonstrate the duality between the Fermat-Torricelli problem and the Chebyshev center problem which are important particular cases of the least square problem. We revisit the Fermat-Torricelli problem for three and four points and solve it using the same technique. We also investigate the behavior of the Fermat-Torricelli points under the addition or replacement of a new point, and present several new results involving the locations of the Fermat-Torricelli point and the Chebyshev center.</description>

      <title>On approximate preservation of orthogonality and its application to isometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the famous Blanco-Koldobsky-Turn\v{s}ek characterization of isometries, we study the \textit{approximate preservation of Birkhoff-James orthogonality by a linear operator between Banach spaces}. In particular, we investigate various geometric and analytic properties related to such preservation on finite-dimensional polyhedral Banach spaces. As an application of the results obtained here, we present refinements of the Blanco-Koldobsky-Turn\v{s}ek characterization of isometries on certain Banach spaces.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Correlation via Inverse Brascamp-Lieb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a simple alternative proof of Royen's Gaussian Correlation inequality by using (a slightly generalized version of) Nakamura-Tsuji's symmetric inverse Brascamp-Lieb inequality for even log-concave functions. We explain that this inverse inequality is in a certain sense a dual counterpart to the forward inequality of Bennett-Carbery-Christ-Tao and Valdimarsson, and that the log-concavity assumption therein cannot be omitted in general.</description>

      <title>A formula of local Maslov index and applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explicitly express the local Maslov index by a Maslov index in finite dimensional case without symplectic reduction. Then we calculate the Maslov index for the path of pairs of Lagrangian subspaces in triangular form. In particular, we get the Maslov-type index of a given symplectic path in triangle form. As applications, we calculate the splitting numbers of the symplectic matrix in triangle form and dependence of iteration theory on triangular frames. We study the continuity of families of bounded linear relations and families of bounded linear operators acting on closed linear subspaces as technique preparations.</description>

      <title>New duality in choices of feature spaces via kernel analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic study of the family of positive definite (p.d.) kernels with the use of their associated feature maps and feature spaces. For a fixed set $X$, generalizing Loewner, we make precise the corresponding partially ordered set $Pos\left(X\right)$ of all p.d. kernels on $X$, as well as a study of its global properties. This new analysis includes both results dealing with applications and concrete examples, including such general notions for $Pos\left(X\right)$ as the structure of its partial order, its products, sums, and limits; as well as their Hilbert space-theoretic counterparts. For this purpose, we introduce a new duality for feature spaces, feature selections, and feature mappings. For our analysis, we further introduce a general notion of dual pairs of p.d. kernels. Three special classes of kernels are studied in detail: (a) the case when the reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs) may be chosen as Hilbert spaces of analytic functions, (b) when they are realized in spaces of Schwartz-distributions, and (c) arise as fractal limits. We further prove inverse theorems in which we derive results for the analysis of $Pos\left(X\right)$ from the operator theory of specified counterpart-feature spaces. We present constructions of new p.d. kernels in two ways: (i) as limits of monotone families in $Pos\left(X\right)$, and (ii) as p.d. kernels which model fractal limits, i.e., are invariant with respect to certain iterated function systems (IFS)-transformations.</description>

      <title>The Capacitary John-Nirenberg Inequality Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish maximal function estimates, Lebesgue differentiation theory, Calder\'on-Zygmund decompositions, and John-Nirenberg inequalities for translation invariant Hausdorff contents. We further identify a key structural component of these results -- a packing condition satisfied by these Hausdorff contents which compensates for the non-linearity of the capacitary integrals. We prove that for any outer capacity, this packing condition is satisfied if and only if the capacity is equivalent to its induced Hausdorff content. Finally, we use this equivalence to extend the preceding theory to general outer capacities which are assumed to satisfy this packing condition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study (strong) first countability of locally solid convergence structures on Archimedean vector lattices. Among other results, we characterise those vector lattices for which relatively unform-, order-, and $\sigma$-order convergence, respectively, is (strongly) first countable. The implications for the validity of sequential arguments in the contexts of these convergences are pointed out.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, by using continuous Hilbert transform and maximal operator boundedness property in the variable Lebesgue space $ L^{p(\cdot)}(\mathbb{R}) $ we show that the discrete Hilbert transform is bounded in the variable discrete Lebesgue space $ \ell^{p_n}(\mathbb{Z}) $. We show that the discrete Mikhlin multiplier $ \mathcal{T}_m $ is a bounded operator on $ \ell^{p_n}(\mathbb{Z}) $ when $ 1&lt;\underline{p}_n&lt;\bar{p}_n&lt;\infty $.</description>

      <title>Some examples of affine isometries of Banach spaces arising from 1-D dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a large family of examples of affine isometries of the Banach spaces $C^0 (S^1)$, $L^1 (S^1)$ and $L^2 (S^1 \times S^1)$ that are fixed-point-free despite being recurrent (in particular, they have zero drift). These come from natural cocycles on the group of circle diffeomorphisms, namely the logarithmic, affine and (a variation of the) Schwarzian derivative. Quite interestingly, they arise from diffeomorphisms that are generic in an appropriate context. We also show how to promote these examples in order to obtain families of commuting isometries satisfying the same properties.</description>

      <title>On the harmonic generalized Cauchy-Kovalevskaya extension and its connection with the Futer-Sce theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the primary objectives of this paper is to establish a generalized Cauchy-Kovalevskaya extension for axially harmonic functions. We demonstrate that the result can be expressed as a power series involving Bessel-type functions of specific differential operators acting on two initial functions. Additionally, we analyze the decomposition of the harmonic CK extension in terms of integrals over the sphere $ \mathbb{S}^{m-1} $ involving functions of plane wave type.
  Another key goal of this paper is to explore the relationship between the harmonic Cauchy-Kovalevskaya extension and the Fueter-Sce theorem. The Fueter-Sce theorem outlines a two-step process for constructing axially monogenic functions in $ \mathbb{R}^{m+1}$ starting from holomorphic functions in one complex variable. The first step generates the class of slice monogenic functions, while the second step produces axially monogenic functions by applying the pointwise differential operator $ \Delta_{\mathbb{R}{^{m+1}}}^{\frac{m-1}{2}} $ with $m$ being odd, known as the Fueter-Sce map, to a slice monogenic function.
  By suitably factorizing the Fueter-Sce map, we introduce the set of axially harmonic functions, which serves as an intermediate class between slice monogenic and axially monogenic functions. In this paper, we establish a connection between the harmonic CK extension and the factorization of the Fueter-Sce map. This connection leads to a new notion of harmonic polynomials, which we show to form a basis for the Riesz potential. Finally, we also construct a basis for the space of axially harmonic functions.</description>

Abstract: We build on a characterization of inner functions $f$ due to Le, in terms of the spectral properties of the operator $V=M_f^*M_f$ and study to what extent the cyclicity on weighted Hardy spaces $H^2_\omega$ of the function $z \mapsto a-z$ can be inferred from the spectral properties of analogous operators $V_a$. We describe several properties of the spectra that hold in a large class of spaces and then, we focus on the particular case of Bergman-type spaces, for which we describe completely the spectrum of such operators and find all eigenfunctions.</description>

      <title>New type of Nonlinear Operator Ideal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The linear operators defined on the Lipschitz projective tensor product of X and E give rise to a new class of operators acting on the cartesian product X E. This class, denoted by LipL(X E;F), combines Lipschitz and linear properties, forming an intermediate framework between bilinear operators and two-Lipschitz operators. We establish an identification between this space and L(X E;F), which also links it to the space of bilinear operators B(AE(X) E;F). Additionally, we define Lip-linear operator ideals and apply summability concepts to this new category, focusing on absolutely (s,p,q)-summing and strongly p-summing operators.</description>

      <title>On the Optimality of Random Partial Sphere Coverings in High Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given $N$ geodesic caps on the normalized unit sphere in $\mathbb{R}^d$, and whose total surface area sums to one, what is the maximal surface area their union can cover? We show that when these caps have equal surface area, as both the dimension $d$ and the number of caps $N$ tend to infinity, the maximum proportion covered approaches $1 - e^{-1} \approx 0.632$. Furthermore, this maximum is achieved by a random partial sphere covering. Our result refines a classical estimate for the covering density of $\mathbb{R}^d$ by Erd\H{o}s, Few, and Rogers (Mathematika, 11(2):171--184, 1964).</description>

      <title>An analysis of non-selfadjoint first-order differential operators with non-local point interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the spectra of non-selfadjoint first-order operators on the interval with non-local point interactions, formally given by ${i\partial_x+V+k\langle \delta,\cdot\rangle}$. We give precise estimates on the location of the eigenvalues on the complex plane and prove that the root vectors of these operators form Riesz bases of $L^2(0,2\pi)$. Under the additional assumption that the operator is maximally dissipative, we prove that it can have at most one real eigenvalue, and given any $\lambda\in\mathbb{R}$, we explicitly construct the unique operator realization such that $\lambda$ is in its spectrum. We also investigate the time-evolution generated by these maximally dissipative operators.</description>

      <title>Spectrality of a measure consisting of two line segments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Take an interval $[t, t+1]$ on the $x$-axis together with the same interval on the $y$-axis and let $\rho$ be the normalized one-dimensional Lebesgue measure on this set of two segments. Continuing the work done by Lai, Liu and Prince (2021) as well as Ai, Lu and Zhou (2023) we examine the spectrality of this measure for all different values of $t$ (being spectral means that there is an orthonormal basis for $L^2(\rho)$ consisting of exponentials $e^{2\pi i (\lambda_1 x + \lambda_2 y)}$). We almost complete the study showing that for $-\frac12&lt;t&lt;0$ and for all $t \notin {\mathbb Q}$ the measure $\rho$ is not spectral. The only remaining undecided case is the case $t=-\frac12$ (plus space). We also observe that in all known cases of spectral instances of this measure the spectrum is contained in a line and we give an easy necessary and sufficient condition for such measures to have a line spectrum.</description>

      <title>A Novel Interpretation of the Radon Transform's Ray- and Pixel-Driven Discretizations under Balanced Resolutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tomographic investigations are a central tool in medical applications, allowing doctors to image the interior of patients. The corresponding measurement process is commonly modeled by the Radon transform. In practice, the solution of the tomographic problem requires discretization of the Radon transform and its adjoint (called the backprojection). There are various discretization schemes; often structured around three discretization parameters: spatial-, detector-, and angular resolutions. The most widespread approach uses the ray-driven Radon transform and the pixel-driven backprojection in a balanced resolution setting, i.e., the spatial resolution roughly equals the detector resolution. The use of these particular discretization approaches is based on anecdotal reports of their approximation performance, but there is little rigorous analysis of these methods' approximation errors. This paper presents a novel interpretation of ray-driven and pixel-driven methods as convolutional discretizations, illustrating that from an abstract perspective these methods are similar. Moreover, we announce statements concerning the convergence of the ray-driven Radon transform and the pixel-driven backprojection under balanced resolutions. Our considerations are supported by numerical experiments highlighting aspects of the discussed methods.</description>

Abstract: We propose several applications of an often overlooked part of the 1976 paper by Br\'ezis and Haraux, in which the celebrated Br\'ezis--Haraux theorem was established. Our results unify and extend various existing ones on the range of a composite monotone operator and provide new insight into the seminal work by Br\'ezis and Haraux.</description>

      <title>The Associated Discrete Laplacian in $\mathbb{R}^3$ and Mean Curvature with Higher order Approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In $\mathbb{R}^3$, the primal and dual constructions yield completely different discrete Laplacians for tetrahedral meshes.In this article, we prove that the discrete Laplacian satisfies the Euler-Lagrange equation of the Dirichlet energy in terms of the associated discrete Laplacian corresponding to the dual construction. Specifically, for a three simplex immersed in $\mathbb{R}^3$, the associated discrete Laplacian on the tetrahedron can be expressed as the discrete Laplacian of the faces of the tetrahedron and the associated discrete mean curvature term given by the ambient space $\mathbb{R}^3$. Based on geometric foundations, we provide a mathematical proof showing that the dual construction gives a optimal Laplacian in $\mathbb{R}^3$ compared to the primal construction. Moreover, we show that the associated discrete mean curvature is more sensitive to the initial mesh than other state-of-the-art discrete mean curvatures when the angle changes instantaneously. Instead of improving the angular transient accuracy through mesh subdivision, we can improve the accuracy by providing a higher order approximation of the instantaneous change in angle to reduce the solution error.</description>

      <title>Gram-like matrix preserving extensions of noncommutative polynomials to sum of Hermitian Squares</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a nonnegative noncommutative polynomial $f$, equivalently a sum of Hermitian squares (SOHS), there exists a positive semidefinite Gram matrix that encrypts all essential information of $f$. There are no available methods for extending a noncommutative polynomial to a SOHS keeping the Gram matrices unperturbed. As a remedy, we introduce an equally significant notion of Gram-like matrices and provide linear algebraic techniques to get the desired extensions. We further use positive semidefinite completion problem to get SOHS and provide criteria in terms of chordal graphs and 2-regular projective algebraic sets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.10710v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present quasi-Banach spaces which are closely related to the duals of combinatorial Banach spaces. More precisely, for a compact family $\mathcal{F}$ of finite subsets of $\omega$ we define a quasi-norm $\lVert \cdot \rVert^\mathcal{F}$ whose Banach envelope is the dual norm for the combinatorial space generated by $\mathcal{F}$. Such quasi-norms seem to be much easier to handle than the dual norms and yet the quasi-Banach spaces induced by them share many properties with the dual spaces. We show that the quasi-Banach spaces induced by large families (in the sense of Lopez-Abad and Todorcevic) are $\ell_1$-saturated and do not have the Schur property. In particular, this holds for the Schreier families.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.17830v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the Paley-Wiener theorem for probabilistic frames. The Paley-Wiener theorem claims that if a sequence is close to a basis in a Banach space, then this sequence is also a basis. Similar results are extended to frames in Hilbert spaces. In this work, we claim that if a probability measure is close to a probabilistic frame, this probability measure is also a probabilistic frame. Moreover, based on operator theory, we obtain the frame bounds for such probability measures that are close to a given probabilistic frame in the 2-Wasserstein metric, which alternatively shows the fact that the set of probabilistic frames is open in the 2-Wasserstein topology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10222v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by the theories of Kaplansky-Hilbert modules and probability theory in vector lattices, we generalise functional analysis by replacing the scalars $\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$ by a real or complex Dedekind complete unital $f$-algebra $\mathbb{L}$; such an algebra can be represented as a suitable space of continuous functions. We set up the basic theory of $\mathbb{L}$-normed and $\mathbb{L}$-Banach spaces and bounded operators between them, we discuss the $\mathbb{L}$-valued analogues of the classical $\ell^p$-spaces, and we prove the analogue of the Hahn-Banach theorem. We also discuss the basics of the theory of $\mathbb{L}$-Hilbert spaces, including projections onto convex subsets, the Riesz Representation theorem, and representing $\mathbb{L}$-Hilbert spaces as a direct sum of $\ell^2$-spaces.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13668v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new contraction property, which we call the generalized $p$-contraction property, for $p$-energy forms as generalizations of many well-known inequalities, such as $p$-Clarkson's inequality, the strong subadditivity and the Markov property in the theory of nonlinear Dirichlet forms, and show that any $p$-energy form satisfying $p$-Clarkson's inequality is Fr\'{e}chet differentiable. We also verify the generalized $p$-contraction property for $p$-energy forms on fractals constructed by Kigami [Mem. Eur. Math. Soc. 5 (2023)] and by Cao--Gu--Qiu [Adv. Math. 405 (2022), no. 108517]. As a general framework of $p$-energy forms taking the generalized $p$-contraction property into consideration, we introduce the notion of $p$-resistance form and investigate fundamental properties of $p$-harmonic functions with respect to $p$-resistance forms. In particular, some new estimates on scaling factors of self-similar $p$-energy forms on self-similar sets are obtained by establishing H\"{o}lder regularity estimates for $p$-harmonic functions, and the $p$-walk dimensions of any generalized Sierpi\'{n}ski carpet and the $D$-dimensional level-$l$ Sierpi\'{n}ski gasket are shown to be strictly greater than $p$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11136v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Perron--Frobenius theorem in infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces can be breifly stated as follows: Given a Hilbert cone in a real Hilbert space, a bounded positive self-adjoint operator $A$ is ergodic with respect to this cone if and only if the maximum eigenvalue $\|A\|$ of $A$ is simple, and the corresponding eigenvector is strictly positive with respect to this cone. This paper addresses the inverse problem of the Perron--Frobenius theorem: Does there exist a Hilbert cone such that a given bounded positive self-adjoint operator $A$ becomes ergodic when its maximum eigenvalue $\|A\|$ is simple? We provide an affirmative answer to this question in this paper. Furthermore, we conduct a detailed analysis of a specialized Hilbert cone introduced to obtain this result. Additionally, we provide an illustrative example of an application of the obtained results to the heat semigroup generated by the magnetic Schr\"odinger operator</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00933v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The bad science matrix problem consists in finding, among all matrices $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ with rows having unit $\ell^2$ norm, one that maximizes $\beta(A) = \frac{1}{2^n} \sum_{x \in \{-1, 1\}^n} \|Ax\|_\infty$. Our main contribution is an explicit construction of an $n \times n$ matrix $A$ showing that $\beta(A) \geq \sqrt{\log_2(n+1)}$, which is only 18% smaller than the asymptotic rate. We prove that every entry of any optimal matrix is a square root of a rational number, and we find provably optimal matrices for $n \leq 4$.</description>

Abstract: This paper considers paired operators in the context of the Lebesgue Hilbert space $L^2$ on the unit circle and its subspace, the Hardy space $H^2$. The kernels of such operators, together with their analytic projections, which are generalizations of Toeplitz kernels, are studied. Inclusion relations between such kernels are considered in detail, and the results are applied to describing the kernels of finite-rank asymmetric truncated Toeplitz operators.</description>

  \item for every $d \in {\rm Pc}(Z)$, there exists a compact subset $K \subset Z$ such that if $d(x,y) = \|d\|$,
  then $x, y \in K$. \end{itemize} Moreover, set
  $${\rm Pp}(Z) = \{d \in {\rm AM}(Z) \mid \text{ there only exists } \{z,w\} \subset Z \text{ such that } d(z,w) = \|d\|\},$$
  and let ${\rm M}(Z)$ be ${\rm Pc}(Z)$ or ${\rm Pp}(Z)$. In this paper, we shall prove the Banach-Stone type theorem on spaces of metrics,
  that is, for metrizable spaces $X$ and $Y$, the following are equivalent:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item $X$ and $Y$ are homeomorphic;
  \item there exists a surjective isometry $T : {\rm PM}(X) \to {\rm PM}(Y)$ with $T({\rm M}(X)) = {\rm M}(Y)$;
  \item there exists a surjective isometry $T : {\rm AM}(X) \to {\rm AM}(Y)$ with $T({\rm M}(X)) = {\rm M}(Y)$;
  \item there exists a surjective isometry $T : {\rm M}(X) \to {\rm M}(Y)$.
  \end{enumerate} Then for each surjective isometry $T : {\rm PM}(X) \to {\rm PM}(Y)$ with $T({\rm M}(X)) = {\rm M}(Y)$, there is a homeomorphism $\phi : Y \to X$ such that for any $d \in {\rm PM}(X)$ and for any $x, y \in Y$, $T(d)(x,y) = d(\phi(x),\phi(y))$. Except for the case where the cardinality of $X$ or $Y$ is equal to $2$, the homeomorphism $\phi$ can be chosen uniquely.</description>

      <title>The quantum metric structure of quantum SU(2)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.06043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.06043v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a two parameter family of Dirac operators on quantum SU(2) and analyse their properties from the point of view of non-commutative metric geometry. It is shown that these Dirac operators give rise to compact quantum metric structures, and that the corresponding two parameter family of compact quantum metric spaces varies continuously in Rieffel's quantum Gromov-Hausdorff distance. This continuity result includes the classical case where we recover the round 3-sphere up to a global scaling factor on the metric. Our main technical tool is a quantum SU(2) analogue of the Berezin transform, together with its associated fuzzy approximations, the analysis of which also leads to a systematic way of approximating Lipschitz operators by means of polynomial expressions in the generators.</description>

      <title>Spectrum and Fine Spectrum of Band Matrices Generated by Oscillatory Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.09302v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, a new class of band matrices is considered where the entries of each non-zero band form a sequence with two limit points. The compact perturbation technique is used to study the spectrum over the $\ell_{p}, (1&lt;p&lt;\infty)$ sequence space. Several spectral subdivisions such as fine spectrum, discrete spectrum, essential spectrum, etc. are obtained. In addition, a few sufficient conditions on the absence of point spectrum over the essential spectrum are also discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04993v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The optimal sufficient conditions for the $L^p$-to-$L^q$ compactness of commutators of singular integral operators of both Calder\'on-Zygmund and of rough type are shown in the different exponent ranges $``q&gt;p"$, $``q=p"$ and $``q&lt;p"$ to quickly follow from each other. The approach is through a new $``\text{off-diagonal to diagonal}"$ extrapolation principle for the compactness of commutators of linear operators together with classical compactness interpolation methods.</description>

      <title>Characterizations of homomorphisms among unital completely positive maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07229v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that a unital completely positive map between finite-dimensional C*-algebras is a homomorphism if and only if it is completely entropy-nonincreasing, where the relevant notion of entropy is a variant of von Neumann entropy. This adjusted von Neumann entropy is the negative of the relative entropy with respect to the uniform state on the C*-algebra, up to an additive constant. As an intermediate step, we prove that a unital completely positive map between finite-dimensional C*-algebras is a homomorphism if and only if its adjusted Choi operator is a projection. Both equivalences generalize familiar facts about stochastic maps between finite sets.</description>

      <title>From Classical to Quantum: Polymorphisms in Non-Commutative Probability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11846v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a parallel between commutative and non-commutative polymorphisms. Our emphasis is the applications to conditional distributions from stochastic processes. In the classical case, both the measures and the positive definite kernels are scalar valued. But the non-commutative framework (as motivated by quantum theory) dictates a setting where instead now both the measures (in the form of quantum states), and the positive definite kernels, are operator valued. The non-commutative theory entails a systematic study of positive operator valued measures, abbreviated POVMs. And quantum states (normal states) are indexed by normalized positive trace-class operators. In the non-commutative theory, the parallel to the commutative/scalar valued theory helps us understand entanglement in quantum information. A further implication of our study of the non-commutative framework will entail an interplay between the two cases, scalar valued, vs operator valued.</description>

      <title>The maximal coarse Baum-Connes conjecture for spaces that admit an A-by-FCE coarse fibration structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06660v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a concept of A-by-FCE coarse fibration structure for metric spaces, which serves as a generalization of the A-by-CE structure for a sequence of group extensions proposed by Deng, Wang, and Yu. We prove that the maximal coarse Baum-Connes conjecture holds for metric spaces with bounded geometry that admit an A-by-FCE coarse fibration structure. As an application, the relative expanders constructed by Arzhantseva and Tessera, as well as the box spaces derived from an ``amenable-by-Haagerup'' group extension, admit the A-by-FCE coarse fibration structure. Consequently, the maximal coarse Baum-Connes conjecture holds for these spaces, which may not admit an FCE structure, i.e. fibred coarse embedding into Hilbert space.</description>

      <title>$L^2$ restriction estimates from the Fourier spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14896v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Stein--Tomas restriction theorem is an important result in Fourier restriction theory. It gives a range of $q$ for which $L^q\to L^2$ restriction estimates hold for a given measure, in terms of the Fourier and Frostman dimensions of the measure. We generalise this result by using the Fourier spectrum; a family of dimensions that interpolate between the Fourier and Sobolev dimensions for measures. This gives us a continuum of Stein--Tomas type estimates, and optimising over this continuum gives a new $L^q\to L^2$ restriction theorem which often outperforms the Stein--Tomas result. We also provide results in the other direction by giving a range of $q$ in terms of the Fourier spectrum for which $L^q\to L^2$ restriction estimates fail, generalising an observation of Hambrook and {\L}aba. We illustrate our results with several examples, including the surface measure on the cone, the moment curve, and several fractal measures.</description>

      <title>Spectral Property of Magnetic Quantum Walk on Hypercube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18401v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce and investigate a model of magnetic quantum walk on a general hypercube. We first construct a set of unitary involutions associated with a magnetic potential $\nu$ by using quantum Bernoulli noises. And then, with these unitary involutions as the magnetic shift operators, we define the evolution operator $\mathsf{W}^{(\nu)}$ for the model, where $\nu$ is the magnetic potential. We examine the point-spectrum and approximate-spectrum of the evolution operator $\mathsf{W}^{(\nu)}$ and obtain their representations in terms of the coin operator system of the model. We show that the point-spectrum and approximate-spectrum of $\mathsf{W}^{(\nu)}$ are completely independent of the magnetic potential $\nu$ although $\mathsf{W}^{(\nu)}$ itself is dependent of the magnetic potential $\nu$. Our work might suggest that a quantum walk perturbed by a magnetic field can have spectral stability with respect to the magnetic potential.</description>
