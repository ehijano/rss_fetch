      <title>Supervised Extraction of the Thermal Sunyaev$-$Zel'dovich Effect with a Three-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The thermal Sunyaev$-$Zel'dovich (SZ) effect offers a unique probe of the hot and diffuse universe that could help close the missing baryon problem. Traditional extractions of the SZ effect, however, exhibit systematic noise that may lead to unreliable results. In this work, we provide an alternative solution using a three-dimensional Attention Nested U-Net trained end-to-end with supervised learning. Our labeled data consists of simulated SZ signals injected into $\textit{Planck}$ frequency maps, allowing our model to learn how to extract SZ signals in the presence of realistic noise. We implement a curriculum learning scheme that gradually exposed the model to weaker SZ signals. The absence/presence of curriculum learning significantly impacted the amount of bias and variance present in the reconstructed SZ signal. The results from our method were comparable to those from the popular $\textit{needlet internal linear combination}$ (NILC) method when evaluated on simulated data as well as real-world SZ signals. We conclude by discussing future avenues for advancing machine learning extractions of SZ signals.</description>

      <title>easyspec: An open-source Python package for long-slit spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In modern-day astronomy, near-infrared, optical, and ultraviolet spectroscopy are indispensable for studying a wide range of phenomena, from measuring black hole masses to analyzing chemical abundances in stellar atmospheres. However, spectroscopic data reduction is often performed using instrument-specific pipelines or legacy software well-established and robust within the community that are often challenging to implement and script in modern astrophysical workflows. In this work, we introduce easyspec, a new Python package designed for long-slit spectroscopy, capable of reducing, extracting, and analyzing spectra from a wide range of instruments--provided they deliver raw FITS files, the standard format for most optical telescopes worldwide. This package is built upon the well-established long-slit spectroscopy routines of the Image Reduction and Analysis Facility (IRAF), integrating modern coding techniques and advanced fitting algorithms based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations. We present a user-friendly open-source Python package that can be easily incorporated into customized pipelines for more complex analyses. To validate its capabilities, we apply easyspec to the active galactic nucleus G4Jy 1709, observed with the DOLORES spectrograph at the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo, measuring its redshift and estimating its supermassive black hole mass. Finally, we compare our results with a previous IRAF-based study.</description>

      <title>reLAISS: A Python Package for Flexible Similarity Searches of Supernovae and Their Host Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discovery rates of supernovae are expected to surpass one million events annually with the Vera C. Rubin Observatory. With unprecedented sample sizes of both common and rare transient types, photometric classification alone will be insufficient for finding one-in-a-million events and prioritizing the 1% of events for spectroscopic follow-up observations. Here, we present reLAISS, a modified framework for similarity searches of supernovae using extracted features of ZTF light curves and Pan-STARRS host galaxy photometry and built on the original LAISS framework. Unlike its predecessor, reLAISS couples interpretable light curve morphology features with extinction-corrected host-galaxy colors to probe both explosion physics and associated stellar populations simultaneously. The library allows users to customize the number of neighbors retrieved, the weight of host and light curve features, and the use of Monte Carlo simulations to ensure relevant matches when features are poorly constrained. We release reLAISS as a pip-installable package with an accompanying reference set of 20,000 features, and a set of tutorials that demonstrate the code's expanded functionality.

      <title>Simulation-based inference with deep ensembles: Evaluating calibration uncertainty and detecting model misspecification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulation-Based Inference (SBI) offers a principled and flexible framework for conducting Bayesian inference in any situation where forward simulations are feasible. However, validating the accuracy and reliability of the inferred posteriors remains a persistent challenge. In this work, we point out a simple diagnostic approach rooted in ensemble learning methods to assess the internal consistency of SBI outputs that does not require access to the true posterior. By training multiple neural estimators under identical conditions and evaluating their pairwise Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergences, we define a consistency criterion that quantifies agreement across the ensemble. We highlight two core use cases for this framework: a) for generating a robust estimate of the systematic uncertainty in parameter reconstruction associated with the training procedure, and b) for detecting possible model misspecification when using trained estimators on real data. We also demonstrate the relationship between significant KL divergences and issues such as insufficient convergence due to, e.g., too low a simulation budget, or intrinsic variance in the training process. Overall, this ensemble-based diagnostic framework provides a lightweight, scalable, and model-agnostic tool for enhancing the trustworthiness of SBI in scientific applications.</description>

      <title>Distributed Acoustic Sensing for Environmental Monitoring, and Newtonian Noise Mitigation:Comparable Sensitivity to Seismometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Newtonian noise limits the low-frequency sensitivity of ground-based gravitational wave detectors. While seismometers and geophones are commonly employed to monitor ground motion for Newtonian noise cancellation, their limited spatial coverage and high deployment costs hinder scalability. In this study, we demonstrate that distributed acoustic sensing offers a viable and scalable alternative, providing performance comparable to that of conventional seismic instruments. Using data from acoustic sensing and colocated seismometers during both natural and controlled events, we observe a strong correlation, exceeding 0.8, between the two sensor types in the 3 to 20 Hz frequency band relevant for Newtonian noise. Moreover, when distributed acoustic sensing data are used to predict geophone signals, the correlation remains high, above 0.7, indicating that distributed acoustic sensing accurately captures both the spatial and spectral features of ground motion. As a case study, we apply distributed acoustic sensing data to cancel noise recorded by the vertical component of a seismometer and compare the results with those obtained using geophone data for the same task. Both distributed acoustic sensing and geophone-based cancellations yield a residual noise factor of 0.11 at 20 Hz. These findings confirm the feasibility of using distributed acoustic sensing for Newtonian noise mitigation and highlight its potential, in combination with traditional seismic sensors, to improve environmental monitoring and noise suppression in current and next-generation gravitational wave observatories.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the robustness of the Auriga galaxy formation model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerical simulations have become an indispensable tool in astrophysics. To interpret their results, it is critical to understand their intrinsic variability, that is, how much the results change with numerical noise or inherent stochasticity of the physics model. We present a set of seven realisations of high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulations of a Milky Way-like galaxy with the Auriga galaxy formation model. All realisations share the same initial conditions and code parameters, but draw different random numbers for the inherently stochastic parts of the model. We show that global galaxy properties at $z=0$, including stellar mass, star formation history, masses of stellar bulge and stellar disc, the radius and height of the stellar disk change by less than $10\%$ between the different realisations, and that magnetic field structures in the disc and the halo are very similar. In contrast, the star formation rate today can vary by a factor of two and the internal morphological structure of the stellar disc can change. The time and orbit of satellite galaxies and their galaxy properties when falling into the main halo are again very similar, but their orbits start to deviate after first pericenter passage. Finally, we show that changing the mass resolution of all matter components in the Auriga model changes galaxy properties significantly more than the intrinsic variability of the model, and that these changes are systematic. This limits detailed comparisons between simulations at different numerical resolutions.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing galactic feedback history via the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest with Habitable Worlds Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have focused on the low-$z$ Ly$\alpha$ forest as a potential constraint on galactic feedback, as different AGN and stellar feedback models in hydrodynamic simulations produce varying intergalactic medium (IGM) statistics. However, existing low-$z$ Ly$\alpha$ forest data provide insufficient observational constraints for simulations due to their low precision and the lack of observations from $z \sim 0.4$ to $1.8$. The Habitable Worlds Observatory, equipped with an ultraviolet (FUV / NUV) spectrograph, could provide transformative data for this science by increasing both absorbers in the redshift range where current data are lacking and increasing the precision of the Ly$\alpha$ forest observational data at $z \leq 0.4$. This spectrograph should cover the wavelengths $1215-3402$ \AA~and have a spectral resolution of $R =$~40,000. Distinguishing between certain active-galactic nuclei feedback models requires high precision ($\sim 5-10$\%) measurements of the Ly$\alpha$ forest 1D transmitted flux power spectrum for $z\leq 1.8$. This requires $\sim 830$ QSO spectra with S/N~$\geq5$ - $25$ depending on redshift. This data would also enable a comprehensive study on the thermal state of the IGM across time, and address the tension between the observed and simulated Ly$\alpha$ forest $b$-value distribution.</description>

      <title>The Pierre Auger Observatory: Contributions to the 39th International Cosmic Rays Conference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Pierre Auger Observatory, located in La Pampa Amarilla, Argentina, has been continuously acquiring data since 2004. It comprises a surface detector array covering 3,000 km$^2$ and 27 fluorescence telescopes, designed to detect extensive air showers initiated by ultra-high-energy cosmic rays. An upgrade to the Observatory was commissioned in 2024, enhancing the existing water-Cherenkov detectors with additional radio antennas, surface scintillator detectors, and a buried scintillator array. This compilation of contributions to the 39th International Cosmic Ray Conference, held in Geneva, Switzerland (July 15-24, 2025), presents recent results from the Pierre Auger Collaboration, addressing a wide range of fundamental questions in astroparticle physics. The included papers cover measurements of the energy spectrum, mass composition, and arrival directions of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays, investigations of hadronic interactions in extensive air showers, and searches for ultra-high-energy photons and neutrinos. Additional topics include radio detection techniques, solar-related phenomena, and atmospheric events such as ELVES and TGFs. The list also contains first results and performance evaluations of the upgraded detectors, AugerPrime, along with reports on outreach and social engagement initiatives conducted by the Collaboration.</description>

      <title>Microlensing optical depth, event rate, and limits on compact objects in dark matter based on 20 years of OGLE observations of the Small Magellanic Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Some previous studies have suggested that massive and intermediate-mass primordial black holes (PBHs) could comprise a substantial fraction of dark matter in the Universe. Such black holes, if they existed in the Milky Way halo, would give rise to long-duration microlensing events that may potentially last for years. However, earlier searches were not sufficiently sensitive to detect such events. Here, we present the results of searches for long-timescale gravitational microlensing events toward the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) using nearly 20 years of photometric observations collected by the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) from 2001 to 2020. We found six events, three of which are new discoveries. We use a sample of five events to measure the microlensing optical depth toward the SMC $\tau = (0.32 \pm 0.18) \times 10^{-7}$ and the event rate $\Gamma = (1.18 \pm 0.57) \times 10^{-7}\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}\,\mathrm{star}^{-1}$. The properties of the detected events are consistent with lenses originating from known stellar populations within the SMC or in the Milky Way disk. No events with timescales longer than 1 yr were detected, which provides competitive limits on the fraction of massive compact objects, including PBHs, in the Milky Way dark matter halo. Together with the earlier OGLE studies of microlensing events in the direction of the Large Magellanic Cloud, these observations rule out PBHs and other compact objects with masses ranging from $10^{-8}$ to $10^3\,M_{\odot}$ as dominant components of dark matter.</description>

      <title>The Extended Atlas of Low-resolution Spectra from the Infrared Astronomical Satellite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an updated atlas of spectra from the Low-Resolution Spectrometer (LRS) on the Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS), which took spectra from 7.67 to 22.73 um with a spectral resolving power (lambda / Delta lambda) of 20-60. The updated atlas includes 11,238 spectra, including 5425 spectra published in the original LRS Atlas, 5796 spectra published in three later papers, and 17 spectra previously available online but not published. The updated atlas has significantly more sources close to the Galactic plane than the original atlas. We have applied an improved spectral correction to remove an artifact at 8 um in the original database. While the IRAS mission flew over 40 yr ago, the extended LRS atlas remains the single most complete database of mid-infrared spectra of nearby and bright objects in the Galaxy.</description>

      <title>LightCurve MoE: A Dynamic Sparse Routing Mixture-of-Experts Architecture for Efficient Stellar Light Curve Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.13745v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The classification of stellar light curves has become a key task in modern time-domain astronomy, fueled by the rapid growth of data from large-scale surveys such as Kepler and TESS. Although deep learning models have achieved high accuracy in this area, their computational costs can limit scalability. To tackle this issue, we propose LightCurve MoE, a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture that combines dynamic sparse routing with a dual-gating mechanism to balance accuracy, efficiency, and robustness. Our model includes five specialized experts, each using a different feature extraction method-such as wavelet transforms, Gramian angular fields, and recurrence plots-to capture unique patterns in the light curves. A dual-gating mechanism evaluates these expert outputs by analyzing both frequency and time-domain features, allowing the model to adaptively weigh each expert's contribution. During inference, only the top 3 out of 5 experts are activated per sample using a Top-k routing strategy, reducing computational cost by 40% compared to dense models while preserving strong accuracy (96%). The model also includes entropy regularization and a technique to retain inactive experts during training, ensuring stable and effective learning. By combining sparse computation with multi-modal feature fusion, LightCurve MoE offers a scalable solution for future large-scale photometric surveys like LSST and Global Open Transient Telescope Array (GOTTA), where processing efficiency is crucial due to the massive volume of daily data.</description>

      <title>OntoPortal-Astro, a Semantic Artefact Catalogue for Astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12897v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The astronomy communities are widely recognised as mature communities for their open science practices. However, while their data ecosystems are rather advanced and permit efficient data interoperability, there are still gaps between these ecosystems. Semantic artefacts (SAs) -- e.g., ontologies, thesauri, vocabularies or metadata schemas -- are a means to bridge that gap as they allow to semantically described the data and map the underlying concepts. The increasing use of SAs in astronomy presents challenges in description, selection, evaluation, trust, and mappings. The landscape remains fragmented, with SAs scattered across various registries in diverse formats and structures -- not yet fully developed or encoded with rich semantic web standards like OWL or SKOS -- and often with overlapping scopes. Enhancing data semantic interoperability requires common platforms to catalog, align, and facilitate the sharing of FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) SAs. In the frame of the FAIR-IMPACT project, we prototyped a SA catalogue for astronomy, heliophysics and planetary sciences. This exercise resulted in improved vocabulary and ontology management in the communities, and is now paving the way for better interdisciplinary data discovery and reuse. This article presents current practices in our discipline, reviews candidate SAs for such a catalogue, presents driving use cases and the perspective of a real production service for the astronomy community based on the OntoPortal technology, that will be called OntoPortal-Astro.</description>

      <title>In-flight Characteristics and Modelling of the Instrumental Background of EP/FXT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00510v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The in-flight instrumental background of the Follow-up X-ray Telescope (FXT) onboard Einstein Probe (EP) mission is analysed in this work by utilizing observations collected during Performance Verification phase and subsequent dedicated filter wheel closed observations. The instrumental backgrounds of the two FXT modules are consistent with each other, with an average rate of $\sim 4\times10^{-2}$\,counts/s/keV in the 0.5--10\,keV band for each module. The background is nearly uniformly distributed across the detector area, with a minor increase ($&lt;8\%$) observed along rows. The spatial distribution shows significant modulation by the geomagnetic field. The spectral shapes remain unchanged in 0.5--10\,keV at different rates. The long-term temporal variation indicates a periodic change associated with the orbital precession ($\sim 57$ days). The innovative design of FXT full-frame readout mode enables simultaneous recording of events in both the imaging area (IMG) and the frame store area (FSA) of the pnCCD. FSA event rates show a strong linear correlation with the IMG, based on which the IMG instrumental background modelling is established.</description>
