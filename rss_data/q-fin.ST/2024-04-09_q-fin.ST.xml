      <title>A Comparison of Cryptocurrency Volatility-benchmarking New and Mature Asset Classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper analyzes the cryptocurrency ecosystem at both the aggregate and individual levels to understand the factors that impact future volatility. The study uses high-frequency panel data from 2020 to 2022 to examine the relationship between several market volatility drivers, such as daily leverage, signed volatility and jumps. Several known autoregressive model specifications are estimated over different market regimes, and results are compared to equity data as a reference benchmark of a more mature asset class. The panel estimations show that the positive market returns at the high-frequency level increase price volatility, contrary to what is expected from the classical financial literature. We attributed this effect to the price dynamics over the last year of the dataset (2022) by repeating the estimation on different time spans. Moreover, the positive signed volatility and negative daily leverage positively impact the cryptocurrencies' future volatility, unlike what emerges from the same study on a cross-section of stocks. This result signals a structural difference in a nascent cryptocurrency market that has to mature yet. Further individual-level analysis confirms the findings of the panel analysis and highlights that these effects are statistically significant and commonly shared among many components in the selected universe.</description>

      <title>StockGPT: A GenAI Model for Stock Prediction and Trading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces StockGPT, an autoregressive "number" model pretrained directly on the history of daily U.S. stock returns. Treating each return series as a sequence of tokens, the model excels at understanding and predicting the highly intricate stock return dynamics. Instead of relying on handcrafted trading patterns using historical stock prices, StockGPT automatically learns the hidden representations predictive of future returns via its attention mechanism. On a held-out test sample from 2001 to 2023, a daily rebalanced long-short portfolio formed from StockGPT predictions earns an annual return of 119% with a Sharpe ratio of 6.5. The StockGPT-based portfolio completely explains away momentum and long-/short-term reversals, eliminating the need for manually crafted price-based strategies and also encompasses most leading stock market factors. This highlights the immense promise of generative AI in surpassing human in making complex financial investment decisions and illustrates the efficacy of the attention mechanism of large language models when applied to a completely different domain.</description>

      <title>Using a Deep Learning Model to Simulate Human Stock Trader's Methods of Chart Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.14870v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the efficient market hypothesis, many studies suggest the existence of inefficiencies in the stock market leading to the development of techniques to gain above-market returns. Systematic trading has undergone significant advances in recent decades with deep learning schemes emerging as a powerful tool for analyzing and predicting market behavior. In this paper, a method is proposed that is inspired by how professional technical analysts trade. This scheme looks at stock prices of the previous 600 days and predicts whether the stock price will rise or fall 10% or 20% within the next D days. The proposed method uses the Resnet's (a deep learning model) skip connections and logits to increase the probability of the prediction. The model was trained and tested using historical data from both the Korea and US stock markets. The backtest is done using the data from 2020 to 2022. Using the proposed method for the Korea market it gave return of 75.36% having Sharpe ratio of 1.57, which far exceeds the market return by 36% and 0.61, respectively. On the US market it gives total return of 27.17% with Sharpe ratio of 0.61, which outperforms other benchmarks such as NASDAQ, S&amp;P500, DOW JONES index by 17.69% and 0.27, respectively.</description>

      <title>DoubleAdapt: A Meta-learning Approach to Incremental Learning for Stock Trend Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.09862v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stock trend forecasting is a fundamental task of quantitative investment where precise predictions of price trends are indispensable. As an online service, stock data continuously arrive over time. It is practical and efficient to incrementally update the forecast model with the latest data which may reveal some new patterns recurring in the future stock market. However, incremental learning for stock trend forecasting still remains under-explored due to the challenge of distribution shifts (a.k.a. concept drifts). With the stock market dynamically evolving, the distribution of future data can slightly or significantly differ from incremental data, hindering the effectiveness of incremental updates. To address this challenge, we propose DoubleAdapt, an end-to-end framework with two adapters, which can effectively adapt the data and the model to mitigate the effects of distribution shifts. Our key insight is to automatically learn how to adapt stock data into a locally stationary distribution in favor of profitable updates. Complemented by data adaptation, we can confidently adapt the model parameters under mitigated distribution shifts. We cast each incremental learning task as a meta-learning task and automatically optimize the adapters for desirable data adaptation and parameter initialization. Experiments on real-world stock datasets demonstrate that DoubleAdapt achieves state-of-the-art predictive performance and shows considerable efficiency.</description>

      <title>The credit spread curve. I: Fundamental concepts, fitting, par-adjusted spread, and expected return</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.01330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.01330v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The notion of a credit spread curve is fundamental in fixed income investing, but in practice it is not `given' and needs to be constructed from bond prices either for a particular issuer, or for a sector rating-by-rating. Rather than attempting to fit spreads -- and as we discuss here, the Z-spread is unsuitable -- we fit parametrised survival curves. By deriving a valuation formula for a risky bond, we explain and avoid the problem that bonds with a high dollar price trade at a higher yield or spread than those with low dollar price (at the same maturity point), even though they do not necessarily offer better value. In fact, a concise treatment of this effect is elusive, and much of the academic literature on risky bond pricing, including a well-known paper by Duffie and Singleton (1997), is fundamentally incorrect. We then proceed to show how to calculate carry, rolldown and relative value for bonds/CDS. Also, once curve construction has been programmed and automated we can run it historically and assess the way a curve has moved over time. This provides the necessary grounding for econometric and arbitrage-free models of curve dynamics, which will be pursued in later work, as well as assessing how the perceived relative value of a particular instrument varies over time.</description>

      <title>Do t-Statistic Hurdles Need to be Raised?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.10275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.10275v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many scholars have called for raising statistical hurdles to guard against false discoveries in academic publications. I show these calls may be difficult to justify empirically. Published data exhibit bias: results that fail to meet existing hurdles are often unobserved. These unobserved results must be extrapolated, which can lead to weak identification of revised hurdles. In contrast, statistics that can target only published findings (e.g. empirical Bayes shrinkage and the FDR) can be strongly identified, as data on published findings is plentiful. I demonstrate these results theoretically and in an empirical analysis of the cross-sectional return predictability literature.</description>
