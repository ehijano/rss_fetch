      <title>$\mathcal{W}$-absorbing actions of finite groups on the Razak-Jacelon algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We say that a countable discrete group action $\alpha$ on a C$^*$-algebra $A$ is \textit{$\mathcal{W}$-absorbing} if there exist a C$^*$-algebra $B$ and an action $\beta$ on $B$ such that $\alpha$ is cocycle conjugate to $\beta\otimes \mathrm{id}_{\mathcal{W}}$ on $B\otimes \mathcal{W}$ where $\mathcal{W}$ is the Razak-Jacelon algebra. In this paper, we completely classify outer $\mathcal{W}$-absorbing actions of finite groups on $\mathcal{W}$ up to conjugacy and cocycle conjugacy.</description>

      <title>The coarse Baum-Connes conjecture with filtered coefficients and product metric spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the quantitative $K$-theory, in this paper, we introduce the coarse Baum-Connes conjecture with filtered coefficients which generalizes the original conjecture. The are two advantages for the conjecture with filtered coefficients. Firstly, the routes toward the coarse Baum-Connes conjecture also work for the conjecture with filtered coefficients. Secondly, the class of metric spaces that satisfy the conjecture with filtered coefficients is closed under products and yet it is not known for the original conjecture. As an application, we show some new examples of product metric spaces for the coarse Baum-Connes conjecture.</description>

      <title>Operator algebraic characterization of the noncommutative Poisson boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain an operator algebraic characterization of the noncommutative Furstenberg-Poisson boundary $\operatorname{L}(\Gamma) \subset \operatorname{L}(\Gamma \curvearrowright B)$ associated with an admissible probability measure $\mu \in \operatorname{Prob}(\Gamma)$ for which the $(\Gamma, \mu)$-Furstenberg-Poisson boundary $(B, \nu_B)$ is uniquely $\mu$-stationary. This is a noncommutative generalization of Nevo-Sageev's structure theorem [NS11]. We apply this result in combination with previous works to provide further evidence towards Connes' rigidity conjecture for higher rank lattices.</description>

      <title>Simplices of maximally amenable extensions in II$_1$ factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For every $n\in \mathbb{N}$ we obtain a separable II$_1$ factor $M$ and a maximally abelian subalgebra $A\subset M$ such that the space of maximally amenable extensions of $A$ in $M$ is affinely identified with the $n$ dimensional $\mathbb{R}$-simplex. This moreover yields first examples of masas in II$_1$ factors $A\subset M$ admitting exactly $n$ maximally amenable factorial extensions. Our examples of such $M$ are group von Neumann algebras of free products of lamplighter groups amalgamated over the acting group. A conceptual ingredient that goes into obtaining this result is a simultaneous relative asymptotic orthogonality property, extending prior works in the literature. The proof uses technical tools including our uniform-flattening strategy for commutants in ultrapowers of II$_1$ factors.</description>

      <title>Relational Quantum Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A common feature of the extended phase space of gauge theory, the crossed product of quantum theory, and quantum reference frames (QRFs) is the adjoining of degrees of freedom followed by a constraining procedure for the resulting total system. Building on previous work, we identify non-commutative or quantum geometry as a mathematical framework which unifies these three objects. We first provide a rigorous account of the extended phase space, and demonstrate that it can be regarded as a classical principal bundle with a Poisson manifold base. We then show that the crossed product is a trivial quantum principal bundle which both substantiates a conjecture on the quantization of the extended phase space and facilitates a relational interpretation. Combining several crossed products with possibly distinct structure groups into a single object, we arrive at a novel definition of a quantum orbifold. We demonstrate that change of frame maps within the quantum orbifold correspond to quantum gauge transformations, which are QRF preserving maps between crossed product algebras. Finally, we conclude that the quantum orbifold is equivalent to the G-framed algebra proposed in prior work, thereby placing systems containing multiple QRFs squarely in the context of quantum geometry.</description>

      <title>Measurable splittings and the measured group theoretic structure of wreath products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be a countable group that admits an essential measurable splitting (for instance, any group measure equivalent to a free product of nontrivial groups).
  We show that, for any two nontrivial measure equivalent groups $A$ and $B$, the wreath product groups $A\wr\Gamma$ and $B\wr\Gamma$ are orbit equivalent -- this is interesting even in the case when the groups $A$ and $B$ are finite.
  On the other hand, we show that certain wreath product actions are not even stably orbit equivalent if $\Gamma$ is instead assumed to be a sofic icc group that is Bernoulli superrigid, and $A$ and $B$ have different cardinalities.</description>

      <title>The BV construction for finite spectral triples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article presents how the BV formalism naturally inserts in the framework of noncommutative geometry for gauge theories induced by finite spectral triples. Reaching this goal entails that not only all the steps of the BV construction, from the introduction of ghost/anti-ghost fields to the construction of the BRST complex, can be expressed using noncommutative geometric objects, but also that the method to go from one step in the construction to the next one has an intrinsically noncommutative geometric nature. Moreover, we prove that both the classical BV and BRST complexes coincide with another cohomological theory, naturally appearing in noncommutative geometry: the Hochschild complex of a coalgebra. The construction is presented in detail for $U(n)$-gauge theories induced by spectral triples on the algebra $M_n(\mathbb{C})$.</description>

      <title>Rigidity results for group von Neumann algebras with diffuse center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01280v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the first examples of groups $G$ with infinite center which in a natural sense are completely recognizable from their von Neumann algebras, $\mathcal{L}(G)$. Specifically, assume that $G=A\times W$, where $A$ is an infinite abelian group and $W$ is an ICC wreath-like product group [CIOS22a; AMCOS23] with property (T) and trivial abelianization. Then whenever $H$ is an \emph{arbitrary} group such that $\mathcal{L}(G)$ is $\ast$-isomorphic to $\mathcal L(H)$ it must be the case that $H= B \times H_0$ where $B$ is infinite abelian and $H_0$ is isomorphic to $W$. Moreover, we completely describe the $\ast$-isomorphism between $\mathcal L(G)$ and $\mathcal L(H)$. This yields new applications to the classification of group C$^*$-algebras, including examples of non-amenable groups which are recoverable from their reduced C$^*$-algebras but not from their von Neumann algebras.</description>

      <title>On the unitary representation theory of locally compact contraction groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03041v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The unitary representation theory of locally compact contraction groups and their semi-direct products with $\mathbb{Z}$ is studied. We put forward the problem of completely characterising such groups which are type I or CCR and this article provides a stepping stone towards a solution to this problem. In particular, we determine new examples of type I and non-type-I groups in this class, and we completely classify the irreducible unitary representations of the torsion-free groups, which are shown to be type I. When these groups are totally disconnected, they admit a faithful action by automorphisms on an infinite locally-finite regular tree; this work thus provides new examples of automorphism groups of regular trees with interesting representation theory, adding to recent work on this topic.</description>

      <title>Conjugating trivial automorphisms of $\mathcal P(\mathbb N)/\mathrm{Fin}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08789v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A trivial automorphism of the Boolean algebra $\mathcal P(\mathbb N) / \mathrm{Fin}$ is an automorphism induced by the action of some function $\mathbb N \rightarrow \mathbb N$. In models of forcing axioms all automorphisms are trivial, and therefore two trivial automorphisms are conjugate if and only if they have the same (modulo finite) cycle structure. We show that the Continuum Hypothesis implies that two trivial automorphisms are conjugate if and only if there are neither first-order obstructions nor index obstructions for their conjugacy. This is equivalent to given trivial automorphisms being conugate in some forcing extension of the universe.
  To each automorphism $\alpha$ of $\mathcal P(\mathbb N) / \mathrm{Fin}$ we associate the first-order structure $\mathfrak{A}_\alpha=(\mathcal P(\mathbb N) / \mathrm{Fin},\alpha)$ and compute the existential theories of these structures.
  These results are applied to resolve a question of Braga, Farah, and Vignati and prove that there are coarse metric spaces $X$ and $Y$ such that the isomorphism between their uniform Roe coronas is independent from $\mathsf{ZFC}$.</description>
