      <title>Reliability Assessment Framework Based on Feature Separability for Pathological Cell Image Classification under Prior Bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: \textbf{Background and objective:} Prior probability shift between training and deployment datasets challenges deep learning--based medical image classification. Standard correction methods reweight posterior probabilities to adjust prior bias, yet their benefit is inconsistent. We developed a reliability framework identifying when prior correction helps or harms performance in pathological cell image analysis. \textbf{Methods:} We analyzed 303 colorectal cancer specimens with CD103/CD8 immunostaining, yielding 185{,}432 annotated cell images across 16 cell types. ResNet models were trained under varying bias ratios (1.1--20$\times$). Feature separability was quantified using cosine similarity--based likelihood quality scores, reflecting intra- versus inter-class distinctions in learned feature spaces. Multiple linear regression, ANOVA, and generalized additive models (GAMs) evaluated associations among feature separability, prior bias, sample adequacy, and F1 performance. \textbf{Results:} Feature separability dominated performance ($\beta = 1.650$, $p &lt; 0.001$), showing 412-fold stronger impact than prior bias ($\beta = 0.004$, $p = 0.018$). GAM analysis showed strong predictive power ($R^2 = 0.876$) with mostly linear trends. A quality threshold of 0.294 effectively identified cases requiring correction (AUC = 0.610). Cell types scoring $&gt;0.5$ were robust without correction, whereas those $&lt;0.3$ consistently required adjustment. \textbf{Conclusion:} Feature extraction quality, not bias magnitude, governs correction benefit. The proposed framework provides quantitative guidance for selective correction, enabling efficient deployment and reliable diagnostic AI.</description>

      <title>Spatial Insight: How Data-Driven Regions of Interest Selection Enhances Single-Trial P300 Classification in EEG-Based BCIs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: EEG-based Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) frequently face spatial specificity limitations in detecting single-trial P300 potentials, a neurophysiological hallmark leveraged for both BCI control and neurodegenerative disease diagnostics. We present a novel framework combining eLORETA source localization with cross-subject functional connectivity to identify stable regions of interest (ROIs) across sessions. Analyzing 62-channel EEG data from 31 subjects (63 sessions, 2,520 trials), we demonstrate that phase-lagged connectivity metrics can reliably isolate task-relevant hubs in deeper cortical-subcortical structures like the insula and parietal regions - critical for Alzheimer's disease biomarkers. By integrating spatially stable ROIs with dynamic temporal agreement, our hybrid classification systematically outperforms whole-brain approaches in different frequency bands (up to 5.4% depending on the connectivity method and the spectral range) while maintaining millisecond-level temporal precision.
  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to establish cross-subject ROI consensus through source-space connectivity, bypassing scalp EEG's depth constraints to probe Alzheimer's-relevant networks. The framework's robustness to noise and compatibility with portable systems offer significant potential for global deployment in early neurodegenerative disease detection. Future integration of individualized anatomical data or adaptive parameter optimization could refine this tool for clinical deployment, enhancing the current max accuracy of 81.57% in the 1-15 Hz range.</description>

      <title>Predicting Microbial Interactions Using Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting interspecies interactions is a key challenge in microbial ecology, as these interactions are critical to determining the structure and activity of microbial communities. In this work, we used data on monoculture growth capabilities, interactions with other species, and phylogeny to predict a negative or positive effect of interactions. More precisely, we used one of the largest available pairwise interaction datasets to train our models, comprising over 7,500 interactions be- tween 20 species from two taxonomic groups co-cultured under 40 distinct carbon conditions, with a primary focus on the work of Nestor et al.[28 ]. In this work, we propose Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) as a powerful classifier to predict the direction of the effect. We construct edge-graphs of pairwise microbial interactions in order to leverage shared information across individual co-culture experiments, and use GNNs to predict modes of interaction. Our model can not only predict binary interactions (positive/negative) but also classify more complex interaction types such as mutualism, competition, and parasitism. Our initial results were encouraging, achieving an F1-score of 80.44%. This significantly outperforms comparable methods in the literature, including conventional Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) models, which reported an F1-score of 72.76%.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Evolutionary Cell Type Matching via Entropy-Minimized Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24759v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Identifying evolutionary correspondences between cell types across species is a fundamental challenge in comparative genomics and evolutionary biology. Existing approaches often rely on either reference-based matching, which imposes asymmetry by designating one species as the reference, or projection-based matching, which may increase computational complexity and obscure biological interpretability at the cell-type level. Here, we present OT-MESH, an unsupervised computational framework leveraging entropy-regularized optimal transport (OT) to systematically determine cross-species cell type homologies. Our method uniquely integrates the Minimize Entropy of Sinkhorn (MESH) technique to refine the OT plan, transforming diffuse transport matrices into sparse, interpretable correspondences. Through systematic evaluation on synthetic datasets, we demonstrate that OT-MESH achieves near-optimal matching accuracy with computational efficiency, while maintaining remarkable robustness to noise. Compared to other OT-based methods like RefCM, OT-MESH provides speedup while achieving comparable accuracy. Applied to retinal bipolar cells (BCs) and retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) from mouse and macaque, OT-MESH accurately recovers known evolutionary relationships and uncovers novel correspondences, one of which was independently validated experimentally. Thus, our framework offers a principled, scalable, and interpretable solution for evolutionary cell type mapping, facilitating deeper insights into cellular specialization and conservation across species.</description>

      <title>Quantifying AI-to-Clinical Translation: The Algorithm-to-Outcome Concordance (AOC) Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26685v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background: Despite high in-silico performance (AUC &gt;0.80), 85% of AI cancer biomarkers fail clinical translation, exposing a critical algorithm-to-outcome gap. Methods: We introduce the Algorithm-to-Outcome Concordance (AOC) framework, integrating model accuracy (AUC), clinical correlation (Corr), and trial heterogeneity. We validated AOC across 6 neoantigen vaccine trials (2017-2025) and 3 independent melanoma immunotherapy cohorts (n=188 patients). Results: AOC ranged 0.18-0.79 across trials, with failed trials (ORR &lt;15%) showing AOC &lt;0.40. External validation revealed unstable algorithm-outcome correlation (C-index: 0.49-0.61, p&gt;0.05), demonstrating the necessity of explicit concordance assessment. Conclusions: AOC provides a quantitative framework for pre-trial risk assessment and adaptive trial design. Prospective validation is underway in KEYNOTE-942 extension studies.</description>

      <title>Cross-modal Diffusion Modelling for Super-resolved Spatial Transcriptomics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12973v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent advancement of spatial transcriptomics (ST) allows to characterize spatial gene expression within tissue for discovery research. However, current ST platforms suffer from low resolution, hindering in-depth understanding of spatial gene expression. Super-resolution approaches promise to enhance ST maps by integrating histology images with gene expressions of profiled tissue spots. However, current super-resolution methods are limited by restoration uncertainty and mode collapse. Although diffusion models have shown promise in capturing complex interactions between multi-modal conditions, it remains a challenge to integrate histology images and gene expression for super-resolved ST maps. This paper proposes a cross-modal conditional diffusion model for super-resolving ST maps with the guidance of histology images. Specifically, we design a multi-modal disentangling network with cross-modal adaptive modulation to utilize complementary information from histology images and spatial gene expression. Moreover, we propose a dynamic cross-attention modelling strategy to extract hierarchical cell-to-tissue information from histology images. Lastly, we propose a co-expression-based gene-correlation graph network to model the co-expression relationship of multiple genes. Experiments show that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in ST super-resolution on three public datasets.</description>

      <title>Surrogate modeling of Cellular-Potts Agent-Based Models as a segmentation task using the U-Net neural network architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00316v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Cellular-Potts model is a powerful and ubiquitous framework for developing computational models for simulating complex multicellular biological systems. Cellular-Potts models (CPMs) are often computationally expensive due to the explicit modeling of interactions among large numbers of individual model agents and diffusive fields described by partial differential equations (PDEs). In this work, we develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) surrogate model using a U-Net architecture that accounts for periodic boundary conditions. We use this model to accelerate the evaluation of a mechanistic CPM previously used to investigate in vitro vasculogenesis. The surrogate model was trained to predict 100 computational steps ahead (Monte-Carlo steps, MCS), accelerating simulation evaluations by a factor of 590 times compared to CPM code execution. Over multiple recursive evaluations, our model effectively captures the emergent behaviors demonstrated by the original Cellular-Potts model of such as vessel sprouting, extension and anastomosis, and contraction of vascular lacunae. This approach demonstrates the potential for deep learning to serve as efficient surrogate models for CPM simulations, enabling faster evaluation of computationally expensive CPM of biological processes at greater spatial and temporal scales.</description>
