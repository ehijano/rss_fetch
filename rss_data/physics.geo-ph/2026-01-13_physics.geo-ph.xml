      <title>Mud-Standoff Effect Correction Based on Open-Short Calibration and Resistivity Consistency-Constrained Iterative Inversion for Oil-Based Mud Imagers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a mud-standoff effect correction method and a set of approximate apparent resistivity inversion methods suitable for oil-based mud micro-resistivity imaging logging. To calibrate the influence of the mud layer on electrode measurement signals, this study integrates the Open-Short calibration(OSC) method with the three-layer impedance model of the oil-based mud resistivity imager. By treating the electrode and the mud layer as an integrated whole and simulating the open/short-circuit states via the finite element method, the independent extraction of the mud layer impedance signal is achieved, and the formation impedance signal is separated from the total impedance. For fast inversion of formation resistivity, standoff thickness (mud layer thickness), and relative permittivity of formation, a resistivity consistency-constrained iterative inversion method is further proposed. In this method, the formation impedance is first converted into resistivity, and then the consistency residual of the resistivity at different frequencies is used as the objective function to invert the approximate apparent resistivity of the formation through an iterative optimization algorithm. The effectiveness of the finite element-simulated OSC method, the objective function construction scheme, and the consistency inversion method is verified through both numerical models and an example of field data.</description>

      <title>Universal scaling between precursory duration and event size across mechanically driven geohazards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many catastrophic events, including landslides, rockbursts, glacier breakoffs, and volcanic eruptions, are preceded by an observable acceleration phase that offers a critical window for early warning and hazard mitigation; however, the duration of this precursory phase remains poorly constrained across sites, scales, and hazard types. This limitation arises because the onset of acceleration is often identified using heuristic thresholds or empirical criteria. Here, we introduce a physics-based framework that objectively constrains the precursory duration from accelerating dynamics, without prescribing the onset a priori or being tied to any specific observable. We analyse a global dataset of 109 geohazard events across seven continents over the past century, quantifying their precursory durations in a consistent manner. For mechanically driven instabilities, we identify a robust scaling between precursory duration and failure volume spanning more than ten orders of magnitude. When expressed in terms of a characteristic system size, this relationship is close to linear, consistent with finite-size scaling near a dynamical critical point. This behaviour indicates that precursory duration reflects the progressive growth of correlated deformation up to system-spanning scales, rather than local rupture kinetics. The resulting universality points to common organising mechanisms governing the approach to catastrophic failure across mechanically driven geohazards.</description>

      <title>SourceNet: Interpretable Sim-to-Real Inference on Variable-Geometry Sensor Arrays for Earthquake Source Inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inferring high-dimensional physical states from sparse, ad-hoc sensor arrays is a fundamental challenge across AI for Science, as they are complicated by irregular geometries and the profound Sim-to-Real gap in physical modeling. Taking earthquake source characterization as a representative challenge, we address limitations in conventional deep learning: CNNs demand fixed grids, while pooling-based architectures (e.g., DeepSets) struggle to capture the relational wave physics. Here, we propose SourceNet, a Transformer-based framework that treats the sensor array as a flexible set to model arbitrary geometries. To bridge the reality gap, we introduce Physics-Structured Domain Randomization (PSDR). Instead of forcing feature alignment, PSDR randomizes the governing physical dynamics by varying velocity structures, propagation effects, and sensor availability, to force the model to learn robust representations invariant to unmodeled environmental heterogeneity. By pre-training on 100,000 synthetic events and fine-tuning on ~2,000 real world events, SourceNet achieves state-of-the-art precision on held-out real data. This demonstrates exceptional data efficiency, and matches classical solvers while enabling real-time processing. Remarkably, interpretability analysis reveals that the model shows scientific-agent-like features: it autonomously discovers geometric information bottlenecks and learns an attention policy that prioritizes sparse sensor placements, effectively recovering principles of optimal experimental design from data alone.</description>

      <title>Towards Operational Streamflow Forecasting in the Limpopo River Basin using Long Short-Term Memory Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robust hydrological simulation is key for sustainable development, water management strategies, and climate change adaptation. In recent years, deep learning methods have been demonstrated to outperform mechanistic models at the task of hydrological discharge simulation. Adoption of these methods has been catalysed by the proliferation of large sample hydrology datasets, consisting of the observed discharge and meteorological drivers, along with geological and topographical catchment descriptors. Deep learning methods infer rainfall-runoff characteristics that have been shown to generalise across catchments, benefitting from the data diversity in large datasets. Despite this, application to catchments in Africa has been limited. The lack of adoption of deep learning methodologies is primarily due to sparsity or lack of the spatiotemporal observational data required to enable downstream model training. We therefore investigate the application of deep learning models, including LSTMs, for hydrological discharge simulation in the transboundary Limpopo River basin, emphasising application to data scarce regions. We conduct a number of computational experiments primarily focused on assessing the impact of varying the LSTM model input data on performance. Results confirm that data constraints remain the largest obstacle to deep learning applications across African river basins. We further outline the impact of human influence on data-driven modelling which is a commonly overlooked aspect of data-driven large-sample hydrology approaches and investigate solutions for model adaptation under smaller datasets. Additionally, we include recommendations for future efforts towards seasonal hydrological discharge prediction and direct comparison or inclusion of SWAT model outputs, as well as architectural improvements.</description>

      <title>Strategic Geosteering Workflow with Uncertainty Quantification and Deep Learning: A Case Study on the Goliat Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.15548v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The real-time interpretation of the logging-while-drilling data allows us to estimate the positions and properties of the geological layers in an anisotropic subsurface environment. Robust real-time estimations capturing uncertainty can be very useful for efficient geosteering operations. However, the model errors in the prior conceptual geological models and forward simulation of the measurements can be significant factors in the unreliable estimations of the profiles of the geological layers. The model errors are specifically pronounced when using a deep-neural-network (DNN) approximation which we use to accelerate and parallelize the simulation of the measurements. This paper presents a practical workflow consisting of offline and online phases. The offline phase includes DNN training and building of an uncertain prior near-well geo-model. The online phase uses the flexible iterative ensemble smoother (FlexIES) to perform real-time assimilation of extra-deep electromagnetic data accounting for the model errors in the approximate DNN model. We demonstrate the proposed workflow on a case study for a historic well in the Goliat Field (Barents Sea). The median of our probabilistic estimation is on-par with proprietary inversion despite the approximate DNN model and regardless of the number of layers in the chosen prior. By estimating the model errors, FlexIES automatically quantifies the uncertainty in the layers' boundaries and resistivities, which is not standard for proprietary inversion.</description>

      <title>Direct-3D Variational Bayesian Surface Wave Inversion and Its Application to Ambient Noise Tomography beneath Great Britain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15390v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new, variational, fully nonlinear, probabilistic ambient noise tomography method, which estimates subsurface structure and quantifies the corresponding uncertainties directly in three dimensions (3D) from inter-receiver seismic surface wave dispersion data. We use the method to invert for high resolution 3D seismic velocity models of the upper crust beneath Great Britain using seismic ambient noise data recorded around the region - a task that proved too high-dimensional and hence computationally demanding for Monte Carlo sampling to converge to a stable solution. We compare the inversion results from the new method to those obtained from two standard, indirect inversion methods, in which 2D (geographical) surface wave velocity maps and 1D (depth) shear velocity profiles are estimated in two separate, consecutive steps. The results show that the direct-3D scheme preserves better lateral continuity and produces better data fit than the two-step methods, and provides information about lateral correlations that is absent from the two-step solutions. The inversion results are consistent with large-scale geology of Great Britain, and for the first time provide seismologically-imaged evidence of the Great Glen Fault and other major tectonic faults. We therefore propose that direct-3D inversion schemes should be used where possible for surface wave inversion as they provide improved results at little additional computational cost.</description>

      <title>Earthquake Source Depth Determination using Single Station Waveforms and Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02346v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In areas with limited station coverage, earthquake depth constraints are much less accurate than their latitude and longitude. Traditional travel-time-based location methods struggle to constrain depths due to imperfect station distribution and the strong trade-off between source depth and origin time. Identifying depth phases at regional distances is usually hindered by strong wave scattering, which is particularly challenging for low-magnitude events. Deep learning algorithms, capable of extracting various features from seismic waveforms, including phase arrivals, phase amplitudes, as well as phase frequency, offer promising constraints to earthquake depths. In this work, we propose a novel depth feature extraction network (named VGGDepth), which directly maps seismic waveforms to earthquake depth using three-component waveforms. The network structure is adapted from VGG16 in computer vision. It is designed to take single-station three-component waveforms as inputs and produce depths as outputs, achieving a direct mapping from waveforms to depths. Two scenarios are considered in our model development: (1) training and testing solely on the same seismic station, and (2) generalizing by training and testing on different seismic stations within a particular region. We demonstrate the efficacy of our methodology using seismic data from the 2016-2017 Central Apennines, Italy earthquake sequence. Results demonstrate that earthquake depths can be estimated from single stations with uncertainties of hundreds of meters. These uncertainties are further reduced by averaging results from multiple stations. Our method shows strong potential for earthquake depth determination, particularly for events recorded by single or sparsely distributed stations, such as historically instrumented earthquakes.</description>

      <title>LOGLO-FNO: Efficient Learning of Local and Global Features in Fourier Neural Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04260v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modeling high-frequency information is a critical challenge in scientific machine learning. For instance, fully turbulent flow simulations of the Navier-Stokes equations at Reynolds numbers 3500 and above can generate high-frequency signals due to swirling fluid motions caused by eddies and vortices. Faithfully modeling such signals using neural nets depends on the accurate reconstruction of moderate to high frequencies. However, it has been well known that neural nets exhibit spectral or frequency bias towards learning low-frequency components. Meanwhile, Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) have emerged as a popular class of data-driven models for surrogate modeling and solving PDEs. Although impressive results were achieved on several PDE benchmark problems, FNOs perform poorly in learning non-dominant frequencies characterized by local features. This limitation stems from spectral bias inherent in neural nets and the explicit exclusion of high-frequency modes in FNOs and their variants. Therefore, to mitigate these issues and improve FNO's spectral learning capabilities to represent a broad range of frequency components, we propose two key architectural enhancements: (i) a parallel branch performing local spectral convolution (ii) a high-frequency propagation module. Moreover, we propose a novel frequency-sensitive loss based on radially binned spectral errors. This introduction of a parallel branch for local convolution reduces the trainable parameters by up to 50% while achieving the accuracy of FNO that relies solely on global convolution. Moreover, our findings demonstrate that the proposed model improves stability over longer rollouts. Experiments on six challenging PDEs in fluid mechanics, wave propagation, and biological pattern formation, and the qualitative and spectral analysis of predictions, show the effectiveness of our method over SOTA neural operator families of baselines.</description>

      <title>Similarities in the Initiation of Upward Positive and Downward Negative Lightning Flashes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09440v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study examines the relationship between upward negative stepped leader pulses in upward positive lightning and preliminary breakdown pulses (PBPs) in downward negative lightning discharges. Through analysis of simultaneous channel-base current and electric field data from the S\"{a}ntis tower in Switzerland, we found notable similarities between the "Category A" and "B" pulses associated with the initial continuous current of upward negative leaders, and the "Classical" and "Narrow" PBPs observed in downward negative flashes. Statistical comparisons reveal correlations between electric field and current parameters for Category A pulses, supporting the field-current relationship for preliminary breakdown proposed in previous studies. These results suggest that similar physical processes may be involved in the early stages of negative leader development in both upward and downward lightning, providing valuable insights into lightning initiation that could not be obtained from conventional field measurements alone. Furthermore, high-speed camera footage revealed that Category B pulses can be produced by a downward-propagating recoil leader. As a whole, these findings demonstrate that detailed observations of upward lightning can offer valuable insight into the complex processes underlying lightning initiation and propagation.</description>
