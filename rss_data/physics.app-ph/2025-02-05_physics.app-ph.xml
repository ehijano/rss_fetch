      <title>Analysis of random telegraph noise in resistive memories: The case of unstable filaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Through Random Telegraph Noise (RTN) analysis, valuable information can be provided about the role of defect traps in fine tuning and reading of the state of a nanoelectronic device. However, time domain analysis techniques exhibit their limitations in case where unstable RTN signals occur. These instabilities are a common issue in Multi-Level Cells (MLC) of resistive memories (ReRAM), when the tunning protocol fails to find a perfectly stable resistance state, which in turn brings fluctuations to the RTN signal especially in long time measurements and cause severe errors in the estimation of the distribution of time constants of the observed telegraphic events, i.e., capture/emission of carriers from traps. In this work, we analyze the case of the unstable filaments in silicon nitride-based ReRAM devices and propose an adaptive filter implementing a moving-average detrending method in order to flatten unstable RTN signals and increase sufficiently the accuracy of the conducted measurements. The te and tc emission/capture time constants of the traps, respectively, are then calculated and a cross-validation through frequency domain analysis (Lorentzian fitting) was performed proving that the proposed method is accurate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several resistive memory technologies (RRAMs) are prominent, but few are fulfilling the requirements for CMOS integration and meet the commercialization standards. In this work, the fabrication and electrical characterization of a fully compatible CMOS process on SOI substrate of 1R silicon SiN-based resistance switching (RS) MIS devices is presented. The RS characteristics are compared with the same devices previously fabricated on bulk silicon.</description>

      <title>Flexible radio-frequency transistors exceeding 100 GHz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of 6G communication demands seamlessly integrated terminals operating above 100 GHz with low power consumption for human-centric applications. In this work, we report high-performance, flexible radio-frequency (RF) transistors based on aligned carbon nanotube (CNT) arrays, achieving, for the first time, as-measured current gain cutoff frequency ($f_{\mathrm{T}}$) and power gain cutoff frequency ($f_{\mathrm{max}}$) both exceeding 100 GHz. Electro-thermal co-design improves both heat dissipation and RF performance, despite the low thermal conductivity of the flexible substrate. The transistors deliver 0.947 mA/ $\mathrm{\mu}$m on-state current and 0.728 mS/ $\mathrm{\mu}$m transconductance. Peak extrinsic $f_{\mathrm{T}}$ and $f_{\mathrm{max}}$ reach 152 GHz and 102 GHz, with low power consumption of 199 mW/mm and 147 mW/mm, respectively, setting new performance records for flexible CNT-based RF transistors by nearly $100\times$, outperforming all other flexible RF devices. Additionally, flexible RF amplifiers achieve output power of 64 mW/mm and power gain of 11 dB in the K-band (18 GHz), marking a significant milestone in the development of flexible RF technologies for next-generation wireless communication systems.</description>

      <title>Temperature-dependent investigation of polarisation doping in 330 nm ultraviolet light-emitting diodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarisation doping of Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$N, through grading of $x$, has realised major improvements in $p$-type conductivity in ultraviolet (UV) light-emitting diodes (LEDs) compared to conventional impurity doping. However, the exact balance between the two doping regimes to achieve the best device performance is not clear, especially as a function of operating wavelength. In this work, 330 nm LEDs with varied $p$-doping approaches were characterised as a function of temperature: Mg doped only (reference); polarisation doped and Mg doped (co-doped); and polarisation doped only. At room temperature, the co-doped LED showed the highest electroluminescence (EL) intensity, with a similar operating voltage to the reference LED. The highest hole concentration, confirmed by Hall effect measurements, as well as improved injection efficiency revealed by simulations, are credited as the main reasons for EL improvement. A parasitic near-UV luminescence tail, analogous to the "blue luminescence" in $p$-GaN, was observed in both the reference and co-doped LEDs, but was absent in the polarisation doped LED. The reference LED demonstrated the highest increase in operating voltage with decreasing temperature, while the LED with only polarisation doping showed a temperature-independent behaviour, demonstrating the benefits of a polarisation field-induced carrier concentration. Further optimisation of the compositional grading with concurrent Mg doping can potentially produce higher performance LEDs with cleaner spectra.</description>

      <title>Thermal investigation of bistability in high index doped silica integrated ring resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The utilization and engineering of thermo-optic effects have found broad applications in integrated photonic devices, facilitating efficient light manipulation to achieve various functionalities. Here, we perform both an experimental characterization and theoretical analysis of these effects in integrated micro-ring resonators in high index doped silica (HIDS), which has had many applications in integrated photonics and nonlinear optics. By fitting the experimental results with theory, we obtain fundamental parameters that characterize their thermo-optic performance, including the thermo-optic coefficient, the efficiency for the optically induced thermo-optic process, and the thermal conductivity. The characteristics of these parameters are compared to those of other materials commonly used for integrated photonic platforms, such as silicon, silicon nitride, and silica. These results offer a comprehensive insight into the thermo-optic properties of HIDS based devices. Understanding these properties is essential for efficiently controlling and engineering them in many practical applications.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Non-Ohmic Drain Resistance of 2DFETs at Cryogenic Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The contact issue for two-dimensional (2D) materials-based field-effect transistors (FETs) has drawn enormous attention in recent years. Although ohmic behavior is achieved at room temperature, the drain current of 2DFETs shifts from ohmic to non-ohmic behavior at cryogenic temperatures. In this work, we demonstrate that the shift is attributed to the asymmetric current reduction at the metal-semiconductor contact at low temperature. Under low drain bias, carriers tunnel from the source to the channel but diffuse to the drain side due to the channel-to-drain barrier, resulting in the current suppression. By studying the property of ohmic metal-semiconductor contact at different temperatures, we analyzed the mechanisms behind this phenomenon and the dependence on metal-to-semiconductor barrier height. The work opens the semiconductor physics of 2D material contact at cryogenic temperature and the importance of contact metal selection in the development of 2DFET at cryogenic temperature.</description>

      <title>Development and validation of a high-fidelity full-spectrum Monte Carlo model for the Swiss airborne gamma-ray spectrometry system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Airborne Gamma-Ray Spectrometry (AGRS) is a critical tool for radiological emergency response, enabling the rapid identification and quantification of hazardous terrestrial radionuclides over large areas. However, existing calibration methods are inherently limited to only a few gamma-ray sources, excluding most gamma-ray emitting radionuclides released in severe nuclear accidents and nuclear weapon detonations, which in turn compromise effective response and accurate risk assessments in such incidents. Here, we present a high-fidelity Monte Carlo model that overcomes these limitations, offering full-spectrum calibration of any gamma-ray source. Unlike previous approaches, our model integrates a detailed mass model of the entire aircraft and a calibrated non-proportional scintillation model, enabling accurate event-by-event prediction of the spectrometer's scintillation response to arbitrarily complex gamma-ray fields. Through a series of validation measurements in near-, mid-, and far-field scenarios, we show that the developed model not only effectively addresses the large deficiencies of previous approaches, but also achieves the accuracy and precision required to supersede traditional empirical calibration methods. These results mark a major advancement in AGRS. The developed methodology not only allows for the quantification of any gamma-ray source, but also reduces calibration time and costs, minimizes reliance on high-intensity calibration sources, and eliminates the generation of related radioactive waste. In addition, these advancements offer promising new capabilities for AGRS applications beyond emergency response, including the quantification of the cosmic-ray induced gamma-ray flux in the atmosphere and probing trace-level airborne radionuclides.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stoichiometric SiNx layers (x = [N]/[Si] = 1.33) are doped with Si atoms by ultra-low energy ion implantation (ULE-II) and subsequently annealed at different temperatures in inert ambient conditions. Detailed material and memory cells characterization is performed to investigate the effect of Si dopants on the switching properties and performance of the fabricated resistive memory cells. In this context extensive dc current-voltage and impedance spectroscopy measurements are carried out systematically and the role of doping in dielectric properties of the nitride films is enlightened. The dc and ac conduction mechanisms are investigated in a comprehensive way. Room temperature retention characteristics of resistive states are also presented.</description>

      <title>Computational insights into Cobalt-based novel half-Heusler alloy for sustainable energy applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quest for efficient and sustainable green energy solutions has led to a growing interest in half Heusler alloys, particularly for thermoelectric and spintronic applications. This study investigates the multifaceted nature of cobalt based half Heusler alloy, CoVAs, employing DFT with advanced computational techniques, such as the FLAPW method. The elastic, electronic, magnetic, thermodynamic, and optical properties of CoVAs are meticulously analyzed. Structural and mechanical evaluations reveal mechanical stability and brittleness under varying pressures. Electronic and magnetic properties are examined through band structure and DOS analysis, revealing a half metallic nature with a minority spin band gap. The total magnetic moment aligns with the Slater Pauling rule, further confirming ferromagnetism and half metallicity. Thermodynamic investigations, based on the quasi-harmonic Debye approximation, provide insights into temperature- and pressure dependent behavior, including thermal expansion, heat capacity, and Debye temperature, establishing CoVAs as a viable candidate for high temperature applications. Additionally, the optical properties underestimate its potential in optoelectronic applications due to high absorption in the UV region, showing a distinct absorption edge corresponding to the electronic band gap. Phonon dispersion relations reflect the stability of the alloy, and the figure of merit confirms the alloy's suitability for thermodynamics applications. The findings highlight the potential of CoVAs as a promising candidate for spintronic photovoltaic and optoelectronic applications, providing insights into its fundamental properties that could facilitate experimental synthesis and industrial implementation for green energy and advanced technological applications.</description>

      <title>Frequency auto-homogenization using group-velocity-matched downconversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the stability of integrated photonics at network nodes and the advantages of photons as flying qubits, photonic quantum information processing (PQIP) makes quantum networks increasingly scalable. However, scaling up PQIP requires the preparation of many identical single photons which is limited by the spectral distinguishability of integrated single-photon sources due to variations in fabrication or local environment. To address this, we introduce frequency auto-homogenization via group-velocity-matched downconversion to remove spectral distinguishability in varying quantum emitters. We present our theory using $\chi^{(2)}$ quantum frequency conversion and show proof-of-principle data in a free-space optical setup.</description>

      <title>Accurate Modeling of Directional Couplers with Oxide Cladding: Bridging Simulation and Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Directional couplers are a fundamental building block in integrated photonics, particularly in quantum applications and optimization-based design where precision is critical. Accurate functionality is crucial to ensure reliable operation within classical and quantum circuits. However, discrepancies between simulations and measurements are frequently observed. These inaccuracies can compromise the performance and scalability of integrated photonic systems, underscoring the critical need for advanced, precise simulation methods that bridge the gap between design and implementation. In this work, we show that this discrepancy can be mainly attributed to density changes in the oxide cladding. We conduct a systematic study involving experimental optical measurements, numerical simulations, and direct electron microscopy imaging to investigate this discrepancy in directional couplers. We find that the impact of cladding density variations on performance increases as feature gaps shrink. By incorporating these effects into our simulations using a novel and physically motivated Effective Trench Medium Model (ETMM), we achieve highly accurate reproduction of experimental measurements. We quantify the effects of cladding density variations on the SU(2) symmetry parameters that govern light propagation in directional couplers. This insight is crucial for advancing the precision of compact device fabrication, enabling reliable simulation of photonic integrated devices.</description>

      <title>Array oscillator in coupled waveguides with nonlinear gain and radiation resistances saturating at exceptional point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14978v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A periodically loaded waveguide composed of periodic discrete nonlinear gain and radiating elements supports a stable oscillation regime related to the presence of an exceptional point of degeneracy (EPD). After reaching saturation, the EPD in the system establishes the oscillation frequency. We demonstrate a synchronization regime at a stable oscillation frequency, resulting in uniform saturated gain across the array and uniform radiating power. Unlike conventional one-dimensional cavity resonances, the oscillation frequency is independent of the array length. Our investigations further show that when small-signal gain is non-uniformly distributed across the array, the saturated gain results in having a uniform distribution at a gain value that generates an EPD. Experimental validation using the measured board confirmed that the system saturates at an EPD, with a measured spectrum exhibiting very low phase noise. This low noise allows for operation at a clean oscillation frequency. Additionally, the measured uniform power across the array corresponds to the simulation results. The proposed scheme can pave the way for a new generation of high-power radiating arrays with distributed active elements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.05870v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Laser-induced alignment of particles and molecules was long envisioned to support three-dimensional structure determination using "single-molecule diffraction" with x-ray free-electron lasers [PRL 92, 198102 (2004)]. However, the alignment of isolated macromolecules has not yet been demonstrated, also because quantitative modeling is very expensive. We computationally demonstrated that the alignment of nanorods and proteins is possible with standard laser technology. We performed a comprehensive analysis on the dependence of the degree of alignment on molecular properties and experimental details, e.g., particle temperature and laser-pulse energy. Considering the polarizability anisotropy of about 150,000 proteins, our analysis revealed that most of these proteins can be aligned using realistic experimental parameters.</description>

Abstract: The thermal memory effect, TME, has been studied in Ni55Fe19Ga26 shape memory alloys, fabricated as ribbons via melt-spinning and as pellets via arc-melting, to evaluate its dependence on the martensitic structure and the macrostructure of the samples. When the reverse martensitic transformation is interrupted, a kinetic delay in the subsequent complete transformation is only evident in the ribbon samples, where the 14M modulated structure is the dominant phase. In contrast, degradation of the modulated structure or the presence of the gamma-phase significantly reduces the observed TME. In such cases, the magnitude of the TME approaches the detection limits of commercial calorimeters, and only high-resolution calorimeter at very low heating rate (40 mK h-1) can show the effect. Following the kinetic arrest and subsequent cooling, the reverse martensitic transformation was completed at several heating rates to confirm the athermal nature of the phenomenon.</description>
