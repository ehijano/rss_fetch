      <title>On the (Mis)Use of Machine Learning with Panel Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) is increasingly employed to inform and support policymaking interventions. This methodological article cautions practitioners about common but often overlooked pitfalls associated with the uncritical application of supervised ML algorithms to panel data. Ignoring the cross-sectional and longitudinal structure of this data can lead to hard-to-detect data leakage, inflated out-of-sample performance, and an inadvertent overestimation of the real-world usefulness and applicability of ML models. After clarifying these issues, we provide practical guidelines and best practices for applied researchers to ensure the correct implementation of supervised ML in panel data environments, emphasizing the need to define ex ante the primary goal of the analysis and align the ML pipeline accordingly. An empirical application based on over 3,000 US counties from 2000 to 2019 illustrates the practical relevance of these points across nearly 500 models for both classification and regression tasks.</description>

      <title>Difference-in-Differences with Sample Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Endogenous treatment and sample selection are two concomitant sources of endogeneity that challenge the validity of causal inference. In this paper, we focus on the partial identification of treatment effects within a standard two-period difference-in-differences framework when the outcome is observed for an endogenously selected subpopulation. The identification strategy embeds Lee's (2009) bounding approach based on principal stratification, which divides the population into latent subgroups based on selection behaviour in counterfactual treatment states in both periods. We establish identification results for four latent types and illustrate the proposed approach by applying it to estimate 1) the effect of a job training program on earnings and 2) the effect of a working-from-home policy on employee performance.</description>

      <title>Sparse Interval-valued Time Series Modeling with Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By treating intervals as inseparable sets, this paper proposes sparse machine learning regressions for high-dimensional interval-valued time series. With LASSO or adaptive LASSO techniques, we develop a penalized minimum distance estimation, which covers point-based estimators are special cases. We establish the consistency and oracle properties of the proposed penalized estimator, regardless of whether the number of predictors is diverging with the sample size. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate the favorable finite sample properties of the proposed estimation. Empirical applications to interval-valued crude oil price forecasting and sparse index-tracking portfolio construction illustrate the robustness and effectiveness of our method against competing approaches, including random forest and multilayer perceptron for interval-valued data. Our findings highlight the potential of machine learning techniques in interval-valued time series analysis, offering new insights for financial forecasting and portfolio management.</description>

      <title>On Asymptotic Optimality of Least Squares Model Averaging When True Model Is Included</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Asymptotic optimality is a key theoretical property in model averaging. Due to technical difficulties, existing studies rely on restricted weight sets or the assumption that there is no true model with fixed dimensions in the candidate set. The focus of this paper is to overcome these difficulties. Surprisingly, we discover that when the penalty factor in the weight selection criterion diverges with a certain order and the true model dimension is fixed, asymptotic loss optimality does not hold, but asymptotic risk optimality does. This result differs from the corresponding result of Fang et al. (2023, Econometric Theory 39, 412-441) and reveals that using the discrete weight set of Hansen (2007, Econometrica 75, 1175-1189) can yield opposite asymptotic properties compared to using the usual weight set. Simulation studies illustrate the theoretical findings in a variety of settings.</description>

      <title>The inclusive Synthetic Control Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17624v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the inclusive synthetic control method (iSCM), a modification of synthetic control methods that includes units in the donor pool potentially affected, directly or indirectly, by an intervention. This method is ideal for situations where including treated units in the donor pool is essential or where donor units may experience spillover effects. The iSCM is straightforward to implement with most synthetic control estimators. As an empirical illustration, we re-estimate the causal effect of German reunification on GDP per capita, accounting for spillover effects from West Germany to Austria.</description>

      <title>Spatial Competition on Psychological Pricing Strategies: Preliminary Evidence from an Online Marketplace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07808v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: According zu Kadir et al. (2023) online marketplaces are used to buy and sell products and services, as well as to exchange money and data between users or the platform. Due to the large product selection, low costs and the ease of shopping without physical restrictions as well as the technical possibilities, online marketplaces have grown rapidly Kadir et al. (2023). Online marketplaces are also used in the consumer-to-consumer (C2C) sector and thus offer a broad user group a marketplace, for example for used products. This article focuses on Willhaben.at (2024), a leading C2C marketplace in Austria, as stated by Obersteiner, Schmied, and Pamperl (2023). The empirical analysis in this course essay centers around the offer ads of Woom Bikes, a standardised product which is sold on Willhaben. Through web scraping, a dataset of approximately 826 observations was created, focusing on mid-to-high price segment bicycles, which are characterized by price stability and uniformity as we claim. This analysis aims to create analyse ad listing prices through predictive models using willhaben product listing attributes and using the spatial distribution of one of the product attributes.</description>

      <title>Comment on 'Sparse Bayesian Factor Analysis when the Number of Factors is Unknown' by S. Fr\"uhwirth-Schnatter, D. Hosszejni, and H. Freitas Lopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02531v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The techniques suggested in Fr\"uhwirth-Schnatter et al. (2024) concern sparsity and factor selection and have enormous potential beyond standard factor analysis applications. We show how these techniques can be applied to Latent Space (LS) models for network data. These models suffer from well-known identification issues of the latent factors due to likelihood invariance to factor translation, reflection, and rotation (see Hoff et al., 2002). A set of observables can be instrumental in identifying the latent factors via auxiliary equations (see Liu et al., 2021). These, in turn, share many analogies with the equations used in factor modeling, and we argue that the factor loading restrictions may be beneficial for achieving identification.</description>
