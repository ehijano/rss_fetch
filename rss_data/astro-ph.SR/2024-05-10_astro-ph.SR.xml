      <title>Magnetic fields beneath active region coronal loops</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the hypothesis that multipolar magnetic fields advected by photospheric granules can contribute heating to the active chromosphere and corona. On 28 September 2020 the GRIS and HiFI+ instruments at the GREGOR telescope obtained data of NOAA 12773. We analyze Stokes profiles of spectral lines of Si I and He I, to study magnetic fields from photosphere to the upper chromosphere. Magnetogram and EUV data from the HMI and AIA instruments on the SDO spacecraft are co-aligned and studied in relation to the GRIS data. At coronal loop footpoints, minor polarity fields comprise just 0.2% and 0.02% of the flux measured over the 40" x 60" area observed in the photosphere and upper chromosphere, centered 320" from disk center. Significantly, the minority fields are situated &gt;~ 12" from bright footpoints. We use physical arguments to show that any unresolved minority flux cannot reach coronal footpoints adjacent to the upper chromosphere. Even if it did, the most optimistic estimate of the energy released through chromospheric reconnection is barely sufficient to account for the coronal energy losses. Further, dynamical changes accompanying reconnection between uni- and multi- polar fields are seen neither in the He I data nor in narrow-band movies of the H alpha line core. We conclude that the hypothesis must be rejected. Bright chromospheric, transition region and coronal loop plasmas must be heated by mechanisms involving unipolar fields.</description>

      <title>The corona of a fully convective star with a near-polar flare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2020, the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) observed a rapidly rotating M7 dwarf, TIC 277539431, produce a flare at 81{\deg} latitude, the highest latitude flare located to date. This is in stark contrast to solar flares that occur much closer to the equator, typically below 30{\deg}. The mechanisms that allow flares at high latitudes to occur are poorly understood. We studied five Sectors of TESS monitoring, and obtained 36 ks of XMM-Newton observations to investigate the coronal and flaring activity of TIC 277539431. From the observations, we infer the optical flare frequency distribution, flare loop sizes and magnetic field strengths, the soft X-ray flux, luminosity and coronal temperatures, as well as the energy, loop size and field strength of a large flare in the XMM-Newton observations. We find that TIC 277539431's corona does not differ significantly from other low mass stars on the canonical saturated activity branch with respect to coronal temperatures and flaring activity, but shows lower luminosity in soft X-ray emission by about an order of magnitude, consistent with other late M dwarfs. The lack of X-ray flux, the high latitude flare, the star's viewing geometry, and the otherwise typical stellar corona taken together can be explained by the migration of flux emergence to the poles in rapid rotators like TIC 277539431 that drain the star's equatorial regions of magnetic flux, but preserve its ability to produce powerful flares.</description>

      <title>Massive interacting binaries as an enrichment source for multiple populations in star clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a suite of binary evolution models with massive primaries (10 $\leq$ M$_1$ $\leq$ 40 M$_\odot$) and periods and mass ratios chosen such that the systems undergo non-conservative mass transfer while the primaries have helium cores. We track the total mass and chemical composition of the ejecta from these systems. This material shows the abundance signatures of hot hydrogen burning which are needed to explain the abundance patterns seen in multiple populations in massive star clusters. We then calculate the total yield of a population of binary stars with masses, mass ratios, and periods consistent with their distribution in a field population. We show that the overall abundance of this material is enriched in helium, nitrogen, sodium, and aluminum, and depleted in carbon, oxygen, and magnesium, by amounts that are consistent with observations. We also show that such a population of binaries will return approximately 25% of its mass in this ejecta (compared to 4% if all the stars were single), over a characteristic timescale of about 12 Myr. We argue that massive binaries must be seriously considered as a contributor to the source of enriched material needed to explain the multiple populations in massive clusters, since essentially all massive stars are formed in binaries or higher order multiples, massive binaries are primarily formed in clusters, and massive binaries naturally produce material of the right composition.</description>

      <title>MCMC inversions of the internal rotation of Kepler subgiants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The measurement of the internal rotation of post-main sequence stars using data from space-based photometry missions has demonstrated the need for an efficient angular momentum transport in stellar interiors. So far, no clear solution has emerged and explaining the observed trends remain a challenge for stellar modellers. We aim at constraining both the shape of the internal rotation profile of six Kepler subgiants studied in details in 2014 and the properties of the missing angular momentum transport process acting in stellar interiors from MCMC inversions of the internal rotation. We apply a new MCMC inversion technique to existing Kepler subgiant targets and test various shapes of the internal rotation profile of all six original subgiants observed in 2014. We also constrain the limitations on the number of free parameters that can be used in the MCMC inversion, showing the limitations in the amount of information in the seismic data. First, we show that large-scale fossil magnetic fields are not able to explain the internal rotation of subgiants, similarly to what was determined from detailed studies of Kepler red giants. We are also able to constrain the location of the transition in the internal rotation profile for the most evolved stars in the available set of subgiants. We find that some of them exhibit a transition located close to the border of the helium core while one clearly does not. We conclude that it might be possible that various processes might be at play to explain our observations, but that revealing the physical nature of the angular momentum process will require a consistent detailed modelling of all subgiants available, particularly the least evolved. In addition, increasing the number of stars for which such inferences are possible (e.g. with the future PLATO mission) is paramount given the key role they play in validating transport process candidates.</description>

      <title>Introducing two improved methods for approximating radiative cooling in hydrodynamical simulations of accretion discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of many astrophysical systems depends strongly on the balance between heating and cooling, in particular star formation in giant molecular clouds and the evolution of young protostellar systems. Protostellar discs are susceptible to the gravitational instability, which can play a key role in their evolution and in planet formation. The strength of the instability depends on the rate at which the system loses thermal energy. To study the evolution of these systems, we require radiative cooling approximations because full radiative transfer is generally too expensive to be coupled to hydrodynamical models. Here we present two new approximate methods for computing radiative cooling that make use of the polytropic cooling approximation. This approach invokes the assumption that each parcel of gas is located within a spherical pseudo-cloud which can then be used to approximate the optical depth. The first method combines the methods introduced by Stamatellos et al. and Lombardi et al. to overcome the limitations of each method at low and high optical depths respectively. The second, the "Modified Lombardi" method, is specifically tailored for self-gravitating discs. This modifies the scale height estimate from the method of Lombardi et al. using the analytical scale height for a self-gravitating disc. We show that the Modified Lombardi method provides an excellent approximation for the column density in a fragmenting disc, a regime in which the existing methods fail to recover the clumps and spiral structures. We therefore recommend this improved radiative cooling method for more realistic simulations of self-gravitating discs.</description>

      <title>The Variation of the Galaxy-Wide IMF for Low-Mass Stars: Modeling and Observational Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Stellar Initial Mass Function (IMF) characterizes the mass distribution of newly formed stars in various cosmic environments, serving as a fundamental assumption in astrophysical research. Recent findings challenge the prevalent notion of a universal and static IMF, proposing instead that the IMF's shape is contingent upon the star formation environment. In this study, we analyze the galaxy-wide variation of the IMF for low-mass stars in both dwarf and massive galaxies with diverse observational methods. Despite systematic discrepancies between different approaches, an IMF model with a metallicity-dependent slope for the low-mass stars aligns with the majority of observations, indicating a high degree of uniformity in the star formation processes across the universe. We also emphasize the need for a more comprehensive understanding of the variation of the low-mass IMF, considering measurement biases and factors beyond metallicity.</description>

Abstract: The hyperfine structure of 40 spectral lines of singly ionized thulium (Tm II) in emission spectra from a hollow cathode discharge lamp measured with a Fourier transform spectrometer in the wavelength range from 335 nm to 2345 nm has been investigated. As a result of the analysis, the magnetic dipole hyperfine structure constants $A$ for 27 fine structure levels of Tm II were determined for the first time. In addition, the values of two magnetic dipole hyperfine structure constants $A$ from the literature were declared incorrect and the corrected values were given.</description>

      <title>The effect of the environment-dependent stellar initial mass function on the photometric properties of star-forming galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: (Abridged) Observational estimates of galaxy properties rely on the inherent galaxy-wide initial mass function (gwIMF), which systematically varies with the global SFR and metallicity, as proposed by the integrated-galactic IMF (IGIMF) theory and supported by empirical evidence. We incorporate PARSEC and COLIBRI stellar isochrones into the GalIMF code, a galaxy chemical evolution (GCE) model featuring real-time updates of environment-dependent gwIMFs. This newly developed photometric GalIMF (photGalIMF) code allows the calculation of photometric properties for galaxies with diverse stellar populations. Subsequently, we analyze observed luminosities and metallicities of local star-forming galaxies to deduce their stellar masses assuming that they have constant SFRs over 13.6 Gyr. We also compute SFR$-$H$\alpha$ luminosity relations for varying stellar metallicities using a separate stellar population synthesis code based on PEGASE. Comparing the IGIMF theory to the canonical universal IMF, our analysis reveals that estimates of the stellar masses and SFRs for local star-forming galaxies differ by factors of $\approx 2$ and 10, respectively. The computed gas-depletion timescale increases with gas mass, implying lower star formation efficiencies in more massive galaxies, possibly due to stronger feedback regulation, aligning with theoretical expectations. Additionally, the characteristic stellar mass buildup timescale increases with stellar mass, indicating that massive disk galaxies initiate star formation earlier than their low-mass counterparts. The photGalIMF code enables self-consistent computations of galactic photometry, self-consistently with GCE modelling within the context of an environment-dependent gwIMF. Utilizing Ks-band and H$\alpha$ luminosities of galaxies, the outcomes include galaxy mass, SFR, and fitting functions for the SFR correction factor.</description>

      <title>Kinematic substructure in star clusters constrains star cluster formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spatial-kinematic structure of 48 young star clusters and associations is investigated. Moran's $I$ statistic is used to quantify the degree of kinematic substructure in each region, and the results are compared to those expected assuming the hierarchical or monolithic models of star cluster formation. Of the observed regions, 39 are found to have significant kinematic substructure, such that they are compatible with the hierarchical model and incompatible with the monolithic model. This includes multiple regions whose $Q$ parameter shows the region to be centrally concentrated and clustered. The remaining nine are compatible with both models. From this it is concluded that the kinematic substructure of the observed star clusters represents strong evidence in favour the hierarchical model of star cluster formation over the monolithic model.</description>

      <title>Gauge invariant perturbations of static spatially compact LRS II spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a framework to describe completely general first-order perturbations of static, spatially compact, and locally rotationally symmetric class II spacetimes within the theory of general relativity. The perturbation variables are by construction covariant and identification gauge invariant and encompass the geometry and the thermodynamics of the fluid sources. The new equations are then applied to the study of isotropic, adiabatic perturbations. We discuss how the choice of frame in which perturbations are described can significantly simplify the mathematical analysis of the problem and show that it is possible to change frames directly from the linear level equations. We find explicitly that the case of isotropic, adiabatic perturbations can be reduced to a singular Sturm-Liouville eigenvalue problem, and lower bounds for the values of the eigenfrequencies can be derived. These results lay the theoretical groundwork to analytically describe linear, isotropic, and adiabatic perturbations of static, spherically symmetric spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Abundances of Elements in Solar Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The relationship between stars and planets provides important information for understanding the interior composition, mineralogy, and overall classification of small planets (R $\lesssim$ 3.5R$_{\oplus}$). Since stars and planets are formed at the same time and from the same material, their compositions are inextricably linked to one another, especially with respect refractory elements like Mg, Si, and Fe. As a result, stellar elemental abundances can help break the degeneracy inherent to planetary mass-radius models and determine whether planets may be similar to the Earth in composition or if additional factors, such as formation near the host star or a giant impact, may have influenced the planet's make-up. To this end, we now have observations of the abundances of extrasolar rocks that were pulled onto the surfaces of a white dwarfs, whose compositions act as a direct insight into the interiors of small exoplanets. From measurements of $\sim$30 of these "polluted" white dwarfs, we have found that composition of the extrasolar rocks are similar to Solar System chondritic meteorites.</description>

      <title>Chemo-dynamical Evolution of Simulated Satellites for a Milky Way-like Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The chemical abundances of Milky Way's satellites reflect their star formation histories (SFHs), yet, due to the difficulty of determining the ages of old stars, the SFHs of most satellites are poorly measured. Ongoing and upcoming surveys will obtain around ten times more medium-resolution spectra for stars in satellites than are currently available. To correctly extract SFHs from large samples of chemical abundances, the relationship between chemical abundances and SFHs needs to be clarified. Here, we perform a high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulation of a Milky Way-like galaxy with detailed models of star formation, supernova feedback, and metal diffusion. We quantify SFHs, metallicity distribution functions, and the $\alpha$-element (Mg, Ca, and Si) abundances in satellites of the host galaxy. We find that star formation in most simulated satellites is quenched before infalling to their host. Star formation episodes in simulated satellites are separated by a few hundred Myr owing to supernova feedback; each star formation event produces groups of stars with similar [$\alpha$/Fe] and [Fe/H]. We then perform a mock observation of the upcoming Subaru Prime Focus Spectrograph (PFS) observations. We find that Subaru PFS will be able to detect distinct groups of stars in [$\alpha$/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] space, produced by episodic star formation. This result means that episodic SFHs can be estimated from the chemical abundances of $\gtrsim$ 1,000 stars determined with medium-resolution spectroscopy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We quantify the effects on the evolution of solar neutrinos of light spin-zero particles with pseudoscalar couplings to leptons and scalar couplings to nucleons. In this scenario the matter potential sourced by the nucleons in the Sun's matter gives rise to spin precession of the relativistic neutrino ensemble. As such the effects in the solar observables are different if neutrinos are Dirac or Majorana particles. For Dirac neutrinos the spin-flavour precession results into left-handed neutrino to right-handed neutrino (i.e., active--sterile) oscillations, while for Majorana neutrinos it results into left-handed neutrino to right-handed antineutrino (i.e., active-active) oscillations. In both cases this leads to distortions in the solar neutrino spectrum which we use to derive constraints on the allowed values of the mediator mass and couplings via a global analysis of the solar neutrino data. In addition for Majorana neutrinos spin-flavour precession results into a potentially observable flux of solar electron antineutrinos at the Earth which we quantify and constrain with the existing bounds from Borexino and KamLAND.</description>

Here, I show that the Brownian motion of the Sun as a result of its random gravitational interactions with the cluster of thousands of unmodeled Main-belt asteroids of radii &lt;20km, not included in the Solar system ephemeris, introduces correlated timing noise for pulsars with the magnitude and frequencies of the reported signal.</description>

      <title>Spelunker: A quick-look Python pipeline for JWST NIRISS FGS Guide Star Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope produces some of the highest sensitivity imaging of the cosmos across all instruments. One of them, the NIRISS Fine Guidance Sensor, provides guide star imaging with a passband of 0.6 to 5 microns through two separate channels, each with a 2.3' x 2.3' field of view (FOV) and a sampling rate of 64 ms$-$data that is taken in parallel and is thus available for every JWST observing program. While the onboard system uses guide stars to provide information to the attitude control system (ACS), which stabilizes the observatory, the astronomical community can also use the data products associated with these 64 ms cadence images as science products. Usages range from studying guide star photometry in search of transient phenomena to using these data to identify and investigate technical anomalies that might occur during scientific observations with the rest of the JWST instruments. Despite this wide range of possible usages, these data products are not straightforward to manipulate and analyze, and there is no publicly available package to download, investigate, and research guide star data. Spelunker is a Python library that was developed to enable access to these guide star data products and their analysis.</description>

      <title>Theoretical investigation of energy levels and transitions for Ce III with applications to kilonova spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Doubly ionized cerium (Ce$^{2+}$) is one of the most important ions to understand the kilonova spectra. In particular, near-infrared (NIR) transitions of Ce III between the ground (5p$^6$ 4f$^2$) and first excited (5p$^6$ 4f 5d) configurations are responsible for the absorption features around 14,500 A. However, there is no dedicated theoretical studies to provide accurate transition probabilities for these transitions. We present energy levels of the ground and first excited configurations and transition data between them for Ce III. Calculations are performed using the GRASP2018 package, which is based on the multiconfiguration Dirac-Hartree-Fock and relativistic configuration interaction methods. Compared with the energy levels in the NIST database, our calculations reach the accuracy with the root-mean-square (rms) of 2732 cm$^{-1}$ or 1404 cm$^{-1}$ (excluding one highest level) for ground configuration, and rms of 618 cm$^{-1}$ for the first excited configuration. We extensively study the line strengths and find that the Babushkin gauge provide the more accurate values. By using the calculated gf values, we show that the NIR spectral features of kilonova can be explained by the Ce III lines.</description>

      <title>Discovery of RR Lyrae in the Ultra-Faint Dwarf Galaxy Virgo III</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Virgo III is a newly discovered ultra-faint dwarf (UFD) candidate, and finding RR Lyrae associated with this galaxy is important to constrain its distance. In this work, we present a search of RR Lyrae in the vicinity of Virgo III based on the time-series $r$-band images taken from the Lulin One-meter Telescope (LOT). We have identified three RR Lyrae from our LOT data, including two fundamental mode (ab-type) and a first-overtone (c-type) RR Lyrae. Assuming these three RR Lyrae are members of Virgo III, we derived the distance to this UFD as $154\pm25$ kpc, fully consistent with the independent measurements given in the literature. We have also revisited the relation between absolute $V$-band magnitude ($M_V$) and the number of RR Lyrae (of all types, $N_{RRL}$) found in local galaxies, demonstrating that the $M_V$-$N_{RRL}$ relation is better described with the specific RR Lyrae frequency.</description>

      <title>Exploration of morphological coherence in open clusters with "core-shell'' structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of their morphological coherence allows for a better understanding of the morphological evolution of open clusters. We employ the ellipsoid fitting method to delineate the 3D spatial structure of the sample clusters while using the morphological dislocation (MD) defined in our previous work and the ellipticity ratio (ER) of the clusters' inner and outer structures to characterize the morphological coherence of the sample clusters. The results show an inverse correlation between the ER of the sample clusters and the number of their members, indicating that sample clusters with much more elliptical external morphology than internal shape have generally a large number of members. Meanwhile, a slight shrinking of the MD of the sample clusters with their members' number may shed light on the significant role of the gravitational binding of the sample clusters in maintaining their morphological stability. Moreover, there are no correlations between the MD and ER of the sample clusters and their age. They are also not significantly correlated with the X-axis, the Y-axis, their orbital eccentricities, and the radial and vertical forces on them. However, the ER of the sample clusters displays some fluctuations in the distributions between it and the above covariates, implying that the morphologies of the sample clusters are sensitive to the external environment if sample effects are not taken into account. Finally, the analysis of the 3D spatial shapes of sample clusters with a small ER or a large ER demonstrates that the number of members lays an important foundation for forming a dense internal system for sample clusters. At the same time, the MD of the sample clusters can serve well as an indicator of their morphological stability, which is built on a certain amount of member stars.</description>

      <title>Time-dependent long-term hydrodynamic simulations of the inner protoplanetary disk III: The influence of photoevaporation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The final stages of a protoplanetary disk are essential for our understanding of the formation and evolution of planets. Photoevaporation is an important mechanism that contributes to the dispersal of an accretion disk and has significant consequences for the disk's lifetime. However, the combined effects of photoevaporation and star-disk interaction have not been investigated in previous studies. We combined an implicit disk evolution model with a photoevaporative mass-loss profile. By including the innermost disk regions down to 0.01 AU, we could calculate the star-disk interaction, the stellar spin evolution, and the transition from an accreting disk to the propeller regime self-consistently. Starting from an early Class II star-disk system, we calculated the long-term evolution of the system until the disk becomes almost completely dissolved. Photoevaporation has a significant effect on disk structure and evolution. The radial extent of the dead zone decreases, and the number of episodic accretion events (outbursts) is reduced by high stellar X-ray luminosities. Reasonable accretion rates in combination with photoevaporative gaps are possible for a dead zone that is still massive enough to develop episodic accretion events. Furthermore, the stellar spin evolution during the Class II evolution is less affected by the star-disk interaction in the case of high X-ray luminosities. Our results suggest that the formation of planets, especially habitable planets, in the dead zone is strongly impaired in the case of strong X-ray luminosities. Additionally, the importance of the star-disk interaction during the Class II phase with respect to the stellar spin evolution is reduced.</description>

      <title>Double white dwarf binary population in MOCCA star clusters -- Comparisons with observations of close and wide binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04314v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There could be a significant population of double white dwarf binaries (DWDs) inside globular clusters (GCs), however, these are often too faint to be individually observed. We have utilized a large number GC models evolved with the Monte Carlo Cluster Simulator (MOCCA) code, to create a large statistical dataset of DWDs. These models include multiple-stellar populations, resulting in two distinct initial populations: one dense and another less dense. Due to the lower density of one population, a large number of objects escape during the early GC evolution, leading to a high mass-loss rate. In this dataset we have analysed three main groups of DWDs, namely in-cluster binaries, escaped binaries, and isolated evolution of primordial binaries. We compared the properties of these groups to observations of close and wide binaries. We find that the number of escaping DWDs is significantly larger than the number of in-cluster binaries and those that form via the isolated evolution of all promiridial binaries in our GC models. This suggests that dynamics play an important role in the formation of DWDs. For close binaries, we found a good agreement in the separations of escaped binaries and isolated binaries, but in-cluster binaries showed slight differences. We could not reproduce the observed extremely low mass WDs due to the limitations of our stellar and binary evolution prescriptions. For wide binaries, we also found a good agreement in the separations and masses, after accounting for observational selection effects. We conclude that, even though the current observational samples of DWDs are extremely biased and incomplete, our results compare reasonably well with observations.</description>

      <title>Polytropic stellar structure in 5$\mathcal{D}$ Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03026v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Polytropic stars are useful tools to learn about stellar structure without the complexity of comprehensive stellar models. These models rely on a certain power-law correlation between the star's pressure and density. This paper proposes a polytropic star model to investigate some new features in the context of $5\mathcal{D}$ Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (EGB) gravity using the Finch-Skea {\em ansatz} [{\em M. R. Finch and J. E. Skea, Classical and Quantum Gravity 6, 467 (1989)}]. Analytical results are better described by graphical representations of the physical parameters for various values of Gauss-Bonnet coupling constant $\alpha$. The solution for a specific compact object, EXO 1785 - 248, with radius $\mathfrak{R} = 8.849_{-0.04}^{+0.04}$ km and mass $\mathcal{M} = 1.3 \pm 0.02~\mathcal{M}_{\odot}$, is shown here. We analyze the essential physical attributes of the star, which reveal the influence of the coupling parameter $\alpha$ on the values of the parameters. Ultimately, we have concluded that our current model is realistic because it satisfies all the physical criteria for an acceptable model.</description>
