      <title>A Machine Learning Approach to Volumetric Computations of Solid Pulmonary Nodules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Early detection of lung cancer is crucial for effective treatment and relies on accurate volumetric assessment of pulmonary nodules in CT scans. Traditional methods, such as consolidation-to-tumor ratio (CTR) and spherical approximation, are limited by inconsistent estimates due to variability in nodule shape and density. We propose an advanced framework that combines a multi-scale 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) with subtype-specific bias correction for precise volume estimation. The model was trained and evaluated on a dataset of 364 cases from Shanghai Chest Hospital. Our approach achieved a mean absolute deviation of 8.0 percent compared to manual nonlinear regression, with inference times under 20 seconds per scan. This method outperforms existing deep learning and semi-automated pipelines, which typically have errors of 25 to 30 percent and require over 60 seconds for processing. Our results show a reduction in error by over 17 percentage points and a threefold acceleration in processing speed. These advancements offer a highly accurate, efficient, and scalable tool for clinical lung nodule screening and monitoring, with promising potential for improving early lung cancer detection.</description>

      <title>Data-Efficient Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation Pipeline for Unimproved Roads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this case study, we present a data-efficient point cloud segmentation pipeline and training framework for robust segmentation of unimproved roads and seven other classes. Our method employs a two-stage training framework: first, a projection-based convolutional neural network is pre-trained on a mixture of public urban datasets and a small, curated in-domain dataset; then, a lightweight prediction head is fine-tuned exclusively on in-domain data. Along the way, we explore the application of Point Prompt Training to batch normalization layers and the effects of Manifold Mixup as a regularizer within our pipeline. We also explore the effects of incorporating histogram-normalized ambients to further boost performance. Using only 50 labeled point clouds from our target domain, we show that our proposed training approach improves mean Intersection-over-Union from 33.5% to 51.8% and the overall accuracy from 85.5% to 90.8%, when compared to naive training on the in-domain data. Crucially, our results demonstrate that pre-training across multiple datasets is key to improving generalization and enabling robust segmentation under limited in-domain supervision. Overall, this study demonstrates a practical framework for robust 3D semantic segmentation in challenging, low-data scenarios.

      <title>Global Motion Corresponder for 3D Point-Based Scene Interpolation under Large Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing dynamic scene interpolation methods typically assume that the motion between consecutive timesteps is small enough so that displacements can be locally approximated by linear models. In practice, even slight deviations from this small-motion assumption can cause conventional techniques to fail. In this paper, we introduce Global Motion Corresponder (GMC), a novel approach that robustly handles large motion and achieves smooth transitions. GMC learns unary potential fields that predict SE(3) mappings into a shared canonical space, balancing correspondence, spatial and semantic smoothness, and local rigidity. We demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing baselines on 3D scene interpolation when the two states undergo large global motions. Furthermore, our method enables extrapolation capabilities where other baseline methods cannot.</description>

      <title>Is the medical image segmentation problem solved? A survey of current developments and future directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical image segmentation has advanced rapidly over the past two decades, largely driven by deep learning, which has enabled accurate and efficient delineation of cells, tissues, organs, and pathologies across diverse imaging modalities. This progress raises a fundamental question: to what extent have current models overcome persistent challenges, and what gaps remain? In this work, we provide an in-depth review of medical image segmentation, tracing its progress and key developments over the past decade. We examine core principles, including multiscale analysis, attention mechanisms, and the integration of prior knowledge, across the encoder, bottleneck, skip connections, and decoder components of segmentation networks. Our discussion is organized around seven key dimensions: (1) the shift from supervised to semi-/unsupervised learning, (2) the transition from organ segmentation to lesion-focused tasks, (3) advances in multi-modality integration and domain adaptation, (4) the role of foundation models and transfer learning, (5) the move from deterministic to probabilistic segmentation, (6) the progression from 2D to 3D and 4D segmentation, and (7) the trend from model invocation to segmentation agents. Together, these perspectives provide a holistic overview of the trajectory of deep learning-based medical image segmentation and aim to inspire future innovation. To support ongoing research, we maintain a continually updated repository of relevant literature and open-source resources at https://github.com/apple1986/medicalSegReview</description>

      <title>UltraEar: a multicentric, large-scale database combining ultra-high-resolution computed tomography and clinical data for ear diseases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ear diseases affect billions of people worldwide, leading to substantial health and socioeconomic burdens. Computed tomography (CT) plays a pivotal role in accurate diagnosis, treatment planning, and outcome evaluation. The objective of this study is to present the establishment and design of UltraEar Database, a large-scale, multicentric repository of isotropic 0.1 mm ultra-high-resolution CT (U-HRCT) images and associated clinical data dedicated to ear diseases. UltraEar recruits patients from 11 tertiary hospitals between October 2020 and October 2035, integrating U-HRCT images, structured CT reports, and comprehensive clinical information, including demographics, audiometric profiles, surgical records, and pathological findings. A broad spectrum of otologic disorders is covered, such as otitis media, cholesteatoma, ossicular chain malformation, temporal bone fracture, inner ear malformation, cochlear aperture stenosis, enlarged vestibular aqueduct, and sigmoid sinus bony deficiency. Standardized preprocessing pipelines have been developed for geometric calibration, image annotation, and multi-structure segmentation. All personal identifiers in DICOM headers and metadata are removed or anonymized to ensure compliance with data privacy regulation. Data collection and curation are coordinated through monthly expert panel meetings, with secure storage on an offline cloud system. UltraEar provides an unprecedented ultra-high-resolution reference atlas with both technical fidelity and clinical relevance. This resource has significant potential to advance radiological research, enable development and validation of AI algorithms, serve as an educational tool for training in otologic imaging, and support multi-institutional collaborative studies. UltraEar will be continuously updated and expanded, ensuring long-term accessibility and usability for the global otologic research community.</description>

      <title>Efficient and Privacy-Protecting Background Removal for 2D Video Streaming using iPhone 15 Pro Max LiDAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) technology in consumer-grade mobile devices can be used as a replacement for traditional background removal and compositing techniques. Unlike approaches such as chroma keying and trained AI models, LiDAR's depth information is independent of subject lighting, and performs equally well in low-light and well-lit environments. We integrate the LiDAR and color cameras on the iPhone 15 Pro Max with GPU-based image processing. We use Apple's SwiftUI and Swift frameworks for user interface and backend development, and Metal Shader Language (MSL) for realtime image enhancement at the standard iPhone streaming frame rate of 60 frames per second. The only meaningful limitations of the technology are the streaming bandwidth of the depth data, which currently reduces the depth map resolution to 320x240, and any pre-existing limitations of the LiDAR IR laser to reflect accurate depth from some materials. If the LiDAR resolution on a mobile device like the iPhone can be improved to match the color image resolution, LiDAR could feasibly become the preeminent method of background removal for video applications and photography.</description>

      <title>GENRE-CMR: Generalizable Deep Learning for Diverse Multi-Domain Cardiac MRI Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accelerated Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance (CMR) image reconstruction remains a critical challenge due to the trade-off between scan time and image quality, particularly when generalizing across diverse acquisition settings. We propose GENRE-CMR, a generative adversarial network (GAN)-based architecture employing a residual deep unrolled reconstruction framework to enhance reconstruction fidelity and generalization. The architecture unrolls iterative optimization into a cascade of convolutional subnetworks, enriched with residual connections to enable progressive feature propagation from shallow to deeper stages. To further improve performance, we integrate two loss functions: (1) an Edge-Aware Region (EAR) loss, which guides the network to focus on structurally informative regions and helps prevent common reconstruction blurriness; and (2) a Statistical Distribution Alignment (SDA) loss, which regularizes the feature space across diverse data distributions via a symmetric KL divergence formulation. Extensive experiments confirm that GENRE-CMR surpasses state-of-the-art methods on training and unseen data, achieving 0.9552 SSIM and 38.90 dB PSNR on unseen distributions across various acceleration factors and sampling trajectories. Ablation studies confirm the contribution of each proposed component to reconstruction quality and generalization. Our framework presents a unified and robust solution for high-quality CMR reconstruction, paving the way for clinically adaptable deployment across heterogeneous acquisition protocols.</description>

      <title>Efficient Fine-Tuning of DINOv3 Pretrained on Natural Images for Atypical Mitotic Figure Classification in MIDOG 2025</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atypical mitotic figures (AMFs) are markers of abnormal cell division associated with poor prognosis, yet their detection remains difficult due to low prevalence, subtle morphology, and inter-observer variability. The MIDOG 2025 challenge introduces a benchmark for AMF classification across multiple domains. In this work, we evaluate the recently published DINOv3-H+ vision transformer, pretrained on natural images, which we fine-tuned using low-rank adaptation (LoRA, 650k trainable parameters) and extensive augmentation. Despite the domain gap, DINOv3 transfers effectively to histopathology, achieving a balanced accuracy of 0.8871 on the preliminary test set. These results highlight the robustness of DINOv3 pretraining and show that, when combined with parameter-efficient fine-tuning, it provides a strong baseline for atypical mitosis classification in MIDOG 2025.</description>

      <title>Task-Aware Tuning of Time Constants in Spiking Neural Networks for Multimodal Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are promising candidates for low-power edge computing in domains such as wearable sensing and time-series analysis. A key neuronal parameter, the leaky time constant (LTC), governs temporal integration of information in Leaky Integrateand-Fire (LIF) neurons, yet its impact on feedforward SNN performance across different data modalities remains underexplored. This study investigates the role of LTC in a temporally adaptive feedforward SNN applied to static image, dynamic image, and biosignal time-series classification. Presented experiments demonstrate that LTCs critically affect inference accuracy, synaptic weight distributions, and firing dynamics. For static and dynamic images, intermediate LTCs yield higher accuracy and compact, centered weight histograms, reflecting stable feature encoding. In time-series tasks, optimal LTCs enhance temporal feature retention and result in broader weight sparsity, allowing for tolerance of LTC variations. The provided results show that inference accuracy peaks at specific LTC ranges, with significant degradation beyond this optimal band due to over-integration or excessive forgetting. Firing rate analysis reveals a strong interplay between LTC, network depth, and energy efficiency, underscoring the importance of balanced spiking activity. These findings reveal that task-specific LTC tuning is essential for efficient spike coding and robust learning. The results provide practical guidelines for hardware-aware SNN optimization and highlight how neuronal time constants can be designed to match task dynamics. This work contributes toward scalable, ultra-lowpower SNN deployment for real-time classification tasks in neuromorphic computing.</description>

      <title>Towards Inclusive Communication: A Unified LLM-Based Framework for Sign Language, Lip Movements, and Audio Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Audio is the primary modality for human communication and has driven the success of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) technologies. However, such systems remain inherently inaccessible to individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing. Visual alternatives such as sign language and lip reading offer effective substitutes, and recent advances in Sign Language Translation (SLT) and Visual Speech Recognition (VSR) have improved audio-less communication. Yet, these modalities have largely been studied in isolation, and their integration within a unified framework remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce the first unified framework capable of handling diverse combinations of sign language, lip movements, and audio for spoken-language text generation. We focus on three main objectives: (i) designing a unified, modality-agnostic architecture capable of effectively processing heterogeneous inputs; (ii) exploring the underexamined synergy among modalities, particularly the role of lip movements as non-manual cues in sign language comprehension; and (iii) achieving performance on par with or superior to state-of-the-art models specialized for individual tasks. Building on this framework, we achieve performance on par with or better than task-specific state-of-the-art models across SLT, VSR, ASR, and AVSR. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that explicitly modeling lip movements as a separate modality significantly improves SLT performance.</description>

      <title>Dino U-Net: Exploiting High-Fidelity Dense Features from Foundation Models for Medical Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Foundation models pre-trained on large-scale natural image datasets offer a powerful paradigm for medical image segmentation. However, effectively transferring their learned representations for precise clinical applications remains a challenge. In this work, we propose Dino U-Net, a novel encoder-decoder architecture designed to exploit the high-fidelity dense features of the DINOv3 vision foundation model. Our architecture introduces an encoder built upon a frozen DINOv3 backbone, which employs a specialized adapter to fuse the model's rich semantic features with low-level spatial details. To preserve the quality of these representations during dimensionality reduction, we design a new fidelity-aware projection module (FAPM) that effectively refines and projects the features for the decoder. We conducted extensive experiments on seven diverse public medical image segmentation datasets. Our results show that Dino U-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently outperforming previous methods across various imaging modalities. Our framework proves to be highly scalable, with segmentation accuracy consistently improving as the backbone model size increases up to the 7-billion-parameter variant. The findings demonstrate that leveraging the superior, dense-pretrained features from a general-purpose foundation model provides a highly effective and parameter-efficient approach to advance the accuracy of medical image segmentation.

      <title>MTS-Net: Dual-Enhanced Positional Multi-Head Self-Attention for 3D CT Diagnosis of May-Thurner Syndrome</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04680v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: May-Thurner Syndrome (MTS) is a vascular condition that affects over 20\% of the population and significantly increases the risk of iliofemoral deep venous thrombosis. Accurate and early diagnosis of MTS using computed tomography (CT) remains a clinical challenge due to the subtle anatomical compression and variability across patients. In this paper, we propose MTS-Net, an end-to-end 3D deep learning framework designed to capture spatial-temporal patterns from CT volumes for reliable MTS diagnosis. MTS-Net builds upon 3D ResNet-18 by embedding a novel dual-enhanced positional multi-head self-attention (DEP-MHSA) module into the Transformer encoder of the network's final stages. The proposed DEP-MHSA employs multi-scale convolution and integrates positional embeddings into both attention weights and residual paths, enhancing spatial context preservation, which is crucial for identifying venous compression. To validate our approach, we curate the first publicly available dataset for MTS, MTS-CT, containing over 747 gender-balanced subjects with standard and enhanced CT scans. Experimental results demonstrate that MTS-Net achieves average 0.79 accuracy, 0.84 AUC, and 0.78 F1-score, outperforming baseline models including 3D ResNet, DenseNet-BC, and BabyNet. Our work not only introduces a new diagnostic architecture for MTS but also provides a high-quality benchmark dataset to facilitate future research in automated vascular syndrome detection. We make our code and dataset publicly available at:https://github.com/Nutingnon/MTS_dep_mhsa.</description>

      <title>Ultrasound Autofocusing: Common Midpoint Phase Error Optimization via Differentiable Beamforming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03008v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In ultrasound imaging, propagation of an acoustic wavefront through heterogeneous media causes phase aberrations that degrade the coherence of the reflected wavefront, leading to reduced image resolution and contrast. Adaptive imaging techniques attempt to correct this phase aberration and restore coherence, leading to improved focusing of the image. We propose an autofocusing paradigm for aberration correction in ultrasound imaging by fitting an acoustic velocity field to pressure measurements, via optimization of the common midpoint phase error (CMPE), using a straight-ray wave propagation model for beamforming in diffusely scattering media. We show that CMPE induced by heterogeneous acoustic velocity is a robust measure of phase aberration that can be used for acoustic autofocusing. CMPE is optimized iteratively using a differentiable beamforming approach to simultaneously improve the image focus while estimating the acoustic velocity field of the interrogated medium. The approach relies solely on wavefield measurements using a straight-ray integral solution of the two-way time-of-flight without explicit numerical time-stepping models of wave propagation. We demonstrate method performance through in silico simulations, in vitro phantom measurements, and in vivo mammalian models, showing practical applications in distributed aberration quantification, correction, and velocity estimation for medical ultrasound autofocusing.</description>

      <title>TAG-WM: Tamper-Aware Generative Image Watermarking via Diffusion Inversion Sensitivity</title>

Abstract: AI-generated content (AIGC) enables efficient visual creation but raises copyright and authenticity risks. As a common technique for integrity verification and source tracing, digital image watermarking is regarded as a potential solution to above issues. However, the widespread adoption and advancing capabilities of generative image editing tools have amplified malicious tampering risks, while simultaneously posing new challenges to passive tampering detection and watermark robustness. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a Tamper-Aware Generative image WaterMarking method named TAG-WM. The proposed method comprises four key modules: a dual-mark joint sampling (DMJS) algorithm for embedding copyright and localization watermarks into the latent space while preserving generative quality, the watermark latent reconstruction (WLR) utilizing reversed DMJS, a dense variation region detector (DVRD) leveraging diffusion inversion sensitivity to identify tampered areas via statistical deviation analysis, and the tamper-aware decoding (TAD) guided by localization results. The experimental results demonstrate that TAG-WM achieves state-of-the-art performance in both tampering robustness and localization capability even under distortion, while preserving lossless generation quality and maintaining a watermark capacity of 256 bits. The code is available at: https://github.com/Suchenl/TAG-WM.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Aware Detection of Fake Identity Documents: Methodology, Benchmark, and Improved Algorithms (FakeIDet2)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11716v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Remote user verification in Internet-based applications is becoming increasingly important nowadays. A popular scenario for it consists of submitting a picture of the user's Identity Document (ID) to a service platform, authenticating its veracity, and then granting access to the requested digital service. An ID is well-suited to verify the identity of an individual, since it is government issued, unique, and nontransferable. However, with recent advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI), attackers can surpass security measures in IDs and create very realistic physical and synthetic fake IDs. Researchers are now trying to develop methods to detect an ever-growing number of these AI-based fakes that are almost indistinguishable from authentic (bona fide) IDs. In this counterattack effort, researchers are faced with an important challenge: the difficulty in using real data to train fake ID detectors. This real data scarcity for research and development is originated by the sensitive nature of these documents, which are usually kept private by the ID owners (the users) and the ID Holders (e.g., government, police, bank, etc.). The main contributions of our study are: 1) We propose and discuss a patch-based methodology to preserve privacy in fake ID detection research. 2) We provide a new public database, FakeIDet2-db, comprising over 900K real/fake ID patches extracted from 2,000 ID images, acquired using different smartphone sensors, illumination and height conditions, etc. In addition, three physical attacks are considered: print, screen, and composite. 3) We present a new privacy-aware fake ID detection method, FakeIDet2. 4) We release a standard reproducible benchmark that considers physical and synthetic attacks from popular databases in the literature.</description>
