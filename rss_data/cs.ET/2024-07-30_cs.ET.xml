      <title>Rouser: Robust SNN training using adaptive threshold learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), learning rules are based on neuron spiking behavior, that is, if and when spikes are generated due to a neuron's membrane potential exceeding that neuron's firing threshold, and this spike timing encodes vital information. However, the threshold is generally treated as a hyperparameter, and incorrect selection can lead to neurons that do not spike for large portions of the training process, hindering the effective rate of learning. Inspired by homeostatic mechanisms in biological neurons, this work (Rouser) presents a study to rouse training-inactive neurons and improve the SNN training by using an in-loop adaptive threshold learning mechanism. Rouser's adaptive threshold allows for dynamic adjustments based on input data and network hyperparameters, influencing spike timing and improving training. This study focuses primarily on investigating the significance of learning neuron thresholds alongside weights in SNNs. We evaluate the performance of Rouser on the spatiotemporal datasets NMNIST, DVS128 and Spiking Heidelberg Digits (SHD), compare our results with state-of-the-art SNN training techniques, and discuss the strengths and limitations of our approach. Our results suggest that promoting threshold from a hyperparameter to a parameter can effectively address the issue of dead neurons during training, resulting in a more robust training algorithm that leads to improved training convergence, increased test accuracy, and substantial reductions in the number of training epochs needed to achieve viable accuracy. Rouser achieves up to 70% lower training latency while providing up to 2% higher accuracy over state-of-the-art SNNs with similar network architecture on the neuromorphic datasets NMNIST, DVS128 and SHD.</description>

      <title>Brain-inspired polymer dendrite networks for morphology-dependent computing hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variability has always been a challenge to mitigate in electronics. This especially holds true for organic semiconductors, where reproducibility and long-term stability concerns hinder industrialization. By relying on a bio-inspired computing paradigm, we show that AC-electropolymerization is a powerful platform for the development of morphology-dependent computing hardware. Our findings reveal that electropolymerized polymer dendrite networks exhibit a complex relationship between structure and operation that allows them to implement nearly linear to nonlinear functions depending on the complexity of their structure. Moreover, dendritic networks can integrate a limitless number of inputs from their environment, for which their unique morphologies induce specific patterns in the dynamic encoding of the network's output. We demonstrate that this property can be used to our advantage in the context of in materio computing to discriminate between different spatiotemporal inputs. These results show how, due to its inherent stochasticity, electropolymerization is a pivotal technique for the bottom-up implementation of computationally powerful objects. We anticipate this study will help shifting the negative perception of variability in the material science community and promote the electropolymerization framework as a foundation for the development of a new generation of hardware defined by its topological richness.</description>

      <title>THEA-Code: an Autoencoder-Based IDS-correcting Code for DNA Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The insertion, deletion, substitution (IDS) correcting code has garnered increased attention due to significant advancements in DNA storage that emerged recently. Despite this, the pursuit of optimal solutions in IDS-correcting codes remains an open challenge, drawing interest from both theoretical and engineering perspectives. This work introduces a pioneering approach named THEA-code. The proposed method follows a heuristic idea of employing an end-to-end autoencoder for the integrated encoding and decoding processes. To address the challenges associated with deploying an autoencoder as an IDS-correcting code, we propose innovative techniques, including the differentiable IDS channel, the entropy constraint on the codeword, and the auxiliary reconstruction of the source sequence. These strategies contribute to the successful convergence of the autoencoder, resulting in a deep learning-based IDS-correcting code with commendable performance. Notably, THEA-Code represents the first instance of a deep learning-based code that is independent of conventional coding frameworks in the IDS-correcting domain. Comprehensive experiments, including an ablation study, provide a detailed analysis and affirm the effectiveness of THEA-Code.</description>

      <title>Interactive Learning in Computer Science Education Supported by a Discord Chatbot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Enhancing interaction and feedback collection in a first-semester computer science course poses a significant challenge due to students' diverse needs and engagement levels. To address this issue, we created and integrated a command-based chatbot on the course communication server on Discord. The DiscordBot enables students to provide feedback on course activities through short surveys, such as exercises, quizzes, and lectures, facilitating stress-free communication with instructors. It also supports attendance tracking and introduces lectures before they start.
  The research demonstrates the effectiveness of the DiscordBot as a communication tool. The ongoing feedback allowed course instructors to dynamically adjust and improve the difficulty level of upcoming activities and promote discussion in subsequent tutor sessions. The data collected reveal that students can accurately perceive the activities' difficulty and expected results, providing insights not possible through traditional end-of-semester surveys. Students reported that interaction with the DiscordBot was easy and expressed a desire to continue using it in future semesters. This responsive approach ensures the course meets the evolving needs of students, thereby enhancing their overall learning experience.</description>

      <title>Danish DPA Banned the Use of Google Chromebooks and Google Workspace in Schools in Helsingor Municipality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On July 14th, 2022, the Danish Data Protection Authority issued a reprimand against Helsingor Municipality. It imposed a general ban on using Google Chromebooks and Google Workspace for education in primary schools in the Municipality. The Danish DPA banned such processing and suspended any related data transfers to the United States (U.S.) until it is brought in line with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The suspension took effect immediately, and the Municipality had until August 3rd, 2022, to withdraw and terminate the processing, as well as delete data already transferred. Finally, in a new decision on August 18th, 2022, the Danish DPA has ratified the ban to the use of Google Chromebooks and Workspace. In the eyes of the Danish DPA, the Municipality failed for example to document that they have assessed and reduced the relevant risks to the rights and freedoms of the pupils. This article is structured as follows: section II provides the background concerning the unfolding events after the Schrems II ruling. Section III discusses the origins and facts of the Danish DPA case. Section IV examines the reasoning and critical findings of the Danish DPA decision. Finally, section V concludes with some general recommendations the Danish municipalities must follow based on the ensuing effects stemming from this case.</description>

      <title>An Alternative to Multi-Factor Authentication with a Triple-Identity Authentication Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Every user authentication scheme involves three login credentials, i.e. a username, a password and a hash value, but only one of them is associated with a user identity. However, this identity is actually not robust enough to protect the whole system, while the login entries (i.e., the username and password forms) have not been effectively protected. Furthermore, the extra factor in a system adding multi-factor authentication is transmitted in cyberspace and operated by users. If more identities can be employed for the two login forms to associate with all login credentials, and if the corresponding identifiers are not transmitted in cyberspace and operated by users, such a system can be more robust even without relying on a third-party service. To this end, a triple-identity authentication scheme is designed within a dual-password login-authentication system, which defines identities for the username and the login password, respectively. Therefore, in addition to the traditional server verification, the system can verify the identifiers at the username and password forms in succession. In the triple-identity authentication, the identifiers are entirely managed by the system without involvement of users or a third-party service, and they are concealed, incommunicable, inaccessible and independent of personal information. Thus, they are useless in online attacks.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While current personal smart devices excel in digital domains, they fall short in assisting users during human environment interaction. This paper proposes Heads Up eXperience (HUX), an AI system designed to bridge this gap, serving as a constant companion across the extended reality (XR) environments. By tracking the user's eye gaze, analyzing the surrounding environment, and interpreting verbal contexts, the system captures and enhances multi-modal data, providing holistic context interpretation and memory storage in real-time task specific situations. This comprehensive approach enables more natural, empathetic and intelligent interactions between the user and HUX AI, paving the path for human computer environment interaction. Intended for deployment in smart glasses and extended reality headsets, HUX AI aims to become a personal and useful AI companion for daily life. By integrating digital assistance with enhanced physical world interactions, this technology has the potential to revolutionize human-AI collaboration in both personal and professional spheres paving the way for the future of personal smart devices.</description>

      <title>Nomadic Non-Public Networks for 6G: Use Cases and Key Performance Indicators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The landscape of wireless communication systems is evolving rapidly, with a pivotal role envisioned for dynamic network structures and self-organizing networks in upcoming technologies like the 6G mobile communications standard. This evolution is fueled by the growing demand from diverse sectors, including industry, manufacturing, agriculture, and the public sector, each with increasingly specific requirements. The establishment of non-public networks in the current 5G standard has laid a foundation, enabling independent operation within certain frequencies and local limitations, notably for Internet of Things applications. This paper explores the progression from non-public networks to nomadic non-public networks and their significance in the context of the forthcoming 6G era.
  Building on existing work in dynamic network structures, non-public networks regulations, and alternative technological solutions, this paper introduces specific use cases enhanced by nomadic networks. In addition, relevant Key Performance Indicators are discussed on the basis of the presented use cases. These serve as a starting point for the definition of requirement clusters and thus for a evaluation metric of nomadic non-public networks. This work lays the groundwork for understanding the potential of nomadic non-public networks in the dynamic landscape of 6G wireless communication systems.</description>

      <title>Introducing a new hyper-parameter for RAG: Context Window Utilization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new hyper-parameter for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems called Context Window Utilization. RAG systems enhance generative models by incorporating relevant information retrieved from external knowledge bases, improving the factual accuracy and contextual relevance of generated responses. The size of the text chunks retrieved and processed is a critical factor influencing RAG performance. This study aims to identify the optimal chunk size that maximizes answer generation quality. Through systematic experimentation, we analyze the effects of varying chunk sizes on the efficiency and effectiveness of RAG frameworks. Our findings reveal that an optimal chunk size balances the trade-off between providing sufficient context and minimizing irrelevant information. These insights are crucial for enhancing the design and implementation of RAG systems, underscoring the importance of selecting an appropriate chunk size to achieve superior performance.</description>

      <title>Reverse Map Projections as Equivariant Quantum Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the novel class $(E_\alpha)_{\alpha \in [-\infty,1)}$ of reverse map projection embeddings, each one defining a unique new method of encoding classical data into quantum states. Inspired by well-known map projections from the unit sphere onto its tangent planes, used in practice in cartography, these embeddings address the common drawback of the amplitude embedding method, wherein scalar multiples of data points are identified and information about the norm of data is lost.
  We show how reverse map projections can be utilised as equivariant embeddings for quantum machine learning. Using these methods, we can leverage symmetries in classical datasets to significantly strengthen performance on quantum machine learning tasks.
  Finally, we select four values of $\alpha$ with which to perform a simple classification task, taking $E_\alpha$ as the embedding and experimenting with both equivariant and non-equivariant setups. We compare their results alongside those of standard amplitude embedding.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical Ising machines have emerged as a promising dynamical hardware solver for computational hard optimization problems. These Ising machines typically require an optical modulator to represent the analog spin variables of these problems. However, modern day optical modulators have a relatively low modulation resolution. We therefore investigate how the low bit-resolution of optical hardware influences the performance of this type of novel computing platform. Based on numerical simulations, we determine the minimum required bit-resolution of an optical Ising machine for different benchmark problems of different sizes. Our study shows that a limited bit-resolution of 8bit is sufficient for the optical modulator. Surprisingly, we also observe that the use of a 1bit-resolution modulator significantly improves the performance of the Ising machine across all considered benchmark problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the field of architecture, the conversion of single images into 2 and 1/2D and 3D meshes is a promising technology that enhances design visualization and efficiency. This paper evaluates four innovative methods: "One-2-3-45," "CRM: Single Image to 3D Textured Mesh with Convolutional Reconstruction Model," "Instant Mesh," and "Image-to-Mesh." These methods are at the forefront of this technology, focusing on their applicability in architectural design and visualization. They streamline the creation of 3D architectural models, enabling rapid prototyping and detailed visualization from minimal initial inputs, such as photographs or simple sketches.One-2-3-45 leverages a diffusion-based approach to generate multi-view reconstructions, ensuring high geometric fidelity and texture quality. CRM utilizes a convolutional network to integrate geometric priors into its architecture, producing detailed and textured meshes quickly and efficiently. Instant Mesh combines the strengths of multi-view diffusion and sparse-view models to offer speed and scalability, suitable for diverse architectural projects. Image-to-Mesh leverages a generative adversarial network (GAN) to produce 3D meshes from single images, focusing on maintaining high texture fidelity and geometric accuracy by incorporating image and depth map data into its training process. It uses a hybrid approach that combines voxel-based representations with surface reconstruction techniques to ensure detailed and realistic 3D models.This comparative study highlights each method's contribution to reducing design cycle times, improving accuracy, and enabling flexible adaptations to various architectural styles and requirements. By providing architects with powerful tools for rapid visualization and iteration, these advancements in 3D mesh generation are set to revolutionize architectural practices.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Bootstrapping of Quantum Dot Devices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semiconductor quantum dots (QD) are a promising platform for multiple different qubit implementations, all of which are voltage-controlled by programmable gate electrodes. However, as the QD arrays grow in size and complexity, tuning procedures that can fully autonomously handle the increasing number of control parameters are becoming essential for enabling scalability. We propose a bootstrapping algorithm for initializing a depletion mode QD device in preparation for subsequent phases of tuning. During bootstrapping, the QD device functionality is validated, all gates are characterized, and the QD charge sensor is made operational. We demonstrate the bootstrapping protocol in conjunction with a coarse tuning module, showing that the combined algorithm can efficiently and reliably take a cooled-down QD device to a desired global state configuration in under 8 minutes with a success rate of 96 %. Importantly, by following heuristic approaches to QD device initialization and combining the efficient ray-based measurement with the rapid radio-frequency reflectometry measurements, the proposed algorithm establishes a reference in terms of performance, reliability, and efficiency against which alternative algorithms can be benchmarked.</description>

      <title>To accept or not to accept? An IRT-TOE Framework to Understand Educators' Resistance to Generative AI in Higher Education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since the public release of Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (ChatGPT), extensive discourse has emerged concerning the potential advantages and challenges of integrating Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) into education. In the realm of information systems, research on technology adoption is crucial for understanding the diverse factors influencing the uptake of specific technologies. Theoretical frameworks, refined and validated over decades, serve as guiding tools to elucidate the individual and organizational dynamics, obstacles, and perceptions surrounding technology adoption. However, while several models have been proposed, they often prioritize elucidating the factors that facilitate acceptance over those that impede it, typically focusing on the student perspective and leaving a gap in empirical evidence regarding educators viewpoints. Given the pivotal role educators play in higher education, this study aims to develop a theoretical model to empirically predict the barriers preventing educators from adopting GenAI in their classrooms. Acknowledging the lack of theoretical models tailored to identifying such barriers, our approach is grounded in the Innovation Resistance Theory (IRT) framework and augmented with constructs from the Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) framework. This model is transformed into a measurement instrument employing a quantitative approach, complemented by a qualitative approach to enrich the analysis and uncover concerns related to GenAI adoption in the higher education domain.</description>

Abstract: The rapid advancement of quantum computing (QC) and machine learning (ML) has given rise to the burgeoning field of quantum machine learning (QML), aiming to capitalize on the strengths of quantum computing to propel ML forward. Despite its promise, crafting effective QML models necessitates profound expertise to strike a delicate balance between model intricacy and feasibility on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. While complex models offer robust representation capabilities, their extensive circuit depth may impede seamless execution on extant noisy quantum platforms. In this paper, we address this quandary of QML model design by employing deep reinforcement learning to explore proficient QML model architectures tailored for designated supervised learning tasks. Specifically, our methodology involves training an RL agent to devise policies that facilitate the discovery of QML models without predetermined ansatz. Furthermore, we integrate an adaptive mechanism to dynamically adjust the learning objectives, fostering continuous improvement in the agent's learning process. Through extensive numerical simulations, we illustrate the efficacy of our approach within the realm of classification tasks. Our proposed method successfully identifies VQC architectures capable of achieving high classification accuracy while minimizing gate depth. This pioneering approach not only advances the study of AI-driven quantum circuit design but also holds significant promise for enhancing performance in the NISQ era.</description>

Abstract: Recent experimental achievements have demonstrated the potential of neutral atom architectures for fault-tolerant quantum computing. These architectures feature the dynamic rearrangement of atoms during computation, enabling nearly arbitrary two-dimensional rearrangements. Additionally, they employ a zoned layout with dedicated regions for entangling, storage, and readout. This architecture requires design automation software that efficiently compiles quantum circuits to this hardware and takes care that atoms are in the right place at the right time. In this paper, we initiate this line of work by providing, (1) an abstract model of the novel architecture and, (2) an efficient solution to the routing problem of entangling gates. By this, we aim to maximize the parallelism of entangling gates and minimize the overhead caused by the routing of atoms between zones. In addition to that, we keep the realm of fault-tolerant quantum computing in mind and consider logical qubit arrays, each of which encodes one logical qubit. We implemented the proposed idea as a tool called NALAC and demonstrated its effectiveness and efficiency by showing that it can significantly reduce the routing overhead of logical entangling gates compared to the naive approach. As part of the Munich Quantum Toolkit (MQT), NALAC is publicly available as open-source at https://github.com/cda-tum/mqt-qmap.</description>
