      <title>Towards holographic color superconductivity in QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the holographic V-QCD model by introducing a charged scalar field sector to represent the condensation of paired quark matter in the deconfined phase. By incorporating this new sector into the previously established framework for nuclear and quark matter, we obtain a phase diagram that, in addition to the first-order deconfinement transition and its critical end-point, also features a second-order transition between paired and unpaired quark matter. The critical temperature for quark pairing exhibits only a mild dependence on the chemical potential and can reach values as high as $T_\mathrm{crit} \approx 30~\rm MeV$. Comparison of the growth rate for the formation of homogeneous paired phases to the growth rate of previously discovered modulated phases suggests that the former is subdominant to the latter.</description>

      <title>Yang-Lee Quantum Criticality in Various Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Yang-Lee universality class arises when imaginary magnetic field is tuned to its critical value in the paramagnetic phase of the $d&lt;6$ Ising model. In $d=2$, this non-unitary Conformal Field Theory (CFT) is exactly solvable via the $M(2,5)$ minimal model. As found long ago by von Gehlen using Exact Diagonalizations, the corresponding real-time, quantum critical behavior arises in the periodic Ising spin chain when the imaginary longitudinal magnetic field is tuned to its critical value from below. Even though the Hamiltonian is not Hermitian, the energy levels are real due to the $PT$ symmetry. In this paper, we explore the analogous quantum critical behavior in higher dimensional non-Hermitian Hamiltonians on regularized spheres $S^{d-1}$. For $d=3$, we use the recently invented, powerful fuzzy sphere method, as well as discretization by the platonic solids cube, icosahedron and dodecaherdron. The low-lying energy levels and structure constants we find are in agreement with expectations from the conformal symmetry. The energy levels are in good quantitative agreement with the high-temperature expansions and with Pad\'e extrapolations of the $6-\epsilon$ expansions in Fisher's $i\phi^3$ Euclidean field theory for the Yang-Lee criticality. In the course of this work, we clarify some aspects of matching between operators in this field theory and quasiprimary fields in the $M(2,5)$ minimal model. For $d=4$, we obtain new results by replacing the $S^3$ with the self-dual polytope called the $24$-cell.</description>

      <title>The spectrum of pure dS$_3$ gravity in the static patch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the quantum mechanical description of the de Sitter static patch in three-dimensional general relativity. We consider a Lorentzian path integral that conjecturally computes the Fourier transform of the spectrum of the static patch Hamiltonian. We regulate a saddle point for this integral by a complex deformation that connects it to future infinity. Our computation is thus closely connected with the wave function of de Sitter gravity on a torus at future infinity. Motivated by this, we identify an infinite number of saddle points that contribute to our Lorentzian path integral. Their sum gives a surprisingly simple result, which agrees with the expected features of the de Sitter static patch. For example, the thermal entropy, evaluated at the de Sitter temperature, agrees with the Bekenstein-Hawking formula. We also obtain a spectrum in the spin-zero sector, which is bounded, discrete, and has an integer degeneracy of states. It includes a dense spectrum of states, making both positive and negative contributions to the trace, arranged in such a way that negative contributions are invisible in the computation of any smooth observable. Nevertheless, several mysteries remain.</description>

      <title>Boson stars in the $U(1)$ gauged 3+1 dimensional $O(3)$ sigma-model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study regular self-gravitating non-topological soliton solutions of the $U(1)$ gauged non-linear $O(3)$ sigma model with the usual kinetic term and a simple symmetry breaking potential in 3+1 dimensional asymptotically flat spacetime. Both parity-even and parity-odd configurations with an angular node of the scalar field are considered. Localized solutions are endowed with an electric charge, spinning configurations are also coupled to the toroidal flux of magnetic field. We confirm that such solutions do not exist in the flat space limit. Similar to the usual boson stars, a spiral-like frequency dependence of the mass and the Noether charge of the gauged solutions is observed. Depending on the relative strength of gravity and the electromagnetic interaction, the resulting gauged $O(3)$ boson stars at the mass threshold either possess the usual Newtonian limit, or they are linked to a regular strongly gravitating critical configuration. We explore domain of existence of the solutions and investigate some of their physical properties.</description>

      <title>Axiomatic quantum electrodynamics: from causality to convexity of effective action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Theory of electromagnetic field, specified by an effective action functional, is considered. The causality condition is imposed in the form of a requirement that the group velocities of propagation of small and soft disturbances over the background of an external constant field should not exceed the speed of light in vacuum. It is shown that these conditions lead, in particular, to a very definite conclusion about the geometry of the local limit of the effective action. Namely, the surface, which is specified in the local limit by the nonlinear Lagrangian, considered as a function of two invariants of the field has positive Gaussian curvature.</description>

      <title>Probing the Thermodynamic Phase Structure of Black Holes through Euler characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we attempt to explore a possible connection between thermodynamic topology and the thermodynamic geometry formulation of black hole thermodynamics. We study the topological structure of black hole thermodynamic phase spaces by calculating the Euler characteristic (EC) using four well-known thermodynamic geometries: Weinhold, Ruppeiner, Geometrothermodynamics (GTD), and HPEM. We interpret the Euler characteristic as an indicator of the degree of microscopic interactions within the thermodynamic system. As the system approaches the spinoidal curve, the interaction strength increases significantly, eventually driving a phase transition. Beyond the spinoidal region, the interactions begin to weaken, and the system gradually stabilizes into a new phase configuration, reflected by a corresponding change in the topological structure of the thermodynamic state space.</description>

      <title>Non-thermodynamic Black Hole Evaporation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate black hole evaporation from the path integral perspective. We demonstrate that besides the standard thermodynamic modes, there are non-thermodynamic modes of black hole evaporation which contain remnants. The pure thermodynamic process is recovered when the Gauss-Bonnet action is involved. This scenario opens a new window for analyzing the process of black-hole evaporation.</description>

      <title>Functional renormalization group equations for antisymmetric tensor field models at finite temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the framework of the functional renormalization group, we derived the flow equations for the scale-dependent effective action at finite temperature for models involving an antisymmetric rank-2 tensor field. The analysis focuses on scenarios where the vacuum expectation value emerges due to symmetry breaking patterns, specifically $SU(n) \to USp(n)$ and $SO(n) \to SU(n/2)$. The derived equations provide insights into the behavior of these models under varying scales and temperatures, contributing to the understanding of phase transitions in systems with complex symmetry structures.</description>

      <title>A new formalism of the bi-adjoint scalar $\ell$-loop planar integrand recursion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we proposed a new method to obtain $\ell$-loop planar integrands of bi-adjoint scalars. From the equation of motion, we defined comb components and then constructed loop kernels. We constructed the $\ell$-loop planar integrands using these objects by some recursion rules. Finally, we raised a new formalism of the recursion, which is more elegant than the traditional one, based on the "graded inverse variables".</description>

      <title>Emergence of gravity from quantum field theory in triangulated spacetime and the QFT vector model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate quantum field theory in triangulated spacetime using compositional quantum field theory and tensor network methods. We show that gravitational interactions emerge as a low-energy effective phenomenon in this framework. For concrete calculations we use free massive scalar field theory in two-dimensional Lorentzian spacetime, but the results generalize to other models and higher dimensions. Finally, our results lead us to propose a new approach to the unification of quantum field theory with gravity, the QFT vector model, which combines insights and techniques from various current approaches to quantum gravity such as causal dynamical triangulations, random tensor models, group field theory, emergent gravity and holography.</description>

      <title>Two-point open string amplitude as AdS transition amplitude</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the two-point open string amplitude at tree level and show that, in a t'Hooft-like limit, it takes a form structurally analogous to a boundary-to-boundary transition amplitude of scalar fields in Euclidean AdS space. Starting from the path integral formulation of bosonic string theory on a disk, we evaluate the amplitude using the Green's function under Neumann boundary conditions. In the end, we recast the result as a sum over AdS transition amplitudes between scalar fields with different conformal weights.</description>

      <title>Heterotic String Sigma Models: Discrete Light Cone Quantization and Its Current-Current Deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a two-dimensional superstring sigma model that defines a self-contained corner of heterotic string theory, whose second quantization is heterotic matrix string theory. This worldsheet theory arises from a BPS decoupling limit that zooms in on the heterotic string, under which the target space geometry becomes non-Lorentzian. This construction generalizes the Gomis-Ooguri formulation of non-relativistic string theory to the heterotic case. We show how such a worldsheet theory provides a first-principles definition of the heterotic string in the discrete light cone quantization via T-duality. By turning on a current-current deformation akin to a $T\bar{T}$ deformation, the conventional heterotic string theory with a Lorentzian target space is recovered. We analyze the gauge and gravitational anomalies with respect to the lowest-order quantum corrections in the sigma model and show how the worldsheet theory is consistent with non-Lorentzian supergravity in the target space.</description>

      <title>Center-vortex semiclassics with non-minimal 't Hooft fluxes on $\mathbb{R}^2\times T^2$ and center stabilization at large $N$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the semiclassical description of confinement for $4$d $SU(N)$ Yang-Mills theory on small $\mathbb{R}^2\times T^2$ with non-minimal 't Hooft twist $p$ with $\gcd(N,p)=1$. For this purpose, we construct the self-dual center vortex for non-minimal 't Hooft twists from the Kraan-van Baal-Lee-Lu-Yi (KvBLLY) monopoles by using the $3$d Abelianized description of $SU(N)$ gauge fields on $\mathbb{R}^3\times S^1$ with nontrivial holonomy backgrounds. This construction shows the self-dual vortex has (1) the fractional magnetic charge $q/N$ with $pq=1$ mod $N$, (2) the fractional topological charge $1/N$, and (3) the fractional instanton action $S_{\mathrm{YM}}=8\pi^2/(Ng^2)$. The confinement vacua for $NL\Lambda\ll 1$ can be described by the dilute gas approximation of center vortices, and we give the semiclassical formula for the $\theta$ dependence and confining string tensions. We apply this result to understand the suitable choice of the twist $p$ for center stabilization at large $N$. In particular, we test the proposal using the Fibonacci sequence, $N=F_{n+2}$ and $p=F_n$, suggested in studies of the twisted Eguchi-Kawai model, from the viewpoint of the $1$-form and $0$-form center symmetries.</description>

      <title>Decoherence of quantum superpositions in near-extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes with quantum gravity corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the quantum gravity corrected decoherence of quantum superpositions in the near-extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes. By employing the effective field theory approach, we model the black hole as a quantum system coupled to an external source via a scalar field, and derive the relation between the decoherence rate and the two-point correlation function of the operators acting on the black quantum system. By utilizing the low-energy Schwarzian effective theory, which captures the boundary dynamics of the $AdS_2$ near-horizon geometry of the near-extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes, we compute the decoherence rate both in the microcanonical and canonical ensembles. We find that in the microcanonical ensemble, where the black hole energy is fixed, quantum gravity corrections do not modify the decoherence rate compared to the semiclassical prediction. However, in the canonical ensemble, where the black hole is in a thermal equilibrium state, quantum gravitational effects significantly enhance the decoherence rate at low temperatures. Our results demonstrate that even in the near-extremal limit where Hawking radiation is suppressed, quantum gravitational fluctuations can strongly influence the coherence of nearby quantum systems.</description>

      <title>A novel nonlocal spin-1/2 theory: classical and quantum aspects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel nonlocal spin-1/2 theory in which the form factor depends on the Dirac operator rather than on the d'Alembert operator. In this scenario, we explore some classical and quantum aspects of this new theory. At the classical level, we investigate the dispersion relation of free spin-1/2 particles and find that it increasingly deviates from the standard case as the nonlocal effects become relevant. At the quantum level, we compute the fermionic one-loop effective action for the nonlocal spin-1/2 theory with Yukawa coupling and show that the contributions of nonlocal effects are significant in the UV limit, while in the IR they are suppressed by a UV cutoff scale, which has been chosen to coincide with the nonlocality scale $\Lambda$. We minimally couple a $U(1)$ gauge field to the nonlocal spin-1/2 field theory and explicitly demonstrate that this theory is gauge invariant. Finally, we obtain a nonlocal version of the Pauli equation and the impact of the nonlocality in the $g$-factor of massive particles.</description>

      <title>Pinpointing Triple Point of Noncommutative Matrix Model with Curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07563v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a Hermitian matrix model with a quartic potential, modified by a curvature term $\mathrm{tr}(R\Phi^2)$, where $R$ is a fixed external matrix. Motivated by the truncated Heisenberg algebra formulation of the Grosse-Wulkenhaar model, this term breaks unitary invariance and gives rise to an effective multitrace matrix model via perturbative expansion. We analyze the resulting action analytically and numerically, focusing on the shift of the triple point and suppression of the noncommutative stripe phase -- features linked to renormalizability. Our findings, supported by Hamiltonian Monte Carlo simulations, indicate that the curvature term drives the phase structure toward renormalizable behavior by eliminating the stripe phase.</description>

      <title>Flowing from the Ising Model on the Fuzzy Sphere to the 3D Lee-Yang CFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ the Fuzzy Sphere regulator to study the 3D Lee-Yang CFT. The model is defined by deforming the Ising model on the Fuzzy Sphere via a purely imaginary longitudinal magnetic field. This model undergoes a quantum phase transition, whose critical point we determine and identify with the 3D Lee-Yang CFT. We show how to tune the model and find that the lowest-lying states of the Hamiltonian align well with the expected CFT spectrum. We discuss the Fuzzy Sphere estimates for the scaling dimension $\Delta_\phi$ of the lowest primary operator. Finally, we interpret small deviations from the CFT expectations in terms of the leading irrelevant operators of the Lee-Yang CFT. We show that the Fuzzy Sphere calculations are compatible with the best five-loop $\epsilon$-expansion estimates.</description>

      <title>Effective Field Theory Description of Hawking Radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A study is made of Hawking radiation from four-dimensional black holes using effective field theory methods. The trace anomaly for the stress tensor in a general curved spacetime background is reproduced using Riegert's action. The semiclassical stress tensor is evaluated in a Schwarzschild background taking a time-independent limit for the quantum state. Imposing physical boundary conditions on an initial Cauchy surface leads to a unique state, analogous to the Unruh state with a vanishing ingoing flux and a finite outgoing flux. In particular, there is no sign of quantum hair arising from this nonlocal effective action.</description>

      <title>Disparity in sound speeds: implications for unitarity and effective potential in quantum field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a complete unitarity framework for quantum field theories whose massive scalar excitations propagate at different sound speeds. Starting from first principles we derive the exact partial-wave unitarity condition for $2\rightarrow 2$ scattering with arbitrary masses and velocity hierarchies, recovering the standard and massless limits as special cases. Applying the formalism to a renormalizable two-field model we verify the optical theorem at one loop and obtain compact, velocity-dependent perturbative unitarity bounds. Then we compute the one-loop Coleman-Weinberg potential in the background-field method, tracking how a small splitting between sound speeds reshapes the renormalization-group flow. We find that all of quartic $\beta$-functions are rescaled in such a way that an accidental fixed line emerges.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we investigate the property of complete monotonicity within a special family $\mathcal{F}_s$ of functions in $s$ variables involving logarithms. The main result of this work provides a linear isomorphism between $\mathcal{F}_s$ and the space of real multivariate polynomials. This isomorphism identifies the cone of completely monotone functions with the cone of non-negative polynomials. We conclude that the cone of completely monotone functions in $\mathcal{F}_s$ is semi-algebraic. This gives a finite time algorithm to decide whether a function in $\mathcal{F}_s$ is completely monotone</description>

      <title>Integrability and Chaos via fractal analysis of Spectral Form Factors: Gaussian approximations and exact results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish the mathematical equivalence between the spectral form factor, a quantity used to identify the onset of quantum chaos and scrambling in quantum many-body systems, and the classical problem of statistical characterization of planar random walks. We thus associate to any quantum Hamiltonian a random process on the plane. We set down rigorously the conditions under which such random process becomes a Wiener process in the thermodynamic limit and the associated distribution of the distance from the origin becomes Gaussian. This leads to the well known Gaussian behavior of the spectral form factor for quantum chaotic (non-integrable) models, which we show to be violated at low temperature. For systems with quasi-free spectrum (integrable), instead, the distribution of the SFF is Log-Normal. We compute all the moments of the spectral form factor exactly without resorting to the Gaussian approximation. Assuming degeneracies in the quantum chaotic spectrum we solve the classical problem of random walker taking steps of unequal lengths. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the Hausdorff dimension of the frontier of the random walk, defined as the boundary of the unbounded component of the complement, approaches 1 for the integrable Brownian motion, while the non-integrable walk approaches that obtained by the Schramm-Loewner Evolution (SLE) with the fractal dimension $4/3$. Additionally, we numerically show that Bethe Ansatz walkers fall into a category similar to the non-integrable walkers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The generation of large curvature perturbations associated with the production of primordial black holes is studied in the context of a Higgs inflaton. To enable this amplification, we consider an inflationary model in which the tree-level action for gravity and the Standard Model Higgs is modified by quantum corrections, described by a series of higher-dimension operators. Finally within a minimal EFT framework, we present two viable models in which the spectrum of curvature perturbations generated by the Higgs field is consistent with CMB observations and can lead to the formation of primordial black holes in the asteroid mass range, potentially accounting for the entirety of dark matter.</description>

      <title>2D Quon Language: Unifying Framework for Cliffords, Matchgates, and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulating generic quantum states and dynamics is practically intractable using classical computers. However, certain special classes -- namely Clifford and matchgate circuits -- permit efficient computation. They provide invaluable tools for studying many-body physics, quantum chemistry, and quantum computation. While both play foundational roles across multiple disciplines, the origins of their tractability seem disparate, and their relationship remain unclear. A deeper understanding of such tractable classes could expand their scope and enable a wide range of new applications. In this work, we make progress toward the unified understanding of the Clifford and matchgate -- these two classes are, in fact, distinct special cases of a single underlying structure. Specifically, we introduce the 2D Quon language, which combines Majorana worldlines with their underlying spacetime topology to diagrammatically represent quantum processes and tensor networks. In full generality, the 2D Quon language is universal -- capable of representing arbitrary quantum states, dynamics, or tensor networks -- yet they become especially powerful in describing Clifford and matchgate classes. Each class can be efficiently characterized in a visually recognizable manner using the Quon framework. This capability naturally gives rise to several families of efficiently computable tensor networks introduced in this work: punctured matchgates, hybrid Clifford-matchgate-MPS, and ansatze generated from factories of tractable networks. All of these exhibit high non-Cliffordness, high non-matchgateness, and large bipartite entanglement entropy. We discuss a range of applications of our approach, from recovering well-known results such as the Kramers-Wannier duality and the star-triangle relation of the Ising model, to enabling variational optimization with novel ansatz states.</description>

      <title>Simulating the non-unitary Yang-Lee conformal field theory on the fuzzy sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fuzzy sphere method has enjoyed great success in the study of (2+1)-dimensional unitary conformal field theories (CFTs) by regularizing them as quantum Hall transitions on the sphere. Here, we extend this approach to the Yang-Lee CFT-the simplest non-unitary CFT. We use an Ising quantum-Hall ferromagnet Hamiltonian with a transverse field and an imaginary longitudinal field, the latter breaks the Hermiticity of the Hamiltonian and thus the unitarity of the associated quantum field theory. Non-unitary conformal field theories-particularly the Yang-Lee CFT-pose significant challenges to conventional fuzzy sphere approaches. To overcome these obstacles, here we utilize a different method for determining critical points that requires no a priori knowledge of CFT scaling dimensions. Our method instead leverages the state-operator correspondence while utilizing two complementary criteria: the conformality of the energy spectrum and its consistency with conformal perturbation theory. We also discuss a new finite-size scaling on the fuzzy sphere that allows us to extract conformal data more reliably, and compare it with the conventional analysis using the (1+1)-dimensional Yang-Lee problem as an example. Our results show broad agreement with previous Monte-Carlo and conformal bootstrap results. We also uncover one previously unknown primary operator and several operator product expansion coefficients.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a massive scalar field in a fixed Schwarzschild background, the radial wave equation obeyed by Fourier modes is first studied. In addition to exact solutions at the regular singular points, we find an exact local solution in the neighbourhood of the irregular singular point at infinity. Moreover, we obtain and study the associated integral representation of the massive scalar field. Eventually, the technique developed for the irregular singular point is applied to the homogeneous equation associated to the inhomogeneous Zerilli equation for gravitational perturbations in a Schwarzschild background.</description>

      <title>On the validity of the complex Langevin method near the deconfining phase transition in QCD at finite density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In our previous paper [JHEP 10 (2020) 144], we found that the complex Langevin (CL) method works for QCD at finite density on the $16^3 \times 32$ lattice in the low-temperature high-density regime within the range $\mu / T = 1.6 - 9.6$ with $\mu$ and $T$ being the quark chemical potential and the temperature, which enabled us to see a clear trend towards the formation of the Fermi sphere. Here we investigate the validity of the CL method on the $24^3 \times 12$ lattice in the deconfined phase near the deconfinement phase transition. As before, we use four-flavor staggered fermions and judge the validity using the criterion based on the probability distribution of the drift term. The spatial extent is $L = (1.3 - 2.7 {\rm ~fm} )&gt; \Lambda_{\rm LQCD}^{-1} \sim 1{\rm ~fm}$, in contrast to our previous study with $L &lt; \Lambda_{\rm LQCD}^{-1}$. We find that the CL method works in a broad region up to $\mu / T = 4.8$, while it starts to fail as we approach the phase boundary due to the singular drift problem, which can be understood qualitatively by extending the Banks-Casher relation to the case at finite density.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the thermodynamic properties of Schwarzschild-AdS and charged-AdS black holes within the framework of Cotton gravity, which is a modified theory of gravity that retains all solutions of General Relativity while addressing some of its theoretical shortcomings and enriching gravitational phenomenology at large distances. We derive key thermodynamic quantities, including mass, temperature, heat capacity and Gibbs free energy, to examine the stability and phase structure of these black hole solutions. Furthermore, employing the formalism of geometrothermodynamics, we analyze the behavior of the thermodynamic curvature scalar to identify critical points and characterize phase transitions. Our results demonstrate that the Cotton parameter \( \lambda \), which quantifies deviations from Einstein's theory, plays a pivotal role in shaping the thermodynamic behavior, resulting in new stability conditions and distinct phase transition patterns compared to those predicted by standard General Relativity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a detailed Hamiltonian treatment of an inhomogeneous fermionic perturbation propagating on a closed FLRW spacetime quantized via LQC. Expanding the fermion in spinor harmonics on spatial 3-sphere and truncating at quadratic order, we derive a decoupled, mode-by-mode Hamiltonian, where each mode behaves as a time-dependent Fermi oscillator. This framework naturally facilitates a Schrodinger-picture evolution for fermionic perturbations on a quantum-corrected background. Under the test-field approximation, each massive mode sees its own dressed metric, akin to bosonic perturbations, but with distinctive Planck-scale modifications in both temporal and spatial components. Massless modes, by contrast, experience an equivalent class of conformal backgrounds: quantum corrections drop out of the spatial sector, while the temporal component alone is dressed by quantum gravity corrections. Extending beyond the test-field regime via a Born-Oppenheimer approximation, we incorporate fermionic backreaction self-consistently. Each mode's energy (depending on the either vacuum or pair states they occupied) sources a mode-dependent shift of the background Hamiltonian, resulting in a rainbow metric. In the deep Planck regime, vacuum occupation yields a positive fermionic perturbation term in the Hamiltonian, raising the effective minisuperspace potential and delaying the bounce to higher density in the contracting branch. Excited occupation flips the perturbation sign, lowering the barrier and advancing the bounce to lower density. At large volumes, massive fermion backreaction settles into a constant energy density -- an emergent cosmological constant -- capable of driving late-time acceleration, whereas massless modes remain dynamically inert post-bounce. These effects break the exact time-reversal symmetry of the quantum bounce and generate asymmetric pre- and post-bounce trajectories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, quantum gravity effects, which can potentially be measured in magnetometers through the Larmor frequency of atoms in an external magnetic field, are estimated. It is shown that the thermal motion of atoms can, in principle, produce measurable quantum gravity effects, given the precision of modern magnetometers. If the particle velocities are caused by some other mechanism, such as convection, it is shown that the quantum gravity effects may be observed with the magnetometer's proposed detection threshold. An actual state-of-the-art optical magnetometer experiment is being designed to search for these effects and is described in a companion paper by Maldaner et al. (2023) [1].</description>

      <title>Traversable wormhole sourced by a generalized string fluid in the 4D Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate traversable wormhole solutions in four-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (EGB) gravity coupled with a generalized string fluid background. Our analysis reveals that zero-tidal solutions meet all geometric criteria for traversability while avoiding singularities, with the Gauss-Bonnet coupling $\alpha$ modulating the throat geometry and asymptotic behavior. Varying the parameters $\alpha$ and $\varepsilon$ significantly affects curvature both near the throat and at large distances, maintaining finite values throughout spacetime. We demonstrate that the null energy condition (NEQ) can be satisfied for high values of $\alpha$ ($\gtrsim 1$) and low string fluid density $\varepsilon$ ($\lesssim 0.1$), greatly reducing the exotic matter requirement compared to general relativistic wormholes. The string fluid's behavior approaches that of a cloud of strings for large $\alpha$ or $\varepsilon$. Additionally, the volume integral quantifier and complexity factor analyses show that increasing $\alpha$ reduces gravitational complexity and exotic matter content near the throat, aligning with NEQ preservation. Our results establish that the combined influence of Gauss-Bonnet gravity and string-like matter can support traversable wormholes while minimizing unphysical energy conditions, offering new insights for constructing viable wormhole geometries in modified gravity.</description>

      <title>Quarkyonic picture of isospin QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We suggest a new look onto the thermodynamics of cold isospin QCD matter described within the quarkyonic framework, when confining forces are essential only for the momentum states close to the Fermi sphere and lead to formation of the quark-antiquark correlations with quantum numbers of pions. Within this picture cold isospin QCD matter is constituted by the Bose-Einstein condensate of pions and free (anti)quarks. We develop a simple confining model of pions existing as the lowest energy $P$-state of in-medium three-dimensional harmonic oscillator and use it to show that under the conditions of isospin QCD quarkyonic matter can onset at densities significantly smaller than the overlap density of pions. Using the experimentally established pion charge radius we demonstrate that the onset density can be even lower than two nuclear saturation densities. To analyze the lattice QCD data we develop a field-theory inspired model of quark-antiquark-pion matter with vector-isovector repulsion among pions and (anti)quarks. The quark substructure of pions, which is one of the key elements of the model, is accounted for within the one-loop no-sea approximation and leads to an effective medium dependence of the pion mass. The latter is shown to be crucial for providing asymptotic vanishing of the pion density and pion condensate, which reflects pion dissociation due to asymptotic freedom of QCD. The proposed quarkyonic picture of isospin QCD agrees with the results of perturbative calculations on reaching the conformal limit of QCD and with the data of lattice simulations, which supports its viability and physical relevance.</description>

      <title>An analysis of Born-Infeld boson compact objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study gravitationally bound compact objects sourced by a string theory inspired Born-Infeld scalar field. Unlike many of their canonical scalar field counterparts, these ``boson stars'' do not have to extend out to infinity and may generate compact bodies. We analyze in detail both the junction conditions at the surface as well as the boundary conditions at the center which are required in order to have a smooth structure throughout the object and into the exterior vacuum region. These junction conditions, although involved, turn out to be relatively easy to satisfy. Analysis reveals that these compact objects have a richer structure than the canonical boson stars and some of these properties turn out to be physically peculiar: There are several branches of solutions depending on how the junction conditions are realized. Further analysis illustrates that in practice the junction conditions tend to require interior geometries reminiscent of ``bag of gold'' spacetimes, and also hide the star behind an event horizon in its exterior. The surface compactness of such objects, defined here as the ratio $2M/r$, can be made arbitrarily close to unity indicating the absence of a Buchdahl bound. Some comments on the stability of these objects is provided to find possible stable and unstable regimes. However, we argue that even in the possibly stable regime the event horizon in the vacuum region shielding the object is potentially unstable, and would cut off the star from the rest of the universe.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of photon emission rate near QCD critical point</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute photon emission rate enhancement near the QCD critical point using an effective theory of dynamic critical phenomena and derive a universal photon spectrum. The emission rate scales similarly to conductivity, increasing with the correlation length ($\xi$), diverging at the critical point. The spectrum exhibits $\omega dN_{\gamma}/d^3k \propto \omega^{-1/2}$ in the scaling regime, with the transition occurring at a frequency comparable to shear damping rate $\omega \sim \gamma_{\eta}/\xi^2$, reflecting the nonequilibrium properties of the near-critical liquid.</description>

      <title>Karmarkar-Tolman Embedded Charged Anisotropic Stars in f(R) Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate various anisotropic spherical distributions of charged celestial bodies within the context of f(R) gravity, where R represents the Ricci scalar. The properties of specific charged compact objects are analyzed by using the Karmarkar-Tolman spacetime and three distinct gravitational models. The behavior of the structural parameters is examined via graphical methods. Energy constraints are applied to assess how well the results align with the Karmarkar-Tolman spacetime model. The physical acceptability of the stellar models is evaluated by checking the energy conditions and the equation of state parameter. Additionally, we explore the influence of anisotropy on the stability and internal structure of the models. Our findings are compared with predictions from general relativity to highlight the effects of f(R) gravity on charged compact stars. The obtained results are useful to enhance our understanding of how modified gravity theories affect the properties of compact astrophysical objects.</description>

      <title>Iterative Relaxation Method to Obtain Global Transonic Flows around Compact Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flows around compact objects are necessarily transonic. Due to their dissipative nature, finding of sonic points is not trivial. Becker and Le in 2003 (BL03) proposed a novel methodology to obtain global transonic solutions, using iterative relaxation technique and exploiting the inner boundary conditions of the central object. In the current work, we propose a generic methodology -- IRM-SP and IRM-SHOCK to obtain any class of global accretion and wind solutions, given a set of constants of motion. We have considered viscosity in the system, which transports angular momentum outwards. In addition, it heats the system. Radiative processes like bremsstrahlung which cools the system is also incorporated. An interplay between heating and cooling process, along with gravity and centrifugal forces gives rise to multiple sonic points and hence shocks. The proposed methodology successfully generates any class of accretion as well as wind solutions, allowing us to unify them. Additionally, we report here rigorously the mathematical as well as the computational algorithm needed, to find sonic point(s) and thus obtain global transonic flows around compact objects.</description>

      <title>Non-minimally coupled scalar field dark sector of the universe: in-depth (Einstein frame) case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit non-minimally coupled scalar field cosmologies in the Einstein frame and present a comprehensive analysis that spans background dynamics, linear perturbations, thermodynamics, quantum gravity constraints and baryogenesis. Using a dynamical systems approach, we classify all analytical critical points for a representative set of scalar field potentials: axions (ALPs), cyclic ekpyrotic, exponential (ekpyrotic) with $\Lambda$, quintessence, and scalar field dark matter. We show that a chameleon-like coupling $f(\phi)=e^{\beta\phi}$ modifies both the expansion history and the growth of structure in a way that remains compatible with current fifth-force searches. Analytical transfer matrices for primordial tensor modes are derived, revealing a scale-dependent break in the gravitational-wave spectrum whose position and amplitude are fixed by the coupling parameter $\beta$. A causal Israel--Stewart treatment demonstrates that the same coupling supplies an effective bulk pressure that drives a smooth bounce while respecting quantum energy inequalities. Penrose's Weyl-curvature hypothesis is recovered dynamically: during an ekpyrotic phase with $\omega\gg1$ the Weyl invariant decays as $a^{-6(1+\omega)}$, resetting gravitational entropy without violating the generalized second law. A time-varying $\phi$ simultaneously generates an effective chemical potential $\mu_{B}\simeq\beta\dot{\phi}/M^{2}$, allowing for spontaneous high-scale baryogenesis whose back reaction on $\phi$ is negligible for $M\gtrsim10^{15}\sqrt{\beta}$ GeV. Swampland distance and de Sitter criteria are automatically satisfied because the ekpyrotic phase confines the field excursion to $\Delta\phi\lesssim\mathcal{O}(1)M_{\rm Pl}$. These results establish new links between dark-sector interactions, entropy production, and late-time acceleration while identifying observational windows.</description>

Abstract: We develop a novel and systematic approach to computing the Chern-Simons potentials given the Pontryagin densities in arbitrary even dimensions $ D\geq4 $. Throughout we work with a generic affine connection, that results in a non-vanishing torsion in general and allows for non-metricity, which accommodates the existence of non-trivial Pontryagin densities in $ D=4n-2 \, (n \geq 2) $ dimensions. We outline an algorithm, with its implementation as a code, which lets one to determine the Chern-Simons potential of the Pontryagin density given an arbitrary even dimension.</description>

      <title>Towards a test of the Born rule in high-energy collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider how the Born rule, a fundamental principle of quantum mechanics, could be tested for particles created on the shortest timescales ($\sim10^{-25}\,\mathrm{s}$) currently accessible at high-energy colliders. We focus on targeted tests of the Born rule for spin or polarisation probabilities, which offer a particularly clean experimental signal, and which can be described by a simple hidden-variables model of two-state systems proposed by Bell. These probabilities test a remarkable feature of the quantum formalism, whereby expectation values for incompatible experiments are linearly related. Born-rule violations can be parameterised by nonlinear expectation values for quantum measurements of spin or polarisation, along with anomalies in ensemble averages, which are to be constrained by experiment. Notable experiments considered here include the recent detection of single photons from top-quark decay, and the indirect measurement of tau-lepton polarisation. Repurposing these experiments as tests of the Born rule, however, presents several challenges, which are discussed in this paper.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We reveal a hidden electrodynamical structure emerging from a general $2\times2$ pseudo-Hermitian system that exhibits real spectra. Even when the Hamiltonian does not explicitly depend on time, the Berry curvature can be mapped onto a $2+1$ dimensional electromagnetic field arising from an artificial spacetime instanton, in sharp contrast to the Hermitian systems where the Berry curvature is equivalent to the static magnetic field of a magnetic monopole in three spatial dimensions. The instanton appearing as a spacetime singularity carries a topological charge that quantizes the jump of magnetic flux of the Berry curvature at the time origin. Our findings are demonstrated in a simple example related to antiferromagnetic magnons.</description>

      <title>Using nanokelvin quantum thermometry to detect timelike Unruh effect in a Bose-Einstein condensate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.14246v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is found that the Unruh effect can not only arise out of the entanglement between two sets of modes spanning the left and right Rindler wedges, but also between modes spanning the future and past light cones. Furthermore, an inertial Unruh-DeWitt detector along a spacetime trajectory in one of these cones may exhibit the same thermal response to the vacuum as that of an accelerated detector confined in the Rindler wedge. This feature thus could be an alternative candidate to verify the ``Unruh effect", termed as the timelike Unruh effect correspondingly. In this paper we propose to detect the timelike Unruh effect by using an impurity immersed in a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). The impurity acts as the detector which interacts with the density fluctuations in the condensate, working as an effective quantum field. Following the paradigm of the emerging field of quantum thermometry, we combine quantum parameter estimation theory with the theory of open quantum systems to realize a nondemolition Unruh temperature measurement in the nanokelvin (nK) regime. Our results demonstrate that the timelike Unruh effect can be probed using a stationary two-level impurity with time-dependent energy gap immersed in a BEC within current technologies.</description>

Abstract: We prove that higher-derivative and genuinely nonlocal Lagrangian systems can be Lyapunov-stable even when their Hamiltonians lack a lower bound. Explicit free and coupled Pais-Uhlenbeck oscillators, together with a genuine nonlocal model, are analysed to identify the precise conditions under which stability holds. These counterexamples point out the logical gap in the "Ostrogradsky instability" claims and provide benchmarks for constructing efficient stable higher-derivative theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14998v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of defining an invariant notion of tension in gravity. For spacetimes whose asymptotics are those of a Defect CFT we propose two independent definitions : Gravitational tension given by the one-point function of the dilatation current, and inertial tension, or stiffness, given by the norm of the displacement operator. We show that both reduce to the tension of the Nambu-Goto action in the limit of classical thin probe branes. Subtle normalisations of the relevant Witten diagrams are fixed by the Weyl and diffeomorphism Ward identities of the boundary DCFT. The gravitational tension is not defined for domain walls, whereas stiffness is not defined for point particles. When they both exist these two tensions are in general different, but the examples of line and surface BPS defects in $d=4$ show that superconformal invariance can identify them.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02628v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new perturbative/nonperturbative (P/NP) relation that applies to a broader class of genus-1 potentials, including those that possess real and complex instantons parametrized by a deformation parameter, such as polynomial and elliptic potentials. Our findings significantly extend the scope of quantum mechanical systems for which perturbation theory suffices to calculate the contributions of nonperturbative effects to energy levels, with or without the need for a boundary condition, depending on the potential. We further provide evidence for our results by predicting the corrections to the large-order behavior of the perturbative expansion for the Jacobi SD elliptic potential using the early terms of the instanton fluctuations that satisfy the P/NP relation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14542v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study $U(1)$ symmetry generators from wrapped branes in Type IIB string theory and M-theory. Specifically, we construct topological defects for the $R$-symmetry in 4d $\mathcal{N}=1$ and 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ quantum field theories holographically dual to Sasaki-Einstein compactifications. These are studied using a universal consistent truncation to the gravity multiplet in the bulk theory. We furthermore check these constructions by identifying the objects charged under them, and understanding their origin in the bulk theory.</description>

      <title>Kalb-Ramond field, black holes and black strings in (2 + 1)D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07580v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: New rotating dilaton black hole and black string solutions in three spacetime dimensions are obtained. The background spacetime interpolates between Anti-de Sitter and a (an asymptotically) flat spacetime. The new black strings are characterized by their masses, angular momenta and axion charges. The uncharged black string solutions have only a single horizon. They contain a curvature singularity enclosed inside their horizons. Thus, they are also black hole solutions of Einstein-scalar gravity. On the other hand, the charged black string solutions have two horizons. They may or may not contain a curvature singularity depending on the ratio of their inner and outer horizons radii. When they contain a singularity, the singularity is either at or enclosed inside their inner horizons. We also obtain, in addition to the uncharged black strings, other new black hole solutions of Einstein-scalar gravity by applying duality transformation on the new charged black strings. The new black holes are described by their masses and angular momenta. We show that their angular momenta do not depend on their horizons radii. We also find that the masses of a class of the black holes can be made negative by adjusting, using the gauge ambiguity, the asymptotic value of the (independent component of the) Kalb-Ramond field in the dual black strings. We also discuss black hole and black string solutions with a curvature singularity at or beyond their outer or event horizons. Black hole solutions with a ring curvature singularity in between their inner and outer horizons are also presented.</description>

      <title>The primordial non-Gaussianities for non-singular Horndeski cosmologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10742v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have acquired and analyzed the bispectrum of primordial scalar perturbations and the corresponding non-Gaussianities in the particular model of the contracting Universe with strong gravity in the past within the framework of the Horndeski theory. The found shape function of the bispectrum did not correspond to the widely used local, equilateral, orthogonal or enfolded shapes. We also evaluate non-Gaussianity parameter $f_{\text{NL}}$ for different wave numbers $\vec{k}_1$, $\vec{k}_2$, $\vec{k}_3$ configurations. The convenient ones in our case are: (i) $k_1=k_2$, $k_3\to 0$ (local configuration of wave numbers); (ii) $k_1=k_2=k_3$ (equilateral configuration); (iii) the enfolded one, where $k_1=k_2+k_3$, which is a linear combination of the equilateral and orthogonal configurations. For each separate configuration (local, equilateral, and enfolded) it is possible to satisfy the current observational bounds for non-linear parameter even under the restrictions of the applicability of regime, where the background evolution and perturbations are legitimately described within classical field theory and weakly coupled quantum theory at all times. However, one can not select the parameters of the model so that all three non-linear parameters $f_{\text{NL}}^{\text{local}}$, $f_{\text{NL}}^{\text{equil}}$, and $f_{\text{NL}}^{\text{enfold}}$ would simultaneously satisfy the acceptable observational constraints.</description>

      <title>False vacuum decay beyond the quadratic approximation: summation of non-local self-energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18421v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the 2PI effective action formalism, we study false vacuum decay beyond the quadratic approximation of the path integral. We derive a coupled system of equations for the bounce and the propagator, and we compute a semi-analytic expression for the self-energy of a real scalar field with cubic and quartic interactions from the 2PI effective action truncated at two loops and without further approximations. Deriving numerical results, we can show that the Hartree approximation, where non-local contributions to the self-energy are neglected, is generally not justified. The procedure we develop is a key step towards the explicit computation of the quantum corrected bounce, the determinant of fluctuations about it and the decay rate in the presence of classical zero-modes that are lifted by quantum effects, e.g. classically scale-invariant models relevant for assessing the Higgs stability.</description>

      <title>Gauging or extending bulk and boundary conformal field theories: Application to bulk and domain wall problem in topological matter and their descriptions by (mock) modular covariant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19577v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study gauging operations (or group extensions) in (smeared) boundary conformal field theories (BCFTs) and bulk conformal field theories and their applications to various phenomena in topologically ordered systems. We apply the resultant theories to the correspondence between the renormalization group (RG) flow of CFTs and the classification of topological quantum field theories in the testable information of general classes of partition functions. One can obtain the bulk topological properties of $2+1$ dimensional topological ordered phase corresponding to the massive RG flow of $1+1$ dimensional systems, or smeared BCFT. We present an obstruction of mass condensation for smeared BCFT analogous to the Lieb-Shultz-Mattis theorem for noninvertible symmetry. Related to the bulk topological degeneracies in $2+1$ dimensions and quantum phases in $1+1$ dimensions we construct a new series of BCFT. We also investigate the implications of the massless RG flow of $1+1$ dimensional CFT to $2+1$ dimensional topological order which corresponds to the earlier proposal by L. Kong and H. Zheng in [Nucl. Phys. B 966 (2021), 115384], arXiv:1912.01760 closely related to the integer-spin simple current by Schellekens and Gato-Rivera. We study the properties of the product of two CFTs connected by the two kinds of massless flows. The (mock) modular covariants appearing in the analysis seem to contain new ones. By applying the folding trick to the coupled model, we provide a general method to solve the gapped and charged domain wall. One can obtain the general phenomenology of the transportation of anyons through the domain wall. Our work gives a unified direction for the future theoretical and numerical studies of the topological phase based on the established data of classifications of conformal field theories or modular invariants.</description>

Abstract: We compute the renormalized charge current for a massless, minimally coupled, charged quantum scalar field on a charged Reissner-Nordstrom black hole space-time, using the method of pragmatic mode-sum renormalization. Since the field exhibits superradiance, we consider the past Unruh, Boulware and Candelas-Chrzanowski-Howard states, and study how the renormalized current in these states depends on the charges of the black hole and scalar field. We also study the backreaction of the charge current on the electromagnetic field.</description>

      <title>The Ising model as a window on quantum gravity with matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19015v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We argue that the Ising model CFT can be used to obtain some clear insights into 3D (quantum) gravity with matter. We review arguments for the existence of its holographic description, and concentrate on the time dependence of perturbations of the theory at high temperature, which would correspond to throwing matter into a black hole in the dual picture. Apart from an expected QNM-like exponential damping, we observe a plateau, a burst and a subsequent re-emergence of the whole signal, the latter being apparently at odds with a black hole interpretation. We provide an explanation of this phenomenon in terms of the properties of bulk matter fields interacting with the BTZ black hole and the fact that the geometry/metric is not fundamental but a derived quantity in the Chern-Simons formulation of 3D gravity. This allows for evading the black hole information paradox in the present context.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02079v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In dimensional regularization with $D=D_0-2\epsilon$, the minimal subtraction (MS) scheme is characterized by counterterms that only consist of singular terms in $\epsilon$. We develop a general method to compute the infinite sums of massless ladder or rainbow Feynman integrals in MS at $D_0$. Our method is based on relating the MS-solution to a kinematic solution at a coupling-dependent renormalization point. If the $\epsilon$-dependent Mellin transform of the kernel diagram of the insertions can be computed in closed form, we typically obtain a closed form expression for the all-order solution in MS. As examples, we consider Yukawa theory and $\phi^4$ theory in $D_0=4$, and $\phi^3$ theory in $D_0=6$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09997v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This review explores recent advances in the theory of $T\bar{T}$ deformation, an irrelevant yet solvable deformation of quantum field theories defined via the quadratic form of the energy-momentum tensor. It addresses classical and quantum aspects, highlighting significant developments across various fields, including field theory, holography, and string theory. Classically, $T\bar{T}$ deformation manifests through multiple geometric interpretations, notably random geometry, Jackiw-Teitelboim-like gravity, and uniform light-cone gauge frameworks. For quantum aspects, the deformation introduces notable features such as non-locality, UV-IR mixing, solvable renormalization structures, and intriguing modifications to correlation functions and entanglement properties. Furthermore, the paper examines the profound relationship between $T\bar{T}$ deformation and holography, particularly within the mixed boundary conditions/cutoff AdS holography proposal and holographic entanglement entropy. Connections to string theory through single-trace deformations and their holographic duals further reveal the deformed structure of the worldsheet. This review synthesizes recent developments and outlines potential directions for future research in the study of $T\bar{T}$-like deformation.</description>

Abstract: This study investigates the asymptotic symmetry algebras (ASA) of Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity within the framework of sl(3,R) symmetry. By explicitly constructing this algebra,
  we explore how the presence of the dilaton field influences the structure of asymptotic symmetries and symmetry breaking mechanisms at the AdS(2) boundary. For the sl(3,R) model, the
  dilaton field preserves a subset of the complete W(3)-symmetry, restricting the algebra to sl(3,R). These results provide deeper insights into the role of dilaton dynamics
  in holographic dualities, with implications for the thermodynamics and geometry of AdS(2). The findings pave the way for systematically exploring extended gauge symmetries in
  two-dimensional gravity and their relevance to higher-rank Lie algebras.</description>

Abstract: We present an expanding, spatially flat ($k=0$) FLRW quantum spacetime with a Big Bang, considered as a background in Yang-Mills matrix models. The FLRW geometry emerges in the semi-classical limit as a projection from the fuzzy hyperboloid. We analyze the propagation of scalar fields, and demonstrate that their Feynman propagator resembles the Minkowski space Feynman propagator in the semi-classical regime. Moreover, the higher spin modes predicted by the matrix model are described explicitly. These results are compared to recent results on $k=-1$ FLRW quantum spacetimes with a Big Bounce.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10319v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider mixed gluon-graviton scattering in Type IIB string theory on AdS$_5\times S^5/\mathbb{Z}_2$ in the presence of D7 branes, which is dual to a mixed correlator of the $SO(8)$ and $SU(2)_L$ flavor multiplets of a certain 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ $USp(2N)$ gauge theory with complexified coupling $\tau$. We compute this holographic correlator in the large $N$ and finite $\tau$ expansion using constraints from derivatives of the mass deformed sphere free energy, which we compute using supersymmetric localization at large $N$ and finite $\tau$ in terms of modular invariant non-holomorphic Eisenstein series. In particular, we combine this constraint with the known flat space limit to fix the $R^2F^2$ higher derivative correction to the correlator in terms of the weight one non-holomorphic Eisenstein series, and also to fix the logarithmic threshold. We also compute the one-loop correction to the correlator, and match it to the expected flat space limit result.</description>

      <title>Ryu-Takayanagi Formula for Multi-Boundary Black Holes from 2D Large-$\textbf{$c$}$ CFT Ensemble</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12388v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a class of quantum states involving multiple entangled CFTs in AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$, associated with multi-boundary black hole geometries, and demonstrate that the Ryu-Takayanagi (RT) formula for entanglement entropy can be derived using only boundary CFT data. Approximating the OPE coefficients by their Gaussian moments within the 2D large-$c$ CFT ensemble, we show that both the norm of the states and the entanglement entropies associated with various bipartitions--reproducing the expected bulk dual results--can be computed purely from the CFT. All $\textit{macroscopic geometric}$ structures arising from gravitational saddles emerge entirely from the universal statistical moments of the $\textit{microscopic algebraic}$ CFT data, revealing a statistical-mechanical mechanism underlying semiclassical gravity. We establish a precise correspondence between the CFT norm, the Liouville partition function with ZZ boundary conditions, and the exact gravitational path integral over 3D multi-boundary black hole geometries. For entanglement entropy, each RT phase arises from a distinct leading-order Gaussian contraction, with phase transitions--analogous to replica wormholes--emerging naturally from varying dominant statistical patterns in the CFT ensemble. Our derivation elucidates how the general mechanism behind holographic entropy, namely a boundary replica direction that elongates and becomes contractible in the bulk dual, is encoded explicitly in the statistical structure of the CFT data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16984v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the global structure of the states becoming light at perturbative limits of 4d $\mathcal{N}=1$ string and M-theory compactifications, identifying the different duality frames that emerge asymptotically and how they fit together in moduli space. These limits are characterized by the presence of EFT strings - a special class of axionic BPS strings whose tension, derived from the IR K\"ahler potential, vanishes in Planck units at infinite field distance. An intriguing integer scaling relation, $m \sim \mathcal{T}^w$ with $w = \{1,2,3\}$ in Planck units, connects the tension $\mathcal{T}$ of these strings to the mass scale $m$ of the leading tower of states along the string flow. We show that this relation also holds for the subleading towers below the species scale that generate the tower convex hull, implying that their associated $\vec\zeta = -\vec{\nabla} \log m$ vectors lie in a lattice generated by those of the EFT strings. This reveals a striking UV/IR interplay and offers organizing principles for the parametric hierarchies among the relevant UV scales in a given perturbative limit and the web of dualities governing 4d string vacua.</description>

      <title>Minimal Factorization of Chern-Simons Theory -- Gravitational Anyonic Edge Modes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00501v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One approach to analyzing entanglement in a gauge theory is embedding it into a factorized theory with edge modes on the entangling boundary. For topological quantum field theories (TQFT), this naturally leads to factorizing a TQFT by adding local edge modes associated with the corresponding CFT. In this work, we instead construct a minimal set of edge modes compatible with the topological invariance of Chern-Simons theory. This leads us to propose a minimal factorization map. These minimal edge modes can be interpreted as the degrees of freedom of a particle on a quantum group. Of particular interest is three-dimensional gravity as a Chern-Simons theory with gauge group SL$(2,\mathbb{R}) \times$ SL$(2,\mathbb{R})$. Our minimal factorization proposal uniquely gives rise to quantum group edge modes factorizing the bulk state space of 3d gravity. This agrees with earlier proposals that relate the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy in 3d gravity to topological entanglement entropy.</description>

      <title>Interacting massive/massless continuous-spin fields and integer-spin fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02817v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the framework of light-cone gauge approach, interacting continuous-spin fields and integer-spin fields propagating in flat space are studied. The continuous-spin fields are considered by using a light-cone gauge vector superspace formulation. Description of massive continuous-spin fields associated with the principal, complementary and discrete series is presented. For the massive continuous-spin fields of the principal and complementary series and massless continuous-spin fields, all parity-even cubic vertices realized as functions on the light-cone gauge vector superspace are obtained. Cubic vertices for a cross-interaction of massive/massless continuous spin fields and massive/massless integer-spin fields are also derived. The use of the light-cone gauge vector superspace formulation considerably simplifies the cubic vertices as compared to the ones of oscillator formulation. Some cubic vertices realized as distributions are also found. Map between the oscillator formulation and the vector superspace formulation of the continuous-spin fields is explicitly described. An equivalence of the light-cone gauge and Lorentz covariant formulations of the continuous-spin fields is also demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Bouncing cosmology and dynamical analysis of stability with non-minimal kinetic coupled gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05130v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we model the bounce phase, stability, and the reconstruction of the universe by non-minimal kinetic coupling. In the process, we obtained importance information about the energy density and the matter pressure of the universe in relation to the previous universe through the bounce quantum phase. The novelty of the work is that the scale factor is obtained directly from the model and is fitted with an exponential function, with this view we explore the process of the early universe even the bounce phase. After that, we plot the cosmological parameters in terms of time evolution. In what follows, we investigate the stability of the model by dynamical system analysis in a phase plane. Finally, we examine the stability of the universe, especially in the inflationary period, by using the phase-space trajectories.</description>

      <title>Particle exchange statistics beyond fermions and bosons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.05203v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is commonly believed that there are only two types of particle exchange statistics in quantum mechanics, fermions and bosons, with the exception of anyons in two dimension. In principle, a second exception known as parastatistics, which extends outside of two dimensions, has been considered but was believed to be physically equivalent to fermions and bosons. In this paper we show that nontrivial parastatistics inequivalent to either fermions or bosons can exist in physical systems. These new types of identical particles obey generalized exclusion principles, leading to exotic free-particle thermodynamics distinct from any system of free fermions and bosons. We formulate our theory by developing a second quantization of paraparticles, which naturally includes exactly solvable non-interacting theories, and incorporates physical constraints such as locality. We then construct a family of exactly solvable quantum spin models in one and two dimensions where free paraparticles emerge as quasiparticle excitations, and their exchange statistics can be physically observed and is notably distinct from fermions and bosons. This demonstrates the possibility of a new type of quasiparticle in condensed matter systems, and, more speculatively, the potential for previously unconsidered types of elementary particles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.12176v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss a universal relation that we call the $x-y$ swap relation, which plays a prominent role in the theory of topological recursion, Hurwitz theory, and free probability theory. We describe in a very precise and detailed way the interaction of the $x-y$ swap relation and KP integrability. As an application, we prove a recent conjecture that relates some particular instances of topological recursion to the Mironov-Morozov-Semenoff matrix integrals.</description>

      <title>Particle production in HRG with thermodynamically consistent EoS and partially deformable hadrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11752v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the present work, we analyze several strange as well as non-strange relative hadronic yields obtained in the ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions (URHIC) experiments over a wide range of center-of-mass collision energy ($\sqrt{s_{NN}}$). We invoke the formation of a hot and dense hadronic resonance gas (HRG) in the final stage following the URHIC. We use an earlier proposed thermodynamically consistent approach for obtaining the equation of state (EoS) of a HRG. It takes into account an important aspect of the hadronic interaction, viz., the hadronic hard-core repulsion, by assigning hard-core volumes to the hadrons, leading to an excluded volume (EV) type effect. We have invoked the bag model approach to assign hard-core volumes to baryons (antibaryons) while treating mesons to be point particles. We employ ansatz to obtain the dependence of the temperature (\textit{T}) and baryon chemical potential (BCP) of HRG system on the center-of-mass energy in URHIC. We also find strong evidence of a double freeze-out scenario, corresponding to baryons (antibaryons) and mesons, respectively. Strangeness (anti-strangeness) imbalance factor is also seen to play an important role in explaining the ratio of strange hadrons to the non-strange ones. The HRG model can explain the experimental data on various relative hadronic multiplicities quite satisfactorily over a wide range of $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$, ranging from the lowest RHIC energies to the highest LHC energies using one set of model parameters by obtaining the best theoretical fits to the experimental data using the minimum $\chi^{2}$/dof method.</description>

      <title>Third-Order Perturbative OTOC of the Harmonic Oscillator with Quartic Interaction and Quantum Chaos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17500v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We calculate the third-order out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC) of a simple harmonic oscillator with an additional quartic interaction using the second quantization method. We obtain analytic relations for the spectrum, Fock space states, and matrix elements of the coordinate, which are then used to numerically evaluate the OTOC. We observe that after the scrambling, the OTOC becomes a fluctuation around a saturation point at later times, which is associated with quantum chaotic behavior in systems that exhibit chaos. We analyze the early-time properties of the OTOC and find that in systems with sufficiently strong quartic interactions, an exponential growth curve fitting over a long time window clearly emerges in the third-order perturbation</description>

Abstract: We use the theory of $x-y$ duality to propose a new definition / construction for the correlation differentials of topological recursion; we call it "generalized topological recursion". This new definition coincides with the original topological recursion of Chekhov-Eynard-Orantin in the regular case and allows, in particular, to get meaningful answers in a variety of irregular and degenerate situations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02724v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a symmetry-based approach to constructing lattice models for chiral topological phases, focusing on non-Abelian anyons. Using a 2+1D version of anyon chains and modular tensor categories(MTCs), we ensure exact MTC symmetry at the microscopic level. Numerical simulations using tensor networks demonstrate chiral edge modes for topological phases with Ising and Fibonacci anyons. Our method contrasts with conventional solvability approaches, providing a new theoretical avenue to explore strongly coupled 2+1D systems, revealing chiral edge states in non-Abelian anyonic systems.</description>

      <title>A note on the deformation of 1D ferromagnetic domain walls due to double exchange interaction with a free electron gas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16638v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using an S-matrix formulation we evaluate the thermodynamic potential and conductance of a Bloch or N\'eel magnetic wall interacting with a one dimensional free electron gas via a double exchange interaction. The minimization of the elastic magnetic energy plus electronic thermodynamic potential indicates that for chemical potential larger than the magnetic interaction the domain wall is generally deformed to a thin wall, while for magnetic interaction larger than the chemical potential tends towards wide walls. In contrast, for a double wall configuration the deformation is always towards wide walls. For the single as well as the double magnetic wall configurations the conductance monotonically decreases with decreasing wall width. The thermodynamic potential and conductance of Bloch and N\'eel magnetic domain walls are identical within this prototype model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08114v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work investigates the evaporation of black holes immersed in a de Sitter environment, using the Vaidya-de Sitter spacetime to model the process. The role of cosmological observers is highlighted in the development and Hayward thermodynamics for non stationary geometries is employed in the description of the compact objects. Results of the proposed dynamical model are compared with the usual description based on stationary geometries, with specific results for primordial black holes (PBHs). The timescale of evaporation is shown to depend significantly on the choice of cosmological observer, and may differ substantially from predictions based on stationary models in later times. Deviations are also shown with respect to the standard assertion that there is a fixed initial mass just below $10^{15} \, \text{g} \sim 10^{-18} M_\odot$ for the PBHs which are ending their evaporation process today.</description>

      <title>Chaotic-Integrable Transition for Disordered Orbital Hatsugai-Kohmoto Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08496v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have drawn connections between the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model and the multi-orbit Hatsugai-Kohmoto model, emphasizing their similarities and differences regarding chaotic behaviors. The features of the spectral form factor, such as the dip-ramp-plateau structure and the adjacent gap ratio, indicate chaos in the disordered orbital Hatsugai-Kohmoto model. One significant conclusion is that the plateau value of the out-of-time-order correlator, whether in the Hatsugai-Kohmoto model, Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model with two- or four-body interactions, or a disorder-free Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model, does not effectively differentiate between integrable and chaotic phases in many-body systems. This observation suggests a limitation in using out-of-time-order correlator plateau values as a diagnostic tool for chaos. Our exploration of these ideas provides a deeper understanding of how chaos arises in non-Fermi liquid systems and the tools we use to study it. It opens the door to further questions, particularly about whether there are more effective ways to distinguish between chaotic and integrable phases in these complex systems.</description>

      <title>Periodical orbits and waveforms with spontaneous Lorentz symmetry-breaking in Kalb-Ramond gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00769v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study time-like geodesics around a spherically symmetric black hole in Kalb-Ramond (KR) gravity, characterized by the parameter $l$, which induces spontaneous Lorentz symmetry breaking. The geodesic equations and effective potential are derived to investigate the influence of $l$. We calculate the marginally bound orbits and innermost stable circular orbits, analyzing the parameter's impact. Periodic orbits are computed numerically and classified within the standard taxonomy, revealing significant effects of $l$ on their momentum and energy. Additionally, we explore an extreme mass ratio inspiral system under the adiabatic approximation to derive gravitational waveforms emitted by an object orbiting a supermassive black hole in KR gravity. These waveforms reflect the distinctive characteristics of periodic orbits and highlight the influence of $l$. With advancements in gravitational wave detection, these results offer insights into black holes influenced by Lorentz symmetry-breaking fields.</description>

      <title>Experimental signatures of Kalb-Ramond-like particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09836v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyse phenomenological signatures of Kalb-Ramond-like particles, described by an antisymmetric rank-2 tensor, when coupled to fermionic matter. The latter is modelled by a tensor current coupled directly to the Kalb-Ramond field or by a pseudovector current coupled to the rank-1 dual of the field-strength tensor. We obtain limits on the coupling constants to fermions and mass of the Kalb-Ramond-like particles by investigating their impact on the hyperfine splittings of hydrogen, the tree-level unitarity of the $S$ matrix for $e^- + e^+ \rightarrow \ell^- + \ell^+$ scattering with $\ell \neq e$ and the differential cross section for Bhabha scattering. Assuming that the couplings to fermions are independent of the fermion species, the strongest 95\%-CL bounds we find are from LEP data at $\sqrt{s} = 136.23$~GeV, namely $g_{\rm PV}/\Lambda \lesssim 6.3 \times 10^{-13} \, {\rm eV}^{-1}$ and $g_{\rm T} \lesssim 1.3 \times 10^{-12} \left( m/{\rm eV} \right)$, both for $m \ll \sqrt{s}$ (here $\Lambda$ is a characteristic energy scale). These limits can be improved in upcoming lepton colliders due to enhanced precision, as well as higher energies.</description>

      <title>Conservation of superhorizon curvature perturbations at one loop: Backreaction in the in-in formalism and Renormalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08707v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the superhorizon-limit curvature perturbations are conserved at one-loop level in single-field inflation models with a transient non-slow-roll period. We take the spatially-flat gauge, where the backreaction plays a crucial role for the conservation of superhorizon curvature perturbations unless the counter terms are tuned. We calculate the backreaction with the in-in formalism. In addition, we explicitly show the renormalization of the UV divergences with the counter terms.</description>

      <title>Probing a Scalar Dark Matter Component via Stellar Light Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16588v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a recent work [Phys. Rev. D 110, 023520 (2024)], a baryogenesis scenario was proposed in which our visible Universe is a 3-brane coevolving with a hidden 3-brane in a multidimensional bulk, giving rise to a new pseudo-scalar boson. In the present paper, one shows that this boson may survive as a relic from the early Universe, forming a minor component of dark matter. Remarkably, a one-loop process enables an ultra-weak yet non-zero coupling to photons, leading to a distinctive scattering signature. One explores this effect and argues that subtle light scattering around blue giant stars could provide observational constraints on the boson's properties, thereby testing the underlying baryogenesis scenario with current and future observation instruments.</description>

      <title>Kerr-Newman quasinormal modes and Seiberg-Witten theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17488v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It was recently suggested the quasinormal-mode spectrum of black holes is related to a class of four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=2$ super Yang-Mills theories described by Seiberg-Witten curves, a proposal that has been tested for a number of black hole spacetimes. The aim of this study is to clarify the key ideas of this conjecture to a non-high-energy-physics audience and test it in a setting that has not yet been explored: the electromagnetic and gravitational perturbations of Kerr-Newman black holes in the Dudley-Finley approximation. In the parameter space we explore, we find numerical evidence that the conjecture is valid for subextremal black holes and its slowest damped quasinormal frequencies, thereby providing further support for the conjecture's validity. In addition, we exploit the symmetries of the four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=2$ super Yang-Mills theory to obtain a strikingly simple isospectral version of the radial Dudley-Finley equation.</description>

      <title>Black holes surrounded by massive vector fields in Kaluza-Klein gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00678v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an exact black hole solution surrounded by massive vector fields predicted by Kaluza-Klein (KK) gravity. KK gravity in four dimensions (4D) is of particular interest, as it predicts a tower of particle states, including gravitons with spin-0 and spin-1 components, in addition to the massless spin-2 gravitons of general relativity. The extra degrees of freedom in the gravitational sector modify the law of gravity, allowing the theory to explain the effects attributed to dark matter in the universe. In this paper, we construct a black hole solution surrounded by massive spin-1 gravitons within KK theory. In addition to the influence of the massive vector fields, we incorporate an interaction term between the black hole and the massive vector field. The black hole solution is affected by the mass of the spin-1 graviton and an additional parameter that encodes corrections to Newton's constant, as well as the coupling between the massive vector field and the black hole mass. We find that the coupling between the massive vector field and the black hole mimics the effect of an electric charge. To this end, we investigate the accretion disk, quasinormal modes (QNMs), and the stability of the black hole spacetime. Finally, we use Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations of Sgr A* to constrain the black hole parameters.</description>

      <title>Elementary atoms in spaces of constant curvature by the Nikiforov-Uvarov method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07150v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Nikiforov-Uvarov method is a simple, yet elegant and powerful method for solving second-order differential equations of generalized hypergeometric type. In the past, it has been used to solve many problems in quantum mechanics and elsewhere. We apply this method to the classical problem of hydrogen-like atoms in spaces of constant curvature. Both the spectra of these atoms and their wave functions, including normalization, are easily obtained.</description>

      <title>Thawing quintessence and transient cosmic acceleration in light of DESI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16337v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent analysis of the DESI Collaboration challenges the $\Lambda$-Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model, suggesting evidence for a dynamic dark energy. These results are obtained in the context of generic parameterizations of the dark energy equation of state (EoS), which better fit the data when they exhibit an unphysical phantom behavior in the past. In this paper, we briefly analyze how ambiguous this latter conclusion can be in light of the background degeneracy between EoS parameterizations and minimally coupled quintessence scenarios. We then investigate whether the current observational data can be accommodated with a non-phantom, thawing dark energy EoS, typical of a broad class of quintessence models. We show that the thawing behavior of this EoS outperforms the CPL parameterization and is statistically competitive with $\Lambda$CDM while predicting cosmic acceleration as a transient phenomenon. Such a dynamic behavior aligns with theoretical arguments from string theory and offers a way out of the trans-Planckian problem that challenges the ever-accelerated $\Lambda$CDM paradigm.</description>

      <title>Phonons mimicking doubly special relativity kinematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02026v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Collective excitations (phonons) in barotropic, irrotational, inviscid fluids exhibit an effective Lorentz invariance, where the sound speed plays the role of the invariant speed of light in special relativity. By carefully selecting the interaction potentials, we explicitly construct two hydrodynamic models in which phonons obey doubly special relativistic kinematics, with the analogue Planck scale emerging from non-Newtonian behaviour at high energies. Specifically, we demonstrate that elastic storage leads to an approximate realization of Amelino-Camelia's scenario, while the Magueijo-Smolin model naturally emerges in the presence of elastic restoring forces.</description>

      <title>A review of applications of Quantum Energy Teleportation: from experimental tests to thermodynamics and spacetime engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04689v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum energy teleportation (QET) exploits the existence of correlations to enable remote energy transfer without the need for physical energy carriers between emitter and receiver. This paper presents a review of the thermodynamic foundations of QET and reviews its first experimental demonstration (performed using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance), along with its implementation on publicly available superconducting quantum hardware. Additionally, we review an application of QET in the field of quantum thermodynamics as an efficient algorithmic cooling technique to cool down individual parts of interacting systems. Finally, we will review how QET can be employed to optimally generate exotic quantum states characterized by negative average stress-energy densities, offering a new operational approach to engineering such states which are promising in the context of semiclassical gravity.</description>
