      <title>Intrinsic Chern Half-Metal with High Anomalous Hall Conductivity in 2D BaNiCl$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) half-metals offer complete spin polarization at the Fermi level, making them candidates for dissipationless spin transport. Yet intrinsic 2D half-metals exhibiting robust topological features, particularly large Chern number anomalous Hall conductivities, remain exceptionally rare. Using first-principles calculations, we identify atomically thin BaNiCl$_3$, a layered halide perovskite (perovskene), as a topological half-metal. It exhibits a high Chern number ($C \ge 2$), a large anomalous Hall conductivity of 316~$\Omega^{-1},\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$, and a Fermi velocity of $\approx 0.78 \times 10^6$ m/s. The coexistence of complete spin polarization and high carrier velocity suggests low-dissipation spin transport. Spin-orbit coupling opens a sizable topological gap of $\sim 20\,$ meV, yielding nontrivial Berry curvature and enhancing the anomalous Hall response. Ferromagnetism is stabilized by the Ni$^{2+}$ ($d^8$) configuration and Cl-mediated superexchange, supporting magnetic ordering at elevated temperatures. These results establish BaNiCl$_3$ as a rare intrinsic Chern half-metal, with potential applications in quantum and spintronic technologies.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity enhancement of an anomalous Hall effect magnetic sensor by means of second-order magnetic anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sensing performance of anomalous Hall effect (AHE) magnetic sensors is investigated in terms of their sensitivity, the power spectrum of their voltage noise, and their detectivity. Special attention is paid to the effect of the second-order anisotropy constant, K2, on the sensing performance. It is found that the sensitivity is strongly enhanced by tuning the value of K2 close to the boundary between the in-plane magnetized state and the conically magnetized state. It is also found that the detectivity is almost independent of K2 as long as the film is in-plane magnetized. These results provide fundamental insights into the design of high-performance AHE sensors.</description>

      <title>Current-induced Dynamics of Bloch Domain-wall Bimerons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Domain-wall bimerons are composite topological structures formed by embedding bimerons within domain walls in ferromagnets with in-plane anisotropy. These hybrid textures have recently attracted significant attention due to their promise for racetrack memory applications. In this work, we systematically investigate the current-driven dynamics of single domain-wall bimerons and bimeron chains under spin-transfer torque (STT) and spin-orbit torque (SOT). We show that when the spin current is injected or polarized perpendicular to the domain wall, the bimeron Hall effect facilitates efficient motion along the wall. In contrast, spin currents injected or polarized parallel to the wall suppress transverse motion, leading to a significant reduction in the bimeron Hall angle. This anisotropic response is observed for both STT and SOT driving mechanisms. Furthermore, we find that increasing the number of bimerons within a domain wall diminishes their collective mobility. These results provide key insights into domain-wall bimeron dynamics and offer guidance for their integration into bimeron-based spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Chirality-selective proximity effect between chiral $p$-wave superconductors and quantum Hall insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heterostructures of superconductors and quantum-Hall insulators are promising platforms of topological quantum computation. However, these two systems are incompatible in some aspects such as a strong magnetic field, the Meissner effect, and chirality. In this work, we address the condition that the superconducting proximity effect works in the bulk of quantum Hall states, and identify an essential role played by the vortex lattice regardless of pairing symmetry. We extend this finding to a heterostructure of a chiral $p$-wave superconductor in the mixed state and an integer quantum Hall insulator. The proximity effect works selectively in the lowest Landau level depending on relative chiralities. If the chiralities align, a topological phase transition to a topological superconductor occurs.</description>

      <title>Snakes in the Plane: Controllable Gliders in a Nanomagnetic Metamaterial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetic metamaterials known as Artificial Spin Ice (ASI) are promising candidates for neuromorphic computing, composed of vast numbers of interacting nanomagnets arranged in the plane. Every computing device requires the ability to transform, transmit and store information. While ASI excel at data transformation, reliable transmission and storage has proven difficult to achieve. Here, we take inspiration from the Cellular Automaton (CA), an abstract computing model reminiscent of ASI. In CAs, information transmission and storage can be realised by the ``glider'', a simple structure capable of propagating while maintaining its form. Employing an evolutionary algorithm, we search for gliders in pinwheel ASI and present the simplest glider discovered: the ``snake''. Driven by a global field protocol, the snake moves strictly in one direction, determined by its orientation. We demonstrate the snake, both in simulation and experimentally, and analyse the mechanism behind its motion. The snake provides a means of manipulating a magnetic texture in an ASI with resolution on the order of 100 nm, which could in turn be utilised to precisely control other magnetic phenomena. The integration of data transmission, storage and modification into the same magnetic substrate unlocks the potential for ultra-low power computing devices.</description>

      <title>Multi Moire Networks in Engineered Lateral Hetero-Bilayers: Programmable Phononic Reconfiguration and Second Harmonic Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moire engineering in two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides enables access to correlated quantum phenomena. Realizing such effects demands simultaneous control over twist angle and material composition to modulate phonons, excitons, and their interactions. However, most studies rely on exfoliated flakes, limiting scalability and systematic exploration. Here, we demonstrate a scalable multi-moire network by vertically stacking CVD-grown monolayer lateral heterostructures. Signatures of moire non-rigidity, including phonon frequency softening, linewidth broadening, and strain localization, are attributed to two lattice relaxation modes; rotational reconstruction and volumetric dilation. Micro-angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy reveals that interfacial orbital interactions modulate interlayer coupling. At aligned angles, molybdenum diselenides exhibit reduced valley polarization and Davydov splitting, indicating strain-induced symmetry breaking and chiral phonon effects. Notably, SHG modulation was obderved with variation in twist angle due to lower coherence and band-offset-driven phase delay. First-principles calculations support these findings. This work provides a route to programmable, scalable multi-moire platforms for opto-straintronics, quantum sensing, and on-chip photonics.</description>

      <title>Specular-Andreev reflection and Andreev interference in an Ising superconductor junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Being resilient to magnetic field, Ising superconductor serves as an exceptional platform for studying the interplay between superconductivity and magnetism. In this Letter, we first explore the transport properties of a two-terminal graphene-Ising superconductor junction where mirage gaps are induced in the superconductor by an exchange field due to magnetic proximity effect. We demonstrate that the chemical potential range of graphene supporting specular-Andreev reflection at the interface is between the two mirage gaps and about twice the Ising spin-orbit coupling strength. This enhances the resilience of observing specular-Andreev reflection against graphene potential fluctuations in experiments. We further study the Andreev interference effect based on a four-terminal junction of which two terminals consist of Ising superconductors in the presence of exchange fields. Due to the finite contribution from the spin-triplet pairing, the interference can be modulated by tuning the relative orientation of the exchange fields in addition to the traditional scheme by changing superconducting phase difference and the chemical potential of the normal region.</description>

      <title>Quasiparticle-induced decoherence of a driven superconducting qubit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a theory for two quasiparticle-induced decoherence mechanisms of a driven superconducting qubit. In the first mechanism, an existing quasiparticle (QP) tunnels across the qubit's Josephson junction while simultaneously absorbing a qubit excitation and one (or several) photons from the drive. In the second mechanism, a qubit transition occurs during the non-linear absorption process converting multiple drive quanta into a pair of new QPs. Both mechanisms can remain significant in gap engineered qubits whose coherence is insensitive to QPs without the drive. Our theory establishes a fundamental limitation on fidelity of the microwave qubit operations, such as readout and gates, stemming from QPs.</description>

      <title>Theory of Quasiparticle Generation by Microwave Drives in Superconducting Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microwave drives are commonly employed to control superconducting quantum circuits, enabling qubit gates, readout, and parametric interactions. As the drive frequencies are typically an order of magnitude smaller than (twice) the superconducting gap, it is generally assumed that such drives do not disturb the BCS ground state. However, sufficiently strong drives can activate multi-photon pair-breaking processes that generate quasiparticles and result in qubit errors. In this work, we present a theoretical framework for calculating the rates of multi-photon-assisted pair-breaking transitions induced by both charge- and flux-coupled microwave drives. Through illustrative examples, we show that drive-induced QP generation may impact novel high-frequency dispersive readout architectures, as well as Floquet-engineered superconducting circuits operating under strong driving conditions.</description>

      <title>In-Situ Growth and Ionic Switching Behavior of Single-Crystalline Silver Iodide Nanoflakes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Silver iodide (AgI) is a prototypical superionic conductor, undergoing a first-order phase transition at 147 Celsius that enables rapid ionic transport through its lattice, making it attractive for solid-state ionic devices. However, due to the presence of mobile Ag ions, controlled chemical vapor deposition (CVD) synthesis of high-quality AgI single crystals has remained largely unexplored. Here, we present the controllable synthesis of thin, single-crystalline {\beta}-AgI nanoflakes using a home-built CVD setup with real-time optical observation capability, offering insights into their nucleation and growth dynamics. We evaluate the material's environmental stability through temperature-dependent photodegradation and Ag nanoparticle formation induced by electron beam irradiation. Electrical measurements on two-terminal devices with silver contacts demonstrate a remarkable six-order-of-magnitude resistance drop in lateral configurations at elevated temperatures, indicative of switchable ionic conductivity. Additionally, vertical device architectures exhibit clear memristive (resistive switching) characteristics, likely due to the formation of conductive filaments. Our work addresses the key synthesis challenges and highlights the unique electrical properties of thin AgI single crystals, suggesting its potential for innovative devices in unconventional computing, data storage, and advanced neuromorphic systems.</description>

      <title>Direct evidence for two-gap superconductivity in hydrogen-intercalated titanium diselenide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) offer an extremely rich material platform in the exploration of unconventional superconductivity. The unconventional aspects include exotic coupling mechanisms such as the Ising pairing, a complex interplay with other electronic orders such as charge-density waves (CDWs), symmetry-breaking and topological effects, and non-trivial gap structures such as multi-gap and possible nodal phases. Among TMDs, titanium diselenide (1$T$-TiSe$_2$) is one of the most studied and debated cases. Hints to an anomalous structure of its superconducting order parameter have emerged over the years, possibly linked to its spatial texturing in real and reciprocal space due to the presence of a 2$\times$2$\times$2 CDW phase, or to a pressure-driven multi-band Fermi surface. However, a direct evidence for a non-trivial structure of the superconducting gap in this material is still lacking. In this work, we bring the first evidence for a two-gap structure in the recently-discovered H-intercalated TiSe$_2$ superconductor (with T$_c \simeq 3.6$ K) by an extensive experimental study that combines magnetotransport measurements, point-contact spectroscopy and scanning tunnel spectroscopy. We show that the temperature dependence of the upper critical field (for $\vec B \parallel c$) as well as the shape of the point-contact and tunneling spectra strongly suggest the existence of two distinct superconducting gaps, and can indeed all be fitted in a self-consistent way with the same gap amplitudes $\Delta_1 = 0.26 \pm 0.12$ meV and $\Delta_2 =0.62 \pm 0.18$ meV.</description>

      <title>Tunable resonant Raman scattering with temperature in vertically aligned 2H-SnS2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional semiconducting materials have a wide range of applications in various fields due to their excellent properties and rich physics. Here, we report a detailed investigation of the temperature dependent Raman and Photoluminescence measurements on the vertically aligned 2H-SnS2 grown by CVD method. Our results established the tunability of the resonant Raman scattering with varying temperature, i.e. a crossover between resonance and non-resonance conditions for the current system. We also discussed the temperature as well as laser power dependence of the low frequency asymmetric Raman mode which is interlayer shear mode. Temperature dependence of the intensity of the phonon modes also manifests the tunability of the resonant Raman scattering with temperature. Our temperature dependent Photoluminescence measurement shows the strong temperature dependence of the excitonic peaks which is confirmed with laser power dependence of the Photoluminescence measurement at room temperature. Our investigation may help to design and fabricate devices based on vertically aligned 2H-SnS2 and other similar materials in future.</description>

      <title>Topology-induced symmetry breaking demonstrated in antiferromagnetic magnons on a M\"obius strip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07846v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a mechanism of topology-induced symmetry breaking, where certain local symmetry preserved by the Hamiltonian is explicitly broken in the eigenmodes of excitation due to nontrivial real-space topology. We demonstrate this phenomenon by studying magnonic excitations on a M\"obius strip comprising of two antiferromagnetically coupled spin chains. Even with a simple Hamiltonian respecting local rotational symmetry and all local curvature effects ignored, magnons exhibit linear polarization of the N\'eel vector devoid of chirality, forming two non-degenerate branches that cannot be smoothly connected to or be globally decomposed by the circularly-polarized magnons. Correspondingly, one branch undergoes a spectral shift and only admits standing waves of half-integer wavelength, whereas the other only affords standing waves of integer wavelength. Under the M\"obius boundary condition, we further identify an exotic phase hosting spontaneous antiferromagnetic order whilst all exchange couplings are ferromagnetic. The suppression of chirality in the order parameter dynamics, hence the pattern of standing waves, can be generalized to other elementary excitations on non-orientable surfaces. Our findings showcase the profound influence of real-space topology on the physical nature of not just the ground state but also the quasiparticles.</description>

Abstract: Altermagnets are crystallographic rotational symmetry breaking spin-ordered states, possessing a net zero magnetization despite manifesting Kramer's non-degenerate bands. Here, we show that momentum-independent local spin nematic orders in monolayer, Bernal bilayer, and rhombohedral trilayer graphene give rise to $p$-wave, $d$-wave, and $f$-wave altermagnets, respectively, thereby inheriting the topology of linear, quadratic and cubic free fermion band dispersions that are also described in terms of angular momentum $\ell=1,\; 2$, and $3$ harmonics in the reciprocal space. The same conclusions also hold inside a spin-triplet nematic superconductor, featuring Majorana altermagnets. Altogether, these findings highlight the importance of electronic band structure in identifying such exotic magnetic orders in quantum materials. We depict the effects of in-plane magnetic fields on altermagnets, and propose spin-disordered alter-valley magnets in these systems.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by a recent experiment reporting the fractional quantum spin Hall effect in twisted ${\rm MoTe}_2$, we investigate microscopically the prospects of realizing exotic topologically ordered states beyond conventional quantum Hall physics. We show that a non-Abelian spin Hall insulator, a state of two copies of the non-Abelian Moore-Read state, can be stabilized at half filling of time-reversal conjugate Chern bands. We elucidate that the existence of this phase relies on the reduction of opposite-spin interactions at short distances to overcome the Ising ferromagnetism. Moreover, we demonstrate that band mixing provides a generic mechanism for this reduction to be achieved. Quite remarkably, we find that a renormalization of opposite-spin interactions at short distances as small as 15 % of the moir\'e period is sufficient for a direct transition to a completely spin unpolarized phase which supports the non-Abelian spin Hall insulator. Furthermore, we show that the non-Abelian spin Hall insulator can either break time-reversal symmetry or preserve it depending on the underlying topological order.</description>

      <title>Model-Based Iterative Reconstruction of Three-Dimensional Magnetisation in a Nanowire Structure Using Electron Holographic Vector Field Tomography</title>

Abstract: Methods for characterisation of 3D magnetic spin structures are necessary to advance the performance of 3D magnetic nanoscale technologies. However, as the component dimensions approach the nanometre range, it becomes more challenging to analyse 3D magnetic configurations with the appropriate spatial resolution. In this paper, we present a method based on Lorentz transmission electron microscopy in which model-based iterative reconstruction (MBIR) is used to reconstruct the most probable magnetisation in an exemplar nanostructure. This method is based on relating electron phase measurements to the magnetic configuration of the nanostructure, and therefore, the method is subject to certain limitations. In this proof-of-concept experiment, MBIR was tested on an L-shaped ferromagnetic cobalt nanowire, fabricated using focused electron beam induced deposition. Off-axis electron holography was used to acquire a tomographic tilt series of electron holograms, which were analysed to measure magnetic electron phase shift over two tilt arcs with up to $ \pm 60$ degree tilt range. Then, a 3D magnetisation vector field consistent with the tomographic phase measurements was reconstructed, revealing multiple magnetic domains within the nanowire. The reconstructed magnetisation is accurate for magnetic domains larger than 50 nm, and higher resolution can be achieved by the continued development of tomographic reconstruction algorithms.</description>

      <title>Stability of chiral magnon condensates in collinear antiferromagnetic insulators</title>

Abstract: Quasiequilibrium magnon Bose-Einstein condensates in ferromagnetic insulators have been a field of great interest, while condensation in antiferromagnetic systems has not yet been explored in detail. We analyze the stability of condensed chiral magnons in two antiferromagnetic insulators: a uniaxial easy-axis system and a biaxial system. We show that two-component magnon condensation and inter-magnon interactions are essential to create metastable magnon condensation. The uniaxial system with a Rashba-type Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction supports two degenerate condensate populations at finite wave vectors. We find that the condensation state in this model is (meta)stable only when the distribution of condensed magnons between the two populations is symmetric. In addition, we demonstrate the emergence of a zero-sound-like Goldstone mode in antiferromagnetic systems that support two-component magnon condensation. On the other hand, in the biaxial system without Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, we predict that the magnon condensate cannot stabilize due to the breaking of the magnon degeneracy. Our results suggest that this instability is a general characteristic of single-component quasiequilibrium quasiparticle condensates.</description>

      <title>Engineering Magnetotransport Through Hierarchical Symmetry in Weyl Semimetal Superlattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16512v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superlattice engineering is a powerful way to tune the transport properties of a material. In this work we show that magnetotransport can be modified by superlattices in 3D materials based on the relative symmetry between the Fermi-surface and superlattice. We demonstrate commensuration oscillations in the ballistic transport regime of a nanostructured 3D material with the Weyl semimetal NbP, a signature typically limited to superlattices in 2D materials. The behavior of the oscillations encodes information about the shared properties between the quasiparticles at the Fermi-surface--including their momentum, charge, mass, and rotational symmetry--and the structure of the superlattice. The magnetic field and temperature dependence of the commensuration oscillations enables us to extract the Fermi-momenta and quasiparticle mass at an order of magnitude lower magnetic field and higher temperature than Shubnikov-de Haas quantum oscillations. Furthermore, we use a chiral superlattice to engineer asymmetric longitudinal magnetoresistance based on the charge of the quasiparticles and superlattice enantiomer. These results demonstrate nanopatterned superlattices as an effective method for fermiology, and also point towards new ways of engineering quantum transport in these systems based on the mutual properties of the superlattice and Fermi-surface.</description>

      <title>Acoustic phonons, spin-phonon coupling and spin relaxation via the lattice reorientation mechanism in hexagonal germanium nanowires</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18198v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spin relaxation via electron-phonon interaction is an important decoherence mechanism for spin qubits. In this work, we study spin relaxation in hexagonal (2H) germanium, a novel direct-gap semiconductor showing great potential to combine highly coherent spin qubits with optical functionality. Focusing on electrostatically defined quantum dots in hexagonal germanium nanowires, we (i) identify geometries where spin qubit experiments are feasible, (ii) compute the nanowire phonon modes, and (iii) describe spin relaxation of hole spin qubits due to phonon-induced lattice reorientation, a direct spin-phonon coupling mechanism that is absent in cubic semiconductors typically used for spin qubits (GaAs, cubic Si, cubic Ge). We obtain the spin relaxation time as a function of nanowire cross section, quantum dot confinement length, and magnetic field. For realistic parameters, we find relaxation times above 10 ms, and reveal that the magnetic field direction maximizing the relaxation time depends on the qubit Larmor frequency. Our results facilitate the design of nanowire quantum dot experiments with long qubit relaxation times.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14747v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the possibility of quantum liquids that are compressible but have vanishing DC conductivity in the absence of disorder. We show that the composite Fermi liquid emerging from strong interaction in a generic Chern band has zero Drude weight, in stark contrast to normal Fermi liquids. Our work establishes the absence of Drude weight as the defining property of the composite Fermi liquid phase, which distinguishes it from the Fermi liquid or other types of non-Fermi liquids. Our findings point to a possibly wide class of gapless quantum phases with unexpected transport and optical properties.</description>

      <title>Anomalous radiation reaction in a circularly polarized field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07664v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum corrections to electron dynamics in a circularly polarized electromagnetic field are found within the Floquet theory of periodically driven quantum systems. It is demonstrated that emission of photons by an electron rotating under the field leads to the quantum recoil force acting on the electron perpendicularly to the velocity of its forward movement, which differs crucially from the known classical recoil force directed oppositely to the velocity. Physically, such an anomalous radiation reaction arises from the one-loop QED correction to the photon emission and has no analog within the classical electrodynamics. Possible manifestations of this phenomenon are discussed for electrons in strong laser fields.</description>

      <title>Topological phase transitions in superconductors with chiral symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19882v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study topological transitions in one dimensional superconductors that can harbor multiple edge Majorana bound states protected by chiral symmetry. The chiral symmetry arises due to the structure of the internal spin degrees of freedom of the superconductor and it can be guided by the coupling of the superconductor with sources of time-reversal symmetry breaking. We then consider distinct regions of the phase diagram in the parameters space that are marked by gapless excitations in the spectrum and evaluate the conditions for inducing a topological transition. We show that for gapless chiral symmetric superconductors one can identify a class of physical perturbations that enable a gap opening in the spectrum, without breaking chirality, and turn the system into a topological state. This type of superconductor is dubbed marginal topological superconductor because an infinitesimally small perturbation is able to induce a transition into a topological nontrivial phase. To explicitly demonstrate and evaluate the character of the transitions from gapless to topological gapfull phases we explore different physical cases including p-wave superconductor in the presence of an applied magnetic field or proximity-coupled to a ferromagnet, and s-wave superconductor in a noncollinear magnetic ordering.</description>
