      <title>Virtual Cylindrical PET for Efficient DOI Image Reconstruction with Sub-millimetre Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective: Image reconstruction in high resolution PET scanners with depth of interaction (DOI) capability is computationally challenging due to the high sampling in detector and image space. This study evaluates the use of a virtual cylinder to reduce the number of lines of response (LOR) for DOI-based reconstruction while maintaining uniform sub-millimetre spatial resolution. Approach: Virtual geometry was investigated using the awake animal mousePET as a test case. Using GATE, we simulated the physical scanner and three virtual cylinder implementations with detector size 0.7405 mm, 0.4712 mm and 0.3575 mm. The virtual cylinder condenses physical LORs stemming from various crystal pairs and DOI combinations, and which intersect a single virtual detector pair, into a single virtual LOR. Quantitative comparisons of the point spread function (PSF) at various positions within the field of view (FOV) were compared for reconstructions based on the vPET implementations and the physical scanner. We also assessed the impact of the anisotropic PSFs by reconstructing images of a micro Derenzo phantom. Main results: All virtual cylinder implementations achieved LOR data compression &gt;50%. PSF anisotropy in radial/tangential profiles was chiefly influenced by DOI resolution. Spatial degradation introduced by virtual cylinders was most prominent axially. All virtual cylinders achieved sub-millimetre volumetric resolution across the FOV using 6-bin DOI reconstructions (3.3 mm DOI resolution). Using 0.4712 mm detectors with 6 DOI bins (LOR compression 86%) yielded nearly identical reconstructions to the non-virtual case. Significance: Our results show that DOI PET reconstruction with 50-86% LOR compression and sub-millimetre spatial resolution is possible using virtual cylinders. The methodology and analysis can be extended to high resolution scanners with DOI capability.</description>

      <title>Characterisation of the Intel RealSense D415 Stereo Depth Camera for Motion-Corrected CT Perfusion Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Even for short protocols (&lt;1 min), head movement can compromise accurate haemodynamic modelling of cerebral CT perfusion (CTP) imaging in acute stroke. Frame-to-frame registration is the most common form of retrospective correction but neglects the fact that motion is continuous, not discrete. By contrast, external tracking devices provide continuous motion monitoring and thereby the opportunity to fully correct the acquired data for motion. The aim of this study was to characterise the Intel D415 stereo depth camera, a compact low-cost markerless tracking device, in terms of its suitability for retrospective CTP motion correction. The results showed that jitter was stable, and thermally-induced pose drift was {\le} 1.5 mm and {\le} 0.5{\deg} during the first 10-20 min, after which it also became stable. For static poses, the mean difference between the Intel D415 motion estimates and ground-truth poses for a head phantom was {\le} 1.24 \pm 0.01 mm and {\le} 0.68 \pm 0.01{\deg} for position and orientation, respectively. For dynamic poses measured while a head phantom travelled smooth continuous trajectories with median speed 0.031 ms^(-1) (speed range 0-0.500 ms^(-1)), the root-mean-square-error (RMSE) was {\le} 1.40 \pm 0.12 mm and {\le} 0.24 \pm 0.02{\deg}. When tracking a simulated patient head trajectory derived from a clinical CTP scan, the average RMSE was {\le} 0.86 \pm 0.03 mm and {\le} 0.16 \pm 0.03{\deg}. Tracking the head motion of a human volunteer inside a clinical CT scanner, the average RMSE was {\le} 2.72 \pm 0.24 mm and {\le} 0.55 \pm 0.07{\deg}. Overall, our results suggest that a single D415 tracking system can achieve promising pose estimation accuracy, though still worse than typical brain CT resolution, including CTP. The error is likely to be reduced to a practical level by combining multiple devices and this should be investigated in future work.</description>

      <title>The effect of inter-track coupling on H$_2$O$_2$ productions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Lower production of H$_2$O$_2$ in water is a hallmark of ultra-high dose rate (UHDR) compared to the conventional dose rate (CDR). However, the current computational models based on the predicted yield of H$_2$O$_2$ are in opposite of the experimental data. Methods: We construct an analytical model for the rate equation in the production of H$_2$O$_2$ from \ce{^{.}OH}-radicals and use it as a guide to propose a hypothetical geometrical inhomogeneity in the configuration of particles in the FLASH-UHDR beams. We perform a series of Monte Carlo (MC) simulations of the track structures for a system of charged particles impinging the medium in the form of clusters and/or bunches. Results: We demonstrate the interplay of diffusion, reaction rates, and overlaps in track-spacing attribute to a lower yield of H$_2$O$_2$ at FLASH-UHDR vs. CDR. This trend is reversed if spacing among the tracks becomes larger than a critical value, with a length scale that is proportional to the diffusion length of \ce{^{.}OH}-radicals modulated by a rate of decay due to recombination with other species, available within a track, and the space among the tracks. The latter is substantial on the suppressing of the H$_2$O$_2$ population at FLASH-UHDR relative to CDR. Conclusions: Based on our analysis of the present work, at FLASH-UHDR, the lower yield in H$_2$O$_2$ can be interpreted as a signature of bunching the particles in beams of ionizing radiation. The beams enter the medium in closely packed clusters and form inhomogeneities in the track-structure distribution. Thus the MC simulations based on the assumption of uniformly distributed tracks are unable to explain the experimental data.</description>

      <title>C-arm inverse geometry CT for 3D cardiac chamber mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image-guided navigation of catheter devices to anatomic targets within large 3D cardiac chambers and vessels is challenging in the interventional setting due to the limitations of a conventional 2D x-ray projection format. Scanning-beam digital x-ray (SBDX) is a low-dose inverse geometry x-ray fluoroscopy technology capable of real-time 3D catheter tracking. SBDX performs rapid tomosynthesis using an electronically scanned multisource x-ray tube and photon-counting detector mounted to a C-arm gantry. However, SBDX currently lacks the ability to perform volumetric computed tomography from a rotational C-arm scan. This work develops a novel volumetric CT capability for the SBDX platform, termed C-arm inverse geometry CT, suitable for rotational scans of the beating heart. The work is divided into three tasks: development of image reconstruction algorithms, implementation on the SBDX hardware, and performance assessment for the example task of 3D cardiac chamber mapping. SBDX-CT data acquisition is performed by simultaneous x-ray source scanning at 15 scan/s and C-arm rotation over a 190 degree short-scan arc in 13.4 seconds. An iterative reconstruction method was developed to accommodate fully truncated projections and data inconsistency resulting from cardiac motion during rotation. Hardware implementation included development of a C-arm angle measurement method, development of a geometric calibration method to account for non-ideal C-arm rotations, and detector response nonlinearity correction. The geometric calibration procedure mitigated artifacts from C-arm deflection during rotation. SBDX-CT image quality was evaluated in phantom studies. Feasibility of in-vivo SBDX-CT was demonstrated in a porcine model.</description>

      <title>How accurately can quantitative imaging methods be ranked without ground truth: An upper bound on no-gold-standard evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective evaluation of quantitative imaging (QI) methods with patient data, while important, is typically hindered by the lack of gold standards. To address this challenge, no-gold-standard evaluation (NGSE) techniques have been proposed. These techniques have demonstrated efficacy in accurately ranking QI methods without access to gold standards. The development of NGSE methods has raised an important question: how accurately can QI methods be ranked without ground truth. To answer this question, we propose a Cramer-Rao bound (CRB)-based framework that quantifies the upper bound in ranking QI methods without any ground truth. We present the application of this framework in guiding the use of a well-known NGSE technique, namely the regression-without-truth (RWT) technique. Our results show the utility of this framework in quantifying the performance of this NGSE technique for different patient numbers. These results provide motivation towards studying other applications of this upper bound.</description>

      <title>On machine learning analysis of atomic force microscopy images for image classification, sample surface recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atomic force microscopy (AFM or SPM) imaging is one of the best matches with machine learning (ML) analysis among microscopy techniques. The digital format of AFM images allows for direct utilization in ML algorithms without the need for additional processing. Additionally, AFM enables the simultaneous imaging of distributions of over a dozen different physicochemical properties of sample surfaces, a process known as multidimensional imaging. While this wealth of information can be challenging to analyze using traditional methods, ML provides a seamless approach to this task. However, the relatively slow speed of AFM imaging poses a challenge in applying deep learning methods broadly used in image recognition. This Prospective is focused on ML recognition/classification when using a relatively small number of AFM images, small database. We discuss ML methods other than popular deep-learning neural networks. The described approach has already been successfully used to analyze and classify the surfaces of biological cells. It can be applied to recognize medical images, specific material processing, in forensic studies, even to identify the authenticity of arts. A general template for ML analysis specific to AFM is suggested, with a specific example of the identification of cell phenotype. Special attention is given to the analysis of the statistical significance of the obtained results, an important feature that is often overlooked in papers dealing with machine learning. A simple method for finding statistical significance is also described.</description>

      <title>Water exchange and microscopic kurtosis -- two sides of the same coin?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.03661v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion MRI is sensitive to a wide range of features of the microstructure including diffusivity, exchange and three sources of diffusional kurtosis: isotropic, anisotropic, and microscopic. Correlation tensor imaging (CTI) uses double diffusion encoding (DDE) to resolve all three kurtosis components. In that framework, microscopic kurtosis is estimated from the contrast between SDE and parallel DDE signals at the same b-value. Another approach is multi-Gaussian exchange (MGE), which can apply DDE to measure exchange. The highest exchange sensitivity in MGE is obtained by contrasting SDE and DDE signals at the same b-value. CTI and MGE can thus be applied to analyse the same data, but exchange can bias microscopic kurtosis estimates if not accounted for, and vice versa. Here, we develop new theory (MGE incorporating microscopic kurtosis, $\mu$MGE) that accounts for both effects, by exploiting the distinct signatures of exchange and microscopic kurtosis with varying mixing time: exchange causes a dependence of the signal on mixing time while microscopic kurtosis does not. We perform Monte-Carlo simulations in different geometries with varying levels of exchange and study the behaviour of the parameters from CTI, MGE, and $\mu$MGE. We conclude that microscopic kurtosis from CTI is positively biased by exchange. We also find that applying $\mu$MGE to data acquired with multiple mixing times for both parallel and orthogonal DDE allows accurate estimation of exchange and all three sources of kurtosis.</description>

      <title>Proton-CAT: a Novel Proposal for Enhanced Proton Therapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02760v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an innovative nitrogen targeting Proton-Carbon-Alpha Therapy method, abbreviated as Proton-CAT, which partially converts protons into carbon-12 and alpha particles through nuclear reactions between protons and nitrogen-15. The effectiveness of Proton-CAT is validated using Monte Carlo simulations, and the study focuses on the relative energy deposition distribution. The findings indicate that the presence of nitrogen enhances the maximum dose level of protons, resulting in more effective damage confined to tumor cells. Statistical analysis of secondary ions shows that the Proton-CAT significantly increases the efficiency of carbon-12 and alpha particle production. Furthermore, our results reveal that elevating the nitrogen concentration significantly boosts the dose of carbon and alpha particles within the tumor region. These outcomes offer a novel pathway for proton radiation therapy and hold promise for contributing to the future development of proton therapy.</description>

      <title>Tuning upstream swimming of micro-robots by shape and cargo size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.05694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2004.05694v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The navigation of micro-robots in complex flow environments is controlled by rheotaxis, the reorientation with respect to flow gradients. Here we demonstrate how payloads can be exploited to enhance the motion against flows. Using fully resolved hydrodynamic simulations, the mechanisms are described that allow micro-robots of different shapes to reorient upstream. We find that cargo pullers are the fastest at most flow strengths, but pushers feature a non-trivial optimum as a function of the counter flow strength. Moreover, the rheotactic performance can be maximised by tuning the micro-robot shape or cargo size. These results may be used to control micro-swimmer navigation, but they also apply to rheotaxis in microbial ecology and the prevention of bacterial contamination dynamics.</description>

      <title>Longitudinal Volumetric Study for the Progression of Alzheimer's Disease from Structural MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05558v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is an irreversible neurodegenerative disorder affecting millions of individuals today. The prognosis of the disease solely depends on treating symptoms as they arise and proper caregiving, as there are no current medical preventative treatments apart from newly developing drugs which can, at most, slow the progression. Thus, early detection of the disease at its most premature state is of paramount importance. This work aims to survey imaging biomarkers corresponding to the progression of AD and also reviews some of the existing feature extraction methods. A longitudinal study of structural MR images was performed for given temporal test subjects with AD selected randomly from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. A pipeline was implemented to study the data, including modern pre-processing techniques such as spatial image registration, skull stripping, inhomogeneity correction and tissue segmentation using an unsupervised learning approach using intensity histogram information. The temporal data across multiple visits is used to study the structural change in volumes of these tissue classes, namely, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), grey matter (GM), and white matter (WM) as the patients progressed further into the disease. To detect changes in volume trends, we also analyse the data with a modified Mann-Kendall statistic. The segmented features thus extracted and the subsequent trend analysis provide insights such as atrophy, increase or intolerable shifting of GM, WM and CSF and should help in future research for automated analysis of Alzheimer's detection with clinical domain explainability.</description>
