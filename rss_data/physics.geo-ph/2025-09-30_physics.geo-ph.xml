      <title>Progressive Layer Stripping Analysis for HVSR Interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratio (HVSR) technique is widely used to determine site fundamental periods from ambient noise recordings, but relating the observed peak to a specific impedance contrast within layered soils remains challenging. This paper presents an enhanced implementation of hvstrip-progressive, a Python package for forward HVSR modelling under the diffuse-field assumption and systematic progressive layer stripping. The package computes theoretical HVSR curves from shear-wave velocity (Vs) profiles, iteratively removes the deepest finite layer and promotes the next layer to half-space, and tracks how the fundamental frequency and amplitude change with each step. Compared with previous implementations, the software now supports adaptive frequency scanning, rigorous model validation, and publication-quality visualizations. Using a synthetic seven-layer soil profile, we show that the fundamental peak shifts from 6.99 Hz to 23.45 Hz as layers are stripped and that the maximum impedance contrast of 1.46 at 17 m depth controls the resonance. The transparent workflow, reproducible outputs and open-source distribution make hvstrip-progressive a practical tool for seismic site characterization and microzonation studies.</description>

      <title>U-SWIFT: A Unified Surface Wave Inversion Framework with Transformer via Normalization of Dispersion Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning is an increasingly popular approach for inverting surface wave dispersion curves to obtain Vs profiles. However, its generalizability is constrained by the depth and velocity scales of training data. We propose a unified deep learning framework that overcomes this limitation via normalization of dispersion curves. By leveraging the scaling properties of dispersion curves, our approach enables a single, pre-trained model to predict Vs profiles across diverse scales, from shallow subsurface (e.g., &lt; 10 m depth) to crustal levels. The framework incorporates a novel transformer-based model to handle variable-length dispersion curves and removes tedious manual parameterization. Results from synthetic and field data demonstrate that it delivers rapid and robust inversions with uncertainty estimates. This work provides an efficient inversion approach applicable to a wide spectrum of applications, from near-surface engineering to crustal imaging. The framework establishes a paradigm for developing scale-invariant deep learning models in geophysical inversion.</description>

      <title>Estimating high-resolution albedo for urban applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Implementation of cool roofs is a high-impact pathway for mitigating heat at both global and city scales. However, while albedo estimates derived from Sentinel-2 are free and globally-available, the 10 m resolution is insufficient to resolve individual roofs. We present methods for increasing the resolution of Sentinel-2 albedo using high-resolution satellite imagery to produce albedo inferences at a 30-cm scale. Validating against high-resolution aerial albedo measurements over Boulder, CO we find improved precision and accuracy relative to Sentinel-2 with an RMSE of 0.04. Applying these methods to 12 global cities, we evaluate the impacts of three cool roof implementation scenarios. We find that cities can see up to a 0.5{\deg}C cooling effect from full scale implementation of cool roofs and prioritizing the largest buildings for implementation is a highly effective policy pathway. While Sentinel-2 produces accurate estimates of albedo change at larger scales, high-resolution inferences are required for prioritizing buildings based on their solar radiation management potential. This research demonstrates a scalable implementation of targeted cool roof interventions in neighborhoods with the greatest potential for heat mitigation by enabling actionable, building-level insights.</description>

      <title>Generalizations of Langbein's Formula under Non-Stationarity, Mixed Populations, and Over- or Under-Dispersion in the Number of Exceedances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since its publication in 1949, Langbein's formula has been applied ubiquitously in both research documents and national guidelines concerning frequency analyses (FAs) of hydrologic extremes. Given a time series of independent peak-over-threshold (POT) events and the corresponding annual maxima (AM) series-defined as the subset of extremes representing the largest event in each year-the formula provides a theoretical relationship between the return period T derived from the AM series and the average recurrence interval ARI from the POT series, for any fixed event magnitude. Despite the minimal assumptions required-specifically, that exceedance counts follow a homogeneous Poisson process-there are real-world situations where the validity of the formula may be compromised. Typical cases include non-stationary processes, mixed-event populations, and over- or under-dispersion in exceedance counts. In this work, we extend Langbein's formula to account for these three cases. We demonstrate that, with appropriate adaptations to the definitions of T and ARI, the traditional functional form of Langbein's relationship remains valid for non-stationary processes and mixed populations. However, accounting for dispersion effects in exceedance counts requires a generalization of Langbein's relationship, of which the traditional version represents a limiting case.</description>

      <title>Assessing the risk of future Dunkelflaute events for Germany using generative deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The European electricity power grid is transitioning towards renewable energy sources, characterized by an increasing share of off- and onshore wind and solar power. However, the weather dependency of these energy sources poses a challenge to grid stability, with so-called Dunkelflaute events -- periods of low wind and solar power generation -- being of particular concern due to their potential to cause electricity supply shortages. In this study, we investigate the impact of these events on the German electricity production in the years and decades to come. For this purpose, we adapt a recently developed generative deep learning framework to downscale climate simulations from the CMIP6 ensemble. We first compare their statistics to the historical record taken from ERA5 data. Next, we use these downscaled simulations to assess plausible future occurrences of Dunkelflaute events in Germany under the optimistic low (SSP2-4.5) and high (SSP5-8.5) emission scenarios. Our analysis indicates that both the frequency and duration of Dunkelflaute events in Germany in the ensemble mean are projected to remain largely unchanged compared to the historical period. This suggests that, under the considered climate scenarios, the associated risk is expected to remain stable throughout the century.</description>

      <title>Strong noise attenuation of seismic data based on Nash equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06490v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Seismic data acquisition is often affected by various types of noise, which degrade data quality and hinder subsequent interpretation. Recovery of seismic data becomes particularly challenging in the presence of strong noise, which significantly impacts both data accuracy and geological analysis. This study proposes a novel single-encoder, multiple-decoder network based on Nash equalization (SEMD-Nash) for effective strong noise attenuation in seismic data. The main contributions of this method are as follows: First, we design a shared encoder-multi-decoder architecture, where an improved encoder extracts key features from the noisy data, and three parallel decoders reconstruct the denoised seismic signal from different perspectives. Second, we develop a multi-objective optimization system that integrates three loss functions-Mean Squared Error (MSE), Perceived Loss, and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM)-to ensure effective signal reconstruction, high-order feature preservation, and structural integrity. Third, we introduce the Nash Equalization Weight Optimizer, which dynamically adjusts the weights of the loss functions, balancing the optimization objectives to improve the models robustness and generalization. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively suppresses strong noise while preserving the geological characteristics of the seismic data.</description>

      <title>Multi-MeV electron occurrence and lifetimes in the outer radiation belt and slot region during the maximum of solar cycle 22</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08559v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Combined Release and Radiation Effects Satellite (CRRES) observed the response of the Van Allen radiation belts to peak solar activity within solar cycle 22. This study analyses relativistic and ultra-relativistic electron occurrence and loss timescales within the CRRES High Energy Electron Fluxometer (HEEF) dataset, including during several strong and severe geomagnetic storms that all, remarkably, flooded the slot region with multi-MeV electrons. These allow the first definitive multi-MeV electron lifetimes to be calculated in this region and indicate an elevated risk to satellites in slot region orbits during periods of heightened solar activity. The HEEF outer belt loss timescales are broadly in agreement with those from later solar cycles, but differences include longer-lasting sub-MeV electrons near the inner region of the outer belt and faster-decaying multi-MeV electrons near geosynchronous orbit. These differences are associated with higher levels of geomagnetic activity, a phenomenon that enables the spread in the results to be parameterised accordingly. The timescales generally appear well-bounded by Kp-dependent theoretical predictions, but the variability within the spread is not always well-ordered by geomagnetic activity. This suggests the limitations of using pitch-angle diffusion to account for the decay of elevated electrons following geomagnetic storms, and the need for more sophisticated space weather indices for radiation belt forecasting.</description>

      <title>Diffusion models for multivariate subsurface generation and efficient probabilistic inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15809v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models offer stable training and state-of-the-art performance for deep generative modeling tasks. Here, we consider their use in the context of multivariate subsurface modeling and probabilistic inversion. We first demonstrate that diffusion models enhance multivariate modeling capabilities compared to variational autoencoders and generative adversarial networks. In diffusion modeling, the generative process involves a comparatively large number of time steps with update rules that can be modified to account for conditioning data. We propose different corrections to the popular Diffusion Posterior Sampling approach by Chung et al. (2023). In particular, we introduce a likelihood approximation accounting for the noise-contamination that is inherent in diffusion modeling. We assess performance in a multivariate geological scenario involving facies and correlated acoustic impedance. Conditional modeling is demonstrated using both local hard data (well logs) and nonlinear geophysics (fullstack seismic data). Our tests show significantly improved statistical robustness, enhanced sampling of the posterior probability density function and reduced computational costs, compared to the original approach. The method can be used with both hard and indirect conditioning data, individually or simultaneously. As the inversion is included within the diffusion process, it is faster than other methods requiring an outer-loop around the generative model, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo.</description>
