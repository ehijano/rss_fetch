      <title>Marcus Theory and The Condon Approximation Revisited I: E-SHAKE and Seam Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Marcus theory is the workhorse of theoretical chemistry for predicting the rates of charge and energy transfer. Marcus theory overwhelmingly agrees with experiment -- both in terms of electron transfer and triplet energy transfer -- for the famous set of naphthalene-bridge-biphenyl and naphthalene-bridge-benzophenone systems studied by Piotrowiak, Miller, and Closs. That being said, the agreement is not perfect, and in this manuscript, we revisit one key point of disagreement: the molecule C-13-ae ([3,equatorial]-naphthalene-cyclohexane-[1,axial]-benzophenone). To better understand the theory-experiment disagreement, we introduce and employ a novel scheme to sample the seam between two diabatic electronic states (E-SHAKE) through which we reveal the breakdown of the Condon approximation and the presence of a conical intersection for the C-13-ae molecule; we also predict an isotopic effect on the rate of triplet-triplet energy transfer.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Diffusion-Based Sampling with Molecular Collective Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion-based samplers learn to sample complex, high-dimensional distributions using energies or log densities alone, without training data. Yet, they remain impractical for molecular sampling because they are often slower than molecular dynamics and miss thermodynamically relevant modes. Inspired by enhanced sampling, we encourage exploration by introducing a sequential bias along bespoke, information-rich, low-dimensional projections of atomic coordinates known as collective variables (CVs). We introduce a repulsive potential centered on the CVs from recent samples, which pushes future samples towards novel CV regions and effectively increases the temperature in the projected space. Our resulting method improves efficiency, mode discovery, enables the estimation of free energy differences, and retains independent sampling from the approximate Boltzmann distribution via reweighting by the bias. On standard peptide conformational sampling benchmarks, the method recovers diverse conformational states and accurate free energy profiles. We are the first to demonstrate reactive sampling using a diffusion-based sampler, capturing bond breaking and formation with universal interatomic potentials at near-first-principles accuracy. The approach resolves reactive energy landscapes at a fraction of the wall-clock time of standard sampling methods, advancing diffusion-based sampling towards practical use in molecular sciences.</description>

      <title>Time-resolved solvation dynamics of Li$^+$, Na$^+$ and K$^+$ ions in liquid helium nanodroplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2023, ultrafast pump-probe spectrocopy was used to record the solvation dynamics of a single Na$^+$ ion in a liquid helium droplet, atom-by-atom and with femtosecond time resolution [Albrechtsen \textit{et al., Nature}, 2023, \textbf{623}, 319]. Subsequently, theoretical studies showed that other alkali ions solvate in a similar manner but no experimental results were reported so far. Here, we extend the previous measurement on Na$^+$ to Li$^+$ and K$^+$ ions. A pump pulse selectively ionizes an alkali atom, initially residing at the droplet surface, and the ensuing solvation dynamics of the formed alkali cation, Ak$^+$, is followed by ionizing a Xe atom, located in the droplet interior, and recording the yields of Ak$^+$He$_n$ ions expelled from the droplet as a function of the pump-probe pulse delay. We find that Li$^+$, Na$^+$ and K$^+$ ions solvate with a binding rate of 1.8 $\pm$ 0.1, 1.8 $\pm$ 0.1 and 1.7 $\pm$ 0.1 He per ps, respectively. Furthermore, by comparing the number distribution of the Ak$^+$He$_n$ ion yields to the evaporation energies of these ion--He complexes, obtained by Path Integral Monte Carlo calculations, we identify signatures of the first solvation shells of Li$^+$, Na$^+$ and K$^+$. Lastly, we determine the time-dependent dissipation of the solvation energy from the vicinity of the three alkali ion species and find that the rate is highest (lowest) for Li$^+$ (K$^+$)</description>

      <title>Kinetic modelling of the CO2 capture and utilisation on NiRu-Ca/Al dual function material via parameter estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a detailed, open-source kinetic modelling computational framework for CO2 capture and utilisation using a newly formulated dual-function material (DFM) comprising 15 wt% Ni, 1 wt% Ru, and 10 wt% CaO supported on spherical alumina. A finite difference reactor model was developed to simulate the cyclic adsorption, purge, and hydrogenation stages. The model incorporates experimentally-derived rate expressions, accounts for system delay via a second-order response function, and was fitted to time-resolved concentration laboratory data using Bayesian optimisation. A combined parameter estimation strategy was employed to ensure mass continuity across stages and improve the robustness of purge kinetics. The kinetic parameters extracted reveal that carbonate decomposition, not methanation, is the rate-limiting step during hydrogenation. Temperature-dependent simulations confirm a trade-off between reaction kinetics and CO2 storage capacity, with methane yield maximised at 300C when compared with the other temperature sets. By offering transparent methodology and reproducible code, this work provides a robust platform for researchers and practitioners to study, validate, and optimise DFM systems.</description>

      <title>Investigation of Cathode Electrolyte Interphase Formation via Coupling Liquid Electrochemical TEM and GC/MS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A deeper understanding of the cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) formation mechanism is essential to elucidate battery degradation. Here, we combine Liquid Electrochemical Transmission Electron Microscopy (ec-TEM) with Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) to monitor CEI evolution in a realistic electrochemical environment, focusing on electrolyte behavior under high voltages. The correlation between the electrochemical response, gas and liquid analysis after cycling, and the observation of deposited species on the working electrode (WE) reveals the processes governing CEI formation, stability, and composition. Cycling between 4 and 6 V vs Li leads to dispersed particles instead of a continuous film. These are partly composed of LiF and an amorphous phase that prevents dissolution at high potential. When cycled between 2.5 and 5.5 V, an anodic current peak indicates the formation of a 36 nm amorphous thin film without crystalline LiF, attributed to EC oxidation producing HF and subsequent LiF at a higher potential. LiF dissolution appears to follow a two-step pathway: electrolyte oxidation forms soluble intermediates, which are later reduced at lower potential to yield species capable of dissolving LiF. These results provide new insights into CEI formation and dissolution mechanisms, underscoring the need for further studies across different potential windows and with non carbonate electrolytes to validate these findings.</description>

      <title>Neuromorphic heat transport effects in a molecular junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding energy transport at the nanoscale is an open and fundamental challenge in the molecular sciences with direct implications for the design of new electronics, computing devices, and materials. While nanoscale energy transport under steady-state conditions has been studied extensively, there is much less known about energy transport under time-dependent driving forces, particularly in the far-from-equilibrium regime. In this work, we use nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations and stochastic thermodynamics to investigate energy transport in a well-studied nanoscale system, a molecular junction, subjected to a time-periodic temperature gradient. The primary observation is that molecular junctions can exhibit heat transport hysteresis, a phenomenon in which the heat flux through a system depends not only on the instantaneous value of a time-dependent temperature bias but also on the temporal history of that bias. The presented findings illustrate that molecular junctions can exhibit the specific memory effect, heat transport hysteresis, that is essential for the design of thermal neuromorphic computers. This work elucidates a potential pathway toward the realization of such devices.</description>

      <title>Open Quantum Dynamics Theory for Coulomb Potentials: Hierarchical Equations of Motion for Atomic Orbitals (AO-HEOM)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum dynamics of Coulomb potential systems in thermal baths. We study these systems within the framework of open quantum dynamics theory, focusing on preserving the rotational symmetry of the entire system, including the baths. Thus, we employ a three-dimensional rotationally invariant system-bath (3D-RISB) model to derive numerically ``exact'' hierarchical equations of motion for atomic orbitals (AO-HEOM) that enable a non-perturbative and non-Markovian treatment of system-bath interactions at finite temperatures. To assess the formalism, we calculated the linear absorption spectrum of an atomic system under isotropic thermal environment, with systematic variation of system-bath coupling strength and temperature.</description>

      <title>Nanoscale surface morphology controls charge storage at stepped Pt-water interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Platinum step edges dominate electrocatalytic activity in fuel cells and electrolysers, yet their atomistic electrochemical behaviour remains poorly understood. Here, we employ \textit{ab initio} molecular dynamics under controlled electrode potentials to model a realistic stepped Pt--water interface incorporating experimentally observed (111)$\times$(111) and (111)$\times$(100) edge motifs. This allows us to resolve, for the first time, the site-specific structure, charge distribution, and electrostatics of the electric double layer at a nanostructured Pt surface. We find that differential capacitance near the potential of zero charge (PZC) arises almost entirely from potential-dependent chemisorption of water on flat (111) terraces. In contrast, step edges are saturated with chemisorbed water even below the PZC and thus do not contribute to the capacitance. Instead, edges accumulate excess positive charge and exhibit a locally elevated electrostatic potential, as revealed by spatially resolved macroscopic potential profiles. This electrostatic asymmetry implies a greater barrier for electron accumulation at step sites compared to terraces, consistent with enhanced charge localisation and reactivity. Finally, the higher-in-energy d-band centre and sharper projected density of states at edge atoms further support their role as active, positively charged centres. Together, these results provide a mechanistic explanation for the observed experimental shift of the PZC with step density and establish a predictive framework for understanding and optimising interfacial charging in nanostructured Pt electrocatalysts.</description>

      <title>Reduced Density Matrix Functional Theory And A Reduced Formulation Of Density Functional Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A mathematical framework for reduced density matrix functional theory (RDMFT) is proposed. The work is inspired by and generalizes the work by E.H.~Lieb [E.H. Lieb, Int. J. Quant. Chem. 24(1983), pp.243--277] on density-functional theory (DFT). We introduce a Banach space for density matrices with finite kinetic energy. The dual space is a rich class of single-particle potentials, i.e., Hermitian forms. The ground state energy of an $N$-fermion system with external forces given by any such Hermitian form is expressed as the Legendre--Fenchel transform of a convex and lower semicontinuous ``universal'' reduced density matrix functional. The formalism is employed to provide a mathematical framework for density-functional theory (DFT). The main tool here is a rigorous definition of diagonals of reduced density matrices. The result is a refinement of Lieb's results on DFT applicable to a wide variety of models.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Molecular Dynamics Simulations with Foundation Neural Network Models using Multiple Time-Step and Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06562v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a strategy to accelerate molecular dynamics simulations using foundation neural network models. To do so, we apply a dual-level neural network multi-time-step (MTS) strategy where the target accurate potential is coupled to a simpler but faster model obtained via a distillation process. Thus, the 3.5 \r{A}-cutoff distilled model is sufficient to capture the fast varying forces, i.e. mainly bonded interactions, from the accurate potential allowing its use in a reversible reference system propagator algorithms (RESPA)-like formalism. The approach conserves accuracy, preserving both static and dynamical properties, while enabling to evaluate the costly model only every 3 to 6 fs depending on the system. Consequently, large simulation speedups over standard 1 fs integration are observed: 4-fold in homogeneous systems and 2.7-fold in large solvated proteins. Such a strategy is applicable to any neural network potential and reduces their performance gap with classical force fields.</description>

      <title>Generative Deep Learning Framework for Inverse Design of Fuels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12075v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the present work, a generative deep learning framework combining a Co-optimized Variational Autoencoder (Co-VAE) architecture with quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) techniques is developed to enable accelerated inverse design of fuels. The Co-VAE integrates a property prediction component coupled with the VAE latent space, enhancing molecular reconstruction and accurate estimation of Research Octane Number (RON) (chosen as the fuel property of interest). A subset of the GDB-13 database, enriched with a curated RON database, is used for model training. Hyperparameter tuning is further utilized to optimize the balance among reconstruction fidelity, chemical validity, and RON prediction. An independent regression model is then used to refine RON prediction, while a differential evolution algorithm is employed to efficiently navigate the VAE latent space and identify promising fuel molecule candidates with high RON. This methodology addresses the limitations of traditional fuel screening approaches by capturing complex structure-property relationships within a comprehensive latent representation. The generative model can be adapted to different target properties, enabling systematic exploration of large chemical spaces relevant to fuel design applications. Furthermore, the demonstrated framework can be readily extended by incorporating additional synthesizability criteria to improve applicability and reliability for de novo design of new fuels.</description>
