      <title>Medium-entropy Engineering of magnetism in layered antiferromagnet CuxNi2(1-x)CrxP2S6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Engineering magnetism in layered magnets could result in novel phenomena related to two-dimensional (2D) magnetism, which can be useful for fundamental research and practical applications. Extensive doping efforts such as substitution and intercalation have been adopted to tune antiferromagnetic (AFM) properties in M2P2X6 compounds. The substitutional doping in this material family has mainly focused on bimetallic substitution. Recently, the metal substitution can also be extended to more than two metal elements, leading to medium and high-entropy alloys (MEAs and HEAs), which are fairly underexplored in layered magnetic systems including M2P2X6. In this work, we explored the magnetic properties of the previously unreported Cu- and Cr-substituted Ni2P2S6 i.e., CuxNi2(1-x)CrxP2S6. Our study reveals a relatively systematic evolution of AFM phases with substitution than that observed in traditional bimetallic substitution in M2P2X6. Furthermore, the Cu and Cr substitutions in Ni2P2S6 are found to enhance the ferromagnetic (FM) correlation, which is also accompanied by a possible weak FM phase at low temperatures for the intermediate compositions from 0.32 to 0.80. Our work provides a strategy to establish ferromagnetism in AFM M2P2X6 that can also be used for property tuning in other layered magnets.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Superconducting Qubit Performance Through Ammonium Fluoride Etch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The performance of superconducting qubits is often limited by dissipation and two-level systems (TLS) losses. The dominant sources of these losses are believed to originate from amorphous materials and defects at interfaces and surfaces, likely as a result of fabrication processes or ambient exposure. Here, we explore a novel wet chemical surface treatment at the Josephson junction-substrate and the substrate-air interfaces by replacing a buffered oxide etch (BOE) cleaning process with one that uses hydrofluoric acid followed by aqueous ammonium fluoride. We show that the ammonium fluoride etch process results in a statistically significant improvement in median $\text{T}_1$ by $\sim22\%$ ($p=0.002$), and a reduction in the number of strongly-coupled TLS in the tunable frequency range. Microwave resonator measurements on samples treated with the ammonium fluoride etch prior to niobium deposition also show $\sim33\%$ lower TLS-induced loss tangent compared to the BOE treated samples. As the chemical treatment primarily modifies the Josephson junction-substrate interface and substrate-air interface, we perform targeted chemical and structural characterizations to examine materials' differences at these interfaces and identify multiple microscopic changes that could contribute to decreased TLS.</description>

      <title>Improved Electrical Conductivity of Copper and Nitrogen Functionalized Carbon Nanotubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the electrical conductivity of carbon nanotubes (CNTs), with a particular focus on the effects of doping. Using a first-principles approach, we study the electronic structure, phonon dispersion, and electron-phonon scattering to understand the finite-temperature electrical transport properties in CNTs. Our study covers both prototypical metallic and semiconducting CNTs, with special emphasis on the influence of typical defects such as vacancies and the incorporation of copper or nitrogen, such as pyridinic N, pyrrolic N, graphitic N, and oxidized N. Our theoretical study shows significant improvements in the electrical conduction properties of copper-CNT composites, especially when semiconducting CNTs are functionalized with nitrogen. Doping is found to cause significant changes in the electronic density of states near the Fermi level, which affects the electrical conductivity. Calculations show that certain types of functional groups, such as N-pyrrolic, result in a ~30-fold increase in the conductivity of semiconducting CNTs compared to Cu-incorporated CNTs alone. For metallic CNTs, the conductivity is in agreement with existing experimental data, and our prediction of significant increases in conductivity with N-pyrrolic functional group is consistent with recent experimental results, demonstrating the effectiveness of doping in modifying conductivity. Our study provides valuable insight into the electronic properties of doped CNTs and contributes to the development of ultra-high conductivity CNT composites.</description>

      <title>Strain-modulated Intercalated Phases of Pb Monolayer with Dual Periodicity in SiC(0001)-Graphene Interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intercalation of metal atoms at the SiC(0001)-graphene (Gr) interface can provide confined 2D metal layers with interesting properties. The intercalated Pb monolayer (ML) has shown the coexistence of the Gr(10x10)-moire and a stripe phase, which still lacks understanding. Using density functional theory calculation and thermal annealing with ab initio molecular dynamics, we have studied the formation energy of SiC(0001)/Pb/Gr for different coverages of intercalated Pb. Near the coverage of a Pb(111)-like ML mimicking the (10x10)-moire, we find a slightly more stable stripe structure, where one half of the structure has compressive strain with Pb occupying the Si-top sites and the other half has tensile strain with Pb off the Si-top sites. This stripe structure along the Gr zigzag direction has a periodicity of 2.3 nm across the [1-210] direction agreeing with the previous observations using scanning tunneling microscopy. Analysis with electron density difference and density of states show the tensile region has a more metallic character than the compressive region, while both are dominated by the charge transfer from the Pb ML to SiC(0001). The small energy difference between the stripe and Pb(111)-like structures means the two phases are almost degenerate and can coexist, which explains the experimental observations.</description>

      <title>Polymer Micro-Lattice buffer structure Free Impact absorption</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The uncrewed aerial systems industry is rapidly expanding due to advancements in smaller electronics, smarter sensors, advanced flight controllers, and embedded perception modules leveraging artificial intelligence. These technological progress have opened new indoor applications for UAS, including warehouse inventory management, security inspections of public spaces and facilities, and underground exploration. Despite the innovative designs from UAS manufacturers, there are no existing standards to ensure UAS and human safety in these environments. This study explores developing and evaluating micro-lattice structures for impact resistance in lightweight UAS. We examine patch designs using Face-Centered Cubic (FCC), Diamond (D), Kelvin (K), and Gyroid (GY) patterns and detail the processes for creating samples for impact and compression tests, including manufacturing and testing protocols.
  Our evaluation includes compression and impact tests to assess structural behavior, revealing the influence of geometry, compactness, and material properties. Diamond and Kelvin patterns were particularly effective in load distribution and energy absorption over the compression tests. Impact tests demonstrated significant differences in response between flexible and rigid materials, with flexible patches exhibiting superior energy dissipation and structural integrity under dynamic loading.
  The study provides a detailed analysis of specific energy absorption (SEA) and efficiency, offering insights into optimal micro-lattice structure designs for impact resistance in lightweight UAS applications.</description>

      <title>Slowly generated anomalously large nuclear field in bulk n-AlGaAs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigated the dynamics of an electron--nuclear spin-coupled system using three Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$As bulk samples with different aluminum concentrations $x$ of 0, 0.05, and 0.15. The time-resolved Kerr rotation technique was primarily used. The samples with $x=$ 0.05 and 0.15 exhibited an anomalously large nuclear magnetic field of $\sim$1.1 T, which was twice the applied magnetic field. This observation is unusual for bulk semiconductors, which typically exhibit weak hyperfine interactions. Further investigations revealed a long nuclear field formation time, which indicated clear two-stage formation dynamics. Thus, this study concluded that slow nuclear spin diffusion owing to the nuclear quadrupole interaction facilitates the formation process of the nuclear field.</description>

      <title>Patterning of Fine Features on Material Surfaces Using a Ga Ion-Beam in a FIB-SEM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since an ion-beam is a viable attractive alternative to other material surface patterning techniques like an electron-beam, a study of the structure, composition and dimension of patterned lines created on surfaces of Si and SrTiO3 wafers with a Ga ion-beam was carried out. A combination of top-view SEM and cross-sectional STEM imaging and EDX spectroscopy applied to the patterned lines showed that the total ion-dose (DI) is the key parameter affecting the characteristics of the patterned lines, which can be adjusted by the degree of overlap between adjacent spots, beam dwell time at each spot, and the number of beam-passes for every beam size and current. A strong dependence between the used ion-doses and the patterned lines sizes was observed and quantified. At higher ion-doses (DI &gt; 10^15 ions/cm^2), the Ga ions remove part of the material in the exposed area creating channels surrounded with amorphized regions whereas, at lower ion-doses only amorphization occurs, creating a ridge on the wafer surface. Further, to pattern lines with similar sizes, an order of magnitude different ion-doses might be required in different materials as was the case with Si and SrTiO3. The quantification of line sizes showed that with this approach, lines as fine as 10 nm can be reproducibly patterned and characterized on the surfaces of materials, when low ion-doses are used, typically in the range of 10^14-10^15 ions/cm^2.</description>

      <title>Stretch-induced tunability of electrical transport properties of three-dimensional graphene-based foam structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fast electron transport and superior multidirectional flexibility of three-dimensional graphene-based foams (GFs) are pivotal in the realm of stretchable electronics. We observed pre-stretching induced modulation of the temperature-dependent electrical resistivity of GFs, where, as the pre-stretch strain level increased, the distinct temperature dependence of the resistivity of a GF sample would change and might even exhibit a notable transition from negative dependence to positive dependence. We attempted to interpret the phenomenon by proposing a new conduction network model that represents GF structures as interconnected graphene islands and island/island conduction junctions and incorporates three conduction mechanisms: thermally activated conduction, phonon-limited conduction, and fluctuation-induced tunneling conduction. By fitting-assisted analysis, we found that the temperature dependence of the resistivity of a GF sample primarily relies on the discrete quantities of graphene islands and island/island conduction junctions, and the resistivity originating from each conduction mechanism. As pre-stretch strain level increases, these factors would change due to conduction network alteration, local strain-induced phonon hardening, and local strain-induced transport gap modulation, all resulting from pre-stretching. Our results offer valuable insights into the optimization of GFs-based stretchable electronic devices, such as performance enhancement through structural modifications.</description>

      <title>Enhance Ferroelectric Structural Distortion via Doping Ca in Epitaxial h-Lu1-xCaxMnO3 Thin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unlike proper ferroelectricity, the improper ferroelectricity in multiferroic rare-earth manganites h-ReMnO3 (Re=La-Lu,Y,Sc) thin films features a unique geometric distortion and stays immune to the depolarizing field in the ultra-thin limit. Here, we have managed to tune and boost ferroelectric geometric distortion of h-LuMnO3 thin films by doping Ca. Compressively strained h-Lu1-xCaxMnO3(x=0.1,0.2,0.3,0.4,0.5)epitaxial thin films were stabilized over sapphire substrates by a h-ScFeO3 buffer layer. When the doping concentration x&gt;=0.2, the common substrate-induced interface clamping effect that suppresses improper ferroelectricity of h-ReMnO3 can be eliminated. This work establishes a potential quasi-2D ferroelectric system and suggests a general strain engineering method to enhance improper ferroelectricity of hexagonal manganites.</description>

      <title>Topological Hall-like anomalies from twisted magnetic exchange spring in Nd0.6Sr0.4MnO3 / SrRuO3 heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent times, there has been a surge of interest in utilizing manganite systems for oxide-based heterostructures that host non-trivial spin textures, primarily driven by the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI). In these systems, the Topological Hall Effect (THE) manifests as humps or peaks in anomalous Hall Effect (AHE) loops near the coercive field. Numerous studies have reported THE in ruthenate/iridate and ruthenate/manganite heterostructures. Among the manganites, the Nd0.6Sr0.4MnO3 (NSMO) system remains relatively less explored. The strontium ruthenate (SrRuO3 - SRO) system exhibits excellent structural compatibility with NSMO, making NSMO/SRO heterostructures a model system for investigating non-trivial spin textures at oxide-based interfaces. In this work, we have studied the proximity effect of NSMO with SRO through magnetic and magnetotransport studies, varying the SRO layer thicknesses in the NSMO/SRO heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Stacking fault segregation imaging with analytical field ion microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stacking faults (SF) are important structural defects that play an essential role in the deformation of engineering alloys. However, direct observation of stacking faults at the atomic scale can be challenging. Here, we use the analytical field ion microscopy (aFIM), including density-functional theory informed contrast estimation, to image local elemental segregation at SFs in a creep-deformed solid solution single crystal alloy of Ni-2 at.% W. The segregated atoms are imaged brightly, and time-of-flight spectrometry allows for their identification as W. We also provide the first quantitative analysis of trajectory aberration, with a deviation of approximately 0.4 nm, explaining why atom probe tomography could not resolve these segregations. Atomistic simulations of substitutional W atoms at an edge dislocation in fcc Ni using an analytic bond-order potential indicate that the experimentally observed segregation is due to the energetic preference of W for the center of the stacking fault, contrasting with e.g., Re segregating to partial dislocations. Solute segregation to SF can hinder dislocation motion, increasing the strength of Ni-based superalloys. Yet direct substitution of Re by W envisaged to lower superalloys' costs, requires extra consideration in alloy design since these two solutes do not have comparable interactions with structural defects during deformation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Safe, all-solid-state lithium metal batteries enable high energy density applications, but suffer from instabilities during operation that lead to rough interfaces between the metal and electrolyte and subsequently cause void formation and dendrite growth that degrades performance and safety. Inspired by the morphogenetic control of thin lamina such as tree leaves that robustly grow into flat shapes -- we propose a range of approaches to control lithium metal stripping and plating. To guide discovery of materials that will implement these feedback mechanisms, we develop a reduced order model that captures couplings between mechanics, interface growth, temperature, and electrochemical variables. We find that long-range feedback is required to achieve true interface stability, while approaches based on local feedback always eventually grow into rough interfaces. All together, our study provides the beginning of a practical framework for analyzing and designing stable electrochemical interfaces in terms of the mechanical properties and the physical chemistry that underlie their dynamics.</description>

      <title>Phase field simulations of thermal annealing for all-small molecule organic solar cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interest in organic solar cells (OSCs) is constantly rising in the field of photovoltaic devices. The device performance relies on the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) nanomorphology, which develops during the drying process and additional post-treatment. This work studies the effect of thermal annealing (TA) on an all-small molecule DRCN5T: PC71 BM blend with phase field simulations. The objective is to determine the physical phenomena driving the evolution of the BHJ morphology for a better understanding of the posttreatment/morphology relationship. Phase-field simulation results are used to investigate the impact on the final BHJ morphology of the DRCN5T crystallization-related mechanisms, including nucleation, growth, crystal stability, impingement, grain coarsening, and Ostwald ripening, of the amorphous-amorphous phase separation (AAPS), and of diffusion limitations. The comparison of simulation results with experimental data shows that the morphological evolution of the BHJ under TA is dominated by dissolution of the smallest, unstable DRCN5T crystals and anisotropic growth of the largest crystals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Around 17,000 micromagnetic simulations were performed with a wide variation of geometric and magnetic parameters of different cellular nanostructures in the samarium-cobalt-based 1:7-type (SmCo-1:7) magnets. A forward prediction neural network (NN) model is trained to unveil the influence of these parameters on the coercivity of materials, along with the sensitivity analysis. Results indicate the important role of the 1:5-phase in enhancing coercivity. Moreover, an inverse design NN model is obtained to suggest the nanostructure for a queried coercivity.</description>

      <title>Careful finite element simulations of cold rolling with accurate through-thickness resolution and prediction of residual stress</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we carefully develop a finite element (FE) model that gives accurate through-thickness predictions of stress and strain distributions during the steady-state cold rolling process. These through-thickness predictions unveil an oscillatory pattern that is shown to have important consequences for residual stress in the rolled sheet. We believe this is the first time that through-thickness FE results have been accurately validated by comparison to non-FE results, in this case by comparison to a recent analytical model of through-thickness variation in cold rolling. While we use here the ABAQUS commercially available FE software, our observations are relevant to all FE simulations of cold rolling. Care is taken by considering both convergence in number of elements through thickness, convergence to a steady state, and the avoidance of other numerical artefacts such as shear locking and hourglassing. We find that previous FE models of cold rolling are usually woefully under-resolved through-thickness; e.g. using 10 elements through-thickness, while we require 60 here for convergence. Convergence of roll force and roll torque, used in previous studies to validate models, are shown to be poor indicators of through-thickness convergence. We also show that the through-thickness oscillatory pattern may have important consequences for predicting curvature during asymmetric rolling.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Density Functional Theory for Strain-Dependent Magnetic Properties of MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ with Diffusion Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we evaluate the predictive power of density functional theory (DFT) for the magnetic properties of MnBi\(_2\)Te\(_4\) (MBT), an intrinsically magnetic topological insulator with potential applications in spintronics and quantum computing. Our theoretical understanding of MBT has been challenged by discrepancies between experimental results and \textit{ab initio} calculations, particularly with respect to its electronic and magnetic properties. Our results show that the magnetic phase diagram of MBT varies significantly depending on the Hubbard $U$ parameter in the DFT framework, highlighting the importance of benchmark calculations. To address these challenges, we establish an optimized Hubbard $U$ approach derived from Diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) calculations, which directly solves the many-body Schr\"{o}dinger equation based on the stochastic process, and implement it in the DFT framework. Once the optimized $U$ value is determined as a function of strain, we apply it to achieve DMC-level accuracy within our DFT framework. This approach is instrumental in accurately describing the magnetic states of MBT and understanding the underlying mechanisms governing its magnetic properties and their dependence on external factors.</description>

      <title>Ultra-thin strain-relieving Si$_{1-x}$Ge$_x$ layers enabling III-V epitaxy on Si</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The explosion of artificial intelligence, possible end of Moore's law, dawn of quantum computing and continued exponential growth of data communications traffic have brought new urgency to the need for laser integration on the diversified Si platform. While diode lasers on III-V platforms have long powered internet data communications and other optoelectronic technologies, direct integration with Si remains problematic. A paradigm-shifting solution requires exploring new and unconventional materials and integration approaches. In this work, we show that a sub-10-nm ultra-thin Si$_{1-x}$Ge$_x$ buffer layer fabricated by an oxidative solid-phase epitaxy process can facilitate extraordinarily efficient strain relaxation. The Si$_{1-x}$Ge$_x$ layer is formed by ion implanting Ge into Si(111) and selectively oxidizing Si atoms in the resulting ion-damaged layer, precipitating a fully strain-relaxed Ge-rich layer between the Si substrate and surface oxide. The efficient strain relaxation results from the high oxidation temperature, producing a periodic network of dislocations at the substrate interface, coinciding with modulations of the Ge content in the Si$_{1-x}$Ge$_x$ layer and indicating the presence of defect-mediated diffusion of Si through the layer. The epitaxial growth of high-quality GaAs is demonstrated on this ultra-thin Si$_{1-x}$Ge$_x$ layer, demonstrating a promising new pathway for integrating III-V lasers directly on the Si platform.</description>

      <title>Low-lying magnon frequency comb in skymion crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A stable, low-power and tunable magnon frequency comb (MFC) is crucial for magnon-based precision measurements, quantum information processing and chip integration. Original method for creating MFC utilizes the nonlinear interactions between propagating spin waves and localized oscillations of an isolated magnetic texture, e.g., skyrmion. It requires a driving frequency well above the ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) and the spectrum frequency of MFC will quickly approach to the detection limit of conventional microwave technique after only tens of comb teeth. In addition, the detection and manipulation of a single skyrmion is challenging in experiments due to its high degree of locality. These issues hinder the applications of MFC. In this work, we report the low-lying MFC with comb frequencies below the FMR in a skyrmion crystal (SkX). We show that the MFC originates from the three-wave mixing between the collective skyrmion gyration and breathing in the SkX. Our findings significantly improve the efficiency of the nonlinear frequency conversion from a single-frequency mircowave input, and establish a synergistic relationship between the SkX and MFC, which paves the way to coherent information processing and ultra-sensitive metrology based on MFC.</description>

      <title>Theory of Magnetoresistance due to Edge Orbital Moment Accumulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The orbital Hall effect, resulting from non-trivial quantum geometry of 2D materials, causes the accumulation of orbital magnetic moment near the system edges. This accumulation contributes to an electric current that flows parallel to the edges, causing a slight decrease in resistance. The accumulation of orbital moment and the resulting change in resistance can be modulated by an in-plane magnetic field. In this work, we investigate this effect in multilayered 2D materials where electrons can move between layers providing a handle through which the resistance can be controlled. The orbital moment dynamics differs from conventional spin dynamics, being governed by an anisotropic effective inverse mass tensor, for which we provide a microscopic expression. We derive phenomenological equations that describe both generation and control of orbital moment accumulations.</description>

      <title>Superconducting gap modulations: are they from pair density waves or pair-breaking scattering?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In his seminal work published in Acta Physica Sinica in 1965, Yu Lu pointed out that the superconducting gap exhibits weak modulations near the pair-breaking magnetic impurity in a superconductor. In the past ten years, a series of high-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy works reported weak superconducting gap modulations in certain superconductors and explained these phenomena as pair density waves. In line with Yu's discovery, Lee DH et al. pointed out that in many cases, the interference effect of pair-breaking scattering can also lead to superconducting gap modulations in space. We will discuss the distinction and unification of these two kinds of mechanisms, as well as their relevance to recent experimental observations.</description>

      <title>Local excitation of kagome spin ice magnetism in HoAgGe seen by scanning tunneling microscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The kagome spin ice can host frustrated magnetic excitations by flipping its local spin. Under an inelastic tunneling condition, the tip in a scanning tunneling microscope can flip the local spin, and we apply this technique to kagome metal HoAgGe with a long-range ordered spin ice ground state. Away from defects, we discover a pair of pronounced dips in the local tunneling spectrum at symmetrical bias voltages with negative intensity values, serving as a striking inelastic tunneling signal. This signal disappears above the spin ice formation temperature and has a dependence on the magnetic fields, demonstrating its intimate relation with the spin ice magnetism. We provide a two-level spin-flip model to explain the tunneling dips considering the spin ice magnetism under spin-orbit coupling. Our results uncover a local emergent excitation of spin ice magnetism in a kagome metal, suggesting that local electrical field induced spin flip climbs over a barrier caused by spin-orbital locking.</description>

      <title>Chiral kagome superconductivity modulations with residual Fermi arcs in KV3Sb5 and CsV3Sb5</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconductivity involving finite momentum pairing can lead to spatial gap and pair density modulations, as well as Bogoliubov Fermi states within the superconducting gap. However, the experimental realization of their intertwined relations has been challenging. Here, we detect chiral kagome superconductivity modulations with residual Fermi arcs in KV3Sb5 and CsV3Sb5 by normal and Josephson scanning tunneling microscopy down to 30mK with resolved electronic energy difference at microelectronvolt level. We observe a U-shaped superconducting gap with flat residual in-gap states. This gap exhibits chiral 2 by 2 spatial modulations with magnetic field tunable chirality, which align with the chiral 2 by 2 pair density modulations observed through Josephson tunneling. These findings demonstrate a chiral pair density wave (PDW) that breaks time-reversal symmetry. Quasiparticle interference imaging of the in-gap zero-energy states reveals segmented arcs, with high-temperature data linking them to parts of the reconstructed V d-orbital states within the charge order. The detected residual Fermi arcs can be explained by the partial suppression of these d-orbital states through an interorbital 2 by 2 PDW and thus serve as candidate Bogoliubov Fermi states. Additionally, we differentiate the observed PDW order from impurity-induced gap modulations. Our observations not only uncover a chiral PDW order with orbital-selectivity, but also illuminate the fundamental space-momentum correspondence inherent in finite momentum paired superconductivity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconductivity and magnetism are antagonistic quantum matter, while their intertwining has long been considered in frustrated-lattice systems1-3. In this work, we utilize scanning tunneling microscopy and muon spin resonance to discover time-reversal symmetry-breaking superconductivity in kagome metal Cs(V,Ta)3Sb5, where the Cooper pairing exhibits magnetism and is modulated by it. In the magnetic channel, we observe spontaneous internal magnetism in a full-gap superconducting state. Under perturbations of inverse magnetic fields, we detect a time-reversal asymmetrical interference of Bogoliubov quasi-particles at a circular vector. At this vector, the pairing gap spontaneously modulates, which is distinct from pair density waves occurring at a point vector and consistent with the theoretical proposal of unusual interference effect under time-reversal symmetry-breaking. The correlation between internal magnetism, Bogoliubov quasi-particles, and pairing modulation provides a chain of experimental clues for time-reversal symmetry-breaking kagome superconductivity.</description>

      <title>A dual-cutoff machine-learned potential for condensed organic systems obtained via uncertainty-guided active learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine-learned potentials (MLPs) trained on ab initio data combine the computational efficiency of classical interatomic potentials with the accuracy and generality of the first-principles method used in the creation of the respective training set. In this work, we implement and train a MLP to obtain an accurate description of the potential energy surface and property predictions for organic compounds, as both single molecules and in the condensed phase. We devise a dual descriptor, based on the atomic cluster expansion (ACE), that couples an information-rich short-range description with a coarser long-range description that captures weak intermolecular interactions. We employ uncertainty-guided active learning for the training set generation, creating a dataset that is comparatively small for the breadth of application and consists of alcohols, alkanes, and an adipate. Utilizing that MLP, we calculate densities of those systems of varying chain lengths as a function of temperature, obtaining a discrepancy of less than 4% compared with experiment. Vibrational frequencies calculated with the MLP have a root mean square error of less than 1 THz compared to DFT. The heat capacities of condensed systems are within 11% of experimental findings, which is strong evidence that the dual descriptor provides an accurate framework for the prediction of both short-range intramolecular and long-range intermolecular interactions.</description>

      <title>Considerations on free-surface detachment and bed entrainment of fluvial plastics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the last decade, fluvial plastics have been identified as major threat to aquatic environments and human health. In order to develop adequate mitigation strategies for plastic pollution, a fundamental process understanding of riverine plastic transport is of significant importance. In this context, the implementation of research findings into numerical simulation environments is anticipated to enhance modelling capabilities and to support a rigorous decision making. Recent experimental research has focused on the incipient motion of plastic particles, as well as on the effects of surface tension on plastic concentration profiles. While these investigations have advanced the state-of-the-art knowledge, current literature still displays a lack of basic insights into layer-specific plastic transport physics. In this study, first principles are applied to advance knowledge on free-surface detachment and bed entrainment of fluvial plastics. A novel relationship for the critical surface detachment velocity is derived, followed by the development of a framework that allows to relate plastic Shields parameters to those of natural sediments. Overall, it is anticipated that these developments will trigger new research within the plastics community, and it is hoped that present findings will be implemented into Lagrangian particle tracking software.</description>

      <title>Revealing the Berry phase under the tunneling barrier</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In quantum mechanics, a quantum wavepacket may acquire a geometrical phase as it evolves along a cyclic trajectory in parameter space. In condensed matter systems, the Berry phase plays a crucial role in fundamental phenomena such as the Hall effect, orbital magnetism, and polarization. Resolving the quantum nature of these processes commonly requires sensitive quantum techniques, as tunneling, being the dominant mechanism in STM microscopy and tunneling transport devices. In this study, we integrate these two phenomena - geometrical phases and tunneling - and observe a complex-valued Berry phase via strong field light matter interactions in condensed matter systems. By manipulating the tunneling barrier, with attoseconds precision, we measure the imaginary Berry phase accumulated as the electron tunnels during a fraction of the optical cycle. Our work opens new theoretical and experimental directions in geometrical phases physics and their realization in condensed matter systems, expanding solid state strong field light metrology to study topological quantum phenomena.</description>

      <title>Chiral Floquet Engineering on Topological Fermions in Chiral Crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interplay of chiralities in light and quantum matter provides an opportunity to design and manipulate chirality-dependent properties in quantum materials. Herein we report the chirality-dependent Floquet engineering on topological fermions with the high Chern number in chiral crystal CoSi via circularly polarized light (CPL) pumping. Intense light pumping does not compromise the gapless nature of topological fermions in CoSi, but displaces the crossing points in momentum space along the direction of light propagation. The Floquet chirality index is proposed to signify the interplay between the chiralities of topological fermion, crystal, and incident light, which determines the amplitudes and directions of light-induced momentum shifts. Regarding the time-reversal symmetry breaking induced by the CPL pumping, momentum shifts of topological fermions result in the birth of transient anomalous Hall signals in non-magnetic CoSi within an ultrafast time scale, which Mid-infrared (IR) pumping and terahertz (THz) Kerr or Faraday probe spectroscopy could experimentally detect. Our findings provide insights into exploring novel applications in optoelectronic devices by leveraging the degree of freedom of chirality in the non-equilibrium regime.</description>

      <title>Relationship between the shear modulus and volume relaxation in high-entropy metallic glasses: experiment and physical origin</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We performed parallel measurements of the high-frequency shear modulus $G$ and relative volume $\Delta V/V$ for high-entropy Ti$_{20}$Zr$_{20}$Hf$_{20}$Be$_{20}$Cu$_{20}$ and Ti$_{20}$Zr$_{20}$Hf$_{20}$Be$_{20}$Ni$_{20}$ glasses upon heating from room temperature up to the complete crystallization. The changes of these properties due to structural relaxation both below and above the glass transition temperature are singled out. It is shown that these changes for both initial and preannealed samples can be well described within the framework of the Interstitialcy theory. It is found that the whole relaxation process in the full temperature range of the experiments for both samples' states can be characterized by a single dimensionless temperature-independent parameter $K_i=dln\;G/dln\;V$, which equals to -44 and -53 for the above glasses, respectively, and strongly points at interstitial-type defects as a source of relaxation. We also show that the relaxation of the relative volume linearly depends on the defect concentration. This behavior can be described by another dimensionless temperature-independent parameter, which is related with the relaxation volume of defects. Possible contribution of vacancy-like defects into the relaxation is discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01751v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An analytical theory is developed for predicting the nonlinear susceptibility of ionic polarization to continuous electromagnetic waves in both bulk and strained thin film ferroelectrics. Using a perturbation method for solving the nonlinear equation of motion for ionic polarization within the framework of Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire theory, the full second-order nonlinear susceptibility tensor is derived as a function of frequency, temperature, and strain. The theory predicts the coexistence of a significantly enhanced second-order dielectric susceptibility and a relatively low dielectric loss in BaTiO3 films with a strain-stabilized monoclinic ferroelectric phase and in a strained SrTiO3 film near its temperature-driven second-order ferroelectric-to-paraelectric phase transition. This work establishes a theoretical framework for predicting and exploiting nonlinear interactions between THz waves and ferroelectric materials, and more generally, suggests exciting opportunities to strain-engineer nonlinear dynamical properties of ferroelectrics beyond the static and quasi-static limits.</description>

      <title>Unidirectional spin waves measured using propagating spin wave spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09107v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dispersion relation of spin waves can vary monotonically about the center of the Brillouin zone, allowing zero-momentum wavepackets to flow unidirectionally, which is of interest for applications. Techniques such as propagating spin wave spectroscopy are inoperative in such cases because of the difficulty to identify the spin wave wavevector at a particular frequency within a spectrum. Here we present a method to analyse this case and apply it to acoustic spin waves in a synthetic antiferromagnet in the scissors state, in which we confirm that propagation parallel to the applied fields is unidirectional. Interestingly, we find that in this unidirectional situation, the phase accumulated by the spin waves propagating between two antenna is not proportional to the antenna spacing. It is also a function of the two other lengths of the problem: the antenna width and the spin wave decay length. Accounting for them is required to avoid wavevector errors in the dispersion relations.</description>

      <title>Origin of the gossamer ferromagnetism in MnTe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14389v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Absence of net magnetization in altermagnetis is both a blessing (no stray fields) and a curse (no obvious way to manipulate altermagnetic domains by external fields). Yet, MnTe was demonstrated experimentally to have no measurable stray fields and yet controllable by external magnetic filed - a win-win situation. In this paper we unravel the microscopic mechanism of this property. It appear to emerge from concerted action of three different mechanisms. Microscopic understanding of the beneficial properties of MnTe opens a road to controllable design of similar altermagnets for spintronics applications.</description>

      <title>Negative Longitudinal Magnetoresistance in the Dirac Semimetal PtSe$_2$ -- Kondo Effect and Surface Spin Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16469v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The emergence of negative longitudinal magnetoresistance in the topologically non-trivial transition-metal dichalcogenide PtSe$_2$ is studied. Low $T$/high $\mu_0 H$ transport is performed for arbitrary field directions, and an analytical framework is established. The source of the negative longitudinal magnetoresistance is identified as the Kondo effect stemming from Pt-vacancies contributing an uncompensated spin, exclusively at the sample surface. The concentration of vacancies and the sample thickness are identified as tuning parameters. The findings are substantiated by density functional theory, which corroborates the proposed Pt-vacancy model.</description>

      <title>Analog control of electrical conductivity in La0.5Sr0.5FeO3-{\delta} through oxygen deficiency induced magnetic transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02539v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Switchability of materials properties by applying controlled stimuli such as voltage pulses is an emerging field of study with applicability in adaptive and programmable devices like neuromorphic transistors or non-emissive smart displays. One of the most exciting approaches to modulate materials performance is mobile ion/vacancy insertion for inducing changes in relevant electrical, optical, or magnetic properties, among others. Unveiling the interplay between changes in the concentration of mobile defects (like oxygen vacancies) and functional properties in relevant materials represents a step forward for underpinning the emerging oxide iontronics discipline. In this work, electrochemical oxide-ion pumping cells were fabricated for an analog control of the oxygen stoichiometry in thin films of mixed ionic-electronic conductor La0.5Sr0.5FeO3-{\delta}. We demonstrate over more than 4 orders of magnitude electronic conductivity control within the same crystallographic phase through the precise and continuous voltage control of the oxygen stoichiometry. We show that behind the modification of the transport properties of the material lays a paramagnetic-to-antiferromagnetic transition. We exploit such magnetoelectric coupling to show control over the exchange interaction between La0.5Sr0.5FeO3-{\delta} and a ferromagnetic Co layer deposited on top.</description>

      <title>Amorphous silicon detectors for proton beam monitoring in FLASH radiotherapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14300v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultra-high dose rate radiation therapy (FLASH) based on proton irradiation is of major interest for cancer treatments but creates new challenges for dose monitoring. Amorphous hydrogenated silicon is known to be one of the most radiation-hard semiconductors. In this study, detectors based on this material are investigated at proton dose rates similar to or exceeding those required for FLASH therapy. Tested detectors comprise two different types of contacts, two different thicknesses deposited either on glass or on polyimide substrates. All detectors exhibit excellent linear behaviour as a function of dose rate up to a value of 20 kGy/s. Linearity is achieved independently of the depletion condition of the device and remarkably in passive (unbiased) conditions. The degradation of the performance as a function of the dose rate and its recovery are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Sub-100-fs formation of dark excitons in monolayer WS2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08390v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are promising for optoelectronic applications due to their strongly bound excitons. While bright excitons have been thoroughly scrutinized, dark excitons are much less investigated as they are not observable with far-field spectroscopy. However, with their non-zero momenta, dark excitons are significant for applications requiring long-range transport or coupling to external fields. We access such dark excitons in WS2 monolayer using transient photoemission electron microscopy with sub-diffraction limited spatial resolution (75 nm) and exceptionally high temporal resolution (13 fs). Image time series of TMD flakes are recorded at several different fluences. We directly observe the ultrafast formation of dark K-Q excitons in monolayer WS2 occurring within 14-50 fs and follow their subsequent picosecond decay. We distinguish exciton dynamics between the interior and edges of the monolayer TMD and conclude that the long-term evolution of dark excitations is defect-mediated while intervalley scattering is not affected.</description>

      <title>Phase shifts, band geometry and responses in triple-Q charge and spin density waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00292v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Triple-Q density waves are often realized in many materials such as charge density waves in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDC) and spin density waves, such as Skyrmion crystal, in B20 compounds. Compared with the single-Q density waves, triple-Q density waves have an internal degree of freedom (phase shift) made from the phase of the order parameters in addition to the translations of density waves. Although this phase shift has been studied in Ginzburg-Landau theory or in spin Hamiltonian, its impact on the electronic states has not yet been explored from the microscopic point of view. Here, we systematically investigate the interference of different Q density waves revealing its pivotal effects depending on the phase shift. We show that the phase shifts play a crucial role in affecting the interference effects of triple-Q density waves on electronic states. Due to such interference, the band geometry in the momentum space becomes nontrivial, where multiband Dirac-like fermions are induced near the Fermi energy. Furthermore, we explicitly establish that the nontrivial band geometry, combined with symmetry-breaking induced by phase shifts, leads to a variety of intriguing linear and nonlinear responses.</description>

      <title>From many-body ab initio to effective excitonic models: a versatile mapping approach including environmental embedding effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07143v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an original multi-state projective diabatization scheme based on the Green's function formalism that allows the systematic mapping of many-body ab initio calculations onto effective excitonic models. This method inherits the ability of the Bethe-Salpeter equation to describe Frenkel molecular excitons and intermolecular charge-transfer states equally well, as well as the possibility for an effective description of environmental effects in a QM/MM framework. The latter is found to be a crucial element in order to obtain accurate model parameters for condensed phases and to ensure their transferability to excitonic models for extended systems. The method is presented through a series of examples illustrating its quality, robustness, and internal consistency.</description>
