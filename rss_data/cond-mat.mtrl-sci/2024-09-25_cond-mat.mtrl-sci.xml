      <title>Smallest [5,6]fullerene as building blocks for 2D networks with superior stability and enhanced photocatalytic performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The assembly of molecules with covalent networks can form varied lattice structures with distinct physical and chemical properties from conventional atomic lattices. Using the smallest stable [5,6]fullerene units as building blocks, various 2D C$_{24}$ networks can be formed with superior stability and strength compared to the recently synthesised monolayer polymeric C$_{60}$. Monolayer C$_{24}$ harnesses the properties of both carbon crystals and fullerene molecules, such as stable chemical bonds, suitable band gaps and large surface area, facilitating photocatalytic water splitting. The electronic band gaps of C$_{24}$ are comparable to TiO$_2$, providing appropriate band edges with sufficient external potential for overall water splitting over the acidic and neutral pH range. Upon photoexcitation, strong solar absorption enabled by strongly bound bright excitons can generate carriers effectively, while the type-II band alignment between C$_{24}$ and other 2D monolayers can separate electrons and holes in individual layers simultaneously. Additionally, the number of surface active sites of C$_{24}$ monolayers are three times more than that of their C$_{60}$ counterparts in a much wider pH range, providing spontaneous reaction pathways for hydrogen evolution reaction. Our work provides insights into materials design using tunable building blocks of fullerene units with tailored functions for energy generation, conversion and storage.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium chemical short-range order in metallic alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metallic alloys are routinely subjected to nonequilibrium processes during manufacturing, such as rapid solidification and thermomechanical processing. It has been suggested in the high-entropy alloy literature that chemical short-range order (SRO) could offer a "new knob" to tailor materials properties. While evidence of the effect of SRO on materials properties accumulates, the state of SRO evolution during alloy manufacturing remains obscure. Here we employ high-fidelity atomistic simulations to track SRO evolution during solidification and thermomechanical processing of alloys. This approach reveals that alloy processing leads to nonequilibrium steady-states of SRO that are less ordered than any equilibrium state. We show that the mechanism behind nonequilibrium SRO formation is an inherent ordering bias present in nonequilibrium events. These results demonstrate that conventional manufacturing processes provide pathways for tuning SRO that lead to a broad nonequilibrium spectrum of SRO states that are beyond the equilibrium design space of alloys.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopy, Crystal-Field, and Transition Intensity Analyses of the C$_{\rm 3v}$(O$^{2-}$) Centre in Er$^{3+}$ Doped CaF$_{2}$ Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Erbium ions in crystals show considerable promise for the technologies that will form the backbone of future networked quantum information technology. Despite advances in leveraging erbium's fibre-compatible infrared transition for classical and quantum applications, the transitions are, in general, not well understood. We present detailed absorption and laser site-selective spectroscopy of the C$_{\rm 3v}$(O$^{2-}$) centre in CaF$_2$:Er$^{3+}$ as an interesting erbium site case study. The $^{4}$I$_{15/2}$Z$_1 \rightarrow {^{4}}$I$_{13/2}$Y$_1$ transition has a low-temperature inhomogeneous linewidth of 1 GHz with hyperfine structure observable from the $^{167}$Er isotope. A parametrized crystal-field Hamiltonian is fitted to 34 energy levels and the two ground state magnetic splitting factors. The wavefunctions are used to perform a transition intensity analysis and electric-dipole parameters are fitted to absorption oscillator strengths. Simulated spectra for the $^{4}$I$_{11/2}\rightarrow {^{4}}$I$_{15/2}$ and $^{4}$I$_{13/2} \rightarrow {^{4}}$I$_{15/2}$ inter-multiplet transitions are in excellent agreement with the experimentally measured spectra. The $^{4}$I$_{13/2}$ excited state lifetime is 25.0\,ms and the intensity calculation is in excellent agreement with this value.</description>

      <title>Laser Site-Selective Spectroscopy and Magnetic Hyperfine Splittings of Ho$^{3+}$ doped Y$_{2}$SiO$_{5}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laser site-selective spectroscopy and high-resolution absorption measurements have been used to determine 51 crystal-field energy levels for one of the Ho$^{3+}$ centres in Y$_{2}$SiO$_{5}$. This centre is denoted as Site 2 and has been tentatively assigned as the seven-fold coordinated centre. High resolution absorption measurements reveal complex hyperfine patterns that obey and approximate selection rule. The application of a magnetic field along the three optical axes reveals the presence of avoided crossings below 0.5 Tesla, in both the ground and excited states.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopy and Crystal-Field Analysis of Low -Symmetry Er$^{3+}$ Centres in K$_2$YF$_5$ Microparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: K$_2$YF$_5$ crystals doped with lanthanide ions have a variety of possible optical applications. Owing to the low symmetry of the system, the crystal structure cannot be unambiguously determined by x-ray diffraction. However, electron-paramagnetic resonance studies have demonstrated that lanthanide ions substitute for yttrium in sites of C$_{\rm s}$ local symmetry. In this work, we use high-resolution absorption and laser spectroscopy to determine electronic energy levels for Er$^{3+}$ ions in K$_2$YF$_5$ microparticles. A total of 39 crystal-field energy levels, distributed among 7 multiplets of the Er$^{3+}$ ion, have been assigned. This optical data is used for crystal-field modelling of the electronic structure of Er$^{3+}$ in K$_2$YF$_5$. Our model is fitted not only to the electronic energy levels, but also to the ground-state g-tensor. This magnetic-splitting data defines the axis system of the calculation, avoiding ambiguities associated with low-symmetry crystal-field fits.</description>

      <title>Theoretical insights into the role of lattice fluctuations on the excited behavior of lead halide perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unravelling the role of charge-lattice interactions on the optoelectronic properties in lead halide perovskites is of great interest due to their unique photophysical properties. While there is broad consensus on the importance of the structural deformations and polar fluctuations on the behavior of charge carriers and quasiparticles, the strongly anharmonic nature of these fluctuations and their strong interactions render theoretical descriptions of lead halides challenging. In this Account, we review our recent efforts to understand how the soft, polar lattice of this class of materials alter their quasiparticle binding energies and fine structure, charge mobilities, and lifetimes of phonons and excess charges. This is reviewed in the context of the effective models we have built, and the novel theoretical methods we have developed to understand bulk crystalline materials, as well as nanostructures, and lower dimensionality lattices. The perspective we detail provides both some design principles for optoelectronic materials and a set of theoretical tools to study them when charge-lattice interactions are important.</description>

      <title>Measuring Chemical Shifts with Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron microscopy prevalently uses energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) for elemental analysis. EDS and EELS energy resolutions are commonly between 30-100 eV or 0.01-1 eV, respectively. Large solid angle EDS detector technology has increased collection efficiency to enable precision spectroscopy via averaging of 0.02-0.1 eV. This improved precision gives access to chemical shifts; examples are shown in compounds of Al, Ti, and W. EDS can now detect chemical information in a complementary parameter space (accelerating voltage, thickness, atomic number) to that covered by EELS.</description>

      <title>Resolving the Valence of Iron Oxides by Resonant Photoemission Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precisely determining the oxidation states of metal cations within variable-valence transition metal oxides remains a significant challenge, yet it is crucial for understanding and predicting the properties of these technologically important materials. Iron oxides, in particular, exhibit a remarkable diversity of electronic structures due to the variable valence states of iron (Fe2+ and Fe3+), however, quantitative analysis using conventional X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is challenging because of significant overlapping of the Fe2p spectra among different oxidation states. In this study, we leverage the intriguing case of Pt supported FeO2 phase of monolayer thickness (ML) as a model system and employ Resonant Photoemission Spectroscopy (ResPES) to directly quantify the cation valence states and compositional ratios in this complex Fe oxide. Our results reveal that this ultrathin FeO2 film (Pt-O-Fe-O), contrary to the +3 valence predicted by density functional theory (DFT), consists of an equal mixture of Fe2+ and Fe3+ cations, yielding an average valence of +2.5. Structurally, FeO2 is likely derived from the Fe3O4 sublattice, featuring an octahedral Fe layer (50% Fe3+ and 50% Fe2+) bonded to upper and lower oxygen layers.</description>

      <title>Choosing Tight-Binding Models for Accurate Optoelectronic Responses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tight-binding models provide great insight and are a low-cost alternative to \emph{ab initio} methods for calculation of a material's electronic structure. These models are used to calculate optical responses, including nonlinear optical effects such as the shift current bulk photovoltaic effect. The validity of tight-binding models is often evaluated by comparing their band structures to those calculated with Density Functional Theory. However, we find that band structure agreement is a necessary but not sufficient condition for accurate optical response calculations. In this Letter, we compute the shift current response and dielectric tensor using a variety of tight-binding models of {MoS$_2$}, including both Slater-Koster and Wannier tight-binding models that treat the Mo $4d$ orbitals and/or S $3p$ orbitals. We also truncate hoppings in the Wannier function models to next-nearest neighbor, as is common in tight-binding methods, in order to gauge the effect on optical response. By examining discrepancies in energies and optical matrix elements, we determine the interpolation quality of the different tight-binding models and establish that agreement in both band structure and wavefunctions is required to accurately model optical response,</description>

      <title>Northeast Materials Database (NEMAD): Enabling Discovery of High Transition Temperature Magnetic Compounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of novel magnetic materials with greater operating temperature ranges and optimized performance is essential for advanced applications. Current data-driven approaches are challenging and limited due to the lack of accurate, comprehensive, and feature-rich databases. This study aims to address this challenge by introducing a new approach that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to create a comprehensive, experiment-based, magnetic materials database named the Northeast Materials Database (NEMAD), which consists of 26,706 magnetic materials (www.nemad.org). The database incorporates chemical composition, magnetic phase transition temperatures, structural details, and magnetic properties. Enabled by NEMAD, machine learning models were developed to classify materials and predict transition temperatures. Our classification model achieved an accuracy of 90% in categorizing materials as ferromagnetic (FM), antiferromagnetic (AFM), and non-magnetic (NM). The regression models predict Curie (N\'eel) temperature with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.86 (0.85) and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 62K (32K). These models identified 62 (19) FM (AFM) candidates with a predicted Curie (N\'eel) temperature above 500K (100K) from the Materials Project. This work shows the feasibility of combining LLMs for automated data extraction and machine learning models in accelerating the discovery of magnetic materials.</description>

      <title>High-dose long-time defect evolution in tungsten studied by atomistically informed Object Kinetic Monte Carlo simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Irradiation of materials in nuclear test reactors and power plants is known to alter the properties of the material. The irradiation event happening at pico- or nanosecond time scales are affecting the evolution and properties of the material on macroscopic timescales. Classical Molecular Dynamics simulations, which can capture the cascade event, are typically limited to nanosecond time scales, resulting in high dose rates. To achieve experimental dose rates, larger-scale models like Object Kinetic Monte Carlo are used, while they lack atomistic detail. The exact evolution of cascades in the vicinity of pre-existing defects is known to affect the defects formed, and the structure and morphology of the defects produced are crucial to know for determining macroscopic material behavior. Here we introduce a novel approach to integrate full Molecular Dynamics-based cascades into Object Kinetic Monte Carlo to achieve accurate dose rates, with the atomistic level accuracy of cascade overlap in tungsten. Our study reveals that incorporating full cascades significantly influences defect concentration levels. Not only is the concentration affected, but also the cluster statistics. We observe both that the full cascade can promote vacancy clustering at low temperatures and it can split existing voids at higher temperatures. These effects are missing in conventional Object Kinetic Monte Carlo simulations. This can be especially important in more complex materials, where many cascade-overlap effects are present.</description>

Abstract: We describe a broadband ferromagnetic resonance spectrometer for scientific and educational applications with a frequency range up to 30 GHz. It is built with low-cost components available off-the-shelf and utilizes 3D printed parts for sample holders and support structures, and requires little assembly. A PCB design for the grounded coplanar waveguide (GCPW) is presented and analysed. We further include a software suite for command-line or script driven data acqusition, a graphical user interface, and a graphical data analysis program. The capabilities of the system design are demonstrated with measurements on ferromagnetic thin films with a thickness of 1 nm. All designs and scripts are published under the GNU GPL v3.0 license.</description>

      <title>Machine-learning potential for phonon transport in AlN with defects in multiple charge states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding phonon transport properties in defect-laden AlN is important for their device applications. Here, we construct a machine-learning potential to describe phonon transport with $ab$ $initio$ accuracy in pristine and defect-laden AlN, following the template of Behler-Parrinello-type neural network potentials (NNPs) but extending them to consider multiple charge states of defects. The high accuracy of our NNP in predicting second- and third-order interatomic force constants is demonstrated through calculations of phonon bands, three-phonon anharmonic, phonon-isotope and phonon-defect scattering rates, and thermal conductivity. In particular, our NNP accurately describes the difference in phonon-related properties among various native defects and among different charge states of the defects. They reveal that the phonon-defect scattering rates induced by V$_{N}^{3+}$ are the largest, followed by V$_{Al}^{3-}$, and that V$_{N}^{1+}$ is the least effective scatterer. This is further confirmed by the magnitude of the respective depressions of the thermal conductivity of AlN. Our findings reveal the significance of the contribution from structural distortions induced by defects to the elastic scattering rates. The present work shows the usefulness of our NNP scheme to cost-efficiently study phonon transport in partially disordered crystalline phases containing charged defects.</description>

      <title>Tracing Ion Migration in Halide Perovskites with Machine Learned Force Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Halide perovskite optoelectronic devices suffer from chemical degradation and current-voltage hysteresis induced by migration of highly mobile charged defects. Atomic scale molecular dynamics simulations can capture the motion of these ionic defects, but classical force fields are too inflexible to describe their dynamical charge states. Using CsPbI3 as a case study, we develop machine learned force fields from density functional theory calculations and study the diffusion of charged halide interstitial and vacancy defects in bulk CsPbI3. We find that negative iodide interstitials and positive iodide vacancies, the most stable charge states for their respective defect type, migrate at similar rates at room temperature. Neutral interstitials are faster, but neutral vacancies are one order of magnitude slower. Oppositely charged interstitials and vacancies, as they can occur in device operation or reverse bias conditions, are significantly slower and can be considered relatively immobile.</description>

      <title>Modulating dislocation reactions through preferential hydrogen segregation in bcc metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction between dislocations is fundamental to plastic deformation, work hardening, and defect accumulation. While extensive research has focused on the impact of solutes on individual dislocations, how solutes affect dislocation-dislocation reactions remains largely unexplored. Here, using atomistic simulations of iron as a model bcc system, we demonstrate that hydrogen solutes enable two &lt;111&gt;/2 screw dislocations to react and form a &lt;001&gt; edge dislocation junction, a process that is otherwise unfavorable in hydrogen-free environments. This phenomenon arises from the preferential segregation of hydrogen around the &lt;001&gt; dislocation, which reduces the energy of the reaction product. The resulting &lt;001&gt; dislocation demonstrates remarkable stability and transforms into a &lt;001&gt; vacancy-type dislocation loop under strain. These vacancy-type dislocation loops can accumulate during continuous deformation and dislocation reactions, serving as precursors for the initiation of structural damage, such as cracking and blistering. Our findings highlight the pivotal role of hydrogen in dislocation reactions, uncover a novel defect accumulation mechanism crucial for interpreting recent experimental observations, and represent a significant advance in understanding hydrogen-induced damage in bcc metals.</description>

      <title>The Arrhenius Law Prefactor in Permalloy Mesoscale Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Arrhenius equation was used to describe the dynamics of two-state switching in mesoscale, ferromagnetic particles. Using square, permalloy dots as an idealized two-state switching system, measurements of the prefactor of the Arrhenius law changed by 26 decades over barrier heights from 30 meV to 700 meV. Measurements of the prefactor ratios for a two well system revealed significant deviations from the common interpretation of the Arrhenius law. The anomalous Arrhenius prefactors and the prefactor ratios can be fitted to a modified model that includes entropic contributions to two-state transitions. Similar considerations are likely for the application of the Arrhenius law to other mesoscale systems.</description>

      <title>Enhanced magnetoelectric coupling in two-dimensional hybrid multiferroic heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetoelectric coupling in insulating multiferroic materials is invaluable for both fundamental research and multifunctional device applications. However, material realization remains a significant challenge. We employ first-principles calculations to predict an enhanced and stacking-robust magnetoelectric coupling in a multiferroic van der Waals heterostructure consisting of CrCl3 and CuCrP2S6. Within this heterostructure, the intralayer ferroic orders exhibit characteristics of a type-I multiferroic, while the interlayer ferroic orders resemble those of a type-II multiferroic, thus creating a hybrid-type multiferroic. Notably, the interlayer magnetic configuration can be switched upon electric polarization reversal, while maintaining the insulating property without any nontrivial phase transitions. Our analysis reveals a strongly interfacial spin local-field effect and proximity polarization effect on band alignments. These factors work synergistically to decide the interlayer exchange interaction and drive enhanced magnetoelectric coupling. Finally, we show that this magnetoelectric effect is robust in multi-layer structures, exhibiting a dependence on the layer number's parity. This research offers promising prospects for discovering enhanced magnetoelectric couplings in hybrid multiferroic van der Waals heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Untangling the Raman spectrum of cubic and tetragonal BaZrO$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Raman spectroscopy is a widely used experimental technique to study the vibrational properties of solids. Atomic scale simulations can be used to predict such spectra, but trustworthy studies at finite temperatures are challenging, mainly due to the requirement of accurate and computationally efficient models for the dielectric susceptibility. Here, we have made use of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations together with a density functional theory (DFT) based model for the dielectric susceptibility to determine the Raman spectrum of barium zirconate, BaZrO$_3$ (BZO), a well-studied oxide perovskite. At ambient conditions, where the system is cubic, we find excellent agreement with experimentally measured Raman spectra. Our study establishes that the relatively sharp spectra seen experimentally are due to second-order scattering. At higher pressures, where BZO is tetragonal, all first-order Raman active modes are identified. Additionally, slightly below the phase transition, in the cubic phase, a broad "central Raman peak" appears. The origin of this type of peak is controversial and extensively debated in connection to the dynamics of the halide perovskites. Here, we show that it is also present in a "hard" oxide perovskite, and it originates from the highly overdamped R-tilt mode in the cubic structure.</description>

      <title>Raman Spectra and Excitonic Effects of the novel Ta$_2$Ni$_3$Te$_5$ Monolayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have investigated the Raman spectrum and excitonic effects of the novel two-dimensional Ta$_2$Ni$_3$Te$_5$ structure. The monolayer is an indirect band gap semiconductor with an electronic band gap value of 0.09 eV and 0.38 eV, determined using GGA-PBE and HSE06 exchange-correlation functionals, respectively. Since this structure is energetically, dynamically, and mechanically stable, it could be synthesized as a free-standing material. We identify ten Raman and ten infrared active modes for various laser energies, including those commonly used in Raman spectroscopy experiments. It was also observed that the contribution of Ni atoms is minimal in most Raman vibrational modes. In contrast, most infrared vibrational modes do not involve the vibration of the Ta atoms. As far as the optical properties are concerned, this monolayer shows a robust linear anisotropy, an exciton binding energy of 287 meV, and also presents a high reflectivity in the ultraviolet region, which is more intense for linear light polarization along the x-direction.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Small Polaron Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarons are crucial for charge transport in semiconductors, significantly impacting material properties and device performance. The dynamics of small polarons can be investigated using first-principles molecular dynamics. However, the limited timescale of these simulations presents a challenge for adequately sampling infrequent polaron hopping events. Here, we introduce a message-passing neural network that learns the polaronic potential energy surface by encoding the polaronic state, allowing for simulations of polaron hopping dynamics at the nanosecond scale. By leveraging the statistical significance of the long timescale, our framework can accurately estimate polaron (anisotropic) mobilities and activation barriers in prototypical polaronic oxides across different scenarios (hole polarons in rocksalt MgO and electron polarons in pristine and F-doped rutile TiO$_2$) in excellent agreement with experimental observations.</description>

      <title>Size Effect on Raman Measured Stress and Strain Induced Phonon Shifts in Ultra-Thin Film Silicon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fabrication of complex nano-scale structures, which is a crucial step in the scaling of (nano) electronic devices, often leads to residual stress in the different layers present. This stress gradient can change many of the material properties and leads to desired or undesired effects, especially in the active part of the transistor, its channel. Measuring, understanding, and, ultimately, controlling the stress fields is hence crucial for many design steps.The level of stress can in principle be measured by micro-Raman spectroscopy. This, however, requires \emph{a priori} knowledge of the mechanical properties of the material. The mechanical properties start to deviate from the bulk values when film dimensions become thinner than 5 nm. If this effect is ignored, errors of up to 400\% can be introduced in the extracted stress profile. In this work, we illustrate this effect for a range of Si (001) slabs with different silicon film thickness, ranging from 5 to 0.7 nm and provide best practices for the proper interpretation of micro-Raman stress measurements.</description>

      <title>An Informatics Framework for the Design of Sustainable, Chemically Recyclable, Synthetically-Accessible and Durable Polymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel approach to design durable and chemically recyclable ring-opening polymerization (ROP) class polymers. This approach employs digital reactions using virtual forward synthesis (VFS) to generate over 7 million ROP polymers and machine learning techniques to rapidly predict thermal, thermodynamic and mechanical properties crucial for application-specific performance and recyclability. This combined methodology enables the generation and evaluation of millions of hypothetical ROP polymers from known and commercially available molecules, guiding the selection of approximately 35,000 candidates with optimal features for sustainability and practical utility. Three of these recommended candidates have passed validation tests in the physical lab - two of the three by others, as published previously elsewhere, and one of them is a new thiocane polymer synthesized, tested and reported here. This paper presents the framework, methodology, and initial findings of our study, highlighting the potential of VFS and machine learning to enable a large-scale search of the polymer universe and advance the development of recyclable and environmentally benign polymers.</description>

      <title>A Comparison of the Spatial Statistics of Random and Defined-Sequence Photoresist Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The resolution-line edge roughness-sensitivity tradeoff has motivated exploration of potential improvements using defined sequence polymers and polymer-bound photoacid generators and quenchers. In this study we characterize the internal structures of positive tone photoresist polymer films formed from defined sequence polymers and compare them to random copolymers of the same composition. We model their imaging to connect initial to developable film structures. We use a polymer packing algorithm to simulate films of diverse compositions and locations of photoacid generators and quenchers, using the composition of an ESCAP photoresist. We use a simple EUV exposure-deprotection algorithm to model developable image formation within them. In all cases, the spatial distribution of chemical moieties in the film for defined sequence polymers is nearly indistinguishable from random copolymers. We evaluate several exposure-deprotection scenarios, and find that a defined sequence copolymer has a distinctive developable image under certain circumstances. The use of defined sequence polymers within a photoresist layer does not automatically result in improved imaging, however they do have some characteristics different from random polymers of the same composition. Further study of these characteristics may provide a route to improved control over the nanoscale imaging process.</description>

      <title>Supply Risk-Aware Alloy Discovery and Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Materials design is a critical driver of innovation, yet overlooking the technological, economic, and environmental risks inherent in materials and their supply chains can lead to unsustainable and risk-prone solutions. To address this, we present a novel risk-aware design approach that integrates Supply-Chain Aware Design Strategies into the materials development process. This approach leverages existing language models and text analysis to develop a specialized model for predicting materials feedstock supply risk indices. To efficiently navigate the multi-objective, multi-constraint design space, we employ Batch Bayesian Optimization (BBO), enabling the identification of Pareto-optimal high entropy alloys (HEAs) that balance performance objectives with minimized supply risk. A case study using the MoNbTiVW system demonstrates the efficacy of our approach in four scenarios, highlighting the significant impact of incorporating supply risk into the design process. By optimizing for both performance and supply risk, we ensure that the developed alloys are not only high-performing but also sustainable and economically viable. This integrated approach represents a critical step towards a future where materials discovery and design seamlessly consider sustainability, supply chain dynamics, and comprehensive life cycle analysis.</description>

      <title>Switching of magnetic domains in a noncollinear antiferromagnet at the nanoscale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Antiferromagnets that display very small stray magnetic field are ideal for spintronic applications. Of particular interest are non-collinear, chiral antiferromagnets of the type Mn3X (X=Sn, Ge), which display a large magnetotransport response that is correlated with their antiferromagnetic ordering. The ability to read out and manipulate this ordering is crucial for their integration into spintronic devices. These materials exhibit a tiny unbalanced magnetic moment such that a large external magnetic field can, in principle, be used to set the material into a single antiferromagnetic domain. However, in thin films of Mn3Sn, we find that such fields induce only a partial magnetic ordering. By detecting two orthogonal in-plane components of the magnetic order vector, we find that the non-switchable fraction has a unidirectional anisotropy. This also enables us to visualize switching along multiple easy axes in Mn3Sn. Studying the switching at the nanoscale allows us to correlate the pining behavior to crystal grain boundaries in the Mn3Sn nanowire structures.</description>

      <title>Deep-learning real-time phase retrieval of imperfect diffraction patterns from X-ray free-electron lasers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning is attracting surging interest across nearly all scientific areas by enabling the analysis of large datasets and the extraction of scientific information from incomplete data. Data-driven science is rapidly growing, especially in X-ray methodologies, where advanced light sources and detection technologies accumulate vast amounts of data that exceed meticulous human inspection capabilities. Despite the increasing demands, the full application of machine learning has been hindered by the need for data-specific optimizations. In this study, we introduce a new deep-learning-based phase retrieval method for imperfect diffraction data. This method provides robust phase retrieval for simulated data and performs well on weak-signal single-pulse diffraction data from X-ray free-electron lasers. Moreover, the method significantly reduces data processing time, facilitating real-time image reconstructions that are crucial for high-repetition-rate data acquisition. Thus, this approach offers a reliable solution to the phase problem and is expected to be widely adopted across various research areas.</description>

      <title>Simultaneously enhancing brightness and purity of WSe$_2$ single photon emitter using high-aspect-ratio nanopillar array on metal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monolayer semiconductor transferred on nanopillar arrays provides site-controlled, on-chip single photon emission, which is a scalable light source platform for quantum technologies. However, the brightness of these emitters reported to date often falls short of the perceived requirement for such applications. Also, the single photon purity usually degrades as the brightness increases. Hence, there is a need for a design methodology to achieve enhanced emission rate while maintaining high single photon purity. Using WSe$_2$ on high-aspect-ratio ($\sim 3$ - at least two-fold higher than previous reports) nanopillar arrays, here we demonstrate $&gt;10$ MHz single photon emission rate in the 770-800 nm band that is compatible with quantum memory and repeater networks (Rb-87-D1/D2 lines), and satellite quantum communication. The emitters exhibit excellent purity (even at high emission rates) and improved out-coupling due to the use of a gold back reflector that quenches the emission away from the nanopillar.</description>

      <title>Nonstationary behavior of the upconversion processes of $Er^{3+}:Yb^{3+}$ ions pair doping the $Y_2O_3$ ceramic illuminated with 976 nm laser light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The studies of the upconversion response of RE ions in various hosts usually depict a static picture, whereas, at constant illumination, the upconverted emission is also constant. We discovered here that, at least in the case of $Y_2O_3$ doped with $Er^{3+}:Yb^{3+}$, this is not the case. At constant illuminated power, the upconversion emission is not only fluctuating, but it varies in a manner which seems to be a superposition of intensity waves with different frequencies. We present here the results of the measurements we've performed on $Y_2O_3$ with $1\%Er^{3+}-2\%Yb^{3+}$. The origin of this effect remain to be established but it shows that the energy transfers during the upconversion are an interplay of absorption-saturation-emission-relaxation processes.</description>

Abstract: Discovery of polar skyrmions on the (PbTiO$_3$)$_n$/(SrTiO$_3$)$_n$ superlattice in the absence of any known interaction, which can orient electric polarizations at a point with respect to its neighboring points, is enigmatic. We here show that the coupling of the electric polarization and strain at each layer is responsible for orienting polarizations. We formulate coupled Euler equations for electric polarization and elastic displacement vectors, and solve to find skyrmion solution for a range of electric fields with unique topological number in each layer. The types of skyrmions vary from Neel to Bloch depending on the position of the layers in the superlattice, as observed in the experiments.</description>

      <title>Electric field management in $\beta$-$Ga_2O_3$ vertical Schottky diodes using high-k bismuth zinc niobium oxide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we have integrated bismuth zinc niobium oxide (BZN), a high-k dielectric material, in metal-insulator-semiconductor (MIS) and field-plated metal-semiconductor (FP-MS) Schottky barrier diodes on $\beta$-$Ga_2O_3$. This increases the breakdown voltage ($V_{BR}$) from 300 V to 600 V by redistributing the electric fields, leveraging the high permittivity of BZN (k ~210). Enhancement in Schottky barrier height, by approximately 0.14 eV for MIS and 0.28 eV for FP-MS devices, also contributes to the improved $V_{BR}$. BZN inclusion has minimal impact on specific on-resistance ($R_{on,sp}$). Additionally, the devices display excellent current-voltage characteristics with ideality factors close to unity and an on/off current ratio greater than 1010. This work presents the most significant $V_{BR}$ enhancement reported-to-date for MIS devices on $\beta$-$Ga_2O_3$ without compromising turn-on voltage and $R_{on,sp}$. A comparison of FP-MS and MIS devices shows that FP-MS outperforms MIS in terms of lower $R_{on,sp}$, higher Schottky barrier height, and improved VBR.</description>

      <title>Manipulating Photogalvanic Effects in Two-Dimensional Multiferroic Breathing Kagome Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiferroic materials, known for their multiple tunable orders, present an exceptional opportunity to manipulate nonlinear optical responses, which are sensitive to symmetry. In this study, we propose leveraging electric and magnetic fields to selectively control and switch specific types of photogalvanic effects in two-dimensional multiferroic breathing kagome materials. Taking monolayer Nb3I8 as an example, we demonstrate that the shift current, characterized by the real-space shift of electrons and holes, is predominantly unaffected by magnetic order. In contrast, injection current, featured by quantum metric dipole in momentum space, is closely related to valley polarization which can be controlled by magnetic field. Furthermore, both photocurrents can be reversed by out-of-plane electric field via the lattice breathing. Our findings reveal the potential of multiferroic beathing kagome structures for multifunctional optoelectronic applications and sensors.</description>

      <title>Simulations of Nanocrystalline Iron Formation under High Shear Strain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.17090v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-shear methods have long been used in experiments to refine grain structures in metals, yet the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. We demonstrate a refinement process using molecular dynamic simulations of iron, wherein nanocrystalline structures are generated from initially perfect lattices under high-shear strain. The simulation cells undergo a highly disordered state, followed by an atomic reordering and grain coarsening, resulting in nanograins. We explore the dependence on parameters such as temperature, heat dissipation rate, shear strain rate, and carbon impurity concentration. Higher temperatures lead to the formation of larger and longer grains. The faster heat dissipation sample initially yields more small grains, but their number subsequently reduces, and is lower than the slower heat dissipation sample at approximately {\gamma} = 1.5. Slower strain rates do not promote nanograin formation. The presence of carbon impurities appears to have little effect on grain formation. This detailed analysis affords insight into the mechanisms that control the formation of nanograins under high-shear conditions.</description>

      <title>Influence of Polymer on Shock-Induced Pore Collapse: Hotspot Criticality through Reactive Molecular Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02234v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The shock initiation of energetic materials is mediated by the localization of mechanical energy into hotspots. These originate through the interaction of the shock and material microstructure; the most potent hotspots are formed by the collapse of porosity. Recent work using molecular dynamics (MD) has shed light on the molecular mechanisms responsible for the shock-to-deflagration transition following pore collapse in pure energetic materials. However, explosive formulations are composites of energetic crystals and a polymer binder, which differs from the prior focus on pure materials. The role of polymer phases on hotspot formation and its criticality is not well-understood. We use reactive MD simulations to investigate the role of polystyrene and polyvinyl nitrate films around pores in the shock-induced pore collapse of RDX. The polymer affects the hotspots' temperature and their criticality. While the presence of inert polymer often delays or hinders chemical reactions of the energetic material, certain geometries accelerate chemistry. The simulations provide a mechanistic understanding of these phenomena.</description>

      <title>Ab-initio study of quantum oscillation in altermagnetic and nonmagnetic phases of RuO$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17807v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Altermagnet (AM) is a new proposed magnetic state with collinear antiferromagnetic ground state but presents some transport properties that were only believed to exist in ferromagnets or non-collinear antiferromagnets. To have a comprehensive understanding of the transport properties of AMs, especially from the experimental point of view, a promising altermagnetic metal is crucial. In all the proposed altermagnetic metals, RuO$_2$ has a special position, since it is the first proposed AM with the largest spin splitting and several important altermagnetism featured experiments were first performed based on it. However, a very recent report based on sensitive muon-spin measurements suggest a super small local magnetization from Ru, i.e. a nonmagnetic ground state in RuO$_2$. Therefore, a determination of the existence of the altermagnetic ground state is the basic starting point for all the previously altermagnetic transport properties in RuO$_2$. In this work, we propose to identify its magnetic ground state from the Fermi surface (FS) via the electronic transport property of quantum oscillation (QO). We systematically analyzed the FSs of RuO$_2$ in both nonmagnetic and altermagnetic states via first principles calculations. Our work should be helpful for future experiments on QO measurements to confirm its ground state by the interplay between transport measurements and computations.</description>

      <title>The influence of magnon renormalization and interband coupling on the spin Seebeck effect in YIG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10058v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With exceptionally low magnetic damping, YIG has been extensively applied in the realm of magnetism, encompassing the researches into the spin Seebeck effect. YIG has 20 magnon bands, including 8 higher-energy bands denoted as $\alpha_{1\sim8}$, and 12 lower-energy bands denoted as $\beta_{1\sim12}$. Here, we study the impact of the complex intraband and interband magnon couplings on the transport coefficients of YIG. Four-magnon processes in YIG are considered, and a self-consistent mean-field approximation is made for these interaction terms. We find that the $\beta$ bands exhibit minimal variation with increasing temperature, whereas the $\alpha$ bands undergo a noticeable decline as the temperature rises. These counterintuitive results agree well with the observation of earlier inelastic neutron scattering experiments and the results of the theoretical calculations in recent years. We also find it sufficient to include only the contribution of magnons on the acoustic band $\beta_1$ when studying the spin conductivity ($\sigma_m$). However, when calculating the spin Seebeck coefficient ($S_m$) and the magnon thermal conductivity ($\kappa_m$), the results calculated using only $\beta_{1}$ show noticeable deviations over a large temperature range compared to the full band calculations. These deviations are well mitigated when the $\beta_{2}$ and $\beta_{3}$ bands are considered. Finally, we find our results satisfy the Wiedemann-Franz law for magnon transport.</description>

Abstract: The Janus VSBrI monolayer, identified by first-principles calculations, emerges as a promising semiconducting material with desirable ferromagnetic and ferroelectric properties. It's in-plane magnetic anisotropic energy is up to 460 $\mu$eV/V , and in-plane and out-of-plane piezoelectric strain coefficients are larger than many other known two-dimensional materials. The energy variations among different magnetic states show a strong correlate with polarization. Interestingly, the stability of the ferroelectric phase can be further enhanced by the application of biaxial tensile strain. These intriguing properties make the Janus VSBrI monolayer highly desirable for practical applications in piezoelectronic devices, and a promising candidate for multifunctional spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Comparison of intermediate-range order in GeO$_2$ glass: molecular dynamics using machine-learning interatomic potential vs.\ reverse Monte Carlo fitting to experimental data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06982v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The short and intermediate-range order in GeO$_2$ glass are investigated by molecular dynamics using machine-learning interatomic potential trained on ab initio calculation data and compared with reverse Monte Carlo fitting of neutron diffraction data. To characterize the structural differences in each model, the total/partial structure factors, coordination number, ring size and shape distributions, and persistent homology analysis were performed. These results show that although the two approaches yield similar two-body correlations, they can lead to three-dimensional models with very different short and intermediate-range ordering. A clear difference was observed especially in the ring distributions; RMC models exhibit a broad distribution in the ring size distribution, while neural network potential molecular dynamics yield much narrower ring distributions. This confirms that the density functional approximation in the ab initio calculations determines the preferred network assembly more strictly than RMC with simple coordination constraints and neutron diffraction data with isotope substitution.</description>

      <title>Giant Strain Tunability in Polycrystalline Ceramic Films via Helium Implantation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13505v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strain engineering is a powerful tool routinely used to control and enhance properties such as ferroelectricity, magnetic ordering, or metal-insulator transitions. Epitaxial strain in thin films allows manipulation of in-plane lattice parameters, achieving strain values generally up to 4\%, and above in some specific cases. In polycrystalline films, which are more suitable for functional applications due to their lower fabrication costs, strains above 1% often cause cracking. This poses challenges for functional property tuning by strain engineering. Helium implantation has been shown to induce negative pressure through interstitial implantation, which increases the unit cell volume and allows for continuous strain tuning with the implanted dose in epitaxial monocrystalline films. However, there have been no studies on the transferability of helium implantation as a strain-engineering technique to polycrystalline films. Here, we demonstrate the technique's applicability for strain engineering beyond epitaxial monocrystalline samples. Helium implantation can trigger an unprecedented lattice parameter expansion of up to 3.2% in polycrystalline BiFeO3 films without causing structural cracks. The film maintains stable ferroelectric properties with doses up to 1E15 He/cm2. This finding underscores the potential of helium implantation in strain engineering polycrystalline materials, enabling cost-effective and versatile applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.15153v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the effect of hole doping on the Kitaev spin liquid (KSL) and find that for ferromagnetic (FM) Kitaev exchange $K$ the system is very susceptible to the formation of a FM spin polarization. Through density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations on finite systems, we uncover that the introduction of a single hole with a hopping strength of just $t\sim{}0.28K$ is enough to disrupt fractionalization and polarize the spins in the [001] direction due to an order-by-disorder mechanism. Taking into account a material relevant FM anisotropic spin exchange $\varGamma$ drives the polarization towards the [111] direction via a reorientation transition into a topological FM state with chiral magnon excitations. We develop a parton mean-field theory incorporating fermionic holons and bosonic spinons/magnons, which accounts for the doping induced FM phases and topological magnon excitations. We discuss experimental signatures and implications for Kitaev candidate materials.</description>

      <title>Orbital Hall Conductivity in a Graphene/Haldane and Haldane/Haldane Bilayers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.06447v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the orbital Hall conductivity in bilayer graphene (G/G) by modifying one or both the layers as Haldane type ($\rm G/ \tilde G$ : Graphene/Haldane and $\rm \tilde G/ \tilde G$ : Haldane/Haldane) with the inclusion of next nearest neighbour (NNN) hopping strength ($t_2$) and flux ($\phi$). It is observed that the low energy bands of $\rm G/ \tilde G$ and $\rm \tilde G/ \tilde G$ are isolated with a gap at charge neutrality with the next nearest neighbour (NNN) hopping term $t_2e^{\pm i\phi}$. The time reversal (\textit{TR}) symmetry breaking with $t_2e^{\pm i\phi}$ induces a large orbital magnetic moment ($\vb{m}_n(\vb{k})$) for the $n^{th}$ band in $\rm G/ \tilde G$ and $\rm \tilde G/ \tilde G$ bilayers. This \textit{TR} symmetry breaking, modulated by the $t_2$ strength, leads to the emergence of {\it Orbital Ferromagnetism} and {\it Valley Orbital Magnetism} within the BZ for the Haldane single layer as well for both $\rm G/ \tilde G$ and $\rm \tilde G/ \tilde G$. We show that for the applied longitudinal electric fields, the intrinsic angular momentum ($L^z$) gives the orbital current ($\mathcal{J}^{z,orb}$) along a transverse direction and generates the orbital Hall conductivity (OHC). We further show that the orbital magnetic polarity leads the Haldane single layer to {\it Orbital Chern Insulator} with the quantized OHC in the gap over the occupied bands. Moreover, the accumulation of orbital magnetic moment of the bands in Haldane graphene bilayer shows {\it Quantum Orbital Hall Insulator} and {\it Orbital Chern Insulators}. Similarly, we show that in the hetero-bilayers, one of the layers of the Haldane type generates the orbital magnetism and induces the OHC. We conclude that the isolated bands in Haldane graphene bilayers with external stimuli are of an orbital nature and have various quantum orbital Hall phases.</description>

      <title>Universal collective Larmor-Silin mode emerging in magnetized correlated Dirac fermions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14358v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Employing large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we find that in the magnetized interacting Dirac fermion model there emerges a universal collective Larmor-Silin spin wave mode in the transverse dynamical spin susceptibility. Such mode purely originates from the interaction among Dirac fermions and distinguishes itself from the usual particle-hole continuum with finite lifetime and clear dispersion, both at small and large momenta in a large portion of the Brillouin zone. Our unbiased numerical results offer the dynamic signature of this collective excitation in interacting Dirac fermion systems, and provide experimental guidance for inelastic neutron scattering, electron spin resonance, and other spectroscopic approaches in the investigation of such universal collective modes in quantum Moire materials, topological insulators, and quantum spin liquid materials under magnetic field, with quintessential interaction nature beyond the commonly assumed noninteracting Dirac fermion or spinon approximations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03688v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The kagome material CsTi$_3$Bi$_5$, which is isostructural to the extensively studied charge density wave (CDW) compound CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, exhibits intriguing electronic features within its two-dimensional kagome lattices of titanium atoms. Here, we perform optical spectroscopic measurements together with the first-principles calculations on single-crystalline CsTi$_3$Bi$_5$ to investigate its electronic properties comprehensively. It is found that the overall optical spectra are very similar to those of CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, but the existence of CDW instability is ruled out in CsTi$_3$Bi$_5$. Via careful comparison to the optical responses of CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, we attribute this difference to a significant reduction in the itinerant carrier density of CsTi$_3$Bi$_5$, which is associated with the absence of van Hove singularity near the Fermi level at $M$ point. This result supports the scenario that the CDW in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ is driven by the nesting of van Hove singularity. Additionally, we unveil some exotic low-lying absorption features, which provide clear evidence of flat bands in CsTi$_3$Bi$_5$. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of exotic phenomena in CsTi$_3$Bi$_5$ and provide valuable insights into the role of van Hove singularity in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$.</description>

Abstract: We present a comprehensive study on enhancing the thermoelectric (TE) performance of bilayer graphene (BLG) through irradiation with arbitrarily polarized light, focusing on $AA$- and $AB$-stacked configurations with zigzag edges. Utilizing a combination of tight-binding theory and density functional theory (DFT), we systematically analyze the impact of light irradiation on electronic and phononic transport properties. Light irradiation alters the electronic hopping parameters, creating an asymmetric transmission function, which significantly increases the Seebeck coefficient, thereby boosting the overall {\it figure of merit} (FOM). For the phononic contribution, DFT calculations reveal that $AB$-stacked BLG exhibits lower lattice thermal conductivity compared to $AA$-stacked, attributed to enhanced anharmonic scattering and phonon group velocity. The combined analysis shows that FOM exceeds unity in both stacking types, with notable improvements near the irradiation-induced gap. Additionally, we explore the dependence of FOM on the system dimensions and temperature, demonstrating that light-irradiated BLG holds great promise for efficient thermoelectric energy conversion and waste heat recovery. Our results show favorable responses over a wide range of irradiation parameters. These findings provide crucial insights into optimizing BLG for advanced TE applications through light-induced modifications.</description>

Abstract: Nano-positioning plays a very important role in applications such as scanning probe microscopy and optics. We report the development of a compact inertial nanopositioner along with fully computer interfaced electronics operating down to 2 K, and its use in our fully automated needle-anvil type Point Contact Andreev Reflection (PCAR) apparatus. We also present the fully automated operational procedures using LabVIEW interface with our home-built electronics. The point contact spectroscopy probe has been successfully used to perform PCAR measurements on elemental superconductors at low temperatures. The small footprint of our nano-positioner makes it ideally suited for incorporation in low temperature scanning probe microscopes and makes this design versatile for various research and industrial purposes.</description>
