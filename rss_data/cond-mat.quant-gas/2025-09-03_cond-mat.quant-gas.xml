      <title>In search of exotic pairing in the Hubbard model: many-body computation and quantum gas microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pair density waves and exotic superconductivity have long been of strong interest, and have attracted much recent attention. We present a joint theoretical and experimental exploration of possible signatures of fermion pairing with finite center-of-mass momentum, or the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) order. Experimentally a doped and spin-imbalanced attractive two-dimensional Hubbard model is realized with a cold atomic gas in an optical lattice, and quantum gas microscopy is used to probe its properties. Computationally we study the same model with state-of-the-art constrained-path (CP) auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC). Direct comparisons between experiment and computation on various short-range magnetic and charge correlations show excellent agreement. We then investigate these correlations, as well as pairing correlation functions, systematically to low temperatures with CP-AFQMC, and determine parameter regimes in density and magnetization where signatures of FFLO order may be observed. We show that the temperature at which precursors of such orders appear is already within reach of the current experiment. We discuss routes for direct experimental detection and measurements of such states.</description>

      <title>Efficient determination of eigenenergies and eigenstates of $N$ ($N=3$--$4$) identical 1D bosons and fermions under external harmonic confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Few-atom systems play an important role in understanding the transition from few- to many-body quantum behaviors. This work introduces a new approach for determining the energy spectra and eigenstates of small harmonically trapped single-component Bose and Fermi gases with additive two-body zero-range interactions in one spatial dimension. The interactions for bosons are the usual $\delta$-function interactions while those for fermions are $\delta$-function interactions that contain derivative operators. Details of the derivation and benchmarks of the numerical scheme are presented. Extensions to other systems are discussed.</description>

      <title>Emergence of spin-mixed superstripe phases in spin-orbit coupled spin-1 condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the ground state phases and quench dynamics of spin-orbit coupled spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensates with ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions. For finite Rabi coupling, the system exhibits zero-momentum, elongated zero-momentum, and stripe phases, while in the limit $\Omega\rightarrow 0$, the superstripe wave phases emerge. Varying the attractive density-density ($c_0$) and spin-exchange ($c_2$) interactions induces the transition from stripe and superstripe phases to the elongated zero-momentum phase, characterized by miscibility and polarization. The condensate remains miscible in the zero-momentum phase and partially miscible for the elongated, stripe, and superstripe phases. Quenching in Rabi coupling stabilizes the condensate, while spin-orbit coupling quenching leads to fluctuations or the formation of complex patterns, with the stripe phase exhibiting the vanishing of the zeroth spin component over time. Our results may offer valuable insights into engineering exotic quantum phases in ultracold atomic gases.</description>

      <title>Controlled Buildup of Half-Quantized Thermal Conductance in an Engineered Chiral Spin Liquid Platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study thermal transport along the edge of a small chiral-spin-liquid device coupled to two Ising-chain reservoirs, a platform suitable for quantum-engineered systems. Adiabatically switching on the tunnel couplings to the reservoirs generates a thermal current that dynamically builds up and reaches a quasi-steady-state regime. In this time window, the two-terminal thermal conductance can approach half-quantized values -- a hallmark of Majorana-mediated transport -- under finely tuned conditions. The results agree with a steady-state Landauer-B\"uttiker description for sufficiently large reservoirs, where energy-resolved transmission rates help identify the optimal parameters to achieve the half-quantized conductance. This work provides a controllable platform to investigate topological thermal transport in engineered spin systems, such as realized in cold-atom and Rydberg-atom settings.</description>

      <title>Topology meets superconductivity in a one-dimensional $t-J$ model of magnetic atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strongly interacting fermions represent the key constituent of several intriguing phases of matter. However, due to the inherent complexity of these systems, important regimes are still inaccessible. Here, we derive a realistic and flexible setup based on ultracold magnetic lanthanide atoms trapped in a one-dimensional optical lattice. Leveraging their large magnetic moments, we design a fermionic $t-J$ model with independently tunable hopping, spin-spin couplings, and onsite interaction. Through combined analytical and numerical analysis, we uncover a variety of many-body quantum phases$-$including superconducting and topological states. Crucially, in the regime of attractive onsite interaction we reveal that topology and superconductivity coexist, thus giving rise to an exotic state of matter: a topological triplet superconductor. We also outline a practical protocol to prepare and detect all discovered phases using current experimental techniques. Our results establish an alternative and powerful route for a deeper understanding of strongly interacting fermionic quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Phase Diagram and dynamical phases of self organization of a Bose--Einstein condensate in a transversely pumped red-detuned cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a transversely pumped atomic Bose--Einstein Condensate coupled to a single-mode optical cavity, where effective atom--atom interactions are mediated by pump and cavity photons. A number of experiments and theoretical works have shown the formation of a superradiant state in this setup, where interference of pump and cavity light leads to an optical lattice in which atoms self-consistently organize. This self-organization has been extensively studied using the approximate Dicke model (truncating to two momentum states), as well as through numerical Gross--Pitaevskii simulations in one and two dimensions. Here, we perform a full mean-field analysis of the system, including all relevant atomic momentum states and the cavity field. We map out the steady-state phase diagram vs pump strength and cavity detuning, and provide an in-depth understanding of the instabilities that are linked to the emergence of spatio-temporal patterns. We find and describe parameter regimes where mean-field predicts bistability, regimes where the dynamics form chaotic trajectories, instabilities caused by resonances between normal mode excitations, and states with atomic dynamics but vanishing cavity field.</description>

      <title>Control of single spin-flips in a Rydberg atomic fractal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rydberg atoms trapped by optical tweezers have emerged as a versatile platform to emulate lattices with different geometries, in which long-range interacting spins lead to fascinating phenomena, ranging from spin liquids to topological states of matter. Here, we show that when the lattice has a fractal geometry with Hausdorff dimension 1.58, additional surprises appear. The system is described by a transverse-field Ising model with long-range van der Waals interactions in a Sierpi\`nski gasket fractal. We investigate the problem theoretically using exact diagonalization, variational mean field, quantum Monte Carlo, and a graph-based numerical technique, SIM-GRAPH, which we developed. We find that in the quantum regime, the phase diagram exhibits phases in which the spins flip one-by-one. The theoretical results are in excellent agreement with experiments performed with single 88Sr atoms trapped by optical tweezers arranged in a fractal geometry. The magnetization and von Neumann entanglement entropy reveal several regimes in which single spin-flips are delocalized over many sites of one sublattice, thus allowing for an unprecedented control of a cascade of phase transitions in a manybody system. These results expand the possibilities of Rydberg atoms for quantum information processing and may have profound implications in quantum technology.</description>

      <title>Robust superconductivity upon doping chiral spin liquid and Chern insulators in a Hubbard-Hofstadter model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Demonstrating superconductivity in purely repulsive Hubbard models is a compelling goal which underscores the counter-intuitive ability of Coulomb interactions to mediate superconductivity. Here, we present numerical evidence for robust superconductivity in a triangular Hubbard-Hofstadter model at $\pi/2$ flux per plaquette. Employing infinite density matrix renormalization group calculations on infinite cylinders of finite circumference, we observe superconducting ground states for a wide range of dopings, whose pair-correlations strengthen as the 2D limit is approached. At a density of one electron per site, Hubbard interactions have been reported to drive the insulating parent state of the superconductor from an integer quantum Hall (IQH) state to a chiral spin liquid (CSL). Our findings give credence to a recent proposal that proximity to the IQH-CSL transition serves to make chiral superconductivity energetically favorable on doping, and also correctly predicts the nature of the edge modes in the superconductor. On the CSL side, this suggests the superconductor can be thought of as arising from Laughlin's `anyon superconductivity' mechanism. Thus the Hubbard-Hofstadter model studied here offers a clean and experimentally accessible setup, potentially realizable in moir\'e heterostructures, for exploring the properties of anyonic matter at finite density and the interplay of topological order, quantum criticality and superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Self-similar kinetics for gravitational Bose-Einstein condensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study an overpopulated gas of gravitationally interacting bosons surrounding a droplet of Bose-Einstein condensate - Bose star. We argue that kinetic evolution of this gas approaches with time a self-similar attractor solution to the kinetic equation. If the scale symmetry of the equation is broken by external conditions, the attractor solution exists, remains approximately self-similar, but has slowly drifting scaling dimension. The latter new regime of adiabatic self-similarity can determine growth of dark matter Bose stars in cosmological models.</description>

      <title>Scattering and induced false vacuum decay in the two-dimensional quantum Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study scattering in the quantum Ising model in two dimensions. In the ordered phase, the spectrum contains a ladder of bound states and intertwined scattering resonances, which enable various scattering channels. By preparing wave packets on a $24 \times 24$ lattice and evolving the state with tensor networks, we explore and characterize these regimes, ranging from elastic scattering in the perturbative regime, to non-perturbative processes closer to the critical point. Then, we break the spin inversion symmetry and study the stability of the metastable false vacuum state on the collision of its excitations. We find that a highly-energetic scattering process can induce a violent decay of the false vacuum, and investigate the spread of the resulting true vacuum bubble.</description>

      <title>Observation of Universal Expansion Anisotropy from Cold Atoms to Hot Quark-Gluon Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02847v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Azimuthal anisotropy has been ubiquitously observed in high-energy proton-proton, proton-nucleus, and nucleus-nucleus (heavy-ion) collisions, shaking the early belief that those anisotropies require an intense phase of multiple interactions between the created particles. This work reports a study of anisotropic expansion of cold $^{6}$Li Fermi gases, initially trapped in an anisotropic potential, as a function of the interaction strength that can be readily tuned by an external magnetic field. It is found that the expansion anisotropy builds up quickly at small interaction strength, without the need of a large amount of interactions. An unexpected and quantitative universal scaling of the expansion anisotropy is observed for the first time between cold atom and heavy-ion systems as a function of the number of collisions per particle or opacity ($n_{\rm coll}$), despite their vast differences in scale and physics. The expansion isotropy in both the cold atom gases and heavy-ion collisions increases smoothly and shows no sign of saturation in the observed opacity range, with an approximate power-law dependence of $\sqrt{n_{\rm coll}}$, characteristic of random walks. This universality potentially unifies a variety of vastly different physical systems, from weakly interacting dilute gases to the strongly interacting quark-gluon plasma of the early universe.</description>

      <title>The Rayleigh-Taylor instability in a binary quantum fluid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19807v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Instabilities, where small fluctuations seed the formation of large-scale structures, govern dynamics in a variety of fluid systems. The Rayleigh-Taylor instability (RTI), present from tabletop to astronomical scales, is an iconic example characterized by mushroom-shaped incursions appearing when immiscible fluids are forced together. Despite its ubiquity, RTI experiments are challenging; here, we report the observation of the RTI in an immiscible binary superfluid consisting of a two-component Bose-Einstein condensate. We force these components together to initiate the instability, and observe the growth of mushroom-like structures. The interface can also be stabilized, allowing us to spectroscopically measure the "ripplon" interface modes. Lastly, we use matter-wave interferometry to transform the superfluid velocity field at the interface into a vortex chain. These results-in agreement with our theory-demonstrate the close connection between the RTI in classical and quantum fluids.</description>

      <title>Emergence of a Landau level structure in dark optical lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15038v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An optical flux lattice is a set of light beams that couple different internal states of an atom, thereby producing topological energy bands. Here we present a configuration in which the atoms exhibit a dark state, i.e. an internal state that is not coupled to the light. At large light intensity, the low-energy dynamics is restricted to the dark state, leading to an effective continuum model with a Landau-level-like structure. This structure is dramatically different from that of usual topological optical lattices, which lead to discrete models in the tight-binding limit. For well-chosen atomic species, the proposed system is essentially immune to heating due to photon scattering, making it a highly promising way to emulate the integer or fractional quantum Hall effect.</description>

      <title>Measuring topological invariants of even-dimensional line-gapped non-Hermitian systems through quench dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23633v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The accurate determination of non-Hermitian (NH) topological invariants plays a central role in the study of NH topological phases. In this work, we propose a general framework for directly measuring NH topological invariants in even-dimensional systems with real line gaps through quench dynamics. Our approach hinges on constructing an auxiliary Hermitian matrix topologically equivalent to the original NH Hamiltonian, enabling topological characterization via reduced-dimensional momentum subspaces called band-inversion surfaces (BISs). A key insight lies in the emergence of chiral symmetry in the NH Hamiltonian specifically on BISs -- a critical property that allows extension of the dynamical characterization scheme previously developed for odd-dimensional NH systems with chiral or sublattice symmetry [Lin et al., Phys. Rev. Res. 7, L012060 (2025)]. We show that NH topological invariants can be extracted from the winding patterns of a dynamical field constructed from post-quench spin textures on BISs. We demonstrate our approach through a detailed analysis of NH Chern insulators and then extend the framework to higher even-dimensional systems by introducing second-order BISs for characterization. The framework is also generalized to imaginary line-gapped topological phases. This work establishes an experimentally accessible protocol for detecting NH topological invariants in quantum platforms.</description>

Abstract: We determine the chiral vortical conductivities, as well as the orbital and spin moment of inertia of a charged, chiral, and rigidly rotating free Fermi gas. To this purpose, we begin by calculating the vacuum expectation values of a vector and axial vector current using the free fermion propagator in this medium. This propagator is derived by employing the Fock-Schwinger method based on the solutions of the Dirac equation in the presence of rotation and finite axial chemical potential. We present a complete derivation of these solutions. We demonstrate that in the first approximation, the chiral vortical conductivity associated with the vector current is proportional to the product of the vector and axial chemical potentials. In contrast, the chiral vortical conductivity related to the axial vector current depends on the temperature, the vector, and the axial vector chemical potential squares. We use the relation between the axial vector current and the angular momentum density associated with spin to determine the spin and the orbital moment of inertia of a rigidly rotating Fermi gas in a charged and chirally imbalanced medium separately. In addition, we compute the total moment of inertia by utilizing the methods presented in the first part of the paper and show that the orbital moment of inertia of a free fermion gas vanishes.</description>
