      <title>Stochastic models of advection-diffusion in layered media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mathematically modelling diffusive and advective transport of particles in heterogeneous layered media is important to many applications in computational, biological and medical physics. While deterministic continuum models of such transport processes are well established, they fail to account for randomness inherent in many problems and are valid only for a large number of particles. To address this, this paper derives a suite of equivalent stochastic (discrete-time discrete-space random walk) models for several standard continuum (partial differential equation) models of diffusion and advection-diffusion across a fully- or semi-permeable interface. Our approach involves discretising the continuum model in space and time to yield a Markov chain, which governs the transition probabilities between spatial lattice sites during each time step. Discretisation in space is carried out using a standard finite volume method while two options are considered for discretisation in time. A simple forward Euler discretisation yields a stochastic model taking the form of a local (nearest-neighbour) random walk with simple analytical expressions for the transition probabilities while an exact exponential discretisation yields a non-local random walk with transition probabilities defined numerically via a matrix exponential. Constraints on the size of the spatial and/or temporal steps are provided for each option to ensure the transition probabilities are non-negative. MATLAB code comparing the stochastic and continuum models is available on GitHub (https://github.com/elliotcarr/Carr2024c) with simulation results demonstrating good agreement for several example problems.</description>

      <title>Classification of electronic structures and state preparation for quantum computation of reaction chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computation for chemical problems will require the construction of guiding states with sufficient overlap with a target state. Since easily available and initializable mean-field states are characterized by an overlap that is reduced for multi-configurational electronic structures and even vanishes with growing system size, we here investigate the severity of state preparation for reaction chemistry. We emphasize weaknesses in current traditional approaches (even for weakly correlated molecules) and highlight the advantage of quantum phase estimation algorithms. An important result is the introduction of a new classification scheme for electronic structures based on orbital entanglement information. We identify two categories of multi-configurational molecules. Whereas class-1 molecules are dominated by very few determinants and often found in reaction chemistry, class-2 molecules do not allow one to single out a reasonably sized number of important determinants. The latter are particularly hard for traditional approaches and an ultimate target for quantum computation. Some open-shell iron-sulfur clusters belong to class 2. We discuss the role of the molecular orbital basis set and show that true class-2 molecules remain in this class independent of the choice of the orbital basis, with the iron-molybdenum cofactor of nitrogenase being a prototypical example. We stress that class-2 molecules can be build in a systematic fashion from open-shell centers or unsaturated carbon atoms. Our key result is that it will always be possible to initialize a guiding state for chemical reaction chemistry in the ground state based on initial low-cost approximate electronic structure information, which is facilitated by the finite size of the atomistic structures to be considered.</description>

      <title>An interpretable formula for lattice thermal conductivity of crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lattice thermal conductivity (kL) is a crucial physical property of crystals with applications in thermal management, such as heat dissipation, insulation, and thermoelectric energy conversion. However, accurately and rapidly determining kL poses a considerable challenge. In this study, we introduce an formula that achieves high precision (mean relative error=8.97%) and provides fast predictions, taking less than one minute, for kL across a wide range of inorganic binary and ternary materials. Our interpretable, dimensionally aligned and physical grounded formula forecasts kL values for 4,601 binary and 6,995 ternary materials in the Materials Project database. Notably, we predict undiscovered high kL values for AlBN2 (kL=101 W/ m/ K) and the undetectedlow kL Cs2Se (kL=0.98 W/ m/ K) at room temperature. This method for determining kL streamlines the traditionally time-consuming process associated with complex phonon physics. It provides insights into microscopic heat transport and facilitates the design and screening of materials with targeted and extreme kL values through the application of phonon engineering. Our findings offer opportunities for controlling and optimizing macroscopic transport properties of materials by engineering their bulk modulus, shear modulus, and Gruneisen parameter.</description>

      <title>Deep Ritz -- Finite Element methods: Neural Network Methods trained with Finite Elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While much attention of neural network methods is devoted to high-dimensional PDE problems, in this work we consider methods designed to work for elliptic problems on domains $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R} ^d, $ $d=1,2,3$ in association with more standard finite elements. We suggest to connect finite elements and neural network approximations through training, i.e., using finite element spaces to compute the integrals appearing in the loss functionals. This approach, retains the simplicity of classical neural network methods for PDEs, uses well established finite element tools (and software) to compute the integrals involved and it gains in efficiency and accuracy. We demonstrate that the proposed methods are stable and furthermore, we establish that the resulting approximations converge to the solutions of the PDE. Numerical results indicating the efficiency and robustness of the proposed algorithms are presented.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Rossby number gap in rapidly rotating thermal convection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Geophysical and astrophysical fluid flows are typically buoyantly driven and are strongly constrained by planetary rotation at large scales. Rapidly rotating Rayleigh-B\'enard convection (RRRBC) provides a paradigm for direct numerical simulations (DNS) and laboratory studies of such flows, but the accessible parameter space remains restricted to moderately fast rotation (Ekman numbers $\rm Ek \gtrsim 10^{-8}$), while realistic $\rm Ek$ for astro-/geophysical applications are significantly smaller. Reduced equations of motion, the non-hydrostatic quasi-geostrophic equations describing the leading-order behavior in the limit of rapid rotation ($\rm Ek \to 0$) cannot capture finite rotation effects, leaving the physically most relevant part of parameter space with small but finite $\rm Ek$ currently inaccessible. Here, we introduce the rescaled incompressible Navier-Stokes equations (RiNSE), a reformulation of the Navier-Stokes-Boussinesq equations informed by the scalings valid for $\rm Ek\to 0$. We provide the first full DNS of RRRBC at unprecedented rotation strengths down to $\rm Ek=10^{-15}$ and below and show that the RiNSE converge to the asymptotically reduced equations.</description>

      <title>Effects of quenched disorder on the kinetics and pathways of phase transition in a soft colloidal system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although impurities are unavoidable in real-world and experimental systems, most numerical studies on nucleation focus on pure (impurity-free) systems. As a result, the role of impurities in phase transitions remains poorly understood, especially for systems with complex free energy landscapes featuring one or more metastable intermediate phases. In this study, we employed Monte-Carlo simulations to investigate the effects of static impurities (quenched disorder) of varying length scales and surface morphologies on the nucleation mechanism and kinetics in the Gaussian Core Model (GCM) system, a model for soft colloidal systems. We first explored how the nucleation free energy barrier and critical cluster size are influenced by the fraction of pinned particles ($f_{\rm p}$) and the pinned cluster size ($n_{\rm p}$). Both the nucleation free energy barrier and critical cluster size increase sharply with increasing $f_{\rm p}$ but decrease as $n_{\rm p}$ grows, eventually approaching the homogeneous nucleation limit. On examining the impact of surface morphology on nucleation kinetics, we observed that the nucleation barrier significantly decreases with increasing the spherical pinned cluster (referred to as "seed") size of face-centred cubic (FCC), body-centred cubic (BCC), and simple cubic (SC) structures, with BCC showing the greatest facilitation. Interestingly, seeds with random surface roughness had little effect on nucleation kinetics. Additionally, the polymorphic identity of particles in the final crystalline phase is influenced by both seed surface morphology and system size. This study further provides crucial insights into the intricate relationship between substrate-induced local structural fluctuations and the selection of the polymorphic identity in the final crystalline phase, which is essential for understanding and controlling crystallization processes in experiments.</description>

      <title>Optimization of Coulomb Energies in Gigantic Configurational Spaces of Multi-Element Ionic Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most of the novel energy materials contain multiple elements occupying a single site in their lattice. The exceedingly large configurational space of these materials imposes challenges in determining their ground-state structures. Coulomb energies of possible configurations generally show a satisfactory correlation to computed energies at higher levels of theory and thus allow to screen for minimum-energy structures. Employing a second-order cluster expansion, we obtain an efficient Coulomb energy optimizer using Monte Carlo and Genetic Algorithms. The presented optimization package, GOAC (Global Optimization of Atomistic Configurations by Coulomb), can achieve a speed up of several orders of magnitude compared to existing software. Our code is able to find low-energy configurations of complex systems involving up to $10^{920}$ structural configurations. The GOAC package thus provides an efficient method for constructing ground-state atomistic models for multi-element materials with gigantic configurational spaces.</description>

      <title>A novel volume of fluid ghost-cell immersed boundary method for free surface flow interacting with structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel volume of fluid ghost-cell immersed boundary (IB) method for two-phase free surface flow interacting with structures. To circumvent the disturbance occurring around the intersection area of the IB and free surface when using the interpolation method for variable reconstruction, the fluid-structure interaction is firstly considered with the orthogonal IB by mimicking the imposition of boundary conditions in the body-conformal grid method. Treatments are subsequently performed to account for the non-orthogonal effect in accurately simulating the FSI, including the newly proposed flux-scaling and IB velocity re-evaluation methods. Further, a variable smoothing process and a flux correction method are adapted to handle moving boundary cases. Based on OpenFOAM, a two-phase flow solver has been developed. Both stationary and moving immersed boundary cases are used for validations. The numerical results reasonably agree with the corresponding laboratory data and other numerical simulation results, demonstrating the disturbance being effectively depressed and the solver's accuracy in capturing fluid-structure interactions involving free surface flow.</description>

      <title>Efficient Pseudomode Representation and Complexity of Quantum Impurity Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Out-of-equilibrium fermionic quantum impurity models (QIM), describing a small interacting system coupled to a continuous fermionic bath, play an important role in condensed matter physics. Solving such models is a computationally demanding task, and a variety of computational approaches are based on finding approximate representations of the bath by a finite number of modes. In this paper, we formulate the problem of finding efficient bath representations as that of approximating a kernel of the bath's Feynman-Vernon influence functional by a sum of complex exponentials, with each term defining a fermionic pseudomode. Under mild assumptions on the analytic properties of the bath spectral density, we provide an analytic construction of pseudomodes, and prove that their number scales polylogarithmically with the maximum evolution time $T$ and the approximation error $\varepsilon$. We then demonstrate that the number of pseudomodes can be significantly reduced by an interpolative matrix decomposition (ID). Furthermore, we present a complementary approach, based on constructing rational approximations of the bath's spectral density using the ``AAA'' algorithm, followed by compression with ID. The combination of two approaches yields a pseudomode count scaling as $N_\text{ID} \sim \log(T)\log(1/\varepsilon)$, and the agreement between the two approches suggests that the result is close to optimal. Finally, to relate our findings to QIM, we derive an explicit Liouvillian that describes the time evolution of the combined impurity-pseudomodes system. These results establish bounds on the computational resources required for solving out-of-equilibrium QIMs, providing an efficient starting point for tensor-network methods for QIMs.</description>

      <title>PiNNAcLe: Adaptive Learn-On-The-Fly Algorithm for Machine-Learning Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: PiNNAcLe is an implementation of our adaptive learn-on-the-fly algorithm for running machine-learning potential (MLP)-based molecular dynamics (MD) simulations -- an emerging approach to simulate the large-scale and long-time dynamics of systems where empirical forms of the PES are difficult to obtain.
  The algorithm aims to solve the challenge of parameterizing MLPs for large-time-scale MD simulations, by validating simulation results at adaptive time intervals. This approach eliminates the need of uncertainty quantification methods for labelling new data, and thus avoids the additional computational cost and arbitrariness thereof.
  The algorithm is implemented in the NextFlow workflow language (Di Tommaso et al., 2017). Components such as MD simulation and MLP engines are designed in a modular fashion, and the workflows are agnostic to the implementation of such modules. This makes it easy to apply the same algorithm to different references, as well as scaling the workflow to a variety of computational resources.
  The code is published under BSD 3-Clause License, the source code and documentation are hosted on Github. It currently supports MLP generation with the atomistic machine learning package PiNN (Shao et al., 2020), electronic structure calculations with CP2K (K\"uhne et al., 2020) and DFTB+ (Hourahine et al., 2020), and MD simulation with ASE (Larsen et al., 2017).</description>

Abstract: Recently, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have emerged as a flexible and promising application of deep learning to partial differential equations in the physical sciences. While offering strong performance and competitive inference speeds on forward and inverse problems, their black-box nature limits interpretability, particularly regarding alignment with expected physical behavior. In the present work, we explore the application of influence functions (IFs) to validate and debug PINNs post-hoc. Specifically, we apply variations of IF-based indicators to gauge the influence of different types of collocation points on the prediction of PINNs applied to a 2D Navier-Stokes fluid flow problem. Our results demonstrate how IFs can be adapted to PINNs to reveal the potential for further studies.</description>

      <title>Toward Routing River Water in Land Surface Models with Recurrent Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14212v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning is playing an increasing role in hydrology, supplementing or replacing physics-based models. One notable example is the use of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for forecasting streamflow given observed precipitation and geographic characteristics. Training of such a model over the continental United States (CONUS) demonstrated that a single set of model parameters can be used across independent catchments, and that RNNs can outperform physics-based models. In this work, we take a next step and study the performance of RNNs for river routing in land surface models (LSMs). Instead of observed precipitation, the LSM-RNN uses instantaneous runoff calculated from physics-based models as an input. We train the model with data from river basins spanning the globe and test it in streamflow hindcasts. The model demonstrates skill at generalization across basins (predicting streamflow in catchments not used in training) and across time (predicting streamflow during years not used in training). We compare the predictions from the LSM-RNN to an existing physics-based model calibrated with a similar dataset and find that the LSM-RNN outperforms the physics based model. Our results show that RNNs are effective for global streamflow prediction from runoff inputs and motivate the development of complete routing models that can capture nested sub-basis connections.</description>

      <title>Sampling Error Analysis in Quantum Krylov Subspace Diagonalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.16279v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum Krylov subspace diagonalization (QKSD) is an emerging method used in place of quantum phase estimation in the early fault-tolerant era, where limited quantum circuit depth is available. In contrast to the classical Krylov subspace diagonalization (KSD) or the Lanczos method, QKSD exploits the quantum computer to efficiently estimate the eigenvalues of large-size Hamiltonians through a faster Krylov projection. However, unlike classical KSD, which is solely concerned with machine precision, QKSD is inherently accompanied by errors originating from a finite number of samples. Moreover, due to difficulty establishing an artificial orthogonal basis, ill-conditioning problems are often encountered, rendering the solution vulnerable to noise. In this work, we present a nonasymptotic theoretical framework to assess the relationship between sampling noise and its effects on eigenvalues. We also propose an optimal solution to cope with large condition numbers by eliminating the ill-conditioned bases. Numerical simulations of the one-dimensional Hubbard model demonstrate that the error bound of finite samplings accurately predicts the experimental errors in well-conditioned regions.</description>

Here, we evaluate the ability and efficiency of generative machine learning methods to sample the Boltzmann distribution of an atomistic model for glass-forming liquids. This is a notoriously difficult task, as it amounts to ergodically exploring the complex free energy landscape of a disordered and frustrated many-body system. We optimize a normalizing flow model to successfully transform high-temperature configurations of a dense liquid into low-temperature ones, near the glass transition. We perform a detailed comparative analysis with established enhanced sampling techniques developed in the physics literature to assess and rank the performance of normalizing flows against state-of-the-art algorithms. We demonstrate that machine learning methods are very promising, showing a large speedup over conventional molecular dynamics. Normalizing flows show performances comparable to parallel tempering and population annealing, while still falling far behind the swap Monte Carlo algorithm. Our study highlights the potential of generative machine learning models in scientific computing for complex systems, but also points to some of its current limitations and the need for further improvement.</description>

      <title>High-accurate and efficient numerical algorithms for the self-consistent field theory of liquid-crystalline polymers</title>

Abstract: Self-consistent field theory (SCFT) is one of the most widely-used framework in studying the equilibrium phase behaviors of inhomogenous polymers. For liquid crystalline polymeric systems, the main numerical challenges of solving SCFT encompass efficiently solving plenty of six dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs), precisely determining the subtle energy difference among self-assembled structures, and developing effective iterative methods for nonlinear SCF iteration. To address these challenges, this work introduces a suite of high-order and efficient numerical methods tailored for SCFT of liquid-crystalline polymers. These methods include various advaced PDE solvers, an improved Anderson iteration algorithm to accelerate SCFT calculations, and an optimization technique of adjusting the computational domain during the SCF iterations. Extensive numerical tests demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed methods. Based on these algorithms, we further explore the self-assembly behavior of liquid crystalline polymers through simulations in four, five, and six dimensions, uncovering intricate three-dimensional spatial structures.</description>

      <title>Construction and sampling of alloy cluster expansions -- A tutorial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14787v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Crystalline alloys and related mixed systems make up a large family of materials with high tunability which have been proposed as the solution to a large number of energy related materials design problems. Due to the presence of chemical order and disorder in these systems, neither experimental efforts nor ab-initio computational methods alone are sufficient to span the inherently large configuration space. Therefore, fast and accurate models are necessary. To this end, cluster expansions have been widely and successfully used for the past decades. Cluster expansions are generalized Ising models designed to predict the energy of any atomic configuration of a system after training on a small subset of the available configurations. Constructing and sampling a cluster expansion consists of multiple steps that have to be performed with care. In this tutorial, we provide a comprehensive guide to this process, highlighting important considerations and potential pitfalls. The tutorial consists of three parts, starting with cluster expansion construction for a relatively simple system, continuing with strategies for more challenging systems such as surfaces and closing with examples of Monte Carlo sampling of cluster expansions to study order-disorder transitions and phase diagrams.</description>

      <title>Investigating Material Interface Diffusion Phenomena through Graph Neural Networks in Applied Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05306v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding and predicting interface diffusion phenomena in materials is crucial for various industrial applications, including semiconductor manufacturing, battery technology, and catalysis. In this study, we propose a novel approach utilizing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to investigate and model material interface diffusion. We begin by collecting experimental and simulated data on diffusion coefficients, concentration gradients, and other relevant parameters from diverse material systems. The data are preprocessed, and key features influencing interface diffusion are extracted. Subsequently, we construct a GNN model tailored to the diffusion problem, with a graph representation capturing the atomic structure of materials. The model architecture includes multiple graph convolutional layers for feature aggregation and update, as well as optional graph attention layers to capture complex relationships between atoms. We train and validate the GNN model using the preprocessed data, achieving accurate predictions of diffusion coefficients, diffusion rates, concentration profiles, and potential diffusion pathways. Our approach offers insights into the underlying mechanisms of interface diffusion and provides a valuable tool for optimizing material design and engineering. Additionally, our method offers possible strategies to solve the longstanding problems related to materials interface diffusion.</description>

      <title>An effective and reliable approach to the phase problem in single-shot single-particle Coherent Diffraction Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07413v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coherent Diffraction Imaging (CDI) is an experimental technique to get images of isolated structures by recording the light scattered off the sample. Thanks to the extremely bright and short coherent light pulses provided by X-ray Free Electron Lasers, CDI makes it possible to study nanostructures in the gas phase and get time-resolved snapshots of their ultrafast dynamics with unprecedented resolution. In principle, the sample density can be recovered from the scattered light field through a straightforward Fourier Transform operation. However, only the amplitude of the field is recorded, while the phase is lost during the measurement process and has to be retrieved by means of suitable, well-established, phase retrieval algorithms. We present the Memetic Phase Retrieval (MPR) method, an improved approach to the phase retrieval problem, which makes use of a combination of existing phase retrieval algorithms and evolutionary algorithms to mitigate the shortcomings of conventional approaches. We benchmark the method on experimental data acquired in two experimental campaigns at SwissFEL and European XFEL. Imaging results on isolated nanostructures reveal considerable stability of the algorithm's behavior on the input parameters, as well as the capability of identifying the solution in challenging conditions. A user-friendly implementation of the MPR method is released as open-source software, aiming at being a reference tool for the FEL imaging community.</description>
