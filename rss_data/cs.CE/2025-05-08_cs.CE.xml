      <title>Physics-informed solution reconstruction in elasticity and heat transfer using the explicit constraint force method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One use case of ``physics-informed neural networks'' (PINNs) is solution reconstruction, which aims to estimate the full-field state of a physical system from sparse measurements. Parameterized governing equations of the system are used in tandem with the measurements to regularize the regression problem. However, in real-world solution reconstruction problems, the parameterized governing equation may be inconsistent with the physical phenomena that give rise to the measurement data. We show that due to assuming consistency between the true and parameterized physics, PINNs-based approaches may fail to satisfy three basic criteria of interpretability, robustness, and data consistency. As we argue, these criteria ensure that (i) the quality of the reconstruction can be assessed, (ii) the reconstruction does not depend strongly on the choice of physics loss, and (iii) that in certain situations, the physics parameters can be uniquely recovered. In the context of elasticity and heat transfer, we demonstrate how standard formulations of the physics loss and techniques for constraining the solution to respect the measurement data lead to different ``constraint forces" -- which we define as additional source terms arising from the constraints -- and that these constraint forces can significantly influence the reconstructed solution. To avoid the potentially substantial influence of the choice of physics loss and method of constraint enforcement on the reconstructed solution, we propose the ``explicit constraint force method'' (ECFM) to gain control of the source term introduced by the constraint. We then show that by satisfying the criteria of interpretability, robustness, and data consistency, this approach leads to more predictable and customizable reconstructions from noisy measurement data, even when the parameterization of the missing physics is inconsistent with the measured system.</description>

      <title>Thermoelastic Kirchhoff Plate: A Novel Model for Shot Peen Forming Metal Panels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A common technique used in factories to shape metal panels is shot peen forming, where the panel is sprayed with a high-velocity stream of small steel pellets called shot. The impacts between the hard steel shot and softer aluminum panel cause localized plastic deformation, both improving the fatigue properties of the material's surface and imparting a residual stress distribution that results in bending. Thus, a torque is associated with the through-thickness shot peen stress distribution. We conceptualize shot peen forming as the application of spatially varying torques, which are modeled with the input of applied temperatures. In this paper, we derive the bending equations for a thermally loaded homogeneous Kirchhoff plate in order to predict the effects of shot peen forming. A simple test is devised to extract the value of an equivalent applied torque from the bending response of uniformly shot peened plates, which circumvents the difficulty of accounting for surface plasticity. This torque can be used as an input to a model which predicts the shape of rectangular plates under more complicated shot peen conditions. An experiment is designed and carried out which investigates the agreement between the model and real shot peen operations. The effect of uncertainty in the experiment is estimated with Monte Carlo methods.</description>

      <title>Advanced Stock Market Prediction Using Long Short-Term Memory Networks: A Comprehensive Deep Learning Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting stock market movements remains a persistent challenge due to the inherently volatile, non-linear, and stochastic nature of financial time series data. This paper introduces a deep learning-based framework employing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to forecast the closing stock prices of major technology firms: Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Amazon, listed on NASDAQ. Historical data was sourced from Yahoo Finance and processed using normalization and feature engineering techniques. The proposed model achieves a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 2.72 on unseen test data, significantly outperforming traditional models like ARIMA. To further enhance predictive accuracy, sentiment scores were integrated using real-time news articles and social media data, analyzed through the VADER sentiment analysis tool. A web application was also developed to provide real-time visualizations of stock price forecasts, offering practical utility for both individual and institutional investors. This research demonstrates the strength of LSTM networks in modeling complex financial sequences and presents a novel hybrid approach combining time series modeling with sentiment analysis.</description>

      <title>MatMMFuse: Multi-Modal Fusion model for Material Property Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent progress of using graph based encoding of crystal structures for high throughput material property prediction has been quite successful. However, using a single modality model prevents us from exploiting the advantages of an enhanced features space by combining different representations. Specifically, pre-trained Large language models(LLMs) can encode a large amount of knowledge which is beneficial for training of models. Moreover, the graph encoder is able to learn the local features while the text encoder is able to learn global information such as space group and crystal symmetry. In this work, we propose Material Multi-Modal Fusion(MatMMFuse), a fusion based model which uses a multi-head attention mechanism for the combination of structure aware embedding from the Crystal Graph Convolution Network (CGCNN) and text embeddings from the SciBERT model. We train our model in an end-to-end framework using data from the Materials Project Dataset. We show that our proposed model shows an improvement compared to the vanilla CGCNN and SciBERT model for all four key properties: formation energy, band gap, energy above hull and fermi energy. Specifically, we observe an improvement of 40% compared to the vanilla CGCNN model and 68% compared to the SciBERT model for predicting the formation energy per atom. Importantly, we demonstrate the zero shot performance of the trained model on small curated datasets of Perovskites, Chalcogenides and the Jarvis Dataset. The results show that the proposed model exhibits better zero shot performance than the individual plain vanilla CGCNN and SciBERT model. This enables researchers to deploy the model for specialized industrial applications where collection of training data is prohibitively expensive.</description>

      <title>HiPerRAG: High-Performance Retrieval Augmented Generation for Scientific Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The volume of scientific literature is growing exponentially, leading to underutilized discoveries, duplicated efforts, and limited cross-disciplinary collaboration. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) offers a way to assist scientists by improving the factuality of Large Language Models (LLMs) in processing this influx of information. However, scaling RAG to handle millions of articles introduces significant challenges, including the high computational costs associated with parsing documents and embedding scientific knowledge, as well as the algorithmic complexity of aligning these representations with the nuanced semantics of scientific content. To address these issues, we introduce HiPerRAG, a RAG workflow powered by high performance computing (HPC) to index and retrieve knowledge from more than 3.6 million scientific articles. At its core are Oreo, a high-throughput model for multimodal document parsing, and ColTrast, a query-aware encoder fine-tuning algorithm that enhances retrieval accuracy by using contrastive learning and late-interaction techniques. HiPerRAG delivers robust performance on existing scientific question answering benchmarks and two new benchmarks introduced in this work, achieving 90% accuracy on SciQ and 76% on PubMedQA-outperforming both domain-specific models like PubMedGPT and commercial LLMs such as GPT-4. Scaling to thousands of GPUs on the Polaris, Sunspot, and Frontier supercomputers, HiPerRAG delivers million document-scale RAG workflows for unifying scientific knowledge and fostering interdisciplinary innovation.</description>

      <title>A Direct-adjoint Approach for Material Point Model Calibration with Application to Plasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04584v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a new approach for the calibration of material parameters in local elastoplastic constitutive models. The calibration is posed as a constrained optimization problem, where the constitutive model evolution equations for a single material point serve as constraints. The objective function quantifies the mismatch between the stress predicted by the model and corresponding experimental measurements. To improve calibration efficiency, a novel direct-adjoint approach is presented to compute the Hessian of the objective function, which enables the use of second-order optimization algorithms. Automatic differentiation is used for gradient and Hessian computations. Two numerical examples are employed to validate the Hessian matrices and to demonstrate that the Newton-Raphson algorithm consistently outperforms gradient-based algorithms such as L-BFGS-B.</description>

      <title>Exact nonlinear state estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10976v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The majority of data assimilation (DA) methods in the geosciences are based on Gaussian assumptions. While these assumptions facilitate efficient algorithms, they cause analysis biases and subsequent forecast degradations. Non-parametric, particle-based DA algorithms have superior accuracy, but their application to high-dimensional models still poses operational challenges. Drawing inspiration from recent advances in the field of generative artificial intelligence (AI), this article introduces a new nonlinear estimation theory which attempts to bridge the existing gap in DA methodology. Specifically, a Conjugate Transform Filter (CTF) is derived and shown to generalize the celebrated Kalman filter to arbitrarily non-Gaussian distributions. The new filter has several desirable properties, such as its ability to preserve statistical relationships in the prior state and convergence to highly accurate observations. An ensemble approximation of the new theory (ECTF) is also presented and validated using idealized statistical experiments that feature bounded quantities with non-Gaussian distributions, a prevalent challenge in Earth system models. Results from these experiments indicate that the greatest benefits from ECTF occur when observation errors are small relative to the forecast uncertainty and when state variables exhibit strong nonlinear dependencies. Ultimately, the new filtering theory offers exciting avenues for improving conventional DA algorithms through their principled integration with AI techniques.</description>

      <title>On-device Anomaly Detection in Conveyor Belt Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10729v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conveyor belts are crucial in mining operations by enabling the continuous and efficient movement of bulk materials over long distances, which directly impacts productivity. While detecting anomalies in specific conveyor belt components has been widely studied, identifying the root causes of these failures, such as changing production conditions and operator errors, remains critical. Continuous monitoring of mining conveyor belt work cycles is still at an early stage and requires robust solutions. Recently, an anomaly detection method for duty cycle operations of a mining conveyor belt has been proposed. Based on its limited performance and unevaluated long-term proper operation, this study proposes two novel methods for classifying normal and abnormal duty cycles. The proposed approaches are pattern recognition systems that make use of threshold-based duty-cycle detection mechanisms, manually extracted features, pattern-matching, and supervised tiny machine learning models. The explored low-computational models include decision tree, random forest, extra trees, extreme gradient boosting, Gaussian naive Bayes, and multi-layer perceptron. A comprehensive evaluation of the former and proposed approaches is carried out on two datasets. Both proposed methods outperform the former method, with the best-performing approach being dataset-dependent. The heuristic rule-based approach achieves the highest performance in the same dataset used for algorithm training, with 97.3% for normal cycles and 80.2% for abnormal cycles. The ML-based approach performs better on a dataset including the effects of machine aging, scoring 91.3% for normal cycles and 67.9% for abnormal cycles. Implemented on two low-power microcontrollers, the methods demonstrate efficient, real-time operation with energy consumption of 13.3 and 20.6 ${\mu}$J during inference. These results offer valuable insights for detecting ...</description>
