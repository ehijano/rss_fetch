      <title>Optical-field-induced dips and splits in nonlinear spectra of selective reflection from high-density atomic vapor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss nonlinear spectra of selective reflection from high-density rubidium atomic vapor, where the self-broadening of the resonant transition $5S_{1/2}-5P_{3/2}$ dominates over the Doppler width. In the experiments, the hole-burning technique with probe and pump lasers is used. The reflection of weak probe beam is investigated at four atomic densities in the range $(1.2-3.6)\cdot10^{17}$ cm$^{-3}$ and various pump beam intensities. To enhance the spectral resolution the frequency derivative $\text{d}R/\text{d}\nu$ of the reflection coefficient $R$ recorded and analyzed. The grow of the atomic number density changes the character of self-broadening from inhomogeneous to homogeneous. At the maximal density, the strong pump field split observed spectra on two homogeneously broadened symmetrical resonances. The appearance of the optical field induced resonances can be explained in the frame of "dressed atomic states" approach. In the range of the lower densities the spectral profiles are in-homogeneously broadened. Spectral profiles of the frequency derivative are separated by the optically saturated dips. The width of such dips is a superposition of the homogeneous part of self-broadening and intensity dependent field broadening. Careful study of the transition from inhomogeneous to homogeneous broadening may be initiate a further development of theory of interatomic interactions in high density atomic gas media.</description>

      <title>FSRCC two-valence calculations of clock transition properties, dipole polarizability and isotope shifts in Fermionic and Bosonic Sr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ an all-particle multireference Fock-space relativistic coupled-cluster (FSRCC) theory to study the $5s^2{\;^1}S_0 - 5s5p{\;^3P^o_0}$ clock transition in both Fermionic and Bosonic isotopes of Sr. We compute the excitation energies, E1 and M1 transition amplitudes, hyperfine reduced matrix elements, and isotope shifts using FSRCC theory. Further, we calculate the lifetime of the metastable clock states for $^{87}$Sr and $^{88}$Sr. Furthermore, we employ perturbed relativistic coupled-cluster (PRCC) theory to compute the ground state electric dipole polarizability of Sr. To improve the accuracy of our results, we incorporate the corrections from the relativistic and quantum electrodynamical (QED) effects, and perturbative triples to all our calculations. Our computed excitation energies are in good agreement with the experimental data for low-lying excited states. Our results for E1, M1 and HFS reduced matrix elements are within the experimental error bars, however, with slight difference from the previous calculations due to more accurate treatment of electron correlations in our calculation. Our computed lifetime of the clock state for $^{87}$Sr is within the error bars of the available experimental results, whereas for $^{88}$Sr, it is an order of magnitude smaller than the only available calculation using model potential. Our PRCC result for the ground state polarizability is in good agreement with the experiment, and smaller than previous calculations. As can be expected, our FSRCC results on isotope shift parameters show differences from the MCDF calculations. From the detailed analysis of our results, we find that the corrections from the Breit interaction, QED effects, and perturbative triples are crucial to get accurate clock transition properties in Sr.</description>

      <title>Probing transition rates, nuclear moments and electric dipole polarizability in nobelium using multireference FSRCC and PRCC theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20875v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We employ an all-particle multireference Fock-space relativistic coupled-cluster (FSRCC) theory to compute the ionization potential, excitation energy, transition rate and hyperfine structure constants associated with $7s^2\;^{1}S_{0}\rightarrow 7s7p\;^{3}P_{1}$ and $7s^2\;^{1}S_{0}\rightarrow 7s7p\;^1P_{1}$ transitions in nobelium (No). Using our state-of-the-art calculations in conjunction with available experimental data \cite{raeder-18}, we extract the values of nuclear magnetic dipole ($\mu$) and electric quadrupole ($Q$) moments for $^{253}$No. Further, information on nuclear deformation in even-mass isotopes is extracted from the isotope shift calculations. Moreover, we employ a perturbed relativistic coupled-cluster (PRCC) theory to compute the ground state electric dipole polarizability of No. In addition, to assess the accuracy of our calculations, we compute the ionization potential and dipole polarizability of lighter homolog ytterbium (Yb). To account for strong relativistic and quantum electrodynamical (QED) effects in No, we incorporate the corrections from Breit interaction, vacuum polarization and self-energy in our calculations. The contributions from triple excitations in coupled-cluster is accounted perturbatively. Our calculations reveal a significant contribution of $\approx$10\% from the perturbative triples to the transition rate of $7s^2\;^1S_{0}\rightarrow 7s7p\;^3P_{1}$ transition. The largest cumulative contribution from Breit+QED is observed to be $\approx$4\%, to the magnetic dipole hyperfine structure constant of $7s7p\;^1P_{1}$ state. Our study provides a comprehensive understanding of atomic and nuclear properties of nobelium with valuable insights into the electron correlation and relativistic effects in superheavy elements.</description>

      <title>Calculation of double differential cross sections (DDCS) for H(3S) ionization using Bethe and Lewis Integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23953v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Calculations have been made for the double differential cross section (DDCS) for the ionization of metastable hydrogen atoms in the 3S state by electron and positron impact at energies of 150 eV and 250 eV. The authors implemented the second Born approximation to the multiple scattering theory as their model, evaluated the corresponding analytical expressions using Bethe and Lewis integrals, and numerically computed them using MATLAB. The generated DDCS captures the features of both recoil and binary fragmentation and, at the same time, provides an overall qualitative consistency with earlier studies, although some differences can be found between them at certain emission angles. The present work, therefore, supplies new theoretical reference levels for ionization investigations in hydrogen-like systems, now that no experimental data are available for the metastable 3S state.</description>

      <title>Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa unitarity deficit reduction via finite nuclear size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17070v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the extraction of the $|V_{ud}|$ CKM matrix element from the superallowed transition decay rate of $^{26m}$Al$\rightarrow$$^{26}$Mg, focusing on finite nuclear size effects. The decay rate dependence on the $^{26m}$Al charge radius is found to be four times higher than previously believed, necessitating precise determination. However, for a short-lived isotope of an odd $Z$ element such as $^{26m}$Al, radius extraction relies on challenging many-body atomic calculations. We performed the needed calculations, finding an excellent agreement with previous ones, which used a different methodology. This sets a new standard for the reliability of isotope shift factor calculations in many-electron systems. The $\mathcal{F}t$ value obtained from our analysis is lower by $2.2\,\sigma$ than the corresponding value in the previous critical survey, resulting in an increase in $|V_{ud}|^2$ by $0.9\,\sigma$. Adopting $|V_{ud}|$ from this decay alone reduces the CKM unitarity deficit by one standard deviation, irrespective of the choice of $|V_{us}|$.</description>
