      <title>Understanding Surgical smoke in Laparoscopy through Lagrangian Coherent Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In laparoscopic surgery, one of the main byproducts is the gaseous particles, called surgical smoke, which is found hazardous for both the patient and the operating room staff due to their chemical composition, and this implies a need for its effective elimination. The dynamics of surgical smoke are monitored by the underlying flow inside the abdomen and the hidden Lagrangian Coherent Structures (LCSs) present therein. In this article, for an insufflated abdomen domain, we analyse the velocity field, obtained from a computational fluid dynamics model, {first, by calculating the flow rates for the outlets} and then by identifying the patterns which are responsible for the transportation, mixing and accumulation of the material particles in the flow. From the finite time Lyapunov exponent (FTLE) field calculated for different planar cross sections of the domain, we show that these material curves are dependent on the angle, positions and number of the outlets, and the inlet. The ridges of the backward FTLE field reveal the regions of vortex formation, and the maximum accumulation, details which can inform the effective placement of the instruments for efficient removal of the surgical smoke.</description>

      <title>Decrypting the temperature field in flow boiling with latent diffusion models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an innovative method using Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) to generate temperature fields from phase indicator maps. By leveraging the BubbleML dataset from numerical simulations, the LDM translates phase field data into corresponding temperature distributions through a two-stage training process involving a vector-quantized variational autoencoder (VQVAE) and a denoising autoencoder. The resulting model effectively reconstructs complex temperature fields at interfaces. Spectral analysis indicates a high degree of agreement with ground truth data in the low to mid wavenumber ranges, even though some inconsistencies are observed at higher wavenumbers, suggesting areas for further enhancement. This machine learning approach significantly reduces the computational burden of traditional simulations and improves the precision of experimental calibration methods. Future work will focus on refining the model's ability to represent small-scale turbulence and expanding its applicability to a broader range of boiling conditions.</description>

      <title>Effect of a polymeric compound layer on jetting dynamics produced by bursting bubbles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jetting dynamics from bursting bubbles play a key role in mediating mass and momentum transport across the air-liquid interface. In marine environments, this phenomenon has drawn considerable attention due to its role in releasing biochemical contaminants, such as extracellular polymeric substances, into the atmosphere through aerosol production. These biocontaminants often exhibit non-Newtonian characteristics, yet the physics of bubble bursting with a rheologically complex layer at bubble-liquid interfaces remains largely unexplored. In this study, we experimentally investigate the jetting dynamics of bubble bursting events in the presence of such polymeric compound layers. Using bubbles coated by a polyethylene oxide solution, we document the cavity collapse and jetting dynamics produced by bubble bursting. At a fixed polymer concentration, the jet velocity increases while the jet radius decreases with an increasing compound layer fraction, as a result of stronger capillary wave damping due to capillary wave separation at the compound interface as well as the formation of smaller cavity cone angles during bubble cavity collapse. These dynamics produce smaller and more numerous jet drops. Meanwhile, as the polymer concentration increases, the jet velocity decreases while the jet radius increases for the same compound layer fraction due to the increasing viscoelastic stresses. In addition, fewer jet drops are ejected as the jets become slower and broader with increasing polymer concentration, as viscoelastic stresses persist throughout the jet formation and thinning process. We further obtain a regime map delineating the conditions for jet drop ejection versus no jet drop ejection in bursting bubbles coated with a polymeric compound layer. Our results may provide new insights into the mechanisms of mass transport of organic materials in bubble-mediated aerosolization processes.</description>

      <title>Drop size distribution from laboratory experiments based on single-drop fragmentation and comparison with aerial in-situ measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laboratory experiments and theoretical modelling are conducted to determine the raindrop size distribution (DSD) resulting from distinct fragmentation processes under various upward airstreams. Since weather radar echoes are proportional to the sixth power of the average droplet diameter, understanding the fragmentation mechanisms that lead to different breakup sizes is crucial for accurate rainfall predictions. We utilize a two-parameter gamma distribution for theoretical modelling and estimate the average droplet diameter from the theoretically obtained characteristic sizes, often treated as assumed input parameters for different rain conditions in rainfall modelling. Our experimental and theoretical findings demonstrate a close agreement with the DSD predicted by the Marshall and Palmer relationship for steady rain conditions. Additionally, in situ DSD measurements at different altitudes were obtained through research flights equipped with advanced sensors, further validating our rainfall model. This study underscores the effectiveness of laboratory-scale experiments and the critical importance of accurately characterizing DSD to enhance rainfall predictions.</description>

      <title>High-speed imaging and coumarin dosimetry of horn type ultrasonic reactors: influence of probe diameter and amplitude</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrasound driven cavitation is widely used to intensify lab and industrial-scale processes. Various studies and experiments demonstrate that the acoustic energy, dissipated through the bubbles collapse, leads to intense physicochemical effects in the processed liquid. A better understanding of these phenomena is crucial for the optimization of ultrasonic reactors, and their scale-up. In the current literature, the visual characterization of the reactor reactivity is mainly carried out with sonoluminescence and sonochemiluminescence. These techniques have limitations in the time resolution since a high camera exposure time is required. In this research, we proposed an alternative method, based on coumarin dosimetry to monitor the hydroxylation activity, and high-speed imaging for the visualization of the vapor field. By this approach, we aim to capture the structure and the dynamics of the vapor field and to correlate this with the chemical effects induced in the ultrasonic reactor. This characterization was carried out for four different ultrasonic probe diameters (3, 7, 14 and 40 mm), displacement amplitudes and processing volumes. Key findings indicate that the probe diameter strongly affects the structure of the vapor field and the chemical effectiveness of the system. The proposed methodology could be applied to characterize other types of ultrasonic reactors with different operating and processing conditions.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamics of In-Canopy Flow in Synthetically Generated Coral Reefs Under Oscillatory Wave Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction of oscillatory wave motion with morphologically complex coral reefs showcases a wide range of consequential hydrodynamic responses within the canopy. While a large body of literature has explored the interaction of morphologically simple coral reefs, the in-canopy flow dynamics in complex coral reefs is poorly understood. This study used a synthetically generated coral reef over flat topography with varying reef height and density to understand the in-canopy turbulence dynamics. Using a turbulence-resolving computational framework, we found that most of the turbulent kinetic energy dissipation is confined to a region below the top of the reef and above the Stokes boundary layer. The results also suggest that most of the vertical Reynolds stress peaks within this region positively contribute to the down-gradient momentum flux during the forward phase of the wave cycle. These findings shed light on the physical relationships between in-canopy flow and morphologically complex coral reefs, thereby motivating a further need to explore the hydrodynamics of such flows using a scale-resolving computational framework.</description>

      <title>Lateral migration and bouncing of a deformable bubble rising near a vertical wall. Part 2. Highly inertial regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fate of deformable buoyancy-driven bubbles rising near a vertical wall under highly inertial conditions is investigated numerically. In the absence of path instability, simulations reveal that when the Galilei number, $Ga$, which represents the buoyancy-to-viscous force ratio, exceeds a critical value, bubbles escape from the near-wall region after one to two rounds of bouncing, while at smaller $Ga$ they perform periodic bounces without escaping. The escape mechanism is rooted in the vigorous rotational flow that forms around a bubble during its bounce at high enough $Ga$, resulting in a Magnus-like repulsive force capable of driving it away from the wall. Path instability takes place with bubbles whose Bond number, the buoyancy-to-capillary force ratio, exceeds a critical $Ga$-dependent value. Such bubbles may or may not escape from the wall region, depending on the competition between the classical repulsive wake-wall interaction mechanism and a specific wall-ward trapping mechanism. The latter results from the reduction of the bubble oblateness caused by the abrupt drop of the rise speed when the bubble-wall gap becomes very thin. Owing to this transient shape variation, bubbles exhibiting zigzagging motions with a large enough amplitude experience larger transverse drag and virtual mass forces when departing from the wall than when returning to it. With moderately oblate bubbles, i.e. in an intermediate Bond number range, this effect is large enough to counteract the repulsive interaction force, forcing such bubbles to perform a periodic zigzagging-like motion at a constant distance from the wall.</description>

      <title>The fluid dynamics of liquid mushrooms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Droplets that impact the surface of a deep liquid pool may form a vertical jet after the cavity formation event, provided they have sufficient impact energy. Depending on the associated time scales and the effect of the Rayleigh Plateau instability, this jet may either continue to rise, or may form satellite droplets via necking. Collision of these structures with a second incoming droplet, ejected from the same dispensing tip as the first droplet, may result in the formation of various lamellar patterns, depending on the impact conditions, giving rise to liquid mushroom and or umbrella structures. In this research, we experiment for the first time with hydrodynamics of such liquid mushrooms, and study the effect of droplet impact height, surface tension, and viscosity on the dynamics of such lamellar formations. We further explore the role of the orientation of incoming droplet impact, ie whether head on or offset collision with the rising jet or satellite droplet. We discuss the spatiotemporal evolution of the lamella diameters, and its susceptibility to surface tension, viscosity, and droplet impact height. We put forward a theoretical model based on energetics, to predict the maximum spread diameter of the lamellae, which yields accurate predictions with respect to our experiments. Our findings may help to provide important insights towards a fluid dynamic phenomenon observed often in nature and may be important in niche utilities as well.</description>

      <title>Hovering of an actively driven fluid-lubricated foil</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by recent experimental observations of a harmonically excited elastic foil hovering near a wall while supporting substantial weight, we develop a theoretical framework that describes the underlying physical effects. Using elastohydrodynamic lubrication theory, we quantify how the dynamic deformation of the soft foil couples to the viscous fluid flow in the intervening gap. Our analysis shows that the soft foil rectifies the reversible forcing, breaking time-reversal symmetry; the relative spatial support of the forcing determines whether the sheet is attracted to or repelled from the wall. A simple scaling law predicts the time-averaged equilibrium hovering height and the maximum weight the sheet can sustain before detaching from the surface. Numerical simulations of the governing equation corroborate our theoretical predictions, are in qualitative agreement with experiments, and might explain the behavior of organisms while providing design principles for soft robotics.</description>

      <title>A novel Trunk Branch-net PINN for flow and heat transfer prediction in porous medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A novel Trunk-Branch (TB)-net physics-informed neural network (PINN) architecture is developed, which is a PINN-based method incorporating trunk and branch nets to capture both global and local features. The aim is to solve four main classes of problems: forward flow problem, forward heat transfer problem, inverse heat transfer problem, and transfer learning problem within the porous medium, which are notoriously complex that could not be handled by origin PINN. In the proposed TB-net PINN architecture, a Fully-connected Neural Network (FNN) is used as the trunk net, followed by separated FNNs as the branch nets with respect to outputs, and automatic differentiation is performed for partial derivatives of outputs with respect to inputs by considering various physical loss. The effectiveness and flexibility of the novel TB-net PINN architecture is demonstrated through a collection of forward problems, and transfer learning validates the feasibility of resource reuse. Combining with the superiority over traditional numerical methods in solving inverse problems, the proposed TB-net PINN shows its great potential for practical engineering applications.</description>

      <title>Reduced-order modeling and classification of hydrodynamic pattern formation in gravure printing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hydrodynamic pattern formation phenomena in printing and coating processes are still not fully understood. However, fundamental understanding is essential to achieve high-quality printed products and to tune printed patterns according to the needs of a specific application like printed electronics, graphical printing, or biomedical printing. The aim of the paper is to develop an automated pattern classification algorithm based on methods from supervised machine learning and reduced-order modeling. We use the HYPA-p dataset, a large image dataset of gravure-printed images, which shows various types of hydrodynamic pattern formation phenomena. It enables the correlation of printing process parameters and resulting printed patterns for the first time. 26880 images of the HYPA-p dataset have been labeled by a human observer as dot patterns, mixed patterns, or finger patterns; 864000 images (97%) are unlabeled. A singular value decomposition (SVD) is used to find the modes of the labeled images and to reduce the dimensionality of the full dataset by truncation and projection. Selected machine learning classification techniques are trained on the reduced-order data. We investigate the effect of several factors, including classifier choice, whether or not fast Fourier transform (FFT) is used to preprocess the labeled images, data balancing, and data normalization. The best performing model is a k-nearest neighbor (kNN) classifier trained on unbalanced, FFT-transformed data with a test error of 3%, which outperforms a human observer by 7%. Data balancing slightly increases the test error of the kNN-model to 5%, but also increases the recall of the mixed class from 90% to 94%. Finally, we demonstrate how the trained models can be used to predict the pattern class of unlabeled images and how the predictions can be correlated to the printing process parameters, in the form of regime maps.</description>

      <title>Topology optimization for microchannel heat sinks with nanofluids using an Eulerian-Eulerian approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The demand for high-performance heat sinks has significantly increased with advancements in computing power and the miniaturization of electronic devices. Among the promising solutions, nanofluids have attracted considerable attention due to their superior thermal conductivity. However, designing a flow field that effectively utilizes nanofluids remains a significant challenge due to the complex interactions between fluid and nanoparticles. In this study, we propose a density-based topology optimization method for microchannel heat sink design using nanofluids. An Eulerian-Eulerian framework is utilized to simulate the behavior of nanofluids, and the optimization problem aims to maximize heat transfer performance under a fixed pressure drop. In numerical examples, we investigate the dependence of the optimized configuration on various parameters and apply the method to the design of a manifold microchannel heat sink. The parametric study reveals that the number of flow branches increases with the increased pressure drop but decreases as the particle volume fraction increases. In the heat sink design, the topology-optimized flow field achieves an 11.6% improvement in heat transfer performance compared to a conventional parallel flow field under identical nanofluid conditions.</description>

      <title>DBSCAN in domains with periodic boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many scientific problems involve data that is embedded in a space with periodic boundary conditions. This can for instance be related to an inherent cyclic or rotational symmetry in the data or a spatially extended periodicity. When analyzing such data, well-tailored methods are needed to obtain efficient approaches that obey the periodic boundary conditions of the problem. In this work, we present a method for applying a clustering algorithm to data embedded in a periodic domain based on the DBSCAN algorithm, a widely used unsupervised machine learning method that identifies clusters in data. The proposed method internally leverages the conventional DBSCAN algorithm for domains with open boundaries, such that it remains compatible with all optimized implementations for neighborhood searches in open domains. In this way, it retains the same optimized runtime complexity of $O(N\log N)$. We demonstrate the workings of the proposed method using synthetic data in one, two and three dimensions and also apply it to a real-world example involving the clustering of bubbles in a turbulent flow. The proposed approach is implemented in a ready-to-use Python package that we make publicly available.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Dissipation via Time-Dependent Velocity Fields: Acceleration and Intermittency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by mixing processes in analytical laboratories, this work investigates enhanced dissipation in non-autonomous flows. Specifically, we study the evolution of concentrations governed by the advection-diffusion equation, where the velocity field is modelled as the product of a shear flow (with simple critical points) and a time-dependent function $\xi(t)$. The main objective of this paper is to derive explicit, quantitative estimates for the energy decay rates, which are shown to depend sensitively on the properties of $\xi$. We identify a class of time-dependent functions $\xi$ that are bounded above and below by increasing functions of time. For this class, we demonstrate super-enhanced dissipation, characterized by energy decay rates faster than those observed in autonomous cases (e.g., when $\xi \equiv 1$, as in Coti Zelati and Gallay (2023)). Additionally, we explore enhanced dissipation in the context of intermittent flows, where the velocity fields may be switched on and off over time. In these cases, the dissipation rates are comparable to those of autonomous flows but with modified constants. To illustrate our results, we analyse two prototypical intermittent flows: one that exhibits a gradual turn-on and turn-off phase, and another that undergoes a significant acceleration following a slow initial activation phase. For the second, we derive the corresponding dissipation rate using a gluing argument. Both results are achieved through the application of the hypocoercivity framework (\`a la Bedrossian and Coti Zelati (2017)), adapted to an augmented functional with time-dependent weights. These weights are designed to dynamically counteract the potential growth of $\xi$, ensuring robust estimates for the energy decay.</description>

      <title>An oceanic basin oscillation-driving mechanism for tides</title>

Abstract: Tides represent the daily alternations of high and low waters along coastlines and in oceans, and the current theory (termed the gravitational forcing mechanism) explains them as a manifestation of the response of ocean water to the Moon's (Sun's) gravitational force. However, although the purely hydrodynamic models representing the current theory have been widely tested over global ocean,their tidal elevation accuracies are generally low. This implies an uncertainty as to whether the gravitational forcing mechanism is the best explanation for tides. In this study, we present a new theory (termed the oceanic basin oscillation-driving mechanism), in which tides are explained as a manifestation of oscillating ocean basin that is intricately linked to the elongated spinning solid Earth due to the Moon (Sun). Based on this new theory, we develop an algebraic tide model and test it using 11-year observations from 33 bottom pressure stations over the Pacific Ocean, the average Root Mean Square (RMS) deviation of tidal elevation predicted by this model against observation is 7.54 cm. Using a ratio of M2 elevation RMS of ocean tide model EOT11a and its total tidal elevation RMS as a reference, we estimate the total tidal elevation RMS of six purely hydrodynamic models (i.e.,Hallberg Isopycnal Model, OSU Tidal Inversion software-GN ,STORMTIDE model, OSU Tidal Inversion Software-ERB,STM-1B, and HYbrid Coordinate Ocean Model to be 59.93, 51.64, 57.05, 38.56, 86.92, and 53.56 cm, respectively.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric dual cascade in gravitational wave turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We numerically simulate, in both the forced and decay regimes, a fourth-order nonlinear diffusion equation derived from the kinetic equation of gravitational wave turbulence in the limit of strongly local quartic interactions. When a forcing is applied to an intermediate wavenumber $k_i$, we observe a dual cascade of energy and wave action. In the stationary state, the associated flux ratio is proportional to $k_i$, and the Kolmogorov-Zakharov spectra are recovered. In decaying turbulence, the study reveals that the wave action spectrum can extend to wavenumbers greater than the initial excitation $k_i$ with constant negative flux, while the energy flux is positive with a power law dependence in $k$. This leads to an unexpected result: a single inertial range with a Kolmogorov-Zakharov wave action spectrum extending progressively to wavenumbers larger than $k_i$. We also observe a wave action decay in time in $t^{-1/3}$ while the front of the energy spectrum progresses according to a $t^{1/3}$ law. These properties can be understood with simple theoretical arguments.</description>

      <title>Interfacial Temperature and Density Discontinuities for Phase-Change Heat Transfer With Non-condensable Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent prior work, the author derived interfacial mass and heat flux conditions for phase-change processes. The mass flux condition is identical to the Schrage equation, but the additional heat flux expression enables one to couple the interface to the continua in both the liquid and the vapor phases and compute the interfacial temperature and density discontinuities. However, questions exist on how to treat phase change heat transfer in the presence of non-condensable gases. In this work, the author shows that the same set of interfacial conditions can be used to account for the presence of non-condensable gases. Although the mass flux of non-condensable gas is zero, their presence impacts the heat transfer. For evaporation, when the presence of the non-condensable gas is small, temperature and density discontinuities persist across the interface, as well as inverted temperature distributions. For condensation, however, no temperature inversion happens in the presence of a small amount of non-condensable gas and the interfacial temperature jump is significantly smaller. When a large amount of non-condensable gas is present, such as for evaporation into and condensation from air, the temperature discontinuities at the interface are significantly smaller and no temperature inversion happens. For evaporation driven purely by humidity difference, temperature inversion and discontinuity still exist. Results from this work will benefit the modeling of phase change processes in the presence of non-condensable gases, evaporative cooling in air, air-gap distillation, atmospheric water harvesting, and other applications.</description>

      <title>Droplet Bag Formation in Turbulent Airflows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08650v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present novel numerical simulations investigating the evolution of liquid droplets into bag-like structures in turbulent airflows. The droplet bag breakup problem is of significance for many multiphase processes in scientific and engineering applications. Turbulent fluctuations are introduced synthetically into a mean flow, and the droplet is inserted when the air-phase turbulence reaches a statistically stationary state. The morphological evolution of the droplet under different turbulence configurations is retrieved and analysed in comparison with laminar aerobreakup results. While the detailed evolution history of individual droplets varies widely between different realisations of the turbulent flow, common dynamic and morphological evolution patterns are observed. The presence of turbulence is found to enhance the drag coefficient of the droplet as it flattens. At late times, the droplet becomes tilted and increasingly corrugated under strong turbulence intensity. We quantify these phenomena and discuss their possible governing mechanisms associated with turbulence intermittency. Lastly, the influences of liquid-gas viscosity ratio are examined and the implications of air-phase turbulence on the later bag film breakup process are discussed.</description>

      <title>Fingering instability of self-similar radial flow of miscible fluids in a Hele-Shaw cell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01961v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The linear stability of miscible displacement for radial source flow at infinite P\'eclet number in a Hele-Shaw cell is calculated theoretically. The axisymmetric self-similar flow is shown to be unstable to viscous fingering if the viscosity ratio $m$ between ambient and injected fluids exceeds $3\over2$ and to be stable if $m&lt;{3\over2}$. If $1&lt;m&lt;{3\over2}$ small disturbances decay at rates between $t^{-3/4}$ and $t^{-1}$ relative to the $t^{1/2}$ radius of the axisymmetric base-state similarity solution; if $m&lt;1$ they decay faster than $t^{-1}$. Asymptotic analysis confirms these results and gives physical insight into various features of the numerically determined relationship between the growth rate and the azimuthal wavenumber and viscosity ratio.</description>

      <title>Dusty disks as safe havens for terrestrial planets: Effect of the back-reaction of solid material on gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07403v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Previous studies have shown that there is considerable variation in the dust-to-gas density ratio in the vicinity of low-mass planets undergoing growth. This can lead to a significant change in the planetary momentum exerted by the gas and solid material. However, due to the low dust-to-gas mass ratio of protoplanetary disks, the back-reaction of the solid material, is often neglected. We study the effect of the back-reaction of solid material on the torques felt by low-mass planets. We performed locally isothermal, 2D hydrodynamic simulations of planet-disk interactions. Low-mass planets in the range of 0.1-10MEarth accrete only solid material. Simulations were compared with and without taking into account the back-reaction of the solid material on the gas. The solid component was assumed to have a fixed Stokes number in the range 0.01-10. In general, the inclusion of back-reaction results in a greater number of models with positive torque values compared to models that neglect back-reaction. It is clear, therefore, that the simulation of planetary growth and migration via hydrodynamic modeling requires the inclusion of solid-gas back-reaction. As a result of the back-reaction and accretion, a Mars-sized planetary embryo will experience positive total torques from the disk containing coupled solid components St&lt;=0.01. Earth-mass planets also experience positive total torques from the disk containing boulder-sized solid components 2&lt;=St&lt;=5. The accretion of weakly coupled solid material tends to increase the positive torques and decrease the negative torques. Our results suggest that the combined effect of back-reaction and accretion is beneficial to the formation of planetary systems by reducing the likelihood of a young planet being engulfed by the central star.</description>
