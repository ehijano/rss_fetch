      <title>Cubing for Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are exploring the problem of building an automated reasoning procedure that adaptively tunes the high-level solving strategy for a given problem. There are two main distinctive characteristics of our approach: tuning is performed solely online, unlike the common use of tuning as an offline process; and tuning data comes exclusively from the given instance, so we do not rely on the availability of similar benchmarks and can work with unique challenging instances. Our approach builds on top of the divide-and-conquer paradigm that naturally serves partitioned sub-problems for an automated tuning algorithm to obtain a good solving strategy. We demonstrate performance improvement on two classes of important problems--SAT-solving and neural network verification\,--\,and show that our method can learn unconventional solving strategies in some cases.</description>

      <title>Detecting speculative data flow vulnerabilities using weakest precondition reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speculative execution is a hardware optimisation technique where a processor, while waiting on the completion of a computation required for an instruction, continues to execute later instructions based on a predicted value of the pending computation. It came to the forefront of security research in 2018 with the disclosure of two related attacks, Spectre and Meltdown. Since then many similar attacks have been identified. While there has been much research on using formal methods to detect speculative execution vulnerabilities based on predicted control flow, there has been significantly less on vulnerabilities based on predicted data flow. In this paper, we introduce an approach for detecting the data flow vulnerabilities, Spectre-STL and Spectre-PSF, using weakest precondition reasoning. We validate our approach on a suite of litmus tests used to validate related approaches in the literature.</description>

      <title>The Satisfiability and Validity Problems for Probabilistic Computational Tree Logic are Highly Undecidable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Probabilistic Computational Tree Logic (PCTL) is the main specification formalism for discrete probabilistic systems modeled by Markov chains. Despite serious research attempts, the decidability of PCTL satisfiability and validity problems remained unresolved for 30 years. We show that both problems are highly undecidable, i.e., beyond the arithmetical hierarchy. Consequently, there is no sound and complete deductive system for PCTL.</description>

      <title>Positive Almost-Sure Termination of Polynomial Random Walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The number of steps until termination of a probabilistic program is a random variable. Probabilistic program termination therefore requires qualitative analysis via almost-sure termination (AST), while also providing quantitative answers via positive almost-sure termination (PAST) on the expected number of steps until termination. While every program which is PAST is AST, the converse is not true. The symmetric random walk with constant step size is a prominent example of a program that is AST but not PAST.
  In this paper we show that a more general class of polynomial random walks is PAST. Our random walks implement a step size that is polynomially increasing in the number of loop iterations and have a constant probability $p$ of choosing either branch. We decide that such programs are PAST when the degree of the polynomial is higher than both the degree of the drift and a threshold $d_\text{min}(p)$. Our approach does not use proof rules, nor auxiliary arithmetic expressions, such as martingales or invariants. Rather, we establish an inductive bound for the cumulative distribution function of the loop guard, based on which PAST is proven.
  We implemented the approximation of this threshold, by combining genetic programming, algebraic reasoning and linear programming.</description>

      <title>High-Level Message Sequence Charts: Satisfiability and Realizability Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Message sequence charts (MSCs) visually represent interactions in distributed systems that communicate through FIFO channels. High-level MSCs (HMSCs) extend MSCs with choice, concatenation, and iteration, allowing for the specification of complex behaviors. This paper revisits two classical problems for HMSCs: satisfiability and realizability. Satisfiability (also known as reachability or nonemptiness) asks whether there exists a path in the HMSC that gives rise to a valid behavior. Realizability concerns translating HMSCs into communicating finite-state machines to ensure correct system implementations.
  While most positive results assume bounded channels, we introduce a class of HMSCs that allows for unbounded channels while maintaining effective implementations. On the other hand, we show that the corresponding satisfiability problem is still undecidable.</description>

      <title>Lecture Notes on Algorithmic Information Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Algorithmic information theory roots the concept of information in computation rather than probability. These lecture notes were constructed in conjunction with the graduate course I taught at Universit\`a della Svizzera italiana in the spring of 2023. The course is intended for graduate students and researchers seeking a self-contained journey from the foundations of computability theory to prefix complexity and the information-theoretic limits of formal systems. My exposition ignores boundaries between computer science, mathematics, physics, and philosophy -- an approach I consider essential when explaining inherently multidisciplinary fields. Lecture recordings are available online. Among other topics, the notes cover bit strings, codes, Shannon information theory, computability theory, the universal Turing machine, the Halting Problem, Rice's Theorem, plain algorithmic complexity, the Invariance Theorem, incompressibility, Solomonoff's induction, self-delimiting Turing machines, prefix algorithmic complexity, the halting probability Omega, Chaitin's Incompleteness Theorem, The Coding Theorem, lower semi-computable semi-measures, and the chain rule for algorithmic complexity.</description>

      <title>A Gradient-Optimized TSK Fuzzy Framework for Explainable Phishing Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phishing attacks represent an increasingly sophisticated and pervasive threat to individuals and organizations, causing significant financial losses, identity theft, and severe damage to institutional reputations. Existing phishing detection methods often struggle to simultaneously achieve high accuracy and explainability, either failing to detect novel attacks or operating as opaque black-box models. To address this critical gap, we propose a novel phishing URL detection system based on a first-order Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) fuzzy inference model optimized through gradient-based techniques. Our approach intelligently combines the interpretability and human-like reasoning capabilities of fuzzy logic with the precision and adaptability provided by gradient optimization methods, specifically leveraging the Adam optimizer for efficient parameter tuning. Experiments conducted using a comprehensive dataset of over 235,000 URLs demonstrate rapid convergence, exceptional predictive performance (accuracy averaging 99.95% across 5 cross-validation folds, with a perfect AUC i.e. 1.00). Furthermore, optimized fuzzy rules and membership functions improve interoperability, clearly indicating how the model makes decisions - an essential feature for cybersecurity applications. This high-performance, transparent, and interpretable phishing detection framework significantly advances current cybersecurity defenses, providing practitioners with accurate and explainable decision-making tools.</description>

      <title>GPU accelerated program synthesis: Enumerate semantics, not syntax!</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Program synthesis is an umbrella term for generating programs and logical formulae from specifications. With the remarkable performance improvements that GPUs enable for deep learning, a natural question arose: can we also implement a search-based program synthesiser on GPUs to achieve similar performance improvements? In this article we discuss our insights on this question, based on recent works~. The goal is to build a synthesiser running on GPUs which takes as input positive and negative example traces and returns a logical formula accepting the positive and rejecting the negative traces. With GPU-friendly programming techniques -- using the semantics of formulae to minimise data movement and reduce data-dependent branching -- our synthesiser scales to significantly larger synthesis problems, and operates much faster than the previous CPU-based state-of-the-art. We believe the insights that make our approach GPU-friendly have wide potential for enhancing the performance of other formal methods (FM) workloads.</description>

      <title>From the Notebooks to the Investigations and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The use of the open and searchable Wittgenstein's Nachlass (The Wittgenstein Archives at the University of Bergen (WAB)) has proved instrumental in the quest for a common thread of Wittgenstein's view on the connections between meaning, use and consequences, going from the Notebooks to later writings (including the Philosophical Investigations) and beyond. Here we take this as the basis for a proposal for a formal counterpart of a 'meaning-as-use' (dialogical/game-theoretical) semantics for the language of predicate logic. In order to further consolidate this perspective, we shall need to bring in key excerpts from Wittgenstein oeuvre (including the Nachlass) and from those formal semanticists who advocate a different perspective on the connections between proofs and meaning. With this in mind we consider several passages from Wittgenstein's published as well as unpublished writings to build a whole picture of a formal counterpart to 'meaning is use' based on the idea that explanations of consequences via 'movements within language' ought to be taken as a central aspect to Wittgenstein's shift from 'interpretation of symbols in a state of affairs' to 'use of symbols' which underpins his 'meaning is use' paradigm. As in the Investigations "every interpretation hangs in the air together with what it interprets, and cannot give it any support. Interpretations by themselves do not determine meaning", as well as in a remark from his transitional period (1929-30): "Perhaps one should say that the expression 'interpretation of symbols' is misleading and one should instead say 'the use of symbols'." Significantly, we wish the present examination of the searchable Nachlass can make a relevant step towards a formal counterpart to the 'meaning is use' dictum, while highlighting an important common thread from Wittgenstein's very early to very late writings.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Attention Generates Better Proofs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in formal theorem proving, but their token-level processing often fails to capture the inherent hierarchical nature of mathematical proofs. We introduce \textbf{Hierarchical Attention}, a regularization method that aligns LLMs' attention mechanisms with mathematical reasoning structures. Our approach establishes a five-level hierarchy from foundational elements to high-level concepts, ensuring structured information flow in proof generation. Experiments demonstrate that our method improves proof success rates by 2.05\% on miniF2F and 1.69\% on ProofNet while reducing proof complexity by 23.81\% and 16.50\% respectively.

      <title>On the Complexity of Identifying Groups without Abelian Normal Subgroups: Parallel, First Order, and GI-Hardness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we exhibit an $\textsf{AC}^{3}$ isomorphism test for groups without Abelian normal subgroups (a.k.a. Fitting-free groups), a class for which isomorphism testing was previously known to be in $\mathsf{P}$ (Babai, Codenotti, and Qiao; ICALP '12). Here, we leverage the fact that $G/\text{PKer}(G)$ can be viewed as permutation group of degree $O(\log |G|)$. As $G$ is given by its multiplication table, we are able to implement the solution for the corresponding instance of Twisted Code Equivalence in $\textsf{AC}^{3}$.
  In sharp contrast, we show that when our groups are specified by a generating set of permutations, isomorphism testing of Fitting-free groups is at least as hard as Graph Isomorphism and Linear Code Equivalence (the latter being $\textsf{GI}$-hard and having no known subexponential-time algorithm).
  Lastly, we show that any Fitting-free group of order $n$ is identified by $\textsf{FO}$ formulas (without counting) using only $O(\log \log n)$ variables. This is in contrast to the fact that there are infinite families of Abelian groups that are not identified by $\textsf{FO}$ formulas with $o(\log n)$ variables (Grochow &amp; Levet, FCT '23).</description>

      <title>Probabilistic and Causal Satisfiability: Constraining the Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the complexity of satisfiability problems in probabilistic and causal reasoning. Given random variables $X_1, X_2,\ldots$ over finite domains, the basic terms are probabilities of propositional formulas over atomic events $X_i = x_i$, such as $P(X_1 = x_1)$ or $P(X_1 = x_1 \vee X_2 = x_2)$. The basic terms can be combined using addition (yielding linear terms) or multiplication (polynomial terms). The probabilistic satisfiability problem asks whether a joint probability distribution satisfies a Boolean combination of (in)equalities over such terms. Fagin et al. (1990) showed that for basic and linear terms, this problem is NP-complete, making it no harder than Boolean satisfiability, while Moss\'e et al. (2022) proved that for polynomial terms, it is complete for the existential theory of the reals.
  Pearl's Causal Hierarchy (PCH) extends the probabilistic setting with interventional and counterfactual reasoning, enriching the expressiveness of languages. However, Moss\'e et al. (2022) found that satisfiability complexity remains unchanged. Van der Zander et al. (2023) showed that introducing a marginalization operator to languages induces a significant increase in complexity.
  We extend this line of work by adding two new dimensions to the problem by constraining the models. First, we fix the graph structure of the underlying structural causal model, motivated by settings like Pearl's do-calculus, and give a nearly complete landscape across different arithmetics and PCH levels. Second, we study small models. While earlier work showed that satisfiable instances admit polynomial-size models, this is no longer guaranteed with compact marginalization. We characterize the complexities of satisfiability under small-model constraints across different settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17109v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit completion modulo equational theories for left-linear term rewrite systems where unification modulo the theory is avoided and the normal rewrite relation can be used in order to decide validity questions. To that end, we give a new correctness proof for finite runs and establish a simulation result between the two inference systems known from the literature. Given a concrete reduction order, novel canonicity results show that the resulting complete systems are unique up to the representation of their rules' right-hand sides. Furthermore, we show how left-linear AC completion can be simulated by general AC completion. In particular, this result allows us to switch from the former to the latter at any point during a completion process.</description>

Abstract: The adele ring of a number field is a central object in modern number theory. Its status as a locally compact topological ring is one of the key reasons why. We describe a formal proof that the adele ring of a number field is locally compact implemented in the Lean 4 theorem prover. Our work includes the formalisations of new types, including the completion of a number field at an infinite place, the infinite adele ring and the finite $S$-adele ring, as well as formal proofs that completions of a number field are locally compact and that their rings of integers at finite places are compact.</description>

      <title>Semantic Foundations of Reductive Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14758v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The development of logic has largely been through the 'deductive' paradigm: conclusions are inferred from established premisses. However, the use of logic in the context of both human and machine reasoning is typically through the dual 'reductive' perspective: collections of sufficient premisses are generated from putative conclusions. We call this paradigm, 'reductive logic'. This expression of logic encompass as diverse reasoning activities as proving a formula in a formal system to seeking to meet a friend before noon on Saturday. This paper is a semantical analysis of reductive logic. In particular, we provide mathematical foundations for representing and reasoning about 'reduction operators'. Heuristically, reduction operators may be thought of as `backwards' inference rules. In this paper, we address their mathematical representation, how they are used in the context of reductive reasoning, and, crucially, what makes them 'valid'.</description>

      <title>Potential for Polynomial Solution for NP-Complete Problems using Quantum Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15529v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose two new methods for solving Set Constraint Problems, as well as a potential polynomial solution for NP-Complete problems using quantum computation. While current methods of solving Set Constraint Problems focus on classical techniques, we offer both a quantum-inspired matrix method and a quantum matrix method that neutralizes common contradictions and inconsistencies that appear in these types of problems. We then use our new method to show how a potential polynomial solution for NP-Complete problems could be found using quantum computation. We state this as a potential solution, rather than an actual solution, as the outcome of any quantum computation may not be the same as the expected outcome. We start by formally defining a Set Constraint Problem. We then explain current, classical methods that are used to solve these problems and the drawbacks of such methods. After this, we explain a new quantum-inspired matrix method that allows us to solve these problems, with classical limitations. Then, we explain a new quantum matrix method that solves these problems using quantum information science. Finally, we describe how we can extend this method to potentially solve NP-Complete problems in polynomial time using quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Analyzing Value Functions of States in Parametric Markov Chains</title>

Abstract: Parametric Markov chains (pMC) are used to model probabilistic systems with unknown or partially known probabilities. Although (universal) pMC verification for reachability properties is known to be coETR-complete, there have been efforts to approach it using potentially easier-to-check properties such as asking whether the pMC is monotonic in certain parameters. In this paper, we first reduce monotonicity to asking whether the reachability probability from a given state is never less than that of another given state. Recent results for the latter property imply an efficient algorithm to collapse same-value equivalence classes, which in turn preserves verification results and monotonicity. We implement our algorithm to collapse "trivial" equivalence classes in the pMC and show empirical evidence for the following: First, the collapse gives reductions in size for some existing benchmarks and significant reductions on some custom benchmarks; Second, the collapse speeds up existing algorithms to check monotonicity and parameter lifting, and hence can be used as a fast pre-processing step in practice.</description>

      <title>Learning Temporal Logic Predicates from Data with Statistical Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10449v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Temporal logic rules are often used in control and robotics to provide structured, human-interpretable descriptions of trajectory data. These rules have numerous applications including safety validation using formal methods, constraining motion planning among autonomous agents, and classifying data. However, existing methods for learning temporal logic predicates from data do not provide assurances about the correctness of the resulting predicate. We present a novel method to learn temporal logic predicates from data with finite-sample correctness guarantees. Our approach leverages expression optimization and conformal prediction to learn predicates that correctly describe future trajectories under mild statistical assumptions. We provide experimental results showing the performance of our approach on a simulated trajectory dataset and perform ablation studies to understand how each component of our algorithm contributes to its performance.</description>

      <title>Measurability in the Fundamental Theorem of Statistical Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10243v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Fundamental Theorem of Statistical Learning states that a hypothesis space is PAC learnable if and only if its VC dimension is finite. For the agnostic model of PAC learning, the literature so far presents proofs of this theorem that often tacitly impose several measurability assumptions on the involved sets and functions. We scrutinize these proofs from a measure-theoretic perspective in order to explicitly extract the assumptions needed for a rigorous argument. This leads to a sound statement as well as a detailed and self-contained proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Statistical Learning in the agnostic setting, showcasing the minimal measurability requirements needed. As the Fundamental Theorem of Statistical Learning underpins a wide range of further theoretical developments, our results are of foundational importance: A careful analysis of measurability aspects is essential, especially when the theorem is used in settings where measure-theoretic subtleties play a role. We particularly discuss applications in Model Theory, considering NIP and o-minimal structures. Our main theorem presents sufficient conditions for the PAC learnability of hypothesis spaces defined over o-minimal expansions of the reals. This class of hypothesis spaces covers all artificial neural networks for binary classification that use commonly employed activation functions like ReLU and the sigmoid function.</description>

      <title>Reachability in 3-VASS is Elementary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13916v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The reachability problem in 3-dimensional vector addition systems with states (3-VASS) is known to be PSpace-hard, and to belong to Tower. We significantly narrow down the complexity gap by proving the problem to be solvable in doubly-exponential space. The result follows from a new upper bound on the length of the shortest path: if there is a path between two configurations of a 3-VASS then there is also one of at most triply-exponential length. We show it by introducing a novel technique of approximating the reachability sets of 2-VASS by small semi-linear sets.</description>
