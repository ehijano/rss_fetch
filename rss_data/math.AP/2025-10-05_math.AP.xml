      <title>$\mu$-ellipticity and nonautonomous integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $\mu$-ellipticity is a form of nonuniform ellipticity arising in various contexts from the calculus of variations. Understanding regularity properties of minimizers in the nonautonomous setting is a challenging task fostering the development of delicate techniques and the discovery of new irregularity phenomena.</description>

      <title>Scalar Approach to ARZ-Type Systems of Conservation Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are interested in 2x2 systems of conservation laws of special structure, including generalized Aw-Rascle and Zhang (GARZ) models for road traffic. The simplest representative is the Keyfitz-Kranzer system, where one equation is nonlinear and not coupled to the other, and the second equation is a linear transport equation which coefficients depend on the solution of the first equation. In GARZ systems, the coupling is stronger, they do not have the triangular structure of Keyfitz-Kranzer.
  In our setting, we claim that it makes sense to address these systems via a kind of splitting approach. Indeed, [E. Y. Panov, Instability in models connected with fluid flows II, 2008] proposes a robust framework for solving linear transport equations with divergence free coefficients. Our idea is to use this theory for the second equation of GARZ systems, and to exploit discontinuous flux theory advances for the first equation of the system.</description>

      <title>Stable determination of the nonlinear parameter in the non-diffusive Westervelt equation from the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Westervelt equation models the propagation of nonlinear acoustic waves in a regime well-suited for applications such as medical ultrasound imaging. In this work, we prove that the nonlinear parameter, as well as the sound speed, can be stably recovered from the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map associated with the non-diffusive Westervelt equation in (1+3)-dimensions. This result is essential for the feasibility of reconstruction methods. The Dirichlet-to-Neumann map encodes boundary measurements by associating a prescribed pressure profile on the boundary with the resulting pressure fluctuations. We prove stability provided the sound speed is a priori known to be close to a reference sound speed and under certain geometrical conditions. We also verify the result through numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Well-Posedness for the Euler Equations in Function Spaces of Generalized Smoothness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the question of well-posedness for the incompressible Euler equations in generalized function spaces of the type $B^{s,\psi}_{p,q}(\mathbb{R}^d)$ and $F^{s,\psi}_{p,q}(\mathbb{R}^d)$ where $\psi$ is a slowly varying function in the Karamata sense and $s=d/p+1$. We prove that if $\psi$ grows fast enough, then there is a local in time solution to the Euler equations. We also establish a BKM-type criterion that allows us to obtain global existence in two dimensions.</description>

      <title>Error estimates for finite-dimensional approximations of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations on the Wasserstein space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation set on the Wasserstein space $\mathcal{P}_2(\mathbb{R}^d)$, with a second order term arising from a purely common noise. We do not assume that the Hamiltonian is convex in the momentum variable, which means that we cannot rely on representation formulas coming from mean field control. In this setting, Gangbo, Mayorga, and \'Swi\k{e}ch showed via viscosity solutions methods that the HJB equation on $\mathcal{P}_2(\mathbb{R}^d)$ can be approximated by a sequence of finite-dimensional HJB equations. Our main contribution is to quantify this convergence result. The proof involves a doubling of variables argument, which leverages the Hilbertian approach of P.L. Lions for HJB equations in the Wasserstein space, rather than working with smooth metrics which have been used to obtain similar results in the presence of idiosyncratic noise. In dimension one, our doubling of variables argument is made relatively simply by the rigid structure of one-dimensional optimal transport, but in higher dimension the argument is significantly more complicated, and relies on some estimates concerning the "simultaneous quantization" of probability measures.</description>

      <title>Burgers equation with a twist: A study on rotational-form equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new three-dimensional (3D) equation is proposed, which is formed like Burgers' equation by starting with the 3D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations (NSE) and eliminating the pressure and the divergence-free constraint, but instead the Bernoulli pressure is eliminated, leaving only the rotational form of the nonlinearity. This results in a globally well-posed 3D equation which has exactly the same energy balance as the 3D NSE. Moreover, we show in simulations that the system seems to exhibit chaotic dynamics. In the viscous case, we prove the global existence, uniqueness, and higher-order regularity of solutions to this equation with no restriction on the initial data other than smoothness. In the inviscid case, local existence holds, but we give an example of a class of solutions with smooth initial data that develop a singularity in finite time in both 2D and 3D. Moreover, a new numerical algorithm is presented in the 2D case, and simulations are included to illustrate the dynamics. In addition, a rotational-form modification for the 2D Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equations (KSE) is proposed, and global well-posedness is also established. We also discuss several related ``rotational form'' equations, and some pedagogical considerations. Global well-posedness for the original 3D NSE and 2D KSE remains a challenging open problem, but it is hoped that by focusing on the rotational term, new insight may be gained.</description>

      <title>Super-Liouville equation with a spinorial Yamabe type term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the super-Liouville equation with a spinorial Yamabe type term, a natural generalization of Liouville equation, super-Liouville equation and spinorial Yamabe type equation. We establish some refined qualitative properties for such a blow-up sequence. In particular, we show energy identities not only for the spinor part but also for the function part. Moreover, the local masses at a blow-up point are also computed. A new phenomenon is that there are two kinds of singularities and local masses due to the nonlinear spinorial Yamabe type term, which is different from super-Liouville equation.</description>

      <title>Lyapunov exponents, entropy and mixing for DiPerna-Lions flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main goal of this work is to establish an asymptotic form of Bressan's mixing conjecture. To this end, we develop an ergodic-theoretic framework for incompressible DiPerna-Lions flows. Lyapunov exponents are defined via an Oseledets-type decomposition and related to metric entropy through a version of Ruelle's inequality in this low-regularity setting. These tools yield sharp bounds on asymptotic regularity propagation and mixing rates, leading to our main result.</description>

      <title>On the existence of fibered three-dimensional perfect fluid equilibria without continuous Euclidean symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following Lortz, we construct a family of smooth steady states of the ideal, incompressible Euler equation in three dimensions that possess no continuous Euclidean symmetry. As in Lortz, they do possess a planar reflection symmetry and, as such, all the orbits of the velocity are closed. Different from Lortz, our construction has a discrete m-fold symmetry and is foliated by invariant cylindrical level sets of a non-degenerate Bernoulli pressure. Such examples narrow the scope of validity of Grad's conjecture that the only solutions with a continuous symmetry can be fibered by pressure surfaces.</description>

      <title>The epsilon-regularity theorem for Brakke flows near triple junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the $\varepsilon$-regularity theorem for $k$-dimensional, possibly forced, Brakke flows near a static, multiplicity-one triple junction. This result provides the parabolic analogue to L. Simon's foundational work on the singular set of stationary varifolds and confirms that the regular structure of triple junctions persists under weak mean curvature flow. The regularity holds provided the flow satisfies a mild structural assumption on its 1-dimensional slices taken orthogonal to the junction's $(k-1)$-dimensional spine, which prohibits certain topological degeneracies. We prove that this assumption is automatically satisfied by two fundamental classes of flows where such singularities are expected: codimension-one multi-phase flows, such as the canonical $\mathrm{BV}$-Brakke flows constructed by the authors, and flows of arbitrary codimension with the structure of a mod 3 integral current, which arise from Ilmanen's elliptic regularization. For such flows, therefore, the Simon type regularity holds unconditionally.</description>

      <title>Homogeneous steady states for the generalized surface quasi-geostrophic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider homogeneous (stationary self-similar) solutions to the generalized surface quasi-geostrophic (gSQG) equations parametrized by the constant $0&lt;s&lt;1$, representing the 2D Euler equations ($s=1$), the SQG equations $(s=1/2)$, and stationary equations ($s=0$); namely, solutions whose stream function and vorticity are of the form \begin{align*} \psi=\frac{w(\theta)}{r^{\beta}},\quad \omega=\frac{g(\theta)}{r^{\beta+2s}}, \end{align*} in polar coordinates $(r,\theta)$ with parameter $\beta\in \mathbb{R}$. We explore a question on the existence of non-trivial homogeneous solutions by assuming an odd symmetric profile $(w,g)$ with Fourier modes larger than $m_0\geq 1$. We show existence of such solutions for $-m_0-2s&lt;\beta&lt;-2s$ and $0&lt;\beta&lt;m_0$ ($1/2-s&lt;\beta&lt;m_0$ for $0&lt;s&lt;1/2$) and non-existence of such solutions for $-2s\leq \beta\leq 0$. The main result provides examples of self-similar solutions which belong to critical and supercritical regimes for the local well-posedness of the gSQG equations for $0&lt;s&lt;1$ and the first examples of self-similar solutions for the SQG equations and the more singular equations $0&lt;s\leq 1/2$ in the stationary setting.</description>

      <title>Global bifurcation of localised 2D patterns emerging from spatial heterogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a general approach to prove the existence, both locally and globally in amplitude, of fully localised multi-dimensional patterns in partial differential equations containing a compact spatial heterogeneity. While one-dimensional localised patterns induced by spatial heterogeneities have been well-studied, proving the existence of fully localised patterns emerging from a Turing instability in higher dimensions remains a key open problem in pattern formation. In order to demonstrate the approach, we consider the two-dimensional Swift-Hohenberg equation, whose linear bifurcation parameter is perturbed by a radially-symmetric potential function. In this case, the trivial state is unstable in a compact neighbourhood of the origin and linearly stable outside. We prove the existence of local bifurcation branches of fully localised patterns, characterise their stability and bifurcation structure, and then rigorously continue solutions to large amplitude via analytic global bifurcation theory. Notably, the primary bifurcating branch in the Swift-Hohenberg equation alternates between an axisymmetric spot and a non-axisymmetric `dipole' pattern, depending on the width of the spatial heterogeneity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20154v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nematic surfaces are thin fluid structures, ideally two-dimensional, endowed with an in-plane nematic order. In 2012, two variational models have been introduced by Giomi [11] and by Napoli and Vergori [29,28]. Both penalize the area of the surface and the gradient of the director: in [11] the covariant derivative of the director is considered, while [28] deals with the surface gradient. In this paper, a complete variational analysis of the model proposed by Giomi is performed for revolution surfaces spanning two coaxial rings.</description>

      <title>On De Giorgi's Conjecture of Nonlocal approximations for free-discontinuity problems: The symmetric gradient case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23908v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that E. De Giorgi's conjecture for the nonlocal approximation of free-discontinuity problems extends to the case of functionals defined in terms of the symmetric gradient of the admissible field. After introducing a suitable class of continuous finite-difference approximants, we show the compactness of deformations with equibounded energies, as well as their Gamma-convergence. The compactness analysis is a crucial hurdle, which we overcome by generalizing a Fr\'echet-Kolmogorov approach previously introduced by two of the authors. A second essential difficulty is the identification of the limiting space of admissible deformations, since a control on the directional variations is, a priori, only available in average. A limiting representation in GSBD is eventually established via a novel characterization of this space.</description>

      <title>Quantum inverse scattering for time-dependent repulsive Hamiltonians of quadratic type</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05915v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a multidimensional inverse scattering problem under the time-dependent repulsive Hamiltonians of quadratic type. The time-dependent coefficient on the repulsive term decays as the inverse square of time, which is the threshold between the standard free Schroedinger operator and the time-independent repulsive Hamiltonians of quadratic type. Applying the Enss-Weder time-dependent method, we can determine uniquely the short-range potential functions with Coulomb-like singularities from the velocity limit of the scattering operator.</description>

      <title>Liouville type results for semilinear elliptic equation and inequality on pseudo-Hermitian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09130v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the semilinear elliptic equation and inequality on pseudo-Hermitian manifolds. In particular, we first obtain a Liouville theorem for the equation $\Delta_b u+F(u)=0$ based on a generalized Jerison-Lee's formula. Next, we prove the nonexistence of a positive solution to the inequality $\Delta_b u+F(u)\leq 0$ under the volume estimate.</description>

      <title>Global Well-posedness for the periodic fractional cubic NLS in 1D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01204v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the defocusing periodic fractional nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation
  $$ i \partial_t u +\left(-\Delta\right)^{\alpha}u=-\lvert u \rvert ^2 u, $$ where $\frac{1}{2}&lt; \alpha &lt; 1$ and the operator $(-\Delta)^\alpha$ is the fractional Laplacian with symbol $\lvert k \rvert ^{2\alpha}$. We establish global well-posedness in $H^s(\mathbb{T})$ for $s\geq \frac{1-\alpha}{2}$ and we conjecture this threshold to be sharp as it corresponds to the pseudo-Galilean symmetry exponent. Our proof uses the $I$-method to control the $H^s(\mathbb{T})$-norm of solutions with infinite energy initial data. A key component of our approach is a set of improved long-time bilinear Strichartz estimates on the rescaled torus, which allow us to exploit the subcritical nature of the equation.</description>

      <title>On the complex moment problem as a dynamic inverse problem for a discrete system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02443v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the complex moment problem, that is the problem of constructing a positive Borel measure on $\mathbb{C}$ from a given set of moments. We relate this problem to the dynamic inverse problem for the discrete system associated with the complex Jacobi matrix. We show how the characterization of dynamic inverse data in solving the inverse problem provides sufficient conditions for solving the complex moment problem.</description>

      <title>Energy cascades and condensation via coherent dynamics in Hamiltonian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03663v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work makes analytic progress in the deterministic study of turbulence in Hamiltonian systems by identifying two types of energy cascade solutions and the corresponding large- and small-scale structures they generate. The first cascade represents condensate formation via a highly coherent process recently uncovered, while the second cascade, which has not been previously observed, leads to the formation of other large-scale structures. The concentration of energy at small scales is characterized in both cases by the development of a power-law spectrum in finite time, causing the blow-up of Sobolev norms and the formation of coherent structures at small scales. These structures approach two different types of singularities: a point discontinuity in one case and a cusp in the other. The results are fully analytic and explicit, based on two solvable families of Hamiltonian systems identified in this study.</description>

      <title>Wasserstein Bounds for generative diffusion models with Gaussian tail targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11251v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an estimate of the Wasserstein distance between the data distribution and the generation of score-based generative models. The sampling complexity with respect to dimension is $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{d})$, with a logarithmic constant. In the analysis, we assume a Gaussian-type tail behavior of the data distribution and an $\epsilon$-accurate approximation of the score. Such a Gaussian tail assumption is general, as it accommodates a practical target - the distribution from early stopping techniques with bounded support.
  The crux of the analysis lies in the global Lipschitz bound of the score, which is shown from the Gaussian tail assumption by a dimension-independent estimate of the heat kernel. Consequently, our complexity bound scales linearly (up to a logarithmic constant) with the square root of the trace of the covariance operator, which relates to the invariant distribution of the forward process.</description>

      <title>Mixing for dynamical systems driven by stationary noises</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11699v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The paper deals with the problem of long-time asymptotic behaviour of solutions for classes of ODEs and PDEs, perturbed by stationary noises. The latter are not assumed to be $\delta$-correlated in time, so that the evolution in question is not necessarily Markovian. We first prove an abstract result which imply the mixing for random dynamical systems satisfying appropriate dissipativity and controllability conditions. It is applicable to a large class of evolution equations, and we illustrate it on the examples of a chain of anharmonic oscillators coupled to heat reservoirs, the 2d Navier-Stokes system, and a complex Ginzburg-Landau equation. Our results also apply to the general theory of random processes on the 1d lattice and allow one to get for them results related to Dobrushin's theorems on reconstructing processes via their conditional distributions. The proof is based on an iterative construction with quadratic convergence. It uses the method of Kantorovich functional, introduced in [KPS02, Kuk02, Kuk06] in the context of randomly forced PDEs, and some ideas suggested in [Shi15, KNS20] to prove mixing with the help of controllability properties of an associated system</description>
