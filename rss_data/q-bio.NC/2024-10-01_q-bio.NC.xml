      <title>Brain Network Diffusion-Driven fMRI Connectivity Augmentation for Enhanced Autism Spectrum Disorder Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is an emerging neuroimaging modality that is commonly modeled as networks of Regions of Interest (ROIs) and their connections, named functional connectivity, for understanding the brain functions and mental disorders. However, due to the high cost of fMRI data acquisition and labeling, the amount of fMRI data is usually small, which largely limits the performance of recognition models. With the rise of generative models, especially diffusion models, the ability to generate realistic samples close to the real data distribution has been widely used for data augmentations. In this work, we present a transformer-based latent diffusion model for functional connectivity generation and demonstrate the effectiveness of the diffusion model as an augmentation tool for fMRI functional connectivity. Furthermore, extended experiments are conducted to provide detailed analysis of the generation quality and interpretations for the learned feature pattern. Our code will be made public upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>Feature Estimation of Global Language Processing in EEG Using Attention Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the correlation between EEG features and cognitive tasks is crucial for elucidating brain function. Brain activity synchronizes during speaking and listening tasks. However, it is challenging to estimate task-dependent brain activity characteristics with methods with low spatial resolution but high temporal resolution, such as EEG, rather than methods with high spatial resolution, like fMRI. This study introduces a novel approach to EEG feature estimation that utilizes the weights of deep learning models to explore this association. We demonstrate that attention maps generated from Vision Transformers and EEGNet effectively identify features that align with findings from prior studies. EEGNet emerged as the most accurate model regarding subject independence and the classification of Listening and Speaking tasks. The application of Mel-Spectrogram with ViTs enhances the resolution of temporal and frequency-related EEG characteristics. Our findings reveal that the characteristics discerned through attention maps vary significantly based on the input data, allowing for tailored feature extraction from EEG signals. By estimating features, our study reinforces known attributes and predicts new ones, potentially offering fresh perspectives in utilizing EEG for medical purposes, such as early disease detection. These techniques will make substantial contributions to cognitive neuroscience.</description>

      <title>Brain-JEPA: Brain Dynamics Foundation Model with Gradient Positioning and Spatiotemporal Masking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Brain-JEPA, a brain dynamics foundation model with the Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA). This pioneering model achieves state-of-the-art performance in demographic prediction, disease diagnosis/prognosis, and trait prediction through fine-tuning. Furthermore, it excels in off-the-shelf evaluations (e.g., linear probing) and demonstrates superior generalizability across different ethnic groups, surpassing the previous large model for brain activity significantly. Brain-JEPA incorporates two innovative techniques: Brain Gradient Positioning and Spatiotemporal Masking. Brain Gradient Positioning introduces a functional coordinate system for brain functional parcellation, enhancing the positional encoding of different Regions of Interest (ROIs). Spatiotemporal Masking, tailored to the unique characteristics of fMRI data, addresses the challenge of heterogeneous time-series patches. These methodologies enhance model performance and advance our understanding of the neural circuits underlying cognition. Overall, Brain-JEPA is paving the way to address pivotal questions of building brain functional coordinate system and masking brain activity at the AI-neuroscience interface, and setting a potentially new paradigm in brain activity analysis through downstream adaptation.</description>

      <title>A multimodal LLM for the non-invasive decoding of spoken text from brain recordings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brain-related research topics in artificial intelligence have recently gained popularity, particularly due to the expansion of what multimodal architectures can do from computer vision to natural language processing. Our main goal in this work is to explore the possibilities and limitations of these architectures in spoken text decoding from non-invasive fMRI recordings. Contrary to vision and textual data, fMRI data represent a complex modality due to the variety of brain scanners, which implies (i) the variety of the recorded signal formats, (ii) the low resolution and noise of the raw signals, and (iii) the scarcity of pretrained models that can be leveraged as foundation models for generative learning. These points make the problem of the non-invasive decoding of text from fMRI recordings very challenging. In this paper, we propose and end-to-end multimodal LLM for decoding spoken text from fMRI signals. The proposed architecture is founded on (i) an encoder derived from a specific transformer incorporating an augmented embedding layer for the encoder and a better-adjusted attention mechanism than that present in the state of the art, and (ii) a frozen large language model adapted to align the embedding of the input text and the encoded embedding of brain activity to decode the output text. A benchmark in performed on a corpus consisting of a set of interactions human-human and human-robot interactions where fMRI and conversational signals are recorded synchronously. The obtained results are very promising, as our proposal outperforms the evaluated models, and is able to generate text capturing more accurate semantics present in the ground truth.

      <title>Modelando procesos cognitivos de la lectura natural con GPT-2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advancement of the Natural Language Processing field has enabled the development of language models with a great capacity for generating text. In recent years, Neuroscience has been using these models to better understand cognitive processes. In previous studies, we found that models like Ngrams and LSTM networks can partially model Predictability when used as a co-variable to explain readers' eye movements. In the present work, we further this line of research by using GPT-2 based models. The results show that this architecture achieves better outcomes than its predecessors.</description>

      <title>A Mathematical Perspective on Neurophenomenology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of consciousness studies, a key challenge is how to rigorously conceptualise first-person phenomenological descriptions of lived experience and their relation to third-person empirical measurements of the activity or dynamics of the brain and body. Since the 1990s, there has been a coordinated effort to explicitly combine first-person phenomenological methods, generating qualitative data, with neuroscientific techniques used to describe and quantify brain activity under the banner of "neurophenomenology". Here, we take on this challenge and develop an approach to neurophenomenology from a mathematical perspective. We harness recent advances in theoretical neuroscience and the physics of cognitive systems to mathematically conceptualise first-person experience and its correspondence with neural and behavioural dynamics. Throughout, we make the operating assumption that the content of first-person experience can be formalised as (or related to) a belief (i.e. a probability distribution) that encodes an organism's best guesses about the state of its external and internal world (e.g. body or brain) as well as its uncertainty. We mathematically characterise phenomenology, bringing to light a tool-set to quantify individual phenomenological differences and develop several hypotheses including on the metabolic cost of phenomenology and on the subjective experience of time. We conceptualise the form of the generative passages between first- and third-person descriptions, and the mathematical apparatus that mutually constrains them, as well as future research directions. In summary, we formalise and characterise first-person subjective experience and its correspondence with third-person empirical measurements of brain and body, offering hypotheses for quantifying various aspects of phenomenology to be tested in future work.</description>

      <title>"What" x "When" working memory representations using Laplace Neural Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Working memory $\unicode{x2013}$ the ability to remember recent events as they recede continuously into the past $\unicode{x2013}$ requires the ability to represent any stimulus at any time delay. This property requires neurons coding working memory to show mixed selectivity, with conjunctive receptive fields (RFs) for stimuli and time, forming a representation of 'what' $\times$ 'when'. We study the properties of such a working memory in simple experiments where a single stimulus must be remembered for a short time. The requirement of conjunctive receptive fields allows the covariance matrix of the network to decouple neatly, allowing an understanding of the low-dimensional dynamics of the population. Different choices of temporal basis functions lead to qualitatively different dynamics. We study a specific choice $\unicode{x2013}$ a Laplace space with exponential basis functions for time coupled to an "Inverse Laplace" space with circumscribed basis functions in time. We refer to this choice with basis functions that evenly tile log time as a Laplace Neural Manifold. Despite the fact that they are related to one another by a linear projection, the Laplace population shows a stable stimulus-specific subspace whereas the Inverse Laplace population shows rotational dynamics. The growth of the rank of the covariance matrix with time depends on the density of the temporal basis set; logarithmic tiling shows good agreement with data. We sketch a continuous attractor CANN that constructs a Laplace Neural Manifold. The attractor in the Laplace space appears as an edge; the attractor for the inverse space appears as a bump. This work provides a map for going from more abstract cognitive models of WM to circuit-level implementation using continuous attractor neural networks, and places constraints on the types of neural dynamics that support working memory.</description>

      <title>EEG-EMG FAConformer: Frequency Aware Conv-Transformer for the fusion of EEG and EMG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motor pattern recognition paradigms are the main forms of Brain-Computer Interfaces(BCI) aimed at motor function rehabilitation and are the most easily promoted applications. In recent years, many researchers have suggested encouraging patients to perform real motor control execution simultaneously in MI-based BCI rehabilitation training systems. Electromyography (EMG) signals are the most direct physiological signals that can assess the execution of movements. Multimodal signal fusion is practically significant for decoding motor patterns. Therefore, we introduce a multimodal motion pattern recognition algorithm for EEG and EMG signals: EEG-EMG FAConformer, a method with several attention modules correlated with temporal and frequency information for motor pattern recognition. We especially devise a frequency band attention module to encode EEG information accurately and efficiently. What's more, modules like Multi-Scale Fusion Module, Independent Channel-Specific Convolution Module(ICSCM), and Fuse Module which can effectively eliminate irrelevant information in EEG and EMG signals and fully exploit hidden dynamics are developed and show great effects. Extensive experiments show that EEG-EMG FAConformer surpasses existing methods on Jeong2020 dataset, showcasing outstanding performance, high robustness and impressive stability.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric Covariance Regression for Massive Neural Data on Restricted Covariates via Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern recording techniques enable neuroscientists to simultaneously study neural activity across large populations of neurons, with capturing predictor-dependent correlations being a fundamental challenge in neuroscience. Moreover, the fact that input covariates often lie in restricted subdomains, according to experimental settings, makes inference even more challenging. To address these challenges, we propose a set of nonparametric mean-covariance regression models for high-dimensional neural activity with restricted inputs. These models reduce the dimensionality of neural responses by employing a lower-dimensional latent factor model, where both factor loadings and latent factors are predictor-dependent, to jointly model mean and covariance across covariates. The smoothness of neural activity across experimental conditions is modeled nonparametrically using two Gaussian processes (GPs), applied to both loading basis and latent factors. Additionally, to account for the covariates lying in restricted subspace, we incorporate graph information into the covariance structure. To flexibly infer the model, we use an MCMC algorithm to sample from posterior distributions. After validating and studying the properties of proposed methods by simulations, we apply them to two neural datasets (local field potential and neural spiking data) to demonstrate the usage of models for continuous and counting observations. Overall, the proposed methods provide a framework to jointly model covariate-dependent mean and covariance in high dimensional neural data, especially when the covariates lie in restricted domains. The framework is general and can be easily adapted to various applications beyond neuroscience.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12022v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern neuroscience has evolved into a frontier field that draws on numerous disciplines, resulting in the flourishing of novel conceptual frames primarily inspired by physics and complex systems science. Contributing in this direction, we recently introduced a mathematical framework to describe the spatiotemporal interactions of systems of neurons using lattice field theory, the reference paradigm for theoretical particle physics. In this note, we provide a concise summary of the basics of the theory, aiming to be intuitive to the interdisciplinary neuroscience community. We contextualize our methods, illustrating how to readily connect the parameters of our formulation to experimental variables using well-known renormalization procedures. This synopsis yields the key concepts needed to describe neural networks using lattice physics. Such classes of methods are attention-worthy in an era of blistering improvements in numerical computations, as they can facilitate relating the observation of neural activity to generative models underpinned by physical principles.</description>
