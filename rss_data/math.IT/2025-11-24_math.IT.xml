      <title>Functional uniqueness and stability of Gaussian priors in optimal L1 estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the functional uniqueness and stability of Gaussian priors in optimal $L^1$ estimation. While it is well known that the Gaussian prior uniquely induces linear conditional means under Gaussian noise, the analogous question for the conditional median (i.e., the optimal estimator under absolute-error loss) has only recently been settled. Building on the prior work establishing this uniqueness, we develop a quantitative stability theory that characterizes how approximate linearity of the optimal estimator constrains the prior distribution. For $L^2$ loss, we derive explicit rates showing that near-linearity of the conditional mean implies proximity of the prior to the Gaussian in the L\'evy metric. For $L^1$ loss, we introduce a Hermite expansion framework and analyze the adjoint of the linearity-defining operator to show that the Gaussian remains the unique stable solution. Together, these results provide a more complete functional-analytic understanding of linearity and stability in Bayesian estimation under Gaussian noise.</description>

      <title>The Star Product of Uniformly Random Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of determining the expected dimension of the star product of two uniformly random linear codes that are not necessarily of the same dimension. We achieve this by establishing a correspondence between the star product and the evaluation of bilinear forms, which we use to provide a lower bound on the expected star product dimension. We show that asymptotically in both the field size q and the dimensions of the two codes, the expected dimension reaches its maximum. Lastly, we discuss some implications related to private information retrieval, secure distributed matrix multiplication, quantum error correction, and the potential for exploiting the results in cryptanalysis.</description>

      <title>Structured Approximation of Toeplitz Matrices and Subspaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies two structured approximation problems: (1) Recovering a corrupted low-rank Toeplitz matrix and (2) recovering the range of a Fourier matrix from a single observation. Both problems are computationally challenging because the structural constraints are difficult to enforce directly. We show that both tasks can be solved efficiently and optimally by applying the Gradient-MUSIC algorithm for spectral estimation. For a rank $r$ Toeplitz matrix ${\boldsymbol T}\in {\mathbb C}^{n\times n}$ that satisfies a regularity assumption and is corrupted by an arbitrary ${\boldsymbol E}\in {\mathbb C}^{n\times n}$ such that $\|{\boldsymbol E}\|_2\leq \alpha n$, our algorithm outputs a Toeplitz matrix $\widehat{\boldsymbol T}$ of rank exactly $r$ such that $\|{\boldsymbol T}-\widehat{\boldsymbol T}\|_2 \leq C \sqrt r \, \|{\boldsymbol E}\|_2$, where $C,\alpha&gt;0$ are absolute constants. This performance guarantee is minimax optimal in $n$ and $\|{\boldsymbol E}\|_2$. We derive optimal results for the second problem as well. Our analysis provides quantitative connections between these two problems and spectral estimation. Our results are equally applicable to Hankel matrices with superficial modifications.</description>

      <title>Fast Decoding for Non-Adaptive Learning of Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi Random Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of learning an unknown graph via group queries on node subsets, where each query reports whether at least one edge is present among the queried nodes. In general, learning arbitrary graphs with \(n\) nodes and \(k\) edges is hard in the non-adaptive setting, requiring \(\Omega\big(\min\{k^2\log n,\,n^2\}\big)\) tests even when a small error probability is allowed. We focus on learning Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi (ER) graphs \(G\sim\ER(n,q)\) in the non-adaptive setting, where the expected number of edges is \(\bar{k}=q\binom{n}{2}\), and we aim to design an efficient testing--decoding scheme achieving asymptotically vanishing error probability. Prior work (Li--Fresacher--Scarlett, NeurIPS 2019) presents a testing--decoding scheme that attains an order-optimal number of tests \(O(\bar{k}\log n)\) but incurs \(\Omega(n^2)\) decoding time, whereas their proposed sublinear-time algorithm incurs an extra \((\log \bar{k})(\log n)\) factor in the number of tests. We extend the binary splitting approach, recently developed for non-adaptive group testing, to the ER graph learning setting, and prove that the edge set can be recovered with high probability using \(O(\bar{k}\log n)\) tests while attaining decoding time \(O(\bar{k}^{1+\delta}\log n)\) for any fixed \(\delta&gt;0\).</description>

      <title>Fluid Antenna System-Enabled UAV-to-Ground Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluid antenna systems (FAS) have emerged as a revolutionary technology offering enhanced spatial diversity within a compact form factor. Concurrently, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are integral to future networks, necessitating channel models that capture both multipath fading and shadowing. This letter presents a novel performance analysis of a UAV-to-ground link, where the receiver is equipped with an $N$-port FAS operating over the challenging double-shadowing fading channel. By adapting a tractable eigenvalue-based approximation for the correlated FAS ports, we derive new analytical expressions for the end-to-end signal-to-noise ratio statistics, namely the cumulative distribution function and the probability density function. Based on these statistics, we present exact integral expressions for the outage probability, average bit error rate, and average channel capacity. We further derive new, tractable closed-form solutions for the average bit error rate and capacity for the practical dual-rank, independent but non-identically distributed case. Finally, a key asymptotic analysis reveals that the system achieves a multiplicative diversity order of $G_d = M \times d$, which is precisely the product of the FAS spatial rank $M$ and the intrinsic channel diversity order $d$. Simulation results are provided to validate the high accuracy of our entire theoretical framework.</description>

      <title>Frobenius Revivals in Laplacian Cellular Automata: Chaos, Replication, and Reversible Encoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate Frobenius-driven revivals in prime-modulus Laplacian cellular
  automata, a phenomenon in which long chaotic transients collapse into exact,
  multi-tile replicas of an initial seed at algebraically prescribed times
  $t=p^m$.
  The mechanism follows directly from the Frobenius identity
  $(I+B)^{p^m}=I+B^{p^m}$, which eliminates all mixed binomial terms and enforces
  deterministic reappearance of the seed after dispersion.
  We provide a detailed numerical and analytical characterisation of these
  revivals across several moduli, examining entropy dynamics, spatial
  organisation, and local stability under perturbations.
  The revival structure yields several useful features: predictable transitions
  between chaotic and ordered phases, intrinsic spatial redundancy, and robust
  reconstruction via replica consensus in the presence of weak additive noise.
  We further show that composing Laplacian operators modulo multiple primes
  generates significantly extended periodic orbits while preserving exact
  reversibility.
  Building on these observations, we propose an explicit reversible encoding
  scheme based on chaotic transients and Frobenius returns, together with
  practical separation conditions and noise-tolerance estimates.
  Potential applications include reversible steganography, structured
  pseudorandomness, error-tolerant information representation, and procedural
  pattern synthesis.
  The results highlight an interplay between algebraic combinatorics and
  cellular-automaton dynamics, suggesting further avenues for theoretical and
  applied development.</description>

      <title>Contraction of Markovian Operators in Orlicz Spaces and Error Bounds for Markov Chain Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11200v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel concept of convergence for Markovian processes within Orlicz spaces, extending beyond the conventional approach associated with $L_p$ spaces. After showing that Markovian operators are contractive in Orlicz spaces, our key technical contribution is an upper bound on their contraction coefficient, which admits a closed-form expression. The bound is tight in some settings, and it recovers well-known results, such as the connection between contraction and ergodicity, ultra-mixing and Doeblin's minorisation. Specialising our approach to $L_p$ spaces leads to a significant improvement upon classical Riesz-Thorin's interpolation methods.
  Furthermore, by exploiting the flexibility offered by Orlicz spaces, we can tackle settings where the stationary distribution is heavy-tailed, a severely under-studied setup. The technical tools introduced lend themselves to providing novel bounds on the contraction coefficient (SDPI constant) of information-theoretic divergences. We thus provide a variety of examples in which we show an improvement over the state of the art. As an application of the framework put forward in the paper, we introduce tighter bounds on the mixing time of Markovian processes, better exponential concentration bounds for MCMC methods, and better lower bounds on the burn-in period. To conclude, we show how our results can be used to prove the concentration of measure phenomenon for a sequence of Markovian random variables.</description>

      <title>Generalization the parameters of minimal linear codes over the ring $\mathbb{Z}_{p^l}$ and $\mathbb{Z}_{{p_1}{p_2}}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09561v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, We introduce a condition that is both necessary and sufficient for a linear code to achieve minimality when analyzed over the rings $\mathbb{Z}_{n}$.The fundamental inquiry in minimal linear codes is the existence of a $[m,k]$ minimal linear code where $k$ is less than or equal to $m$. W. Lu et al. ( see \cite{nine}) showed that there exists a positive integer $m(k;q)$ such that for $m\geq m(k;q)$ a minimal linear code of length $m$ and dimension $k$ over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$ must exist. They give the upper and lower bound of $m(k;q)$. In this manuscript, we establish both an upper and lower bound for $m(k;p^l)$ and $m(k;p_1p_2)$ within the ring $\mathbb{Z}_{p^l}$ and $\mathbb{Z}_{p_1p_2}$ respectively.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic evaluation of the information processing capacity in reservoir computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15769v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reservoir computing (RC) is becoming increasingly important because of its short training time. The squared error normalized by the target output is called the information processing capacity (IPC) and is used to evaluate the performance of an RC system. Since RC aims to learn the relationship between input and output time series, we should evaluate the IPC for infinitely long data rather than the IPC for finite-length data. However, a method for estimating it has not been established. We evaluated the IPC for infinitely long data using the asymptotic expansion of the IPC and weighted least-squares fitting. Then, we showed the validity of our method by numerical simulations. This work makes the performance evaluation of RC more evident.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Gradient Coding: From Optimal Design to Privacy at Intermediate Nodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18251v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gradient coding is a distributed computing technique for computing gradient vectors over large datasets by outsourcing partial computations to multiple workers, typically connected directly to the server. In this work, we investigate gradient coding in a hierarchical setting, where intermediate nodes sit between the server and workers. This structure reduces the communication load received at the server, which is a bottleneck in conventional gradient coding systems. In this paper, the intermediate nodes, referred to as \textit{relays}, process the data received from workers and send the results to the server for the final gradient computation. Our main contribution is deriving the optimal communication-computation trade-off by designing a linear coding scheme, also considering straggling and adversarial nodes among both relays and workers. We propose a coding scheme which achieves both the optimal relay-to-server communication load and the optimal worker-to-relay communication load. We further extend our setting to incorporate privacy by requiring that relays learn no information about the computed partial gradients from the messages they receive. This is achieved by introducing shared randomness among workers, allowing each worker to encode its partial gradients such that the randomness cannot be canceled out at the relay. Meanwhile, the server can successfully decode the global gradient by eliminating this randomness after receiving the computations of the non-straggling relays. Importantly, this privacy guarantee is achieved without increasing the overall communication load.</description>

      <title>Sionna RT: Technical Report</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21719v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sionna is an open-source, GPU-accelerated library that, as of version 0.14, incorporates a ray tracer, Sionna RT, for simulating radio wave propagation. A unique feature of Sionna RT is differentiability, enabling the calculation of gradients for the channel impulse responses (CIRs), radio maps, and other related metrics with respect to system and environmental parameters, such as material properties, antenna patterns, and array geometries. The release of Sionna 1.0 provides a complete overhaul of the ray tracer, significantly improving its speed, memory efficiency, and extensibility. This document details the algorithms employed by Sionna RT to simulate radio wave propagation efficiently, while also addressing their current limitations. Given that the computation of CIRs and radio maps requires distinct algorithms, these are detailed in separate sections. For CIRs, Sionna RT integrates shooting and bouncing of rays (SBR) with the image method and uses a hashing-based mechanism to efficiently eliminate duplicate paths. Radio maps are computed using a purely SBR-based approach.</description>

      <title>Guessing Decoding of Short Blocklength Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12108v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Future beyond-5G and 6G systems demand ultra-reliable, low-latency communication with short blocklengths, motivating the development of universal decoding algorithms. Guessing decoding, which infers the noise or codeword candidate in order of decreasing (exact or approximate) likelihood, offers a universal framework applicable to short codes. In this paper, we present a unified treatment of two prominent recent families of guessing decoding: guessing random additive noise decoding (GRAND) and guessing codeword decoding (GCD). For each, we (i) present algorithmic implementations and ordering strategies; (ii) prove maximum-likelihood (ML) optimality under appropriate stopping criteria; (iii) derive saddle-point approximations for the average number of queries; and (iv) validate theoretical predictions with simulations. We further analyze the performance degradation due to limited search budgets relative to ML performance, compare key metrics (worst-case and average complexity, hardware considerations), and highlight how advances in one approach transfer naturally to the other. Our results clarify the operating regimes where GRAND and GCD demonstrate superior performance. This work provides both theoretical insights and practical guidelines for deploying universal guessing decoders in next-generation short-blocklength communications.</description>
