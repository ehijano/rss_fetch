      <title>First results from the E302 efficiency$\unicode{x2013}$instability experiment at the FACET-II facility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The beam-breakup (BBU) instability in plasma accelerators is seeded by a transverse offset between the driver and a trailing bunch. The BBU instability induces oscillations in the trailing bunch, which are detrimental to its beam quality. When the instability is large, assuming little mitigation from ion motion and energy spread, the beam suffers emittance growth, and charge can be kicked transversely out of the plasma channel. The detrimental effect on beam quality is substantially worse at high efficiencies, which places constraints on the achievable power efficiency in applications such as linear colliders, where maintaining the beam quality is required. In this paper, we present the first experimental signatures of the BBU instability in data taken in the E302 experiment at the FACET-II facility at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory. We use a specific beam-optical setup and a novel method to probe for transverse instabilities on diagnostic screens downstream of a magnetic dipole spectrometer. We complement the analysis with full 3D particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations of the plasma interaction using similar driver and trailing bunch parameters on a simulated FACET-II spectrometer.</description>

      <title>Synchronization of Synchrotron Radiation Bursts during a spatio-temporal Instability in accelerator-Based source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synchronization is a fundamental phenomenon in dynamical systems, occurring in a wide range of contexts such as mechanical, chemical, biological, and social systems. In this work, we explore a novel manifestation of synchronization in accelerator-based light sources, specifically in storage rings where relativistic electron bunches circulate and emit synchrotron radiation, used for user experiments. In such systems, a systematic spatio-temporal instability arises when the bunch contains a large number of electrons. This instability is characterized by the spontaneous formation of microstructures within the bunch, which appear with a bursting behavior. We demonstrate that these bursting events can be synchronized with an external sinusoidal signal by modulating the electric field in a radiofrequency (RF) cavity. This external modulation induces typical synchronization features such as Arnold tongues at fundamental, harmonic, and subharmonic frequencies of the natural bursting rate, as well as phase-slip phenomena near the synchronization threshold. The synchronization mechanism is analyzed using numerical simulations based on the Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equation, and a proof-of-principle experiment is conducted at the SOLEIL synchrotron facility.</description>
