      <title>Increasing Systemic Resilience to Socioeconomic Challenges: Modeling the Dynamics of Liquidity Flows and Systemic Risks Using Navier-Stokes Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern economic systems face unprecedented socioeconomic challenges, making systemic resilience and effective liquidity flow management essential. Traditional models such as CAPM, VaR, and GARCH often fail to reflect real market fluctuations and extreme events. This study develops and validates an innovative mathematical model based on the Navier-Stokes equations, aimed at the quantitative assessment, forecasting, and simulation of liquidity flows and systemic risks. The model incorporates 13 macroeconomic and financial parameters, including liquidity velocity, market pressure, internal stress, stochastic fluctuations, and risk premiums, all based on real data and formally included in the modified equation. The methodology employs econometric testing, Fourier analysis, stochastic simulation, and AI-based calibration to enable dynamic testing and forecasting. Simulation-based sensitivity analysis evaluates the impact of parameter changes on financial balance. The model is empirically tested using Georgian macroeconomic and financial data from 2010-2024, including GDP, inflation, the Gini index, CDS spreads, and LCR metrics. Results show that the model effectively describes liquidity dynamics, systemic risk, and extreme scenarios, while also offering a robust framework for multifactorial analysis, crisis prediction, and countercyclical policy planning.</description>

      <title>The Feasibility of MBSs as Decentralized Autonomous Organizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Can the general structure of a mortgage-backed security (MBS) contract be programmatically represented through the use of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs)? Such an approach could allow for the portfolio of loans to be managed by investors in a trustless and transparent way. The focus and scope of this paper is to explore the potential for applying the tools of modern fintech, such as asset tokenization, smart contracts, and DAOs, to reconstruct traditional structured products that have a greater degree of transparency and traceability. MBS investors face considerable value uncertainty as time increases between the actual occurrence (or non-occurrence) of cash flows and subsequent reporting. Given that an MBS is a financial contract, it should be expressible logically using the Algorithmic Contract Types Unified Standards (ACTUS). Since each underlying mortgage in an MBS derives its cash flows in a prescribed way over the life of the contract, implementation on a public blockchain could enable real-time ratings systems, improving market efficiency. We explore the potential for creating formal algorithmic designs of MBS-DAOs that incorporate individual mortgages, the underlying real estate assets (collateral), and any loan guarantees.</description>

      <title>Branding through responsibility: the advertising impact of CSR activities in the Korean instant noodles market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper empirically examines the extent to which a favorable view of a firm, shaped by its social contributions, influences consumer choices and firm sales. Using a favorability rating that reflects media exposure of each firm's corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities in the Korean instant noodles market during the 2010s, we find evidence that improvements in the corporate image of Ottogi - one of the country's largest instant noodle producers - positively affected consumer utility for the firm's products. Notably, Ottogi's annual sales of its major brands increased by an average of 23.7 million packages, or 6.7%, as a result of CSR activities and the associated rise in consumer favorability. This effect is comparable in magnitude to that of a nearly 60% increase in advertising spending. Our findings suggest that CSR can foster firm growth by boosting product sales.</description>

      <title>A job-based assessment of economic complexity: from hidden to revealed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Economic complexity measures aim to quantify the capability content or endowment of industries and territories; however, capabilities are not observable, and therefore cannot be directly used in the computations. We estimate such endowments by quantifying the quality and diversity of the skills in the occupations required in specific industries. We refer to this job-based assessment as the hidden complexity, in contrast with the usual revealed complexity, which is computed from economic outputs such as exports or production. We show that our job-based measure of complexity is positively associated to wage levels and labor productivity growth, whereas the classic revealed measure is not. Finally, we discuss the application of these methods at the territorial level, showing their connection with economic growth.</description>

      <title>Cutting the Geopolitical Ties: Foreign Exchange Reserves, GDP and Military Spending</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the amount of foreign exchange reserves (FER) in the world in a given currency is highly correlated with the GDP and military spending of that country for a set of western economies during the last 20 years. Taking into account multicollinearity, Ridge and Lasso regressions reveal that the Foreign Exchange Reserve is better explained by military spending than GDP for seven western currencies. For each year shown, military spending is statistically significant more than the monetary instrument M2. Comparing the currency of the second world economy, the Chinese renminbi, is well beyond the western FER equilibrium, but yearly analysis shows that there is a steady trend towards a new FER balance. Next, we define a complex geopolitical network model in which the probability of switching to an alternative FER currency depends both on economic and political factors. Military spending is introduced into the model as an average share of GDP observed within the data. As the GDP of a particular country grows, so does the military power of a country. The nature of the creation of new currency networks initially depends only on geopolitical allegiance. As the volume of trade with a particular country changes over a designated threshold, a country switches to the currency of that country due to increased trade. If the current steady trend continues within the same geopolitical setting as in the past twenty years, we extrapolate that the RMB and Western currencies could reach a new FER balance within 15 to 40 years, depending on the model setup.</description>

      <title>Strategic Alignment Patterns in National AI Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel visual mapping methodology for assessing strategic alignment in national artificial intelligence policies. The proliferation of AI strategies across countries has created an urgent need for analytical frameworks that can evaluate policy coherence between strategic objectives, foresight methods, and implementation instruments. Drawing on data from the OECD AI Policy Observatory, we analyze 15-20 national AI strategies using a combination of matrix-based visualization and network analysis to identify patterns of alignment and misalignment. Our findings reveal distinct alignment archetypes across governance models, with notable variations in how countries integrate foresight methodologies with implementation planning. High-coherence strategies demonstrate strong interconnections between economic competitiveness objectives and robust innovation funding instruments, while common vulnerabilities include misalignment between ethical AI objectives and corresponding regulatory frameworks. The proposed visual mapping approach offers both methodological contributions to policy analysis and practical insights for enhancing strategic coherence in AI governance. This research addresses significant gaps in policy evaluation methodology and provides actionable guidance for policymakers seeking to strengthen alignment in technological governance frameworks.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Monopoly Pricing With Multiple Varieties: Trading Up</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.07146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.07146v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies dynamic monopoly pricing for a broad class of settings that allow for multiple durable, multiple rental, or a mix of varieties. We show that the driving force behind pricing dynamics is the existence of trading-up opportunities. If there are no trading-up opportunities in the static monopoly outcome, then pricing dynamics do not emerge in equilibrium. With trading-up opportunities, pricing dynamics arise until these opportunities are exhausted or the game ends. We characterize the lower bound for the emerging prices and profit and study the conditions under which pricing dynamics end in finite time.</description>

      <title>Note on solving one-to-one matching models with linear transferable utility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05518v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive a system of fixed-point equations for the equilibrium transfers in a class of one-to-one matching models with linear transferable utility. We then show that, when the degree of substitution between alternatives is bounded from above, the derived system of equations constitutes a contraction mapping. As a result, fixed-point iterations are guaranteed to converge to the unique distribution of equilibrium transfers.</description>

      <title>Trade and pollution: Evidence from India</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09289v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: What happens to pollution when developing countries open their borders to trade? Theoretical predictions are ambiguous, and empirical evidence remains limited. We study the effects of the 1991 Indian trade liberalization reform on water pollution. The reform abruptly and unexpectedly lowered import tariffs, increasing exposure to trade. Larger tariff reductions are associated with relative increases in water pollution. The estimated effects imply a 0.12 standard deviation increase in water pollution for the median district exposed to the tariff reform.</description>
