      <title>A formal specification of the jq language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: jq is a widely used tool that provides a programming language to manipulate JSON data. However, the jq language is currently only specified by its implementation, making it difficult to reason about its behaviour. To this end, we provide a formal syntax and denotational semantics for a large subset of the jq language. Our most significant contribution is to provide a new way to interpret updates that allows for more predictable and performant execution.</description>

      <title>Concept-based Analysis of Neural Networks via Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Formal analysis of vision-based deep neural networks (DNNs) is highly desirable but it is very challenging due to the difficulty of expressing formal specifications for vision tasks and the lack of efficient verification procedures. In this paper, we propose to leverage emerging multimodal, vision-language, foundation models (VLMs) as a lens through which we can reason about vision models. VLMs have been trained on a large body of images accompanied by their textual description, and are thus implicitly aware of high-level, human-understandable concepts describing the images. We describe a logical specification language $\texttt{Con}_{\texttt{spec}}$ designed to facilitate writing specifications in terms of these concepts. To define and formally check $\texttt{Con}_{\texttt{spec}}$ specifications, we leverage a VLM, which provides a means to encode and efficiently check natural-language properties of vision models. We demonstrate our techniques on a ResNet-based classifier trained on the RIVAL-10 dataset leveraging CLIP as the multimodal model.</description>

      <title>Representing Knowledge and Querying Data using Double-Functorial Semantics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Category theory offers a mathematical foundation for knowledge representation and database systems. Popular existing approaches model a database instance as a functor into the category of sets and functions, or as a 2-functor into the 2-category of sets, relations, and implications. The functional and relational models are unified by double functors into the double category of sets, functions, relations, and implications. In an accessible, example-driven style, we show that the abstract structure of a 'double category of relations' is a flexible and expressive language in which to represent knowledge, and we show how queries on data in the spirit of Codd's relational algebra are captured by double-functorial semantics.</description>

      <title>Regular Games with Imperfect Information Are Not That Regular</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider two-player games with imperfect information and the synthesis of a randomized strategy for one player that ensures the objective is satisfied almost-surely (i.e., with probability 1), regardless of the strategy of the other player. Imperfect information is modeled by an indistinguishability relation %that describing the pairs of histories that the first player cannot distinguish, a generalization of the traditional model with partial observations. The game is regular if it admits a regular function whose kernel commutes with the indistinguishability relation.
  The synthesis of pure strategies that ensure all possible outcomes satisfy the objective is possible in regular games, by a generic reduction that holds for all objectives. While the solution for pure strategies extends to randomized strategies in the traditional model with partial observations (which is always regular), we show that a similar reduction does not exist in the more general model. Despite that, we show that in regular games with Buechi objectives the synthesis problem is decidable for randomized strategies that ensure the outcome satisfies the objective almost-surely.</description>

      <title>Linear Arboreal Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.10088v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Arboreal categories, introduced by Abramsky and Reggio, axiomatise categories with tree-shaped objects. These categories provide a categorical language for formalising behavioural notions such as simulation, bisimulation, and resource-indexing. In this paper, we strengthen the axioms of an arboreal category to exclude `branching' behaviour, obtaining a notion of `linear arboreal category'. We then demonstrate that every arboreal category satisfying a linearisability condition has an associated linear arboreal subcategory related via an adjunction. This identifies the relationship between the pebble-relation comonad, of Montacute and Shah, and the pebbling comonad, of Abramsky, Dawar, and Wang, and generalises it further. As another outcome of this new framework, we obtain a linear variant of the arboreal category for modal logic. By doing so we recover different linear-time equivalences between transition systems as instances of their categorical definitions. We conclude with new preservation and characterisation theorems relating trace inclusion and trace equivalence with different linear fragments of modal logic.</description>

      <title>Complexity of the Model Checking problem for inquisitive propositional and modal logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14260v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to study the complexity of the model checking problem MC for inquisitive propositional logic InqB and for inquisitive modal logic InqM, that is, the problem of deciding whether a given finite structure for the logic satisfies a given formula. In recent years, this problem has been thoroughly investigated for several variations of dependence and teams logics, systems closely related to inquisitive logic. Building upon some ideas presented by Yang, we prove that the model checking problems for InqB and InqM are both AP-complete.</description>
