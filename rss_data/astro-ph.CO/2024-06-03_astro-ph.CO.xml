      <title>On the contributions of extragalactic CO emission lines to ground-based CMB observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the potential of CO rotational lines at redshifts $z\sim 0-6$ being an appreciable source of extragalactic foreground anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background. Motivated by previous investigations, we specifically focus on the frequency bands and small scales probed by ground-based surveys. Using an empirical parameterization for the relation between the infrared luminosity of galaxies and their CO line luminosity, conditioned on sub-mm observations of CO luminosity functions from $J=1$ to $J=7$ at $\nu = \{100,250\}$ GHz, we explore how uncertainty in the CO luminosity function translates into uncertainty in the signature of CO emission in the CMB. We find that at $\ell = 3000$ the amplitude of both CO autocorrelation and cross-correlation with the CIB could be detectable in an ACT-like experiment with 90, 150 and 220 GHz bands, even in the scenarios with the lowest amplitude consistent with sub-mm data. We also investigate, for the first time, the amplitude of the CO$\times$CIB correlation between different frequency bands and find that our model predicts that this signal could be comparable to the amplitude of the cosmic infrared background frequency cross-correlation at certain wavelengths. This implies current observations can potentially be used to constrain the bright end of CO luminosity functions, which are difficult to probe with current sub-mm telescopes due to the small volumes they survey. Our findings corroborate past results and have significant implications in template-based searches for CMB secondaries, such as the kinetic Sunyaev Zel'dovich effect, using the frequency-dependent high-$\ell$ TT power spectrum.</description>

      <title>Dwarf galaxies imply dark matter is heavier than $\mathbf{2.2 \times 10^{-21}} \, \mathbf{eV}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Folk wisdom dictates that a lower bound on the dark matter particle mass, $m$, can be obtained by demanding that the de Broglie wavelength in a given galaxy must be smaller than the virial radius of the galaxy, leading to $m\gtrsim 10^{-22}\text{ eV}$ when applied to typical dwarf galaxies. This lower limit has never been derived precisely or rigorously. We use stellar kinematical data for the Milky Way satellite galaxy Leo II to self-consistently reconstruct a statistical ensemble of dark matter wavefunctions and corresponding density profiles. By comparison to a data-driven, model-independent reconstruction, and using a variant of the maximum mean discrepancy as a statistical measure, we determine that a self-consistent description of dark matter in the local Universe requires $m&gt;2.2 \times 10^{-21}\,\mathrm{eV}\;\mathrm{(CL&gt;95\%)}$. This lower limit is free of any assumptions pertaining to cosmology, microphysics (including spin), or dynamics of dark matter, and only assumes that it is predominantly composed of a single bosonic particle species.</description>

      <title>Constraining Post-Newtonian Parameters with the Cosmic Microwave Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Parameterised Post-Newtonian (PPN) approach is the default framework for performing precision tests of gravity in nearby astrophysical systems. In recent works we have extended this approach for cosmological applications, and in this paper we use observations of the anisotropies in the Cosmic Microwave Background to constrain the time variation of the PPN parameters $\alpha$ and $\gamma$ between last scattering and the present day. We find their time-averages over cosmological history should be within $\sim 20\%$ of their values in GR, with $\bar{\alpha}=0.89^{+0.08}_{-0.09}$ and $\bar{\gamma}=0.90^{+0.07}_{-0.08}$ at the $68\%$ confidence level. We also constrain the time derivatives of these parameters, and find that their present-day values should be within a factor of two of the best Solar System constraints. Many of these results have no counter-part from Solar System observations, and are entirely new constraints on the gravitational interaction. In all cases, we find that the data strongly prefer $\bar{\alpha}\simeq \bar{\gamma}$, meaning that observers would typically find local gravitational physics to be compatible with GR, despite considerable variation of $\alpha$ and $\gamma$ being allowed over cosmic history. This study lays the groundwork for future precision tests of gravity that combine observations made over all cosmological and astrophysical scales of length and time.</description>

      <title>The Primordial Inflation Explorer (PIXIE): Mission Design and Science Goals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Primordial Inflation Explorer (PIXIE) is an Explorer-class mission concept to measure the energy spectrum and linear polarization of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). A single cryogenic Fourier transform spectrometer compares the sky to an external blackbody calibration target, measuring the Stokes I, Q, U parameters to levels ~200 Jy/sr in each 2.65 degree diameter beam over the full sky, in each of 300 frequency channels from 28 GHz to 6 THz. With sensitivity over 1000 times greater than COBE/FIRAS, PIXIE opens a broad discovery space for the origin, contents, and evolution of the universe. Measurements of small distortions from a CMB blackbody spectrum provide a robust determination of the mean electron pressure and temperature in the universe while constraining processes including dissipation of primordial density perturbations, black holes, and the decay or annihilation of dark matter. Full-sky maps of linear polarization measure the optical depth to reionization at nearly the cosmic variance limit and constrain models of primordial inflation. Spectra with sub-percent absolute calibration spanning microwave to far-IR wavelengths provide a legacy data set for analyses including line intensity mapping of extragalactic emission and the cosmic infrared background amplitude and anisotropy. We describe the PIXIE instrument sensitivity, foreground subtraction, and anticipated science return from both the baseline 2-year mission and a potential extended mission.</description>

      <title>ZTF SN Ia DR2: Peculiar velocities impact on the Hubble diagram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SNe Ia are used to determine the distance-redshift relation and build the Hubble diagram. Neglecting their host-galaxy peculiar velocities (PVs) may bias the measurement of cosmological parameters. The smaller the redshift, the larger the effect is. We use realistic simulations of SNe Ia observed by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) to investigate the effect of different methods to take into account PVs. We study the impact of neglecting galaxy PVs and their correlations in an analysis of the SNe Ia Hubble diagram. We find that it is necessary to use the PV full covariance matrix computed from the velocity power spectrum to take into account the sample variance. Considering the results we have obtained using simulations, we determine the PV systematic effects in the context of the ZTF DR2 SNe Ia sample. We determine the PV impact on the intercept of the Hubble diagram, $a_B$, which is directly linked to the measurement of $H_0$. We show that not taking into account PVs and their correlations results in a shift of the $H_0$ value of about $1.0$km.s$^{-1}$.Mpc$^{-1}$ and a slight underestimation of the $H_0$ error bar.</description>

      <title>What makes a cosmic filament? The dynamical origin and identity of filaments I. fundamentals in 2D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic filaments are the main transport channels of matter in the Megaparsec universe, and represent the most prominent structural feature in the matter and galaxy distribution.
  Here we describe and define the physical and dynamical nature of cosmic filaments. It is based on the realization that the complex spatial pattern and connectivity of the cosmic web are already visible in the primordial random Gaussian density field, in the spatial pattern of the primordial tidal and deformation eigenvalue field. The filaments and other structural features in the cosmic web emerging from this are multistream features and structural singularities in phase-space. The caustic skeleton formalism allows a fully analytical classification, identification, and treatment of the nonlinear cosmic web. The caustic conditions yield the mathematical specification of weblike structures in terms of the primordial deformation tensor eigenvalue and eigenvector fields, in which filaments are identified -- in 2D -- with the so-called cusp caustics. These are centered around points that are maximally stretched as a result of the tidal force field.
  The resulting mathematical conditions represent a complete characterization of filaments in terms of their formation history, dynamics, and orientation. We illustrate the workings of the formalism on the basis of a set of constrained $N$-body simulations of protofilament realizations. These realizations are analyzed in terms of spatial structure, density profiles, and multistream structure and compared to simpler density or potential field saddle point specifications.
  The presented formalism, and its 3D generalization, will facilitate the mining of the rich cosmological information contained in the observed weblike galaxy distribution, and be of key significance for the analysis of cosmological surveys such as SDSS, DESI, and Euclid.</description>

      <title>Simulating the arrival of the southern substructure in the galaxy cluster Abell 1758</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Abell 1758 (z~0.278) is a galaxy cluster composed of two structures: A1758N and A1758S, separated by ~2.2 Mpc. The northern cluster is itself a dissociative merging cluster that has already been modelled by dedicated simulations. Recent radio observations revealed the existence of a previously undetected bridge connecting A1758N and A1758S. New simulations are now needed to take into account the presence of A1758S. We wish to evaluate which orbital configuration would be compatible with a bridge between the clusters. Using N-body hydrodynamical simulations that build upon the previous model, we explore different scenarios that could have led to the current observed configuration. Five types of orbital approaches were tested: radial, tangential, vertical, post-apocentric, and outgoing. We found that the incoming simulated scenarios are generally consistent with mild enhancements of gas density between the approaching clusters. The mock X-ray images exhibit a detectable bridge in all cases. Compared to measurements of Chandra data, the amplitude of the X-ray excess is overestimated by a factor of ~2--3 in the best simulations. The scenario of tangential approach proved to be the one that best matches the properties of the profiles of X-ray surface brightness. The scenarios of radial approach of vertical approach are also marginally compatible.</description>

      <title>ZTF SN Ia DR2: Environmental dependencies of stretch and luminosity of a volume limited sample of 1,000 Type Ia Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To get distances, Type Ia Supernovae magnitudes are corrected for their correlation with lightcurve width and colour. Here we investigate how this standardisation is affected by the SN environment, with the aim to reduce scatter and improve standardisation. We first study the SN Ia stretch distribution, as well as its dependence on environment, as characterised by local and global (g-z) colour and stellar mass. We then look at the standardisation parameter $\alpha$, which accounts for the correlation between residuals and stretch, along with its environment dependence and linearity. We finally compute magnitude offsets between SNe in different astrophysical environments after colour and stretch standardisation, aka steps. This analysis is made possible due to the unprecedented statistics of the ZTF SN Ia DR2 volume-limited sample. The stretch distribution exhibits a bimodal behaviour, as previously found in literature. However, we find the distribution means to decrease with host stellar mass at a 9.0$\sigma$ significance. We demonstrate, at the 14.3$\sigma$ level, that the stretch-magnitude relation is non-linear, challenging the usual linear stretch-residuals relation. Fitting for a broken-$\alpha$ model, we indeed find two different slopes between stretch regimes ($x_1&lt;-0.49\pm0.06$): $\alpha_{low}=0.28\pm0.01$ and $\alpha_{high}=0.09\pm0.01$, a $\Delta_{\alpha}=-0.19\pm0.01$ difference. As the relative proportion of SNe Ia in the high-/low-stretch modes evolves with redshift and environment, this implies that a linear $\alpha$ also evolves with redshift and environment. Concerning the environmental magnitude offset $\gamma$, we find it to be greater than 0.14 mag regardless of the considered environmental tracer used (local or global colour and stellar mass), all measured at the $\geq 6\sigma$ level, increased to $\sim0.18\pm0.01$ mag when accounting for the stretch-non linearity.</description>

      <title>The Renormalization Group for Large-Scale Structure: Primordial non-Gaussianities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.21002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.21002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The renormalization group for large-scale structure (RG-LSS) describes the evolution of galaxy bias and stochastic parameters as a function of the cutoff $\Lambda$. In this work, we introduce interaction vertices that describe primordial non-Gaussianity into the Wilson-Polchinski framework, thereby extending the free theory to the interacting case. The presence of these interactions forces us to include new operators and bias coefficients to the bias expansion to ensure closure under renormalization. We recover the previously-derived ``scale-dependent bias'' contributions, as well as a new (subdominant) stochastic contribution. We derive the renormalization group equations governing the RG-LSS for a large class of interactions which account for vertices at linear order in $f_{\rm NL}$ that parametrize interacting scalar and massive spinning fields during inflation. Solving the RG equations, we show the evolution of the non-Gaussian contributions to galaxy clustering as a function of scale.</description>

      <title>Memory Burden Effect in Black Holes and Solitons: Implications for PBH</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The essence of the \textit{memory burden} effect is that a load of information carried by a system stabilizes it. This universal effect is especially prominent in systems with a high capacity of information storage, such as black holes and other objects with maximal microstate degeneracy, the entities universally referred to as \textit{saturons}. The phenomenon has several implications. The memory burden effect suppresses a further decay of a black hole, the latest, after it has emitted about half of its initial mass. As a consequence, the light primordial black holes (PBHs), that previously were assumed to be fully evaporated, are expected to be present as viable dark matter candidates. In the present paper, we deepen the understanding of the memory burden effect. We first identify various memory burden regimes in generic Hamiltonian systems and then establish a precise correspondence in solitons and in black holes. We make transparent, at a microscopic level, the fundamental differences between the stabilization by a quantum memory burden versus the stabilization by a long-range classical hair due to a spin or an electric charge. We identify certain new features of potential observational interest, such as the model-independent spread of the stabilized masses of initially degenerate PBHs.</description>

      <title>Breaking into the window of primordial black hole dark matter with x-ray microlensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) in the mass range $10^{-16}-10^{-11}~M_\odot$ may constitute all the dark matter. We show that gravitational microlensing of bright x-ray pulsars provide the most robust and immediately implementable opportunity to uncover PBH dark matter in this mass window. As proofs of concept, we show that the currently operational NICER telescope can probe this window near $10^{-14}~M_\odot$ with just two months of exposure on the x-ray pulsar SMC-X1, and that the forthcoming STROBE-X telescope can probe complementary regions in only a few weeks. These times are much shorter than the year-long exposures obtained by NICER on some individual sources. We take into account the effects of wave optics and the finite extent of the source, which become important for the mass range of our PBHs. We also provide a spectral diagnostic to distinguish microlensing from transient background events and to broadly mark the PBH mass if true microlensing events are observed. In light of the powerful science case, i.e., the imminent discovery of dark matter searchable over multiple decades of PBH masses with achievable exposures, we strongly urge the commission of a dedicated large broadband telescope for x-ray microlensing. We derive the microlensing reach of such a telescope by assuming sensitivities of detector components of proposed missions, and find that with hard x-ray pulsar sources PBH masses down to a few $10^{-17}~M_\odot$ can be probed.</description>

      <title>The eventful life of GS-z14-0, the most distant galaxy at redshift $z=14.32$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We developed a model for the star formation history (SFH) of super-early galaxies and applied it to GS-z14-0, the most distant galaxy known, located at $z=14.32$ (294 million years after the Big Bang). The SFH, starting at $z=26.7$, is complex. Initially ($z&gt;18$), the galaxy experiences feedback-regulated phases that are bursty, relatively faint (reaching $M_{\rm UV}=-18.4$), and unattenuated. When dust shielding allows for a smooth star formation rate (SFR), the galaxy quickly becomes heavily obscured. During this obscured phase, which lasts for approximately 20% of the total star-forming time, 70% of the observed stars are formed. Super-early galaxies in this phase should be detectable by ALMA. Twenty-six million years before observation, as the galaxy becomes super-Eddington, a powerful radiation-driven outflow clears most of the dust and significantly reduces the SFR by a factor of seven, from $100 \to 15\ M_\odot \rm yr^{-1}$. The galaxy transitions into a "blue monster" dominating the bright end of the UV luminosity function. When the outflow ceases due to decreased dust opacity, the galaxy relaxes into a post-starburst phase, in which it is currently observed. Our model accurately reproduces all the observed and inferred properties of the galaxy. The analysis of this extreme system opens exciting opportunities for studying the beginnings of the luminous Universe.</description>

      <title>HOLISMOKES XIII: Strong-lens candidates at all mass scales and their environments from the Hyper-Suprime Cam and deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have performed a systematic search for galaxy-scale strong lenses using Hyper Suprime-Cam imaging data, focusing on lenses in overdense environments. To identify these lens candidates, we exploit our neural network from HOLISMOKES VI, which is trained on realistic gri mock-images as positive examples, and real images as negative examples. Compared to our previous work, we lower the i-Kron radius limit to &gt;0.5". This results in an increase by around 73 million sources to more than 135 million images. During our visual multi-stage grading of the network candidates, we now inspect simultaneously larger stamps (80"x80") to identify large, extended arcs cropped in the 10"x10" cutouts, and classify additionally their overall environment. Here we also reinspect our previous lens candidates and classify their environment. Using these 546 visually identified lens candidates, we further define various criteria by exploiting extensive and complementary photometric redshift catalogs, to select the candidates in overdensities. In total, we identified 24 grade-A and 138 grade-B candidates with either spatially-resolved multiple images or extended, distorted arcs in the new sample. Furthermore, with our different techniques, we identify in total 237/546 lens candidates in a cluster-like or overdense environment, containing only 49 group- or cluster-scale re-discoveries. These results demonstrate the feasibility of downloading and applying network classifiers to hundreds of million cutouts, necessary in the upcoming era of big data from deep, wide-field imaging surveys like Euclid and the Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time, while leading to a sample size that can be inspected by humans. These networks, with false-positive rates of ~0.01%, are very powerful tools to identify such rare galaxy-scale strong lensing systems, while also aiding in the discovery of new strong lensing clusters.</description>

      <title>Supernova Neutrinos: flavour conversion mechanisms and new physics scenarios</title>

Abstract: A core-collapse supernova (SN) releases almost all of its energy in the form of neutrinos, which provide a unique opportunity to probe the working machinery of a SN. These sites are prone to neutrino-neutrino refractive effects, which can lead to fascinating collective flavour oscillations among neutrinos. This causes rapid neutrino flavour conversions deep inside the SN even for suppressed mixing angles, with intriguing consequences for the explosion mechanism as well as nucleosynthesis. We review the physics of collective oscillations of neutrinos -- both slow and fast, along with the well-known resonant flavour conversion effects, and discuss the current state-of-the-art of the field. Furthermore, we discuss how neutrinos from a SN can be used to probe novel particle physics properties, extreme values of which are otherwise inaccessible in laboratories.</description>

      <title>Impact of post-Born lensing on the CMB</title>

      <description>arXiv:1605.05662v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lensing of the CMB is affected by post-Born lensing, producing corrections to the convergence power spectrum and introducing field rotation. We show numerically that the lensing convergence power spectrum is affected at the $\lesssim 0.2\%$ level on accessible scales, and that this correction and the field rotation are negligible for observations with arcminute beam and noise levels $\gtrsim 1 \mu {\text{K}}\,{\text{arcmin}} $. The field rotation generates $\sim 2.5\%$ of the total lensing B-mode polarization amplitude ($0.2\%$ in power on small scales), but has a blue spectrum on large scales, making it highly subdominant to the convergence B modes on scales where they are a source of confusion for the signal from primordial gravitational waves. Since the post-Born signal is non-linear, it also generates a bispectrum with the convergence. We show that the post-Born contributions to the bispectrum substantially change the shape predicted from large-scale structure non-linearities alone, and hence must be included to estimate the expected total signal and impact of bispectrum biases on CMB lensing reconstruction quadratic estimators and other observables. The field-rotation power spectrum only becomes potentially detectable for noise levels $\ll 1 \mu {\text{K}}\,{\text{arcmin}}$, but its bispectrum with the convergence may be observable at $\sim 3\sigma$ with Stage IV observations. Rotation-induced and convergence-induced B modes are slightly correlated by the bispectrum, and the bispectrum also produces additional contributions to the lensed BB power spectrum.</description>

      <title>Suggestions of decreasing dark energy from supernova and BAO data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.04946v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The potential energy from a time-dependent scalar field provides a possible explanation for the observed cosmic acceleration. In this paper, we investigate how data from supernova and bary acoustic oscillation surveys constrain the possible evolution of a single scalar field over the period of time (roughly half the age of the universe) for which these data are available. Taking a linear approximation to the scalar potential $V(\phi) = V_0 + V_1 \phi$ around the present value, a likelihood analysis appears to significantly prefer models with a decreasing potential energy at present, with approximately $99.99 \%$ of the $\exp(-\chi^2/2)$ distribution having $V_1 &gt; 0$ in a convention where $\dot{\phi} \le 0$ at present. The models favoured by the distribution typically have an order one decrease $\langle |{\rm Range}[V(\phi(t))] / V(t_0)| \rangle \approx 0.36$ in the scalar potential energy over the time frame corresponding to $z &lt; 2$. According to the likelihood analysis, the $\Lambda$CDM model with no variation in dark energy appears to be significantly disfavoured in the context of the linear potential model, but this should be interpreted cautiously since model selection criteria that make use of $\Delta \chi^2$ while ignoring parameter space volumes still favour $\Lambda$CDM. Working with a second order approximation to the potential, the supernova data can be fit well for a wide range of possible potentials, including models where the universe has already stopped accelerating.</description>

      <title>Exploring the NANOGrav Signal and Planet-mass Primordial Black Holes through Higgs Inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.14688v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The data recently released by the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav) provides compelling evidence supporting the existence of a stochastic signal that aligns with a gravitational-wave background. We show that the scalar-induced gravitational waves from the Higgs inflation model with the parametric amplification mechanism can explain this signal. Such a gravitational-wave background naturally predicts the substantial existence of planet-mass primordial black holes, which can be planet 9 in our solar system and the lensing objects for the ultrashort-timescale microlensing events observed by the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment. Therefore, the NANOGrav signal, the potential Planet 9 in our solar system, and the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment can be explained within the framework of Higgs inflation.</description>

      <title>Self-Interacting Neutrinos in Light of Large-Scale Structure Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03956v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore a self-interacting neutrino cosmology in which neutrinos experience a delayed onset of free-streaming. We use the effective field theory of large-scale structure (LSS) to model matter distribution on mildly non-linear scales within the self-interacting neutrino cosmology for the first time. We perform the first combined likelihood analysis of BOSS full-shape galaxy clustering, weak lensing, and Lyman-$\alpha$ forest measurements, together with the cosmic microwave background (CMB) data from Planck. We find that the full data set strongly favors presence of a flavor-universal neutrino self-interaction, with a characteristic energy scale of order $10$ MeV. The preference is at the $\sim 5\sigma$ level and is primarily driven by the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest measurements and, to a lesser extent, the weak lensing data from DES. The self-interacting neutrino model eases both the Hubble tension and the $S_8$ tension between different cosmological data sets, but it does not resolve either. Finally, we note a preference for a non-zero sum of neutrino masses at the level of $\sim 0.3$ eV under this model, consistent with previous bounds. These results call for further investigation in several directions, and may have significant implications for neutrino physics and for future new-physics searches with galaxy surveys.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13259v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An accurate calculation of their abundance is crucial for numerous aspects of cosmology related to primordial black holes (PBHs). For example, placing constraints on the primordial power spectrum from constraints on the abundance of PBHs (or vice-versa), calculating the mass function observable today, or predicting the merger rate of (primordial) black holes observable by gravitational wave observatories such as LIGO, Virgo and KAGRA.
  In this chapter, we will discuss the different methods used for the calculation of the abundance of PBHs forming from large-amplitude cosmological perturbations, assuming only a minimal understanding of modern cosmology. Different parameters to describe cosmological perturbations will be considered (including different choices for the window function), and it will be argued that the compaction is typically the most appropriate choice. Different methodologies for calculating the abundance and mass function are explained, including \emph{Press-Schechter}-type and peaks theory approaches.</description>

Abstract: According to the inflationary theory of cosmology, most elementary particles in the current universe were created during a period of reheating after inflation. In this work we self-consistently couple the Einstein-inflaton equations to a strongly coupled quantum field theory (QFT) as described by holography. We show that this leads to an inflating universe, a reheating phase and finally a universe dominated by the QFT in thermal equilibrium.</description>

      <title>On energy and particle production in cosmology: the particular case of the gravitino</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14964v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well-known that the number of particles produced in cosmology, commonly defined in the literature from the Fock space of the instantaneous hamiltonian of the canonically normalized fields, is ambiguous. On the other hand, the energy computed from the energy-momentum tensor should be physical. We compare the corresponding Fock spaces and relate them through a Bogolyubov transformation. We find that for particles of spin $0$, $1$ and $3/2$ the two Fock spaces are different, whereas they are the same for spin $1/2$ fermions. For spin $0$ and $1$, for particles of high momenta the two Fock spaces align, as intuitively expected. For the spin $3/2$, one finds two puzzles. The first one is that the two corresponding Fock spaces do not match even in the limit of high momenta. The second is that whereas we provide evidence for the equivalence theorem between longitudinal gravitinos and the goldstino in terms of an exact matching between the lagrangians and the instantaneous hamiltonians for the canonically normalized fields, the energy operator computed from the Rarita--Schwinger action does not seem to be captured in a simple way by the goldstino action. Our results suggest a re-analysis of non-thermal gravitino production in cosmology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10455v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform a phenomenological comparison of the gravitational wave (GW) spectrum expected from cosmic gauge string networks and superstring networks comprised of multiple string types. We show how violations of scaling behavior and the evolution of the number of relativistic degrees of freedom in the early Universe affect the GW spectrum. We derive simple analytical expressions for the GW spectrum from superstrings and gauge strings that are valid for all frequencies relevant to pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) and laser interferometers. We analyze the latest data from PTAs and show that superstring networks are consistent with 32 nHz data from NANOGrav, but are excluded by 3.2 nHz data at $3\sigma$ unless the string coupling $g_s&lt;0.2$ or the strings evolve in only about 10\% of the volume of the higher-dimensional space. We also point out that while gauge string networks are excluded by NANOGrav-15 data at $3\sigma$, they are completely compatible with EPTA and PPTA data. Finally, we study correlations between GW signals at PTAs and laser interferometers.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave spectrum from expanding string loops on domain walls: Implication to nano-hertz pulsar timing array signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09599v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analytically calculate the spectrum of stochastic gravitational waves (GWs) emitted by expanding string loops on domain walls in the scenario where domain walls decay by nucleation of string loops. By introducing macroscopic parameters characterizing the nucleation of the loops, the stochastic GW spectrum is derived in a way that is independent of the details of particle physics models. In contrast to GWs emitted from bubble collisions of the false vacuum decay, the string loops do radiate GWs even when they are perfectly circular before their collisions, resulting in that more and more contribution to the spectrum comes from the smaller and smaller loops compared to the typical size of the collided loops. Consequently, the spectrum is linearly proportional to the frequency at the high-frequency region, which is peculiar to this GW source. Furthermore, the results are compared with the recent nano-Hertz pulsar timing array signal, as well as the projected sensitivity curves of future gravitational wave observatories.</description>

      <title>Model-independent Reconstruction of UV Luminosity Function and Reionization Epoch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10180v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We conduct a first comprehensive study of the Luminosity Function (LF) using a non-parametric approach. We use Gaussian Process to fit available luminosity data between redshifts $z \sim 2-8$. Our free-form LF in the non-parametric approach rules out the conventional Schechter function model to describe the abundance-magnitude relation at redshifts $z=3$ and $4$. Hints of deviation from the Schechter function are also noticed at redshifts 2, 7 and 8 at lower statistical significance. Significant deviation starts for brighter ionizing sources at $M_{\rm UV} \lesssim -21$. The UV luminosity density data at different redshifts are then derived by integrating the LFs obtained from both methods with a truncation magnitude of $-17$. In our analysis, we also include the first 90 arcmin$^2$ JWST/NIRCam data at $z \sim 9-12$. Since at larger magnitudes, we do not find major deviations from the Schechter function, the integrated luminosity density differs marginally between the two methods. Finally, we obtain the history of reionization from a joint analysis of UV luminosity density data along with the ionization fraction data and Planck observation of Cosmic Microwave Background. The history of reionization is not affected by the deviation of LFs from Schechter function at lower magnitudes. We derive reionization optical depth to be $\tau_{\rm re}=0.0494^{+0.0007}_{-0.0006}$ and the duration between 10$\%$ and 90$\% $completion of ionization process is found to be $\Delta z\sim 1.627^{+0.059}_{-0.071}$.</description>
