      <title>Slow driving induced multistability and remote synchronization in chaotic Chua's circuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the response of Chua's circuit driven by a chaotic signal of variable time-scale. We observe that when the frequency of the drive is significantly lower than that of the response and the driving strength is above a threshold, the Chua's circuit exhibits multiple stable attractors. The features of the attractors change as the driving strength {\epsilon} increases, for instance the attractors are double-scroll at low {\epsilon} and are single-scroll when {\epsilon} is high. We also investigate generalized synchronization(GS) between the drive and the response systems by employing the auxiliary system approach. When the drive is much slower than the response, we observe different scenarios of remote synchronization(RS) between response and auxiliary units. In addition to complete synchrony between response and auxiliary systems indicating GS between drive and response, we notice that the response and auxiliary units can be lag synchronized and can also have correlated trajectories indicating novel forms of RS. The slow drive can induce multistability between these RS states which disappears as the frequency of drive increases and become equivalent to the response Chua's ciruit.</description>

      <title>Synchronization and phase transition of two-dimensional self-rotating clock models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore possible synchronization in two-dimensional (2D) locally coupled discrete-state oscillators under thermal fluctuations, using the self-rotating $q$-state clock model as a prototype. Large-scale Monte Carlo simulations reveal that for $q \ge q_c$ (with $q_c = 5$), the system undergoes two-step Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transitions: first from a disordered phase to a critical synchronized phase, and then to a spatiotemporal pattern phase. The latter includes oscillatory droplet states that survive in finite systems and a thermodynamically stable spiral wave state. Notably, the synchronized phase features algebraically decaying spatial correlations, alongside divergent coherence time, thus realizing a continuous time crystal; while it vanishes when $q &lt; q_c$. Mean-field theory supports the existence of the synchronized phase, but predicts a lower critical value $q_c^{MF} = 4$.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Interactions for Efficient Swarm-Based Brownian Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Drawing inspiration from swarm intelligence, we show that short-range attractive interactions between thermally driven Brownian quasiparticles enable energy-efficient optimization. As quasiparticles can be generated directly within a material, the swarm size can be adjusted with minimal energy overhead. Using an optimization task defined by a spatially varying temperature landscape, we quantitatively show that interacting swarms reliably identify global optima and significantly outperform non-interacting searchers within a well-defined regime of interaction strength and swarm size. This improvement arises from emergent cooperative behavior, where local interactions guide the swarm toward high-quality solutions without central coordination. To link our physical model to experimental realizations, we coarse-grain the quasiparticle dynamics onto a sensor lattice and generate trajectories emulating particle-tracking measurements. We further show that the interacting swarm adapts robustly to landscapes that evolve over time. These findings establish interacting Brownian quasiparticles as a physical platform for scalable and energy-efficient unconventional computing.</description>

      <title>Resolving Structural Avalanches in Amorphous Carbon with Arclength Continuation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plastic deformation in amorphous solids is carried by localized shear transformations that self-organize into avalanches. In amorphous carbon modeled with a machine-learned interatomic potential, we find that the energetics and organization of these avalanches can be resolved by systematically following the underlying energy landscape. With a pseudo-arclength numerical continuation framework, we decompose avalanches into constituent shear transformations and determine their strain-dependent energetics. Our analysis shows that, prior to onset, avalanches have a latent structure that consists of well-separated local minima. We further demonstrate that arclength continuation yields an event driven framework for following avalanche dynamics, eliminating time-step effects on statistical avalanche properties such as distributions of stress drops.</description>

      <title>Gradient dynamics model for chemically driven running drops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a thermodynamically consistent model for chemically driven running drops on a solid substrate with reversible substrate adsorption of a wettability-changing chemical species. We consider drops confined to a vertical gap, thereby allowing us to first obtain a gradient dynamics description of the closed system, corresponding to a set of coupled dynamical equations for the drop profile and the chemical concentration profiles of species on the substrate and in both fluids (drop, ambient medium). Chemostatting the species in the drop and the ambient medium, we then derive a reduced model for the dynamics of the drop and the adsorbate on the substrate. When the externally imposed chemical potentials are distinct, the system is driven away from thermodynamic equilibrium, allowing for sustained drop self-propulsion across the substrate due to a wettability contrast maintained by chemical reactions. We numerically study the resulting running drops and show how they emerge from drift-pitchfork bifurcations.</description>

      <title>Singular basins in multiscale systems: tunneling between stable states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02001v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Real-world systems often evolve on different timescales and possess multiple coexisting stable states. Whether or not a system returns to a given stable state after being perturbed away from it depends on the shape and extent of its basin of attraction. We show that basins of attraction in multiscale systems can exhibit special geometric properties in the form of singular funnels. Although singular funnels are narrow, they can extend to different regions of the phase space and, unexpectedly, impact the system's resilience to perturbations. Consequently, singular funnels may prevent common dimensionality reductions in the limit of large timescale separation, such as the quasi-static approximation, adiabatic elimination and time-averaging of the fast variables. We refer to basins of attraction with singular funnels as singular basins. We show that singular basins are universal and occur robustly in a range of multiscale systems: the normal form of a pitchfork bifurcation with a slowly adapting parameter, an adaptive active rotator, and an adaptive network of phase rotators.</description>
