      <title>TurboSAT: Gradient-Guided Boolean Satisfiability Accelerated on GPU-CPU Hybrid System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While accelerated computing has transformed many domains of computing, its impact on logical reasoning, specifically Boolean satisfiability (SAT), remains limited. State-of-the-art SAT solvers rely heavily on inherently sequential conflict-driven search algorithms that offer powerful heuristics but limit the amount of parallelism that could otherwise enable significantly more scalable SAT solving. Inspired by neural network training, we formulate the SAT problem as a binarized matrix-matrix multiplication layer that could be optimized using a differentiable objective function. Enabled by this encoding, we combine the strengths of parallel differentiable optimization and sequential search to accelerate SAT on a hybrid GPU-CPU system. In this system, the GPUs leverage parallel differentiable solving to rapidly evaluate SAT clauses and use gradients to stochastically explore the solution space and optimize variable assignments. Promising partial assignments generated by the GPUs are post-processed on many CPU threads which exploit conflict-driven sequential search to further traverse the solution subspaces and identify complete assignments. Prototyping the hybrid solver on an NVIDIA DGX GB200 node, our solver achieves runtime speedups up to over 200x when compared to a state-of-the-art CPU-based solver on public satisfiable benchmark problems from the SAT Competition.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Conjunctive Query Entailment for $\mathcal S$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We clarify the complexity of answering unions of conjunctive queries over knowledge bases formulated in the description logic $\mathcal S$, the extension of $\mathcal{ALC}$ with transitive roles. Contrary to what existing partial results suggested, we show that the problem is in fact 2ExpTime-complete; hardness already holds in the presence of two transitive roles and for Boolean conjunctive queries. We complement this result by showing that the problem remains in coNExpTime when the input query is rooted or is restricted to use at most one transitive role (but may use arbitrarily many non-transitive roles).</description>

      <title>Semi-Algebraic Proof Systems for QBF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce new semi-algebraic proof systems for Quantified Boolean Formulas (QBF) analogous to the propositional systems Nullstellensatz, Sherali-Adams and Sum-of-Squares. We transfer to this setting techniques both from the QBF literature (strategy extraction) and from propositional proof complexity (size-degree relations and pseudo-expectation). We obtain a number of strong QBF lower bounds and separations between these systems, even when disregarding propositional hardness.</description>

      <title>Constrained and Robust Policy Synthesis with Satisfiability-Modulo-Probabilistic-Model-Checking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to compute reward-optimal policies for given and known finite Markov decision processes (MDPs) underpins a variety of applications across planning, controller synthesis, and verification. However, we often want policies (1) to be robust, i.e., they perform well on perturbations of the MDP and (2) to satisfy additional structural constraints regarding, e.g., their representation or implementation cost. Computing such robust and constrained policies is indeed computationally more challenging. This paper contributes the first approach to effectively compute robust policies subject to arbitrary structural constraints using a flexible and efficient framework. We achieve flexibility by allowing to express our constraints in a first-order theory over a set of MDPs, while the root for our efficiency lies in the tight integration of satisfiability solvers to handle the combinatorial nature of the problem and probabilistic model checking algorithms to handle the analysis of MDPs. Experiments on a few hundred benchmarks demonstrate the feasibility for constrained and robust policy synthesis and the competitiveness with state-of-the-art methods for various fragments of the problem.</description>

      <title>An abstract fixed-point theorem for Horn formula equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a class of formula equations in first-order logic, Horn formula equations, which are defined by a syntactic restriction on the occurrences of predicate variables. Horn formula equations play an important role in many applications in computer science. We state and prove a fixed-point theorem for Horn formula equations in first-order logic with a least fixed-point operator. Our fixed-point theorem is abstract in the sense that it applies to an abstract semantics which generalises standard semantics. We describe several corollaries of this fixed-point theorem in various areas of computational logic, ranging from the logical foundations of program verification to inductive theorem proving.</description>

      <title>Proof Minimization in Neural Network Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The widespread adoption of deep neural networks (DNNs) requires efficient techniques for verifying their safety. DNN verifiers are complex tools, which might contain bugs that could compromise their soundness and undermine the reliability of the verification process. This concern can be mitigated using proofs: artifacts that are checkable by an external and reliable proof checker, and which attest to the correctness of the verification process. However, such proofs tend to be extremely large, limiting their use in many scenarios. In this work, we address this problem by minimizing proofs of unsatisfiability produced by DNN verifiers. We present algorithms that remove facts which were learned during the verification process, but which are unnecessary for the proof itself. Conceptually, our method analyzes the dependencies among facts used to deduce UNSAT, and removes facts that did not contribute. We then further minimize the proof by eliminating remaining unnecessary dependencies, using two alternative procedures. We implemented our algorithms on top of a proof producing DNN verifier, and evaluated them across several benchmarks. Our results show that our best-performing algorithm reduces proof size by 37%-82% and proof checking time by 30%-88%, while introducing a runtime overhead of 7%-20% to the verification process itself.</description>

Abstract: We study Parikh automata on finite and infinite words. First we establish some results for Parikh automata on finite words. Following, we present several definitions of Parikh automata on infinite words. We consider the deterministic as well as the non-deterministic variants and study closure properties, expressiveness, and common decision problems with applications to model checking. Furthermore, we compare our models to other models with counting mechanisms operating on infinite words.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Federated Learning for At-Risk Student Prediction: A Comparative Analysis of Model Complexity and Data Balancing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18316v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study proposes and validates a Federated Learning (FL) framework to proactively identify at-risk students while preserving data privacy. Persistently high dropout rates in distance education remain a pressing institutional challenge. Using the large-scale OULAD dataset, we simulate a privacy-centric scenario where models are trained on early academic performance and digital engagement patterns. Our work investigates the practical trade-offs between model complexity (Logistic Regression vs. a Deep Neural Network) and the impact of local data balancing. The resulting federated model achieves strong predictive power (ROC AUC approximately 85%), demonstrating that FL is a practical and scalable solution for early-warning systems that inherently respects student data sovereignty.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Preserving Personalization in Education: A Federated Recommender System for Student Performance Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10516v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing digitalization of education presents unprecedented opportunities for data-driven personalization, but it also introduces significant challenges to student data privacy. Conventional recommender systems rely on centralized data, a paradigm often incompatible with modern data protection regulations. A novel privacy-preserving recommender system is proposed and evaluated to address this critical issue using Federated Learning (FL). The approach utilizes a Deep Neural Network (DNN) with rich, engineered features from the large-scale ASSISTments educational dataset. A rigorous comparative analysis of federated aggregation strategies was conducted, identifying FedProx as a significantly more stable and effective method for handling heterogeneous student data than the standard FedAvg baseline. The optimized federated model achieves a high-performance F1-Score of 76.28%, corresponding to 92% of the performance of a powerful, centralized XGBoost model. These findings validate that a federated approach can provide highly effective content recommendations without centralizing sensitive student data. Consequently, our work presents a viable and robust solution to the personalization-privacy dilemma in modern educational platforms.</description>

      <title>On the Realizability of Prime Conjectures in Heyting Arithmetic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that no total functional can uniformly transform $\Pi_1$ primality into explicit $\Sigma_1$ witnesses without violating normalization in $\mathsf{HA}$. The argument proceeds through three complementary translations: a geometric interpretation in which compositeness and primality correspond to local and global packing configurations; a proof-theoretic analysis demonstrating the impossibility of uniform $\Sigma_1$ extraction; and a recursion-theoretic formulation linking these constraints to the absence of total Skolem functions in $\mathsf{PA}$. The formal analysis in constructive logic is followed by heuristic remarks interpreting the results in informational terms.</description>

      <title>First-Order Axiom Systems $\mathscr{E}_{d}$ and $\mathscr{E}_{da}$ Extending Tarski's $\mathscr{E}_{2}$ with Distance and Angle Function Symbols for Quantitative Euclidean Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tarski's first-order axiom system $\mathscr{E}_{2}$ for Euclidean geometry is notable for its completeness and decidability. However, the Pythagorean theorem -- either in its modern algebraic form $a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}$ or in Euclid's Elements -- cannot be directly expressed in $\mathscr{E}_{2}$, since neither distance nor area is a primitive notion in the language of $\mathscr{E}_{2}$. In this paper, we introduce an alternative axiom system $\mathscr{E}_{d}$ in a two-sorted language, which takes a two-place distance function $d$ as the only geometric primitive. We also present a conservative extension $\mathscr{E}_{da}$ of it, which also incorporates a three-place angle function $a$. The system $\mathscr{E}_{d}$ has two distinctive features: it is simple (with a single geometric primitive) and it is quantitative. Numerical distance can be directly expressed in this language. The Axiom of Similarity plays a central role in $\mathscr{E}_{d}$, effectively killing two birds with one stone: it provides a rigorous foundation for the theory of proportion and similarity, and it implies Euclid's Parallel Postulate (EPP). The Axiom of Similarity can be viewed as a quantitative formulation of EPP. The Pythagorean theorem and other quantitative results from similarity theory can be directly expressed in the languages of $\mathscr{E}_{d}$ and $\mathscr{E}_{da}$, motivating the name Quantitative Euclidean Geometry. The traditional analytic geometry can be united under synthetic geometry in $\mathscr{E}_{d}$. Namely, analytic geometry is not treated as a model of $\mathscr{E}_{d}$, but rather, its statements can be expressed as first-order formal sentences in the language of $\mathscr{E}_{d}$. The system $\mathscr{E}_{d}$ is shown to be consistent, complete, and decidable. Finally, we extend the theories to hyperbolic geometry and Euclidean geometry in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>On the Computational Power of Extensional ESO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extensional ESO is a fragment of existential second-order logic (ESO) that captures the following family of problems. Given a fixed ESO sentence $\Psi$ and an input structure $\mathbb A$ the task if to decide whether there is an extension $\mathbb B$ of $\mathbb A$ that satisfies the first-order part of $\Psi$, i.e., a structure $\mathbb B$ such that $R^{\mathbb A}\subseteq R^{\mathbb B}$ for every existentially quantified predicate $R$ of $\Psi$, and $R^{\mathbb A} = R^{\mathbb B}$ for every non-quantified predicate $R$ of $\Psi$. In particular, extensional ESO describes all pre-coloured finite-domain constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs).
  In this paper we study the computational power of extensional ESO; we ask, for which problems in NP is there a polynomial-time equivalent problem in extensional ESO?. One of our main results states that extensional ESO has the same computational power as hereditary first-order logic. We also characterize the computational power of the fragment of extensional ESO with monotone universal first-order part in terms of finitely bounded CSPs. These results suggest a rich computational power of this logic, and we conjecture that extensional ESO captures NP-intermediate problems. We further support this conjecture by showing that extensional ESO can express current candidate NP-intermediate problems such as Graph Isomorphism, and Monotone Dualization (up to polynomial-time equivalence). On the other hand, another main result proves that extensional ESO does not have the full computational power of NP: there are problems in NP that are not polynomial-time equivalent to a problem in extensional ESP (unless E=NE).</description>

      <title>Data-Aware Hybrid Tableaux</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12090v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Labelled tableaux have been a traditional approach to define satisfiability checking procedures for Modal Logics. In many cases, they can also be used to obtain tight complexity bounds and lead to efficient implementations of reasoning tools. More recently, it has been shown that the expressive power provided by the operators characterizing Hybrid Logics (nominals and satisfiability modalities) can be used to internalize labels, leading to well-behaved inference procedures for fairly expressive logics. The resulting procedures are attractive because they do not use external mechanisms outside the language of the logic at hand, and have good logical and computational properties.
  Many tableau systems based on Hybrid Logic have been investigated, with more recent efforts concentrating on Modal Logics that support data comparison operators. Here, we introduce an internalized tableau calculus for XPath, arguably one of the most prominent approaches for querying semistructured data. More precisely, we define data-aware tableaux for XPath featuring data comparison operators and enriched with nominals and the satisfiability modalities from Hybrid Logic. We prove that the calculus is sound, complete and terminating. Moreover, we show that tableaux can be explored in polynomial space, therefore establishing that the satisfiability problem for the logic is PSpace-complete. Finally, we explore different extensions of the calculus, in particular how to handle data trees and other frame classes.</description>

      <title>How Artificial Intelligence Leads to Knowledge Why: An Inquiry Inspired by Aristotle's Posterior Analytics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02430v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bayesian networks and causal models provide frameworks for handling queries about external interventions and counterfactuals, enabling tasks that go beyond what probability distributions alone can address. While these formalisms are often informally described as capturing causal knowledge, there is a lack of a formal theory characterizing the type of knowledge required to predict the effects of external interventions. This work introduces the theoretical framework of causal systems to clarify Aristotle's distinction between knowledge that and knowledge why within artificial intelligence. By interpreting existing artificial intelligence technologies as causal systems, it investigates the corresponding types of knowledge. Furthermore, it argues that predicting the effects of external interventions is feasible only with knowledge why, providing a more precise understanding of the knowledge necessary for such tasks.</description>
