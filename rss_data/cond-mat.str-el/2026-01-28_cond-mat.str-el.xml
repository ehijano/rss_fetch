      <title>Cooper Condensation and Pair Wave Functions in Strongly Correlated Electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying superconducting states of matter without prior assumptions is a central challenge in strongly correlated electron systems. We introduce a canonical framework for diagnosing the formation of Cooper pair condensates based on the Penrose-Onsager criterion, in which superconducting order is encoded in the spectral properties of the two-particle reduced density matrix (2RDM). Within this formulation, the symmetry and structure of the condensate are obtained by projecting the 2RDM onto irreducible representations of the underlying symmetry group, enabling an unbiased identification of both conventional and exotic superconducting states. We demonstrate the power and versatility of the approach through applications to the two-dimensional Hubbard model, using both auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) and the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG). For attractive interactions without a magnetic field, we reveal a clear finite-size scaling of the condensate fraction on square lattices of size up to $20\times 20$. The framework further provides direct access to the internal structure and extent of Cooper pairs, which we track across the BCS-BEC crossover. Moreover, it enables a clean diagnosis of the finite-momentum Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) phase in a magnetic field. Finally, we apply the approach to a supersolid phase in the repulsive Hubbard model with an additional next-nearest neighbor hopping $t^\prime$, where a charge-density wave coexists with a superconductor. We confirm the fragmented nature of the condensate and uncover substantial pairing correlations in the triplet channel with $p$-wave spatial symmetry in addition to the dominant singlet $d$-wave pairing. Our results establish the 2RDM-based Penrose-Onsager framework as a broadly applicable and unbiased tool for characterizing superconducting order in correlated quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Design and fabrication of guiding patterns for topography-based searching of 2D devices for scanning tunneling microscopy measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the design and fabrication of guiding patterns for topography-based searching of two-dimensional (2D) devices for scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) measurements. Sub-micron geometric coordinate markers were etched into SiO2/Si wafers, serving as both substrates for 2D device integration and guiding maps for sample navigation. Here, we used a monolayer graphene/h-BN device with an active area of smaller than 20 um x 20 um as a model system and demonstrated that the device could be reliably located in STM solely through topographic imaging of the guiding patterns and in situ stage calibration, without reliance on optical viewports or capacitive sensing. Atomically resolved topographic imaging and tunneling spectroscopy were also obtained. Our proposed navigation strategy is fully compatible with standard device fabrication procedures and requires no hardware modification to existing STM setups. As such, it offers a practical alternative for locating miniaturized devices in STM, shedding light on studying emerging quantum phenomena in 2D systems.</description>

      <title>Probing multipolar order in the candidate altermagnet MnF$_2$ through the elastocaloric effect under strain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnets break a combination of time-reversal and rotational symmetries without generating a net magnetization. As such, the order parameter of $d$-wave altermagnets has the same symmetry as magnetic multipoles, and couples to the product of a magnetic field and uniaxial strain. We combine elastocaloric experiments, free-energy modeling, and first-principles calculations on MnF$_2$ to establish a thermodynamic probe of the predicted finite-temperature altermagnetic critical point. These results pave the way to explore altermagnetic quantum criticality in $d$-wave materials and beyond.</description>

      <title>Coupled Majorana modes in a dual vortex of the Kitaev honeycomb model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kitaev model is exactly solvable in terms of Majorana fermions hopping on a honeycomb lattice and coupled to a static $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge field, giving the possibility of $\pi$-vortices in hexagonal plaquettes. In the vortex-full sector and in the presence of a time-reversal-breaking three-spin term of strength $\kappa$, the energy spectrum is gapped and the ground state possesses an even Chern number. An isolated vortex-free plaquette acts as a ``dual vortex'' and binds a fermionic mode at finite energy $\epsilon$ in the bulk gap. This mode is equivalent to two coupled Majorana zero modes located on the same dual vortex. In a continuum approximation, we analytically compute the Majorana wavefunctions and their coupling $\epsilon$ in the two limits of small or large $\kappa$. The analytical approach is confirmed by numerical perturbation theory directly on the lattice. The latter is in excellent agreement with the full numerics on a finite-size system. We contrast our results with states bound to an isolated vortex in a topological superconductor with even Chern number.</description>

      <title>Realization of Wigner-Mott insulators in 6R-TaS$_2$ superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wigner-Mott insulating states represent a paradigmatic manifestation of strong electronic correlations, in which long-range Coulomb interactions drive spontaneous charge ordering and enable Mott localization at fractional electronic fillings. Such states have been theoretically proposed to arise from the cooperative interplay between onsite and inter-site Coulomb interactions. However, experimental realization of a Wigner-Mott insulator has remained elusive. Here we report the observation of a Wigner-Mott insulating states in 6R-TaS$_2$ using scanning tunneling microscopy. By locally injecting electrons into the depleted 1T layer, we induce distinct Star-of-David charge-ordered superstructures and realize a cascade of insulating phases. In particular, a $\sqrt{3}\times \sqrt{3}$ superstructure constitutes a Wigner-Mott insulating state, characterized by a robust Mott gap despite fractional filling. Comparative measurements reveal that the conventional 1$\times$1 Mott state at integer filling is governed predominantly by onsite interaction U, whereas the $\sqrt{3}\times \sqrt{3}$ fractional-filling Mott state requires the cooperative effects of both U and long-range Coulomb interaction V. Our results provide not only the direct microscopic evidence for a Wigner-Mott mechanism, but also establish a platform for the controllable realization and investigation of Wigner-Mott insulating states.</description>

      <title>Magnetization Plateaus in the Spin-Orbit Coupled Bilayer Triangular Lattice Antiferromagnet Rb2Co2(SeO3)3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geometric frustration among competing spin exchanges can give rise to novel quantum phases by enhancing fluctuations that drive magnetic systems beyond the classical regime. We investigate the frustrated array of strongly correlated spin dimers in the bilayer triangular lattice antiferromagnet \rcs{} under applied magnetic fields. A cascade of magnetization plateaus appears at \(M/M_s = 1/3, 1/2, 2/3,\) and \(5/6\), together with a weak anomalous feature near \(M/M_s = 1/6\), in fields up to 60 T. Concurrent changes in magneto-dielectric response follows the plateau boundaries. The finite slope of each plateau and the absence of a zero-field gap in our ultralow-temperature ac susceptibility down to 20 mK indicate broken \(U(1)\) spin-rotation symmetry. A minimal bilayer-dimer model treated with bond operator representation reproduces the low-field sequence only when \(U(1)\) symmetry is explicitly lifted by spin-orbit-driven, bond-dependent anisotropy. Near saturation, a projected triangular pseudospin model accounts for the high-field plateaus with modest further-neighbor interactions. These results demonstrate that anisotropic exchange arising from spin-orbit-coupled moments is essential for stabilizing the full plateau hierarchy in \rcs{}, a mechanism overlooked in previous interpretations of Co-based triangular bilayers.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Iteration Scheme for Dynamical Mean-Field Theory: A Framework for Near-Term Quantum Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a time-domain iteration scheme for solving the Dynamical Mean-Field Theory (DMFT) self-consistent equations using retarded Green's functions in real time. Unlike conventional DMFT approaches that operate in imaginary time or frequency space, our scheme operates directly with real-time quantities. This makes it particularly suitable for near-term quantum computing hardware with limited Hilbert spaces, where real-time propagation can be efficiently implemented via Trotterization or variational quantum algorithms. We map the effective impurity problem to a finite one-dimensional chain with a small number of bath sites, solved via exact diagonalization as a proof-of-concept. The hybridization function is iteratively updated through time-domain fitting until self-consistency. We demonstrate stable convergence across a wide range of interaction strengths for the half-filled Hubbard model on a Bethe lattice, successfully capturing the metal-to-insulator transition. Despite using limited time resolution and a minimal bath discretization, the spectral functions clearly exhibit the emergence of Hubbard bands and the suppression of spectral weight at the Fermi level as interaction strength increases. This overcomes major limitations of two-site DMFT approximations by delivering detailed spectral features while preserving efficiency and compatibility with quantum computing platforms through real-time dynamics.</description>

      <title>Jordan-Wigner mapping between quantum-spin and fermionic Casimir effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Jordan-Wigner transformation connects spin operators in one-dimensional spin systems and fermionic operators. In this work, we elucidate the relationship between the finite-size corrections in the spin representation and the fermionic Casimir effect in the corresponding fermion representation. In particular, we focus on the ground-state energy of one-dimensional transverse-field Ising and XY models, and show that all finite-size corrections can be interpreted as lattice fermionic Casimir effects. We further find several types of Casimir phenomena, such as the conventional Casimir energy from massless fields, damping behavior from massive fields, vanishing behavior from flat or nonrelativistic bands, and oscillating behavior from the finite-density effect. Our findings establish a dictionary between finite-size corrections in spin chains and fermionic Casimir effects, and provide experimentally relevant platforms for the fermionic Casimir phenomena.</description>

      <title>Eigenstate condensation in quantum systems with finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Random quantum states drawn from the Haar ensemble with a constraint on the energy expectation value $E_{\mathrm{av}} = \langle \psi | H | \psi\rangle$ display \textit{eigenstate condensation}: for $E_{\mathrm{av}}$ below a critical value $E_c$, they develop macroscopic overlap with the ground state. We study eigenstate condensation in systems with finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. These systems display three phases: a ground-state phase, in which energy-constrained random states have macroscopic overlap with the ground state; a high-temperature phase, in which they have exponentially small overlap with each energy eigenstate; and an anti-ground-state phase, in which they have macroscopic overlap with the most highly excited state. In local spin systems the ground-state and anti-ground-state phases approach the middle of the spectrum as $1/[\text{system size}]$, but -- because the condensation phase transitions have exponential, rather than polynomial, finite-size scaling -- the crossover becomes exponentially sharp in system size and the high-temperature phase is best understood as an extended phase.</description>

      <title>Dissipative diffusion in quantum state preparation: from passive cooling to system-bath engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate and compare two particle number conserving protocols for the preparation of a topologically nontrivial state. The first is derived from thermally coupling the system to a cold bath, while the second is based on engineered dissipation. We numerically study the time required to reach the target state as well as its robustness against physically important perturbations. Crucially, in both protocols the cooling capability is limited by dissipatively induced diffusion processes. The resulting quadratic scaling of the cooling time with system size is corroborated also analytically using mean-field approximations and a purely classical random walk model. Furthermore, we find that the engineered protocol admits a unique and stable dark state, which contributes to an ongoing discussion regarding the applicability of dissipative state preparation to many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Tests of Quantum Geometric Bounds in Ionic and Covalent Insulators using Inelastic X-Ray Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum geometry underlies many fundamental properties of materials, but it has remained largely inaccessible to direct experiment. Here we demonstrate that inelastic x-ray scattering (IXS) provides a direct, quantitative probe of quantum geometry and quantum information in solids. Studying two prototype insulators, covalently bonded diamond and ionically bonded LiF, we measure the density response and experimentally determine the quantum Fisher information, the associated Bures metric, and the electron localization length. These measurements enable a quantitative comparison of quantum geometry for two distinct bonding environments. We find that the dimensionless quantum weight, $aK(q)$, which quantifies the longitudinal localization of quantum information, is constrained by fundamental electrostatic bounds in both materials. Crucially, the quantum weight of diamond exceeds that of LiF, indicating that covalent bonds exhibit a higher degree of delocalization and higher density of quantum information than the ionic bonds. Our results establish a direct experimental relationship between quantum information, electron localization, and chemical bonding, and identify IXS as a powerful tool for measuring quantum geometry in materials.</description>

      <title>Transformer Learning of Chaotic Collective Dynamics in Many-Body Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning reduced descriptions of chaotic many-body dynamics is fundamentally challenging: although microscopic equations are Markovian, collective observables exhibit strong memory and exponential sensitivity to initial conditions and prediction errors. We show that a self-attention-based transformer framework provides an effective approach for modeling such chaotic collective dynamics directly from time-series data. By selectively reweighting long-range temporal correlations, the transformer learns a non-Markovian reduced description that overcomes intrinsic limitations of conventional recurrent architectures. As a concrete demonstration, we study the one-dimensional semiclassical Holstein model, where interaction quenches induce strongly nonlinear and chaotic dynamics of the charge-density-wave order parameter. While pointwise predictions inevitably diverge at long times, the transformer faithfully reproduces the statistical "climate" of the chaos, including temporal correlations and characteristic decay scales. Our results establish self-attention as a powerful mechanism for learning effective reduced dynamics in chaotic many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Molecular Hamiltonian learning from setpoint-dependent scanning tunneling spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular quantum magnets adsorbed on surfaces exhibit rich spin and orbital excitations that can be probed by scanning tunneling microscopy with inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy (STM-IETS). However, the quantitative extraction of the underlying multiorbital Hamiltonian from experimental spectra remains a fundamental challenge. Here, we introduce molecular Hamiltonian learning, a machine learning strategy that infers the microscopic Hamiltonian parameters of a single adsorbed molecule directly from the setpoint-dependence of STM-IETS data. The method leverages the systematic evolution of spectral features as the STM tip tunes the local electrostatic environment for different tip-sample distances. We demonstrate this approach on iron phthalocyanine on ferroelectric SnTe, training our algorithm on theory spectra from a realistic multiorbital model, including spin-orbit coupling, electrostatic interactions, local crystal field, and substrate effects. The algorithm, trained solely on theoretical many-body simulations, allows reconstructing Hamiltonian parameters directly from experimental spectra. Our manuscript establishes a flexible and automated strategy for Hamiltonian reconstruction from STM-IETS, transforming setpoint-dependent spectroscopy into quantitative characterization of quantum materials at the atomic scale.</description>

      <title>Competing ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases on the frustrated Ising honeycomb lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the frustrated $J_1$-$J_2$-$J_3$ Ising model on the honeycomb lattice, featuring first- and second-neighbor ferromagnetic couplings ($J_1&gt;0$ and $J_2&gt;0$) and third-neighbor antiferromagnetic interactions ($J_3&lt;0$). Using the cluster mean-field method, we analyze the phase transitions in the regime $1/2 &lt; J_2/J_1 \le 1$, where ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases compete. Our results reveal that near the strongly frustrated limit $J_3/J_1 = -1$, the system exhibits order-by-disorder state selection, tricritical and bicritical behavior, critical endpoints, and two successive phase transitions. The ferromagnetic-paramagnetic transition remains second order across the entire interaction range, whereas the antiferromagnetic-paramagnetic boundary shows a richer behavior, including both first- and second-order transitions as well as tricriticality. Increasing the second-neighbor coupling $J_2/J_1$ narrows the range of $J_3/J_1$ where first-order antiferromagnetic-paramagnetic transitions occur; beyond a certain threshold, only second-order order-disorder transitions persist. Consequently, the tricritical point shifts toward $J_3/J_1 \approx -1$ as $J_2/J_1$ increases, culminating in a bicritical point where the antiferromagnetic, ferromagnetic, and paramagnetic phases meet.</description>

      <title>Efficient Application of Tensor Network Operators to Tensor Network States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.19650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The performance of tensor network methods has seen constant improvements over the last few years. We add to this effort by introducing a new algorithm that efficiently applies tree tensor network operators to tree tensor network states inspired by the density matrix method and the Cholesky decomposition. This application procedure is a common subroutine in tensor network methods. We explicitly include the special case of tensor train structures and demonstrate how to extend methods commonly used in this context to general tree structures. We compare our newly developed method with the existing ones in a benchmark scenario with random tensor network states and operators. We find our Cholesky-based compression (CBC) performs equivalently to the current state-of-the-art method, while outperforming most established methods by at least an order of magnitude in runtime. We then apply our knowledge to perform circuit simulation of tree-like circuits, in order to test our method in a more realistic scenario. Here, we find that more complex tree structures can outperform simple linear structures and achieve lower errors than those possible with the simple structures. Additionally, our CBC still performs among the most successful methods, showing less dependence on the different bond dimensions of the operator.</description>

      <title>Internal and External Field Effects upon Crystal Field Excitations in REFeO$_3$ (RE = Nd$^{3+}$, Er$^{3+}$, Yb$^{3+}$, Pr$^{3+}$, and Ho$^{3+}$)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04976v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We systematically investigated crystal-field (CF) excitations of Kramers (Nd$^{3+}$, Er$^{3+}$, Yb$^{3+}$) and non-Kramers (Pr$^{3+}$, Ho$^{3+}$) rare-earth ions in $REFeO_3$ using optimized CF simulations. Internal magnetic fields from the Fe$^{3+}$ and RE$^{3+}$ sublattices split the ground-state doublets of all Kramers ions (e.g. $NdFeO_3$, $ErFeO_3$, and $YbFeO_3$), generating low-energy excitations around 1 meV. In non-Kramers systems, low-energy excitations arise only when the ground state forms an accidental pseudo-doublet, as observed for Ho$^{3+}$ in $HoFeO_3$; such pseudo-doublets exhibit field-induced splitting analogous to Kramers ions. In contrast, true singlet ground states, exemplified by Pr$^{3+}$, show no zero-field splitting. Strong anisotropies are found in both internal- and external-field responses of the CF excitations in these $REFeO_3$. These results provide a unified explanation for the anomalous Zeeman splitting of CF ground states in $REFeO_3$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09780v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of entanglement in strongly correlated electron systems typically requires knowledge of the reduced density matrix. Here, we apply the parquet dynamical vertex approximation to study the two-site reduced density matrix at varying distance, in the Hubbard model at weak coupling. This allows us to investigate the spatial structure of entanglement in dependence of interaction strength, electron filling, and temperature. We compare results from different entanglement measures, and benchmark against quantum Monte Carlo.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05778v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phase-separated manganites provide a unique platform to study the dynamics of competing electronic and structural orders in correlated systems. In La0.275Pr0.35Ca0.375MnO3 (LPCMO), we use temperature-cycling Raman spectroscopy to uncover a previously unidentified regime of structural irreversibility, emerging from the interplay between lattice distortions and phase competition across the phase-separation and charge-orbital ordering temperatures. This irreversible behavior encodes a thermal-memory effect reflecting the system's history-dependent energy landscape. Correlated magnetic and transport responses confirm the coupling between lattice and electronic degrees of freedom, revealing a new form of nonequilibrium phase dynamics in mixed-valence oxides. These results advance the understanding of metastability and memory phenomena in strongly correlated materials.</description>

      <title>Detuning the Floquet anomalous chiral spin liquid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23418v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: At high-frequency a periodically-driven quantum spin-1/2 system can emulate a chiral spin liquid (CSL) described by an effective static local chiral Hamiltonian. In contrast, at low-frequency these settings realize "Swap" models exhibiting {\it anomalous} CSL phases, in which one-way spin transport occurs at the edge although the bulk time-evolution operator over one period is trivial. In this work we explicitly construct a family of Floquet quantum spin-1/2 models on the square lattice implementing Swap models to investigate the stability of the anomalous CSL under frequency detuning and the transition to the high-frequency regime. We used the average-energy spectrum on finite-size torus and cylinders to unfold the Floquet quasi-energy spectrum over the whole frequency range and obtain the geometrical Berry phases. This enabled us to identify three regimes upon increasing detuning: i) a finite-size regime (with no folding of the Floquet spectrum), ii) an intermediate (narrow) regime with folding and very few resonances and iii) a regime with an increased density of resonances suggesting heating. At small detuning, edge modes are revealed by spectroscopic tools and from the Streda response of the system giving access to the anomalous winding number. The analysis of all the data suggests that the anomalous CSL is not continuously connected to the high-frequency CSL. We also discuss the possible occurrence of a long-lived prethermal anomalous CSL.</description>

      <title>Symbolic recursion method for strongly correlated fermions in two and three dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23678v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a symbolic implementation of recursion method for the dynamics of strongly correlated fermions on one-, two- and three-dimensional lattices. Focusing on two paradigmatic models, interacting spinless fermions and the Hubbard model, we first directly confirm that the universal operator growth hypothesis holds for interacting fermionic systems, manifested by the linear growth of Lanczos coefficients. Equipped with symbolically computed Lanczos coefficients and knowledge of their asymptotics, we are able to compute infinite-temperature autocorrelation functions up to times long enough for thermalization to occur. In turn, the knowledge of autocorrelation functions unlocks transport properties. We compute with high precision the charge diffusion constant over a broad range of interaction strengths, $V$. Surprisingly, we observe that these results are well described by a simple functional dependence $\sim 1/V^2$ universally valid both for small and large $V$. All results are obtained directly in the thermodynamic limit. Our results highlight the promise of symbolic computational paradigm where the most costly step is performed once and outputs symbolic results that can further be used multiple times to easily compute physical quantities for specific values of model parameters.</description>

      <title>Magnetic structure of EuZn$_2$Sb$_2$ single-crystal thin-film</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.16365v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic topological materials are a class of compounds which can host massless electrons controlled by the magnetic order. One such compound is EuZn$_2$Sb$_2$, which has recently garnered interest due to its strong interplay between the Eu magnetism and charge carriers. However the topology of the electronic band structure, which depends on the ground state magnetic configuration of the europium sublattice, has not been determined. Based on our \textit{ab-initio} calculations, we find that an in-plane and out-of-plane \textit{A}-type antiferromagnetic (AFM) order generates a topological crystalline insulator and Dirac semimetal respectively, whereas a ferromagnetic (FM) order stabilizes a Weyl semimetal. Our resonant x-ray elastic scattering measurements of single-crystal thin film EuZn$_2$Sb$_2$ reveal both a sharp magnetic peak at $\textit{\textbf{Q}}$=$(0,0,\frac{1}{2})$ and broad $\textit{\textbf{Q}}$=$(0,0,1)$ below $T_{\mathrm{N}}=12.9$\,K, which is associated with an \textit{A}-type AFM and FM order, respectively. Our measurements indicate that the FM and AFM layers are spatially separated along the crystal $c$ axis, with the former limited to the top three atomic layers. We propose that EuZn$_2$Sb$_2$ behaves as a Weyl semimetal in the surface FM layers, and as a topological crystalline insulator in the lower AFM layers.</description>

      <title>Conductance of atomic size contacts of Ag and Au at high magnetic fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20577v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electronic conduction at the atomic scale can be described by Landauer's formalism. In single atom point contacts of noble metals like Au and Ag, there is just one channel open between both electrodes and the conductance is very close to the quantum of conductance $G \approx G_0=\frac{2e^2}{h}$, with the factor of two coming from spin degeneracy. The magnetoconductivity of atomic size contacts has been studied for numerous systems, unveiling local Kondo screening, magnetic order and spin-polarized currents. However, these have been mostly performed in elements with multiple open conduction channels where $G$ differs from $G_0$. The realization of a magnetically active conductor with a single open channel remains difficult to achieve. Here we present measurements of the electronic conductance of single channel Au and Ag atomic-size contacts in magnetic fields up to 20 Tesla. We observe a decrease in $G$ which goes up to about 15% in many Au contacts at 20 T. We perform calculations and find that pure Ag and Au do not present a strong field dependence of $G$, in agreement with previous results at smaller magnetic fields. We also find, however, that residual O$_2$ molecules attached close to the contact produce an an induced spin-polarized current, which leads to a decrease in $G$. We discuss the role of the magnetic response of the electrodes in the jump to contact. Our results suggest that single channel atomic size conductors with a sizeable response to a magnetic field can be built by combining noble metals and magnetically active molecular systems.</description>

      <title>Bipartite Fluctuations and Charge Fractionalization in Quantum Wires</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14410v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a quantum information method for measuring fractional charges in ballistic quantum wires generalizing bipartite fluctuations to the chiral quasiparticles in Luttinger liquids, i.e. analyzing and summing charge and current fluctuations in a region of the wire. Bipartite fluctuations at equilibrium are characterized through a logarithmic scaling with distance encoding the entangled nature of these fractional charges in one-dimensional (1D) fluids. This approach clarifies the physical meaning of the dephasing factor of electronic interferences in a ballistic ring geometry at zero temperature, as a result of charge fractionalization. We formulate an analogy towards ground-state energetics. We show how bipartite current fluctuations represent a useful tool to locate quantum phase transitions associated to Mott physics. We address a spin chain equivalence and verify the fractional charges through an algorithm such as Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG). Adding a potential difference between the two sides (parties) of the wire, bipartite fluctuations can detect a bound state localized at the interface through the Jackiw-Rebbi model coexisting with fractional charges.</description>

      <title>Exact Diagonalization, Matrix Product States and Conformal Perturbation Theory Study of a 3D Ising Fuzzy Sphere Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00842v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Numerical studies of phase transitions in statistical and quantum lattice models provide crucial insights into the corresponding Conformal Field Theories (CFTs). In higher dimensions, comparing finite-volume numerical results to infinite-volume CFT data is facilitated by choosing the sphere $S^{d-1}$ as the spatial manifold. Recently, the fuzzy sphere regulator in Ref. [Zhu et al, Phys. Rev. X 13 021009 (2023)] has enabled such studies with exact rotational invariance, yielding impressive agreement with known 3D Ising CFT predictions, as well as new results. However, systematic improvements and a deeper understanding of finite-size corrections remain essential. In this work, we revisit the fuzzy sphere regulator, focusing on the original Ising model, with two main goals. First, we assess the robustness of this approach using Conformal Perturbation Theory (CPT), to which we provide a detailed guidebook. We demonstrate how CPT provides a unified framework for determining the critical point, the speed of light, and residual deviations from CFT predictions. Applying this framework, we study finite-size corrections and clarify the role of tuning the model in minimizing these effects. Second, we develop a novel method for extracting Operator Product Expansion (OPE) coefficients from fuzzy sphere data. This method leverages the sensitivity of energy levels to detuning from criticality, providing new insights into level mixing and avoided crossings in finite systems. Our work also includes validation of CPT in a 1+1D Ising model away from the integrable limit.</description>

      <title>General many-body entanglement swapping protocol: opportunities for distributed quantum computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22430v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sharing entangled pairs between non-signaling parties via entanglement swapping constitutes a striking demonstration of the nonlocality of quantum mechanics and a crucial building block for future quantum technologies. In this work, we generalize pair-swapping methods by introducing a many-body entanglement swapping protocol, which allows two non-signaling parties to share general many-body states along an arbitrary partitioning. The shared many-body state retains exactly the same Schmidt vectors as the target state and exhibits typically high fidelity, which approaches unity as the variance of the Schmidt coefficients vanishes. Moreover, we demonstrate how the three-party protocol can be generalized to many-body swapping networks, enabling a general many-body state sharing with unit fidelity via arbitrary number of intermediate nodes. This is achieved by replacing all but one of the unitary operations with those corresponding to the same Schmidt states but with a flattened spectrum, which also completely eliminates the need for postselection. We provide a proof of concept of the three-party protocol on real quantum hardware and discuss how it enables new functionalities, such as fault-tolerant entanglement swapping and new strategies for distributed quantum computing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21217v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the coupling of two spatially separated qubits via topologically protected edge states in a two-dimensional Hofstadter lattice. In this hybrid platform, the qubits are coupled to distinct edge sites of the lattice, enabling long-range interactions mediated by topological edge modes. We solve the full system Hamiltonian and analyze the resulting eigenstate structure to uncover the conditions under which coherent qubit interactions emerge. Our analysis reveals that the effective coupling is highly sensitive to the qubit placement, energy detuning, and the topological character of the edge spectrum. We obtain an analytical solution that goes beyond the perturbative regime, capturing the full interplay between the qubits and edge modes. These results provide a foundation for exploring information transport and many-body effects in engineered quantum systems where interactions are mediated by topological edge modes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25327v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish the conditions under which a conservation law associated with a non-invertible operator may be realized as a symmetry in quantum mechanics. As established by Wigner, all quantum symmetries must be represented by either unitary or antiunitary transformations. Relinquishing an implicit assumption of invertibility, we demonstrate that the fundamental invariance of quantum transition probabilities under the application of symmetries mandates that all non-invertible symmetries may only correspond to {\it projective} unitary or antiunitary transformations, i.e., {\it partial isometries}. This extends the notion of physical states beyond conventional rays in Hilbert space to equivalence classes in an {\it extended, gauged Hilbert space}, thereby broadening the traditional understanding of symmetry transformations in quantum theory. We discuss consequences of this result and explicitly illustrate how, in simple model systems, whether symmetries be invertible or non-invertible may be inextricably related to the particular boundary conditions that are being used.</description>

Abstract: Recent experiments on few-layer graphene structures have reported indirect signatures of anomalous Hall crystals (AHCs), but the need for a top gate to stabilize the phase precludes direct imaging of the emergent electronic lattice. This situation necessitates the investigation of alternative signatures of AHCs. The gapless phonons of the emergent electronic lattice provide a clear distinction from conventional quantum Hall states, but it may be difficult to disentangle these phonons from the plethora of other possible low-lying modes. Intriguingly, the quantum geometry of the underlying electronic ground state can imprint on the collective modes, possibly leading the phonons themselves to be topological. Were this the case, the resulting neutral chiral edge modes would provide a further signature of an AHC. Using time-dependent Hartree-Fock, we compute the spectra of collective modes of Wigner crystals (WCs) and AHCs arising in minimal models and study the topology of the phonons and low-lying excitons. Across the WC to AHC transition, we observe a series of band inversions among collective modes, producing topological phonons and excitons, and a sharp sign change in the phonon Chern number upon entering the AHC phase. We conclude by discussing the relevance of collective mode topology to experiments on candidate systems for AHCs.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity under pressure in the two-dimensional van der Waals heavy-fermion metal CeSiI</title>

Abstract: CeSiI is a newly discovered exfoliable van der Waals (vdW) heavy-fermion metal featured by a long-range antiferromagnetic (AF) order (TN =7.5 K) inside the Kondo coherent state below T* = 50 K. To gain a more profound understanding of the intriguing physics of this material and to uncover novel phenomena driven by quantum criticality, it is imperative to construct the phase diagram of CeSiI detailing the evolutions of T* and TN as a function of external tuning parameters such as pressure (P).In this study, we employ high pressure as an effective tuning knob to investigate this system, thereby generating a comprehensive T-P phase diagram of CeSiI. This diagram is characterized by an unusual V-shaped nonmonotonic evolution of T*(P) and the emergence of a superconducting dome with Tcmax = 240 mK upon suppression of AF order at Pc = 6 GPa, coinciding with the minimum of T*(P).The close proximity of the superconductivity (SC) to the AF instability and an unusually large upper critical field Bc2(0) exceeding 4-7 times the Pauli paramagnetic limit, suggests an unconventional pairing mechanism in CeSiI. Further analyses of normal-state transport properties provide evidence of quantum criticality, i.e., non-Fermi-liquid behavior and divergence of quasiparticle effective mass near Pc = 7 GPa. Our findings not only establish CeSiI as the first vdW heavy-fermion superconductor but also highlight an unconventional nature for the Kondo coherent state at T* at ambient pressure, hence opening a new avenue to study the interplay of strong electron correlation, Kondo hybridization, magnetism, and unconventional SC in the vdW heavy-fermion systems.</description>
