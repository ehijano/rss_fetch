      <title>Impacts of extreme weather events on terrestrial carbon sequestration revealed by weather stations in the Northern Hemisphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing frequency of global climate extremes has significantly impacted the terrestrial carbon cycle. Extreme weather events such as heatwaves, droughts, and extreme precipitation pose serious threats to ecosystem carbon sequestration. This study investigated the impacts of these extreme events on terrestrial carbon sequestration using data from weather stations in the Northern Hemisphere, by combining weather station observations and machine learning-based Gross Primary Production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (Reco) estimates. Droughts and heatwaves have the most significant impact, often correlated as compound events. The effects of extreme precipitation and cold extremes may have been underestimated in the past. Whether various extreme events occur in spring or summer led to different mechanisms. We provided a more precise and station-specific analysis compared to using coarse-resolution climate reanalysis and model simulations. It also suggests the need for improved methodologies and the integration of data-driven and process-based models to better predict and understand the effects of extreme weather on ecosystem carbon cycling.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Geological Prediction for Tunnel Excavation Using Full Waveform Inversion Integrating Sobolev Space Regularization with a Quadratic Penalty Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the process of tunnel excavation, advanced geological prediction technology has become indispensable for safe, economical, and efficient tunnel construction. Although traditional methods such as drilling and geological analysis are effective, they typically involve destructive processes, carry high risks, and incur significant costs. In contrast, non-destructive geophysical exploration offers a more convenient and economical alternative. However, the accuracy and precision of these non-destructive methods can be severely compromised by complex geological structures and environmental noise. To address these challenges effectively, a novel approach using frequency domain full waveform inversion (FWI), based on a penalty method and Sobolev space regularization, has been proposed to enhance the performance of non-destructive predictions. The proposed method constructs a soft-constrained optimization problem by restructuring the misfit function into a combination of data misfit and wave equation drive terms to enhance convexity. Additionally, it semi-extends the search space to both the wavefield and the model parameters to mitigate the strong nonlinearity of the optimization, facilitating high-resolution inversion. Furthermore, a Sobolev space regularization algorithm is introduced to flexibly adjust the regularization path, addressing issues related to noise and artefacts to improve the robustness of the inversion. We evaluated the proposed FWI with a tunnel fault model by comparing the results of the proposed method with those of traditional Tikhonov regularization and total variation regularization FWI methods. The results confirm the superior performance of the proposed algorithm as expected.</description>

      <title>Refraction FWI of a circular shot OBN acquisition in the Brazilian pre-salt region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a workflow based on full-waveform inversion (FWI) to estimate P-wave velocities in a deepwater Brazilian pre-salt field using the recently introduced circular shot ocean bottom node (OBN) acquisition geometry. Such a geometry comprises a source vessel sailing in large radius concentric circular trajectories and seismic signals are recorded by OBN arrays. The circular shot OBN survey provides mostly refracted waves separately from reflected waves, so the FWI process is mainly driven by diving waves. We introduce a new FWI workflow to analyze non-preprocessed OBN refraction data, which includes automated steps such as data selection solving an Eikonal equation, estimation of a source signature that accounts for ghost and bubble effects, and gradient preconditioning using a non-stationary filter and seismic illumination. We consider two objective functions based on the $L^1$ and $L^2$ norms. The FWI results demonstrated that using our proposed workflow with the $L^1$ norm objective function and the circular OBN survey can lead to an improvement in pre-salt velocity models. Furthermore, using these improved models we construct reverse-time migration (RTM) images of the conventional OBN dataset, showing significant improvements in the salt stratification, the base of salt, and the lateral resolution of the pre-salt area. The Brazilian pre-salt case study demonstrated that the circular shot OBN acquisition maximizes the illumination of deep reservoirs through the ultra-long offset and full-azimuth coverage that prioritizes the recording of diving waves.</description>

      <title>A finite geometry, inertia assisted coarsening-to-complexity transition in homogeneous frictional systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07178v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The emergence of statistical complexity in frictional systems, manifested in broad distributions of various observables, is not yet understood. We study this problem in velocity-driven, homogeneous (no quenched disorder) unstable frictional systems of height $H$. The latter are described at the continuum scale within a realistic rate-and-state friction interfacial constitutive framework, where elasto-frictional instabilities emerge from rate-weakening friction. For large $H$, such frictional systems were recently shown to undergo continuous coarsening until settling into a spatially periodic traveling solution. We show that when the system's height-to-length ratio becomes small, coarsening is less effective and the periodic solution is dynamically avoided. Instead, and consistently with previous reports, the system settles into a stochastic, statistically stationary state. The latter features slip bursts, classified into predominantly non-propagating small bursts and propagating large bursts, which are non-trivially distributed. The statistical distributions emerge from dynamically self-generated heterogeneity, where both the non-equilibrium history of the interface and wave reflections from finite boundaries, mediated by material inertia, play central roles. Specifically, the dynamics and statistics of large bursts reveal a timescale $\sim\!H/c_{\rm s}$, where $c_{\rm s}$ is the shear wave-speed. We discuss the robustness of our findings against variations of the frictional parameters, most notably affecting the magnitude of frictional rate-weakening, as well as against different interfacial state evolution laws. Finally, we demonstrate a reverse transition in which statistical complexity disappears in favor of the spatially periodic traveling solution. Overall, our results elucidate how relatively simple physical ingredients can give rise to the emergence of slip complexity.</description>
