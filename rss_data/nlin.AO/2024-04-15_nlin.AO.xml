      <title>Modeling Stochastic Chemical Kinetics on Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Chemical Master Equation (CME) provides a highly accurate, yet extremely resource-intensive representation of a stochastic chemical reaction network and its kinetics due to the exponential scaling of its possible states with the number of reacting species. In this work, we demonstrate how quantum algorithms and hardware can be employed to model stochastic chemical kinetics as described by the CME using the Schl\"ogl Model of a trimolecular reaction network as an illustrative example. To ground our study of the performance of our quantum algorithms, we first determine a range of suitable parameters for constructing the stochastic Schl\"ogl operator in the mono- and bistable regimes of the model using a classical computer and then discuss the appropriateness of our parameter choices for modeling approximate kinetics on a quantum computer. We then apply the Variational Quantum Deflation (VQD) algorithm to evaluate the smallest-magnitude eigenvalues, $\lambda_0$ and $\lambda_1$, which describe the transition rates of both the mono- and bi-stable systems, and the Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) algorithm combined with the Variational Quantum Singular Value Decomposition (VQSVD) algorithm to estimate the zeromode (ground state) of the bistable case. Our quantum computed results from both noisy and noiseless quantum simulations agree within a few percent with the classically computed eigenvalues and zeromode. Altogether, our work outlines a practical path toward the quantum solution of exponentially complex stochastic chemical kinetics problems and other related stochastic differential equations.</description>

      <title>Eigenvalue Preferential Attachment Networks A Dandelion Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce a new type of preferential attachment network, the growth of which is based on the eigenvalue centrality. In this network, the agents attach most probably to the nodes with larger eigenvalue centrality which represents that the agent has stronger connections. A new network is presented, namely a dandelion network, which shares some properties of star-like structure and also a hierarchical network. We show that this network, having hub-and-spoke topology is not generally scale free, and shows essential differences with respect to the Barab{\'a}si-Albert preferential attachment model. Most importantly, there is a super hub agent in the system (identified by a pronounced peak in the spectrum), and the other agents are classified in terms of the distance to this super-hub. We explore a plenty of statistical centralities like the nodes degree, the betweenness and the eigenvalue centrality, along with various measures of structure like the community and hierarchical structures, and the clustering coefficient. Global measures like the shortest path statistics and the self-similarity are also examined.</description>

      <title>Phase reduction explains chimera shape: when multi-body interaction matters</title>

Abstract: We present an extension of the Kuramoto-Sakaguchi model for networks, deriving the second-order phase approximation for a paradigmatic model of oscillatory networks - an ensemble of non-identical Stuart-Landau oscillators coupled pairwisely via an arbitrary adjacency matrix. We explicitly demonstrate how this matrix translates into the coupling structure in the phase equations. To illustrate the power of our approach and the crucial importance of high-order phase reduction, we tackle a trendy setup of non-locally coupled oscillators exhibiting a chimera state. We reveal that our second-order phase model reproduces the dependence of the chimera shape on the coupling strength that is not captured by the typically used first-order Kuramoto-like model. Our derivation contributes to a better understanding of complex networks' dynamics, establishing a relation between the adjacency matrix and multi-body interaction terms in the high-order phase model.</description>

      <title>Information-theoretic description of a feedback-control Kuramoto model</title>

Abstract: Semantic Information Theory (SIT) offers a new approach to evaluating the information architecture of complex systems. In this study we describe the steps required to {\it operationalize} SIT via its application to dynamical problems. Our road map has four steps: (1) separating the dynamical system into agent-environment sub-systems; (2) choosing an appropriate coarse graining and quantifying correlations; (3) identifying a measure of viability; (4) implementing a scrambling protocol and measuring the semantic content. We apply the road map to a model inspired by the neural dynamics of epileptic seizures whereby an agent (a control process) attempts to maintain an environment (a base process) in a desynchronized state. The synchronization dynamics is studied through the well-known Kuramoto model of phase synchronization. Our application of SIT to this problem reveals new features of both semantic information and the Kuramoto model. For the latter we find articulating the correlational structure for agent and environment(the oscillators), allows us to cast the model in in a novel computational (information theoretic) perspective, where the agent-environment dynamics can be thought of as analyzing a communication channel. For the former we find that all the information in our system is semantic. This is in contrast to previous SIT studies of foragers in which semantic thresholds where seen above which no further semantic content was obtained.</description>
