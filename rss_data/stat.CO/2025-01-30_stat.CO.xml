      <title>Deterministic Optimal Transport-based Gaussian Mixture Particle Filtering for Verifiable Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixture-model particle filters such as the ensemble Gaussian mixture filter require a resampling procedure in order to converge to exact Bayesian inference. Canonically, stochastic resampling is performed, which provides useful samples with no guarantee of usefulness for a finite ensemble. We propose a new resampling procedure based on optimal transport that deterministically selects optimal resampling points. We show on a toy 3-variable problem that it significantly reduces the amount of particles required for useful state estimation. Finally, we show that this filter improves the state estimation of a seldomly-observed space object in an NRHO around the moon.</description>

      <title>Gradient-free Importance Sampling Scheme for Efficient Reliability Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a novel gradient-free importance sampling-based framework for precisely and efficiently estimating rare event probabilities, often encountered in reliability analyses of engineering systems. The approach is formulated around our foundational Approximate Sampling Target with Post-processing Adjustment (ASTPA) methodology. ASTPA uniquely constructs and directly samples an unnormalized target distribution, relaxing the optimal importance sampling distribution (ISD). The target's normalizing constant is then estimated using our inverse importance sampling (IIS) scheme, employing an ISD fitted based on the obtained samples. In this work, a gradient-free sampling method within ASTPA is developed through a guided dimension-robust preconditioned Crank-Nicolson (pCN) algorithm, particularly suitable for black-box computational models where analytical gradient information is not available. To boost the sampling efficiency of pCN in our context, a computationally effective, general discovery stage for the rare event domain is devised, providing (multi-modal) rare event samples used in initializing the pCN chains. A series of diverse test functions and engineering problems involving high dimensionality and strong nonlinearity is presented, demonstrating the advantages of the proposed framework compared to several state-of-the-art sampling methods.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric Smoothing of Directional and Axial Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss generalized linear models for directional data where the conditional distribution of the response is a von Mises-Fisher distribution in arbitrary dimension or a Bingham distribution on the unit circle. To do this properly, we parametrize von Mises-Fisher distributions by Euclidean parameters and investigate computational aspects of this parametrization. Then we modify this approach for local polynomial regression as a means of nonparametric smoothing of distributional data. The methods are illustrated with simulated data and a data set from planetary sciences involving covariate vectors on a sphere with axial response.</description>

      <title>nabqr: Python package for improving probabilistic forecasts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the open-source Python package NABQR: Neural Adaptive Basis for (time-adaptive) Quantile Regression that provides reliable probabilistic forecasts. NABQR corrects ensembles (scenarios) with LSTM networks and then applies time-adaptive quantile regression to the corrected ensembles to obtain improved and more reliable forecasts. With the suggested package, accuracy improvements of up to 40% in mean absolute terms can be achieved in day-ahead forecasting of onshore and offshore wind power production in Denmark.</description>

      <title>Efficient Computation of Sparse and Robust Maximum Association Estimators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17563v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Robust statistical estimators offer resilience against outliers but are often computationally challenging, particularly in high-dimensional sparse settings. Modern optimization techniques are utilized for robust sparse association estimators without imposing constraints on the covariance structure. The approach splits the problem into a robust estimation phase, followed by optimization of a decoupled, biconvex problem to derive the sparse canonical vectors. An augmented Lagrangian algorithm, combined with a modified adaptive gradient descent method, induces sparsity through simultaneous updates of both canonical vectors. Results demonstrate improved precision over existing methods, with high-dimensional empirical examples illustrating the effectiveness of this approach. The methodology can also be extended to other robust sparse estimators.</description>

      <title>A fresh view on Least Quantile of Squares Regression based on new optimization approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17793v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Regression analysis is an important instrument to determine the effect of the explanatory variables on response variables. When outliers and bias errors are present, the standard weighted least squares estimator may perform poorly. For this reason, many alternative robust techniques have been studied in literature. In these terms, the Least Squares Quantile (LQS), and in particular the Least Squares Median, are among the regression estimators that exhibit better robustness properties. However, the accurate computation of this estimators is computationally demanding, resulting in a difficult estimator to obtain. In this paper, new novel approaches to compute a global optimal solution for the LQS estimator based on single-level and bilevel optimization methods are proposed. An extensive computational study is provided to support the efficiency of the methods considered, and an ad hoc procedure to address the scalability of the problem to larger instances is proposed.</description>
