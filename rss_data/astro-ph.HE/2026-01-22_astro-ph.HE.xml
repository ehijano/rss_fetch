      <title>The Ep-Liso correlation: A new diagnostic tool for kilonova transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The AT2017gfo kilonova transient remains a unique multi-messenger event thanks to its proximity (z=0.00987) and the possibility to investigate time-resolved spectra, providing evidence of r-process nucleosynthesis. The kilonova signal was extensively studied in the spectral and time domains, giving key insights into the chemical composition and physical properties of the ejecta. Here, we report the discovery of a novel correlation between two fundamental observables: the peak energy of the EF_E spectrum, Ep, and the isotropic-equivalent luminosity, Liso. In particular, we show that up to about 2.5 days after the merger, the AT2017gfo spectrum evolves according to: log10[Ep/eV] = -0.13 (+0.02/-0.02) + 0.62 (+0.02/-0.02) * log10[Liso/(1e41 erg/s)] (68% C.L.) while in subsequent epochs, Ep remains almost constant with Liso, flattening around 1 eV. Exploiting simulations from a state-of-the-art radiative transfer code, we demonstrate that our kilonova model inherently predicts this peculiar correlation, suggesting a new diagnostic tool for comparing observables against simulations. Future kilonova observations will provide additional insight into the physics behind the Ep-Liso correlation.</description>

      <title>Mach $&gt;3$ shocks at the tips of both eROSITA bubbles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: eROSITA substantiated earlier indications that Loop-I is the northern part of an extended bipolar Galactic-bubble structure, but the southern bubble was not established in nonthermal emission and the shock strength was not robustly measured in either bubble. After using eROSITA data to map the bubble edges, we analyzed edge-adjacent radio and $\gamma$-ray data to remove foregrounds, test if the southern bubble can be detected in nonthermal emission, and measure the corresponding high-latitude spectra of both bubbles. Data were stacked parallel to the eROSITA bubble edges traced by an edge detector, in the same method used previously to pick up weak signals in the smaller, nested Fermi bubbles; the detected brightness jumps were then used to measure the spectrum. We detect ($&gt;5\sigma$) both bubble tips in both radio and $\gamma$-rays, and find a radio spectrum corresponding to high, Mach $3$-$5$ shocks. The southern bubble is fainter, by $\sim$an order of magnitude in radio, its edge propagating into a medium roughly half as dense. The results indicate that these eROSITA bubbles are older, evolved counterparts of the Fermi bubbles, arising from an earlier collimated high-energy outburst from the Galactic center.</description>

      <title>Fast X-ray transients in NuSTAR data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast X-ray transients (FXTs) are flashes of X-rays that last for a few hundreds of seconds to a few hours. An enigmatic population of these transients that did not have a clear origin has been known for several decades, mostly found serendipitously in soft X-ray imaging observations. Recent progress in this field by Einstein Probe has found that many FXTs are associated with gamma-ray bursts and the collapse of massive stars. Motivated by this, we searched the NuSTAR archive in the harder 3--79 keV band for $\sim1000$ s duration transients. From 204 Ms of exposure we present five candidate FXTs, four of which are spectrally hard, with power-law indices $-3&lt;\Gamma&lt;0$, standing them apart from FXTs discovered in the soft band. Three have potential associations with galaxies at $z=0.1-2$, implying 3--79 keV luminosities of $10^{43}$ to $10^{48}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and volumetric event rates of 125--2900 Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$. The properties of these NuSTAR FXTs most resemble low-luminosity gamma-ray bursts, and would be much more common than their higher-luminosity counterparts in this redshift range.</description>

      <title>The Self-Limiting Nature of Jet-Modulated Thermal Conduction in Cool Core Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conduction as a mechanism for explaining the disrupted cooling-flow in galaxy clusters has been mostly discounted, as the process is inefficient at transporting heat all the way from the cluster into the core. However, thermal conduction can be strongly enhanced when materials of significantly different temperature are brought into proximity, and thus into close thermal contact. Jets of active galactic nuclei may act as heat pumps by bringing low-entropy gas from the cluster core into thermal contact with the hot outer atmosphere of the cluster, significantly increasing the feedback efficiency of active galactic nuclei. We test this hypothesis by running a suite of 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations of active galactic nuclei jets in a Perseus-like cluster, including anisotropic conduction. We find that the heat pump efficiency $\eta$ can reach up to 50\% of the maximum possible efficiency $\eta_{\rm max}$ if conduction operates near the Spitzer-Braginskii limit, while $\eta\approx f_{\rm sp}\eta_{\rm max}$ if conduction along the field lines is substantially suppressed below the Spitzer-Braginskii value by a factor $f_{\rm sp}$ by kinetic effects, as recently suggested. We further find that jet-induced thermal conduction is self-limiting: Magnetic draping during the uplift results in a magnetic field orientation close to perpendicular to the induced temperature gradients, significantly reducing conduction along the ideal conductive pathways. Thus, for conservative assumptions about thermal conduction suppression by $f_{\rm sp} \lesssim 0.1$, the heat pump effect leads to only marginal heat transfer and, correspondingly, to immaterial changes in the overall thermal evolution of cool core clusters beyond the isolated effects of conduction and jet-induced heating alone.</description>

      <title>Neutron star cooling implications and magnetic field of the Vela Junior central compact object from all XMM-Newton and Chandra spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The central compact object (CCO) in the Vela Junior supernova remnant is a young neutron star whose relatively low X-ray flux and small distance suggest it has a mass high enough to activate fast neutrino cooling processes. Here we analyse all XMM-Newton MOS and pn and Chandra ACIS-S spectra of the Vela Junior CCO, with observations taking place over the 9 years from 2001 to 2010. We find that the best-fit flux and spectral model parameters do not vary significantly when treating each observation independently, and therefore we fit all the spectra simultaneously using various spectral models to characterize the predominantly thermal emission from the neutron star surface. Our results indicate the Vela Junior CCO has an atmosphere composed of hydrogen, a hot spot temperature (unredshifted) of 3.5x10^6 K, and a colder surface temperature of (6.6-8.8)x10^5 K. Possible absorption lines at ~0.6 keV and 0.9 keV provide evidence for the first-time of an average surface magnetic field B~3x10^10 G for this CCO, which is similar to the magnetic field of other CCOs. At the accurate new Vela Junior distance of 1.4 kpc, the observed luminosity that is dominated by the hot spot is ~5x10^32 erg s^-1. The luminosity from the rest of the colder surface is (1.3-4.0)x10^32 erg s^-1. The cool luminosity and temperature imply the Vela Junior CCO is indeed colder than many other young neutron stars and probably has a high mass that triggered fast neutrino cooling.</description>

      <title>MeV absorption in gamma-ray bursts as a probe of their progenitor winds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A small fraction of X-ray photons from gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), after escaping the relativistic jet, are scattered by electrons in the circumburst medium. Subsequent photon-photon absorption between the incoming MeV $\gamma$-rays and the back-scattered X-rays generate electron-positron pairs, enriching the surrounding medium with leptons. We investigate how these back-scattered photons modify the prompt GRB spectrum through $\gamma-\gamma$ absorption. In a dense and pair-loaded wind environment, the emerging spectra exhibit a broad attenuation structure, whose morphology is sensitive to the low-energy spectral index $\alpha$. In particular, spectra with $\alpha &gt; -1$ develop a pronounced, saddle-shaped absorption between 1 and 100 MeV (rest frame). Such external MeV absorption could account for the spectral curvature seen in some bright GRBs, and may point to enhanced mass loss from their progenitor stars, consistent with early observations of core-collapse supernovae.</description>

      <title>Erythrohenosis -- The crimson chronicles of two giants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate erythrohenosis -- the collision and merger of two red giants -- establishing an end-to-end model for this fundamental evolutionary channel in dense stellar environments. Combining three-dimensional SPH simulations of a binary with analytical modeling, we characterize the event from initial encounter to terminal explosion. We demonstrate that grazing encounters induce tidal capture and rapid orbital decay, accompanied by large-amplitude, nonlinear stellar oscillations. The subsequent inspiral spins up the common envelope into a stable, non-spherical equilibrium, powering a luminous precursor with quasi-periodic bursts. The terminal explosion, modeled with angular momentum conservation, produces an intrinsically flattened remnant that preserves a geometric memory, or morphomnesia, of its binary origin. The associated gravitational wave signal features a rapid, drag-dominated frequency evolution, identifiable by a unique time-varying apparent chirp mass. These results define a distinctive multi-stage observational fingerprint -- linking transient optical precursors, asymmetric nebulae, and anomalous gravitational wave chirps -- to guide identification in current and future multi-messenger surveys.</description>

      <title>Prospects of Prompt Gamma-Ray Burst Polarimetry with POLAR-2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dominant radiation mechanism that powers the prompt $\gamma$-ray emission in gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) remains poorly understood. High quality, time- and energy-resolved linear polarization measurements of prompt $\gamma$-ray photons can distinguish between synchrotron and inverse-Compton processes and provide crucial constraints on the outflow properties. This will be achieved by POLAR-2 that is proposed as a dedicated GRB polarimeter and successor to POLAR. The High-energy Polarimetry Detector (HPD) is one of the three instruments of POLAR-2 that features significantly improved sensitivity in the $(40-1000)$\,keV energy range and a detection area four times larger than that of POLAR. Here we demonstrate the capabilities of the HPD to constrain key physical model parameters by creating and fitting to synthetic sources using a time-resolved spectro-polarimetric theoretical model of prompt GRB emission. The time-resolved spectral and polarization fits are performed using a novel technique featuring maximum likelihood over an unbinned (in time and energy) list of detected events. The constrained model parameters directly relate to the underlying source physics that would reveal an accelerating, coasting or decelerating emission region. For a pulse fluence of $\mathcal{F}=10^{-5}\mathcal{F}_{-5}\,{\rm erg\,cm^{-2}}$ we can constrain the time-integrated polarization degree to an absolute accuracy ($1\,\sigma$) of about $2.5\mathcal{F}_{-5}^{\,-1/2}$ per cent, as long as source photons dominate over the background. In bright GRBs, such unprecedented accuracy at these energies will allow to distinguish between different models for the prompt GRB emission mechanism and constrain the magnetic field geometry, jet angular structure and outflow composition.</description>

      <title>Supermassive black hole mass inference with the optical flares of tidal disruption events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tidal disruption events (TDEs) represent a truly unique, and potentially very powerful, probe of the quiescent supermassive black hole (SMBH) population. Given current observational survey capabilities the vast majority of the TDEs discovered in the next decade will be observed only across optical-UV wavelengths. A set of questions of broad scientific interest relating to SMBH demographics and SMBH-galaxy correlations could in principal be answered by using TDE emission as an efficient means to constrain SMBH masses. In this paper we argue for using well-understood elements of TDE emission (the thermal X-ray continuum and late-time UV plateau) to derive empirical relationships between the more poorly understood early optical/UV flare and the black hole mass, before using these empirical relationships to measure TDE black hole masses simply and rapidly. We provide a publicly available code TDEFLARE which does this, showing (i) it produces results consistent with disk codes containing far more physics, (ii) it reproduces galactic scaling relationships at high ($&gt;5\sigma$) significance, (iii) it produces reliable mass estimates for both partial and full disruptions, and (iv) it does not require late time data to derive mass constraints. We provide 89 TDE black hole mass constraints, derive the intrinsic black hole mass function implied by the current TDE population, and discuss the Malmquist-Hills bias, an important confounding factor in TDE science.</description>

      <title>The failed failed-supernova scenario of M31-2014-DS1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I examine a recently proposed failed-supernova scenario for the fading of the yellow supergiant event M31-2014-DS1, and find that it requires unlikely fine-tuned parameters to work, if at all. In the failed-supernova scenario, most of the yellow supergiant collapsed to form a black hole. Due to the energy carried by neutrinos from the cooling, collapsing core, gravity decreases, leading to the ejection of a small fraction of the outer envelope, some of which remains bound. The fallback accreted gas possesses large angular-momentum fluctuations due to the pre-collapse envelope convection. The fallback material forms intermittent accretion disks around the black hole that launch jets (or disk wind), which unbind most of the bound material. The failed-supernova scenario for M31-2014-DS1 requires that only &lt;1% of the bound material be accreted by the black hole, but the jets do not shut down the backflow for over 10 years. I find this fine-tuned requirement unlikely. I also find that, due to the rapid radiative cooling of the outflow interaction zone with the outer gas, the expected radiation is about an order of magnitude or more above the observed value. These, as well as earlier challenges raised against the failed-supernova scenario, make the alternative type II intermediate-luminosity optical transient scenario, in which fading is due to dust ejection in a violent binary interaction, more likely. The fading event M31-2014-DS1 does not support the failed-supernova scenario predicted by the neutrino-driven explosion mechanism of core-collapse supernovae.</description>

      <title>Searching for Isolated Black Hole Candidates within 15 pc of the Solar System in Gaia DR3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Theoretical models predict that the Galaxy hosts $10^8$-$10^9$ black holes formed from the complete gravitational collapse of heavy stars and that most of these black holes are isolated, without any companion. Within 15 pc of the Solar System ($\sim 50$ ly), there may be a few black holes. If located inside one of the Local Interstellar Clouds - which occupy 5-20% of this local volume - an isolated black hole could produce detectable electromagnetic emission via accretion from the interstellar medium, given the capabilities of current or near-future observatories. However, precise predictions remain challenging due to large uncertainties in the expected accretion spectra. Outside these clouds, the accretion rate would be too low in any standard model to yield a detectable electromagnetic signal. While astrometric detection via gravitational perturbation of nearby stars is conceivable, the local stellar density is too low for this method to be realistically successful. We have searched the Gaia DR3 catalog for candidate isolated black holes accreting from the interstellar medium and identified five sources. All candidates lie close to the Galactic plane, making them likely spurious astrometric solutions, for instance caused by unmodelled background sources (crowding) and/or unmodelled binarity; nevertheless, they cannot be definitively ruled out without follow-up observations.</description>

      <title>Exotic optical variability in the black hole X-ray binary IGR J17091-3624</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: IGR J17091-3624 is a distinctive black hole X-ray binary exhibiting exotic variability, including complex "heartbeat" oscillations in its X-ray light curves, similar to those observed in GRS 1915+105, a system renowned for its structured, rapid X-ray variability but heavily obscured at optical wavelengths. In contrast, IGR J17091-3624 is less obscured, making it a more accessible target for optical investigations. Due to its weak radio emission, optical and infrared data are essential to probe the jet and outer disc behavior of IGR J17091-3624. This study presents the first long-term optical monitoring of IGR J17091-3624, using data from the Las Cumbres Observatory (LCO) over its 2011, 2016, and 2022 outbursts. We combine these observations with quasi-simultaneous X-ray data from Swift/XRT, RXTE, and NICER, employing light curve and variability analysis, spectral energy distributions, color-magnitude diagrams, and optical/X-ray correlations to investigate optical emission mechanisms. We find that the optical and X-ray fluxes are significantly correlated, following a power-law relation with the index 0.40\pm0.04, suggesting that the optical emission in IGR J17091-3624 is dominated by an X-ray-irradiated accretion disk. Based on optical spectral slope constraints, we estimate the extinction toward IGR J17091-3624 A_V = 4.3 to 6.6 mag. The global optical/X-ray correlation suggests a distance estimate of 8-17 kpc, in line with previous findings. High-cadence optical observations show tentative evidence of optical oscillations that may arise from reprocessed X-ray modulations, although confirming this will require higher time-resolution optical data.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Axion-Like Particles from Ultra-High-Energy Observations of 3HWC J1908+063 with HAWC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Axion-like particles (ALPs) are hypothetical particles and compelling candidates for cold dark matter. Their existence could be probed through their conversions into photons in the presence of magnetic fields. In this work, we explore the effect of these photon-ALP conversions by searching for an attenuation in the observed gamma ray spectra of galactic sources that emit at energies of hundreds of TeV. We analyze data from the High-Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) Observatory for the source 3HWC J1908+063. No evidence of photon-ALP conversions was found, and we set constraints on the ALP parameter space. Specifically, we derive exclusion limits for ALPs with masses in the range $10^{-8}~\mathrm{eV} \leq m_a \leq 10^{-6}~\mathrm{eV}$ and photon-ALP couplings in the range $10^{-12}~\mathrm{GeV}^{-1} \leq g_{a\gamma} \leq 10^{-10}~\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$, based on HAWC observations.</description>

      <title>The puzzle of composition of cosmic rays with energies (2-12.5) EeV according to muon detectors data of the Yakutsk EAS array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The results of a study of the cosmic ray composition in individual events in the energy range (2-12.5) EeV using the muon correlation method is presented. The considered sample included showers with zenith angles less than 60 degrees recorded in the period 1974-2018. The existence of four separate groups of primary particles with different origins is confirmed. The obtained results have potential importance for understanding the composition of cosmic rays in the specified primary energy range.</description>

      <title>Evidence of mutually exclusive outflow forms from a black hole X-ray binary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accretion onto black holes often leads to the launch of outflows that significantly influence their surrounding environments. The two primary forms of these outflows are X-ray disk winds-hot, ionized gases ejected from the accretion disk-and relativistic jets, which are collimated streams of particles often expelled along the rotational axis of the black hole. While previous studies have revealed a general association between spectral states and different types of outflows, the physical mechanisms governing wind and jet formation remain debated. Here, using coordinated NICER and MeerKAT observations of the recurrent black hole X-ray binary 4U 1630-472, we identify a clear anti-correlation between X-ray disk winds and jets: during three recent outbursts, only one type of outflow is detected at a time. Notably, this apparent exclusivity occurs even as the overall accretion luminosity remains within the range expected for a standard thin disk, characteristic of the canonical soft state. These results suggest a competition between outflow channels that may depend on how the accretion energy is partitioned between the disk and the corona. Our findings provide new observational constraints on jet and wind formation in X-ray binaries and offer a fresh perspective on the interplay between different modes of accretion-driven feedback.</description>

      <title>The Supernova Remnant G284.3$-$1.8 and Its Relation to the Gamma-ray Binary 1FGL J1018.6$-$5856</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14801v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: G284.3$-$1.8 is a supernova remnant with a radio shell and thermal X-ray emission. Located near its center is the gamma-ray binary 1FGL J1018.6$-$5856, although the physical association between the two systems is not clear yet. Our X-ray spectroscopy with Suzaku reveals that G284.3$-$1.8 and 1FGL J1018.6$-$5856 have compatible absorption column densities of $N_\mathrm{H} = 6\textrm{--}7 \times 10^{21}~\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$, indicating that the two systems have similar distances. The actual distance is determined as $3~\mathrm{kpc}$ using $\mathrm{^{12}CO}$ ($J=1\textrm{--}0$) data obtained with NANTEN. The X-ray spectrum of G284.3$-$1.8 shows a strong K-shell emission line of Mg, confirming that the earlier claim that the SNR is one of the few Mg-rich SNRs. Comparing recent stellar models taking into account the "shell merger" processes, we find that the obtained Mg-to-Ne mass ratio of $M_\mathrm{Mg}/M_\mathrm{Ne} = 0.73^{+0.07}_{-0.03}$ and Si-to-Mg mass ratio of $M_\mathrm{Si}/M_\mathrm{Mg} = 0.44\pm0.03$ suggest a supernova explosion that would have left a neutron star. The characteristics of 1FGL J1018.6$-$5856, on the other hand, are better explained with a model in which its compact object is neutron star. The present results, therefore, would suggest a possible scenario where G284.3$-$1.8 and 1FGL J1018.6$-$5856 are both remnants of a common supernova explosion although further observational tests are necessary.</description>

      <title>SN 2023zcu: A Type IIP SN with Early Flash Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed photometric and spectroscopic analysis of the Type IIP supernova SN~2023zcu, which exploded in the galaxy NGC~2139 (redshift $z$ = 0.006). SN~2023zcu exhibits a well-sampled light curve covering the rise, plateau, and nebular phases. It has an optically thick phase of $100.6 \pm 0.6$ d with a magnitude drop of $\sim$1.7 mag in the {\em V} band during the transition between the plateau and the nebular phases. Weak emission features in the early-time spectra indicate a low-level interaction between circumstellar material (CSM) and the SN ejecta. The spectral evolution is well sampled and exhibits a prominent P-Cygni profile of H$\alpha$, a defining characteristic of Type IIP SNe. Signatures of metal-line formation (e.g., \ion{Fe}{2}, \ion{Ca}{2} near-infrared triplet) are also evident in the spectra as the SN evolves. Spectral modeling with the radiative-transfer code \texttt{TARDIS} during the early photospheric phase (8.7--35.5 d since explosion) yields photospheric temperatures decreasing from $\sim$9,000 to $\sim$6,000 K and expansion velocities declining from $\sim$10,000 to $\sim$5,400 km s$^{-1}$. A tailored expanding photosphere method (EPM) fit based on the \texttt{TARDIS} models provides a distance estimate of $27.8 \pm 2.0$ Mpc. Nebular-phase spectra and bolometric light-curve modeling suggest a progenitor mass in the range 12--15 M$_\odot$. This thorough analysis helps to constrain progenitor properties and explosion parameters, thereby strengthening our understanding of Type IIP SNe.</description>

      <title>Modeling X-ray reflection spectra from returning radiation: application to 4U 1630$-$47</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Returning radiation is thought to play a key role in disk illumination of black hole X-ray binaries in the high-soft state, yet it has not been fully incorporated into XSPEC reflection models. We present a new table model for reflection spectroscopy that, for the first time, self-consistently accounts for the returning radiation. To isolate this effect, we adopt the standard disk-corona configuration but disable the corona, allowing the reflection spectrum to be produced solely by self-irradiation of the disk. Applying our model to the black hole X-ray binary 4U 1630$-$47, we report a rapidly spinning black hole ($a_* \sim 0.99$), a disk inclination of $i \sim 53^\circ$, a mass accretion rate of $\dot{M}_{\rm BH} \sim 15\% \, {\rm \dot{M}_{Edd}}$, and an electron density of $n_{\rm e} \sim 10^{21} \,\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$ to reproduce the observed reflection features. The model also yields a source distance of $D\sim 8.2 \, {\rm kpc}$, slightly below the commonly adopted value of $10 \, {\rm kpc}$ in the literature. Compared to the widely used relxillNS, our model naturally produces a harder high-energy reflection spectrum, fitting the data without invoking a Comptonized component.</description>

      <title>Towards gravitational wave parameter inference for binaries with an eccentric companion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a complete model for dephasing due to line-of-sight acceleration (LOSA) in gravitational wave (GW) signals from stellar-mass binary black holes (BBHs) in three-body systems. Our prescription provides curvature- and projection-dependent phase features that are not recovered by local-expansion-based treatments. We perform parameter-space surveys and mock parameter inferences assuming the nominal sensitivity of the Einstein Telescope (ET) to identify the regime where the time-varying LOSA allows for separate constraints on the outer orbital parameters, in particular the tertiary mass and distance. We estimate that ET may detect a few to tens of such systems per year, provided that all binaries merge dynamically, and demonstrate that these constraints can be used to directly discriminate between a dynamical and AGN origin for BBHs. Finally, we reanalyse the GW190814 event and four O4a events finding no evidence for LOSA, with the previously claimed LOSA in GW190814 disappearing when a sufficiently long data segment is used.</description>

      <title>Modelling the Time-variable Broadband Emission and Correlation Study of FSRQ S5 1044+71</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed temporal and spectral analysis of the blazar S5\,1044+71 using multi-wavelength data obtained from the \emph{Fermi}-LAT and Swift-XRT/UVOT telescopes. Applying the Bayesian block algorithm to the 3-day binned $\gamma$-ray lightcurve, we identify pronounced variability, including four major outbursts marked by significant flux enhancements. The highest flux recorded was $(1.1 \pm 0.2)\times 10^{-6}\,\text{ph}\,\text{cm}^{-2}\,\text{s}^{-1}$ on 57868.5 MJD. Each outburst comprises multiple components, and lightcurve profile analysis indicates predominantly symmetric temporal structures. The shortest variability timescale of 4.5 hours constrains the emission region to be located within 0.03 pc of the central engine, likely near the broad-line region (BLR). Additionally, two highest-energy photons were detected with energies of 46.4 GeV (on 57739.6 MJD) and 42.5 GeV (on 59161.9 MJD), observed outside the peak flaring activity. The fractional variability shows an overall increasing trend from UV/optical to $\gamma$-ray bands, with a noticeable dip in the X-ray range, consistent with the shape of the broadband spectral energy distribution (SED). The flux distributions during flares exhibit log-normal or double log-normal behavior, suggesting multiplicative variability processes and evolving emission zones. Cross-correlation analysis reveals a strong positive correlation between the $\gamma$-ray and X-ray bands, with X-rays lagging by 42.5 days. Broadband SED modeling across different flux states supports a one-zone leptonic scenario, with $\gamma$-ray emission produced via external Compton scattering of IR and BLR photons. High-flux states show harder electron spectra, elevated break energies, and reduced magnetic fields-features consistent with efficient particle acceleration and Compton dominance.</description>

      <title>AGN in Gaia Alerts: from flares to Changing Look Quasars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Gaia Alerts system is providing alerts on a variety of objects displaying a significant photometric change detected by the Gaia satellite from one passage to the next one over the same region of the sky. Among the over 22000 alerts published until the end of 2022, around 13 percent concern AGN or quasar candidates. We have embarked on a spectroscopic ground-based follow-up of some of those (including some selected by a different method specifically in galactic nuclei), to establish their true nature, and reveal the various phenomena leading to a change in magnitude of those AGN. The present paper deals with radio-quiet objects, while the radio-loud ones will be described in a companion paper. We confirm, on one hand, the AGN/quasar nature of 64 new candidates alerted by Gaia, and, on the other hand, obtained second-epoch spectra of over 200 known AGN also alerted for large photometric variations. The observed phenomena show a large variety: from Flares to Tidal Disruption Events (TDEs) and a large number of Changing Look Quasars (CLQs, 56 secure ones, plus 23 probable ones), not forgetting some rarer events like SNe, microlensing events or Extreme Coronal Line Emitters. This sample shows that variability is an excellent tool to detect new quasars, especially radio-quiet ones that otherwise would be undetected, and that a significant fraction of variable AGN/quasars, around 10 percent, presents the CLQ phenomenon. Some of the new CLQs are followed-up to monitor further changes and measure time scales.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional GRMHD simulations of jet formation and propagation in self-gravitating collapsing stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate collapsar models with and without self-gravity under identical initial conditions to directly compare the effects of self-gravity on jet properties, such as opening angle, jet power, terminal Lorentz factor, and its variability. We compute a suite of time-dependent, three-dimensional GRMHD simulations of collapsars in evolving spacetime. We update the Kerr metric components due to the growth of the black hole mass and changes its angular momentum. The self-gravity is considered via perturbative terms. We present for the first time the process of jet formation in self-gravitating collapsars. We find that self-gravity leads to temporary jet quenching, which can explain some features in the gamma-ray burst prompt emission. We find no substantial difference in jet launching times between models with and without self-gravity. We observe that in the absence of self-gravity, the jet can extract more rotational energy from the black hole, while self-gravitating models produce narrower jet opening angles. We show that under certain conditions, self-gravity can interrupt the jet formation process, resulting in a failed burst. Our computations show that self-gravity significantly modifies the process of jet propagation, resulting in notably different jet properties. We show that the timescales, variability, and opening angle of jet depend on whether self-gravity is included or not. We argue that self-gravity can potentially explain certain prompt emission properties due to the jet quenching.</description>

      <title>Properties and Possible Physical Origins of $\gamma$-ray Emission in Extreme Synchrotron Blazars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extreme synchrotron blazars, characterized by a first peak in their broadband spectral energy distributions (SEDs) at frequencies exceeding $10^{17}$ Hz, often exhibit a second peak beyond 1~TeV. These sources serve as ideal laboratories for studying particle acceleration and radiation mechanisms in relativistic jets. In this work, we systematically analyze the $\sim$16-year Fermi-LAT observational data for 25 extreme high-synchrotron-peaked BL Lacs (EHBLs). The results indicate that the majority of these sources display stable or low flux levels in the GeV band, with only 6 sources showing significant variability at a confidence level exceeding 5$\sigma$. The time-averaged spectra over the 16-year period for most EHBLs are well described by a hard power-law model, with photon indices predominantly clustered between 1.7 and 1.8. Using Fermi-LAT data in conjunction with multiwavelength observations compiled from the literature, we construct broadband SEDs for these EHBLs and fit them with a one-zone synchrotron + synchrotron-self-Compton (SSC) model. We find that this simplified theoretical framework is sufficient for modeling the observed SEDs of most of these EHBLs, albeit requiring relatively higher electron energies compared to other $\gamma$-ray emitting HBLs, and at times under-representing the UV emission. Based on the SED fitting results, we investigate the physical properties of the emission regions in these EHBLs and compare them with those of other $\gamma$-ray emitting HBLs. Consistent with other GeV--TeV $\gamma$-ray-emitting BL Lacs, the jets in these EHBLs are marked by low radiation efficiency and low magnetization.</description>

      <title>The early r-process nucleosynthesis scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I compare seven actively studied r-process nucleosynthesis scenarios against observed properties of r-process elements in the early Universe, and conclude that the most likely scenario to contribute to the site of elements below the third r-process peak is the magnetorotational r-process scenario, and that of the third peak is the common envelope jets supernova (CEJSN) r-process scenario. The collapsar and CEJSN r-process scenario might also contribute to the lighter r-process elements, and the binary neutron star (NS-NS) merger r-process scenario might contribute to the third r-process peak. The magnetar, the wind from the newly born NS, and the accretion-induced collapse of a white dwarf r-process scenarios fall short in explaining observations. They might exist, but cannot be major contributors to the r-process in the early Universe. To constrain r-process scenarios in the early Universe, I require that they explain the large scatter in the r-process abundances of very metal-poor stars, account for the correlation between light r-process nucleosynthesis and iron production, and the lack of correlation between the third peak r-process production and iron production, as inferred from very metal-poor stars. I discuss the diversity of the CEJSN r-process scenario and encourage extending its exploration.</description>

      <title>Revealing massive black hole astrophysics: The potential of hierarchical inference with extreme mass-ratio inspiral observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational waves from extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) will enable sub-percent measurements of massive black hole parameters and provide access to the demographics of compact objects in galactic nuclei. During the LISA mission, multiple EMRIs are expected to be detected, allowing statistical studies of massive black hole populations and their formation pathways. We perform hierarchical Bayesian inference on simulated EMRI catalogues to assess how well LISA could constrain the astrophysical population using parametrised population models. We test our inference framework on a variety of populations, including heterogeneous and homogeneous mixtures of parametrised subpopulations, and scenarios in which the assumed model is deliberately misspecified. Our results show that population parameters governing distributions with sharp features can be tightly constrained. Mixed populations can be disentangled with as few as $\sim20$ detections, and even with model misspecification, the inference retains sensitivity to key population features. These results demonstrate the capabilities and limitations of EMRI population inference, providing guidance for constructing realistic astrophysical population models for LISA analysis.</description>

      <title>Scalar Quasi-Normal Modes in Black Hole Gravitational Lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the excitation of quasi-normal modes (QNMs) in gravitational lensing by a Schwarzschild black hole using a scalar field model. By employing a time-domain mode-sum method, we analyze the complex interplay between an incident burst signal and the black hole spacetime. We find that the incident waves can non-resonantly excite a substantial number of high-$l$ modes, with amplitudes for modes as high as l=20 remaining significant compared to the fundamental l=0 mode. We confirm through QNM template fitting that the late-time behaviors of these excited modes are indeed QNMs. After passing through the black hole, we find that the lensed waves form a highly directional and coherent Gaussian beam whose cross-sectional intensity profile is well-described by a Gaussian profile. Unlike spherical waves, this beam's amplitude does not decrease with distance from the black hole but remains nearly constant in the near-field region. Moreover, due to the superposition of numerous QNMs, oscillations largely cancel each other out. The lensed temporal waves do not exhibit typical oscillatory patterns.</description>

      <title>Chemical evolution of close massive binaries -- tidally-enhanced or tidally-suppressed mixing?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the largest source of uncertainties in the predictions of stellar models comes from the internal transport mechanisms. In close massive binaries, previous theoretical studies suggest that tides systematically boost chemical mixing. However, observations do not reveal any clear period-nitrogen enrichment trend, challenging these predictions. In addition, comprehensive examinations of the interplay between tidal interactions, angular momentum and chemicals transport have so far been scarce. We investigate the interplay between tidal interactions and rotational mixing, and the impact of the angular moment transport (AMT) assumptions. We examine whether tidal interactions enhance or suppress chemical mixing by computing grids of genec binary models with various AMT treatments. In order to independently assess the role of tidal interactions, we systematically compute model variations of single stars with identical initial conditions. Our investigations reveal that tides can either enhance or suppress mixing relative to single-star models, and that the outcome is highly sensitive to the AMT assumptions. We identify a key contrast between the two types of computed models: in close systems subject to tides, magnetic models predict that the mixing efficiency is mostly determined by the orbital configuration, whereas in hydrodynamic models it also depends on the assumed initial velocity. As a result, hydro models may display non-monotonic period-enrichment trends, or even period-enrichment correlations. These results highlight the importance of the AMT assumptions in modeling binaries with tidal interactions. The sensitivity of the predictions of hydro models to initial conditions extends the size of the period-enrichment parameter space they cover, allowing them to accommodate for peculiar observed systems, i.e., with mild enrichment at short periods, or high enrichment at longer periods.</description>

      <title>The Little Red Dots Are Direct Collapse Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery by JWST of a substantial population of compact "Little Red Dots" (LRDs) presents a major puzzle: their observed spectra defy standard astrophysical interpretations. Here, we show that LRD spectra are naturally reproduced by emission from an accreting Direct Collapse Black Hole (DCBH). Using radiation-hydrodynamic simulations, we follow the growth of the DCBH seed via a dense, compressionally heated, collisionally ionized accretion flow. The model self-consistently reproduces the screen responsible for the observed Balmer absorption, while allowing UV/optical emission to partially escape, along with reprocessed infrared radiation. Crucially, this structure is not a blackbody and requires no stellar contribution: the UV continuum originates entirely from reprocessed DCBH radiation, attenuated only by a small amount of dust with an extinction curve consistent with high-redshift galaxies. This single framework simultaneously explains the key observational puzzles of LRDs: (a) weak X-ray emission, (b) metal and high-ionization lines alongside absent star-formation features, (c) overmassive black holes, (d) compact morphology, (e) abundance and redshift evolution -- linking them directly to pristine atomic-cooling halos, (f) long-lived ($&gt;100$ Myr), slowly variable phases driven by radiation pressure. Our findings indicate that JWST is witnessing the widespread formation of heavy black hole seeds in the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Ultraviolet spectroscopy reveals a hot and luminous companion to the Be star + black hole candidate MWC 656</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Galactic Be star binary MWC 656 was long considered the only known Be star + black hole (BH) system, making it a critical benchmark for models of massive binary evolution and for the expected X-ray emission of Be+BH binaries. However, recent dynamical measurements cast doubt on the presence of a BH companion. We present new multi-epoch ultraviolet spectroscopy from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), combined with high-resolution optical spectra, to reassess the nature of the companion. The far-ultraviolet spectra reveal high-ionisation features, including prominent N V and He II lines, which are absent in the spectra of normal Be stars and are indicative of a hot, luminous companion. Spectral modelling shows that these features cannot originate from the Be star or from an accretion disc around a compact object. Instead, we find that the data are best explained by a hot ($T_\mathrm{eff} \approx 85$ kK), compact, hydrogen-deficient star with strong wind signatures, consistent with an intermediate-mass stripped star. Our revised orbital solution and composite spectroscopic modelling yield a companion mass of $M_2 = 1.54^{+0.57}_{-0.46}\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$, definitively ruling out a BH and disfavouring a white dwarf. MWC 656 thus joins the growing class of Be + stripped star binaries. The system's unusual properties - including a high companion temperature and wind strength - extend the known parameter space of such binaries. The continued absence of confirmed OBe+BH binaries in the Galaxy highlights a growing tension with population synthesis models.</description>

      <title>Neutrino production mechanisms in strongly magnetized quark matter: Current status and open questions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review the main neutrino emission mechanisms operating in dense quark matter under strong magnetic fields, with particular emphasis on conditions expected in the interiors of compact stars. We discuss the direct Urca and neutrino synchrotron processes in unpaired quark matter, incorporating the effects of Landau-level quantization. For the direct Urca process, the quantization of the electron energy spectrum plays a critical role, whereas quark quantization can often be neglected at sufficiently high baryon densities. The resulting field-dependent neutrino emissivity is anisotropic and exhibits an oscillatory behavior as a function of magnetic-field strength. We explore the implications of these effects for magnetar cooling and for possible anisotropic neutrino emission that could contribute to pulsar kicks. In addition, we review the $\nu\bar{\nu}$ synchrotron emission process, which, although subdominant, provides valuable insights into the interplay between magnetic fields and weak interactions in dense quark matter. Overall, our analysis highlights the nontrivial influence of strong magnetic fields on neutrino production in magnetized quark cores, with potential consequences for the thermal and dynamical evolution of compact stars.</description>

      <title>Higher Harmonics of Double White Dwarfs in the Centihertz Band: Linking LISA and DECIGO</title>

Abstract: We investigate the detectability of post-Newtonian higher harmonics from Galactic double white dwarfs in the centihertz band ($\sim 0.01$ Hz). Using a synthetic population, we show that, unlike the quadrupole mode, higher harmonics remain undetectable with LISA except for rare nearby systems. In contrast, planned mid-band (decihertz) observatories such as DECIGO and BBO will be able to detect the third harmonic for about 10\% of inspiral binaries above $\sim 5$ mHz, enabling statistical constraints on mass ratios. These results highlight the successive roles of LISA and future decihertz missions in establishing a coherent strategy for space-based gravitational-wave astronomy.</description>

      <title>The Intermediate-Mass Black Hole Reverberation Mapping Project: Stable Optical Continuum Lags of an IMBH in the Dwarf Galaxy NGC 4395 Over Years</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: NGC 4395 is a nearby dwarf spiral galaxy hosting an active galactic nucleus (AGN) powered by an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH, $M_{\rm BH} \sim 10^{4-5}\,M_\odot$). Recent optical continuum reverberation mapping studies have suggested potential lag variations between different epochs, offering important clues to the physical mechanisms governing variability in the vicinity of the central black hole. We present continuous intranight multi-band photometric monitoring of NGC 4395 based on three nights of observations with the Faulkes Telescope North and two nights with the Mephisto telescope. This represents the first systematic investigation of optical continuum lag stability in a robustly confirmed IMBH. By applying difference-imaging techniques to both the new observations and archival data, we significantly detect the optical inter-band lags of $\sim$5-15 minutes, which increase monotonically with wavelength. No obvious $u$-band lag excess is observed, implying a negligible fractional contribution from diffuse continuum (DC) emission to the optical continuum, in agreement with our spectral decomposition results. Remarkably, the inter-band lags remain stable over multi-year baselines. We attribute this long-term lag stability primarily to the minor DC contribution, a relatively steady disk-corona structure, and the unusually high X-ray-to-optical luminosity ratio characteristic of low-luminosity AGNs, which likely allows X-ray reprocessing to dominate over other potential variability mechanisms. Future facilities like Gemini/SCORPIO, with its simultaneous optical-to-near-infrared coverage, will be ideally suited to play an important role in advancing this field.</description>

      <title>The relativistic restricted three-body problem: geometry and motion around tidally perturbed black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the geometry of a tidally deformed, rotating black hole and timelike geodesics in its vicinity. Our framework provides a local picture of the structural evolution of a relativistic restricted three-body problem around a deformed black hole in an adiabatically evolving binary, motivated by various astrophysical settings including disk dynamics and extreme mass-ratio inspirals. As the tidal-field strength is increased, initially regular, bound geodesics undergo four stages: (i) weak chaos emerges within the bound motion; (ii) a subset of trajectories plunges into the black hole; (iii) a fraction of the remaining trajectories becomes unbound; and (iv) no bound trajectories persist. We provide semi-analytic estimates for the critical tidal amplitudes associated with each transition. Our estimates indicate that, within the frequency band of ground-based gravitational-wave detectors, the matter flow around black holes may already be depleted, whereas LISA and (B-)DECIGO could probe the earlier stages. Our results suggest that an object orbiting a tidally deformed massive BH may remain near resonances over a wide range of separations, indicating an accumulated, non-negligible impact on the gravitational-wave phase. Tidal perturbations can also introduce nonlinear couplings among epicyclic oscillations of geodesics, offering a potential avenue to resonant excitation of quasi-periodic oscillations in X-ray light curves from accreting black holes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.15125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a recent publication [R. C. Tautz and I. Lerche, Res. Astron. Astrophys. 16, 162 (2016); arXiv:1606.08272], the authors present a derivation of the Green's function for the three-dimensional telegraph equation (also known as the heat wave equation, or relativistic heat conduction equation). We demonstrate that the closed-form expression derived in their Appendix A is incorrect. Specifically, the published solution lacks a Dirac delta term representing the ballistic wavefront and contains an algebraic error in the prefactor of the wake term. These omissions arise from the neglect of distributional derivatives when differentiating a Heaviside step function. We provide a rigorous derivation of the Green's function using the Fourier transform method, verify the correct limiting behavior as the damping vanishes, and pinpoint the exact mathematical step where the original derivation failed.</description>

      <title>Implications of the continuous radio-loudness distribution among AGNs in the local Universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.15189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aims. We investigate the radio loudness ($\mathcal{R}$) distribution in a large, homogeneous sample of radio galaxies. Methods. The sample is composed of galaxies from the ROGUE I/II catalogue belonging to the SDSS MGS and is divided into optically inactive radio galaxies (OPIRGs), optically active ones (OPARGs) and radio Seyferts. We use optical, mid-infrared and radio data to calculate the AGN bolometric luminosities, accretion rate ($\lambda$), black-hole mass ($M_{BH}$) and $\mathcal{R}$. Results. Contrary to some previous studies based on restricted samples, using our complete sample of objects with redshifts $z &lt; 0.4$, we find no evidence of bimodality in $\mathcal{R}$. The highest $\mathcal{R}$ values are associated with extended radio structures. $\mathcal{R}$ is anti-correlated with $\lambda$, and spans about 2 dex at fixed $\lambda$. Radio Seyferts, OPARGs and OPIRGs form a sequence of increasing $M_{BH}$ with substantial overlap. Radio Seyferts show no $\mathcal{R}$-$M_{BH}$ correlation, whereas OPARGs and OPIRGs show a weak positive trend. From theoretical considerations, the observed two-dex spread in radio luminosity and $\mathcal{R}$ can be reproduced by a four-fold variation in the dimensionless magnetic flux $\varphi$ assuming realistic black-hole spins. Conclusions. The smooth distribution of radio loudness supports a common evolutionary path for all radio sources, with black-hole spin and magnetic field varying continuously. The radio loudness depends on black-hole mass and accretion rate, while moderate variations in $\varphi$ may account for the observed scatter in this relation.</description>

Abstract: Using high-resolution general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations, we investigate accretion flows around spinning black holes and identify three distinct accretion states. Our results suggest the origin of the complex phenomenology observed across the black hole mass spectrum as the interplay between magnetic and gravitational fields. The magnetically arrested disk (MAD) state, characterized by strong magnetic fields (plasma-$\beta &lt;&lt; 1$), exhibits powerful jets, highly variable accretion, and significant sub-Keplerian motion. On the other hand, weakly magnetized disks (plasma-$\beta &gt;&gt; 1$), known as the standard and normal evolution (SANE) state, show steady accretion with primarily winds. An intermediate state bridges the gap between MAD and SANE regimes, with moderate magnetic support (plasma-$\beta \sim 1$) producing mixed outflow morphologies and complex variability. This unified framework has many implications including its possible connection to extreme variability of GRS 1915+105, particularly in its hard spectral states. It also suggests the possible origin of steady jets of Cyg X-1 and the unusually high luminosities (even super-Eddington based on stellar mass black hole) of HLX-1 without requiring super-Eddington mass accretion rates. Our simulations reveal a hierarchy of timescales that explain the rich variety of variability patterns, with magnetic processes driving transitions between states. Comparing two with three dimensional simulations demonstrates that while quantitative details differ, the qualitative features distinguishing different accretion states remain robust.</description>

      <title>Repeating flares, X-ray outbursts and delayed infrared emission: A comprehensive compilation of optical tidal disruption events</title>

Abstract: TDEs have been proposed as valuable laboratories for studying dormant black holes. However, progress in this field has been hampered by the limited number of observed events. In this work, we present TDECat, a comprehensive catalogue of 134 confirmed TDEs (131 optical TDEs and three jetted TDEs) discovered up to the end of 2024, accompanied by multi-wavelength photometry (X-ray, UV, optical, and IR) and publicly available spectra. We also study the statistical properties, spectral classifications, and multi-band variability of these events. Using a Bayesian Blocks algorithm, we determined the duration, rise time, decay time, and their ratio for 103 flares in our sample. We find that these timescales follow a log-normal distribution. Furthermore, our spectral analysis shows that most optical TDEs belong to the TDE-H+He class, followed by the TDE-H, TDE-He, and TDE-featureless classes, which is consistent with expectations from main-sequence star disruption. Using archival observations, we identified three new potentially repeating TDEs, namely, AT2024pvu, AT2022exr, and AT2021uvz, increasing the number of known repeating events. In both new and previously known cases, the secondary flares exhibit a similar shape to the primary. We also examined the infrared and X-ray emission from the TDEs in our catalogue, and find that 14 out of the 18 infrared events have associated X-ray emission, strongly suggesting a potential correlation. Finally, we find that for three sub-samples (repeating flares, infrared-emitting events, and X-ray events), the spectral classes are unlikely to be randomly distributed, suggesting a connection between spectral characteristics and multi-wavelength emission. TDEcat enables large-scale population studies across wavelengths and spectral classes, providing essential tools for navigating the data-rich era of upcoming surveys such as the Legacy Survey of Space and Time.</description>

      <title>Coupled Time-Dependent Proton Acceleration and Leptonic-Hadronic Radiation in Turbulent Supermassive Black Hole Coronae</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08233v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Turbulent coronae of supermassive black holes can accelerate non-thermal particles to high energies and produce observable radiation, but capturing this process is challenging due to comparable timescales of acceleration, cooling, and the development of cascades. We present a time-dependent numerical framework that self-consistently couples proton acceleration--modeled by the Fokker-Planck equation--with leptonic-hadronic radiation. For the neutrino-emitting Seyfert galaxy NGC 1068, we reproduce the neutrino spectrum observed by IceCube, while satisfying gamma-ray constraints. We also consider a transient corona scenario, potentially emerging in tidal disruption events like AT 2019dsg, and show that cascade feedback on proton cooling can impact proton acceleration and radiation processes in weaker coronae, producing delayed optical/ultraviolet, X-ray, and neutrino emissions of $\mathcal O(100~\rm d)$. This flexible tool efficiently models multi-messenger signals from both steady and transient astrophysical sources, providing insights in combining particle acceleration and radiation mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Black-hole mass estimation through accretion disk spectral fitting for high-redshift blazars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06933v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-redshift ($z&gt;2$) blazars, with relativistic jets aligned toward us, probe the most powerful end of the active galactic nuclei (AGN) population. We aim at determining the black hole masses and mass accretion rates of high-$z$ blazars in a common framework that utilizes a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) fitting method and the Shakura-Sunayev multi-temperature accretion disk model, accounting also for attenuation due to neutral hydrogen gas in the intergalactic medium (IGM). We compiled a sample of 23 high-redshift blazars from the literature with publicly available infrared-to-ultraviolet photometric data. We performed a Bayesian fit to the spectral energy distribution (SED) of the accretion disk, accounting for upper limits, and determined the black hole masses and mass accretion rates with their uncertainties. We also examined the impact of optical-ultraviolet attenuation due to gas in the IGM. We find that neglecting IGM attenuation in SED fits leads to systematically larger black-hole mass estimates and correspondingly lower Eddington ratios, with the bias becoming more severe at higher redshift. Our MCMC fits yield median black-hole masses in the range $\sim (10^{8}-10^{10})\,M_{\odot}$ and a broad distribution of median Eddington ratios ($\lambda_{\rm Edd}\sim0.04$ up to $\sim1$). Comparison with previous literature shows no clear method-dependent systematic offsets, although individual mass estimates can differ by up to a factor of a few. We also demonstrate that assumptions about black-hole spin introduce a systematic degeneracy. This work is to our knowledge the first systematic study to model the accretion-disk emission of a large sample of high-$z$ blazars within a single, consistent statistical framework. Our results emphasize the importance of accounting for IGM attenuation and of using uniform fitting methods when comparing disk-based black hole estimates across samples.</description>

      <title>A Practical Framework for Estimating the Repetition Likelihood of Fast Radio Bursts from Spectral Morphology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16338v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The repeating behavior of fast radio bursts (FRBs) is regarded as a key clue to understanding their physical origin, yet reliably distinguishing repeaters from apparent non-repeaters with current observations remains challenging. Here we propose a physically interpretable and practically quantifiable classification framework based on spectral morphology. Using dimensionality reduction, clustering, and feature-importance analysis, we identify the spectral running $r$ and spectral index $\gamma$ as the most critical parameters for distinguishing repeaters from apparent non-repeaters in the CHIME/FRB sample. In the $\gamma$-$r$ space, repeaters preferentially occupy regions with steeper, narrower-band spectra, whereas non-repeaters cluster in flatter, broader-band regions, resulting in a clear density separation. We further construct an empirical probability map in the $\gamma$-$r$ space, showing a clear gradient of repetition likelihood, from $\sim 65\%$ in the high-repetition region to $\sim 5\%$ in the low-repetition region. Combining this with Gaussian Mixture Model posterior analysis, we identify several apparent non-repeaters with high inferred repetition probability, recommending them as priority targets for future monitoring. This framework provides a simple and generalizable tool for assessing repeatability in the CHIME/FRB sample and highlights the diagnostic power of spectral morphology in unveiling FRB origins.</description>

      <title>Physical properties of long-rising type II Supernovae -- Bayesian Analytic Modeling and Spectrophotometric Correlations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25018v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Supernova (SN) 1987A, with its long-rising ($\gtrsim$40 days) light curve, defines a rare subclass of type II SNe known as 1987A-like events. Representing only $\sim$1-3\% of all core-collapse SNe and often found in low-metallicity environments, their large diversity suggests a wide range of progenitor and explosion properties. This study aims to improve the understanding of 1987A-like SNe by characterizing their explosion parameters, including kinetic energy, ejected mass, progenitor radius at explosion, and synthesized $^{56}$Ni mass. Additionally, it seeks to identify systematic trends in both the physical properties and the observed features of these peculiar events. A new Bayesian parameter estimation method, based on our $^{56}$Ni-dependent analytical model for hydrogen-rich SNe, is applied to derive explosion parameters from the light curves and expansion velocities of one of the largest and most comprehensive 1987A-like SN samples to date. These data are measured through a consistent analysis of observations available in the literature. The analysis reveals a heterogeneous population that nevertheless clusters into two main groups: (i) lower-energy explosions with modest $^{56}$Ni yields ($\sim$0.07 M$_\odot$), similar to SN 1987A, and (ii) more energetic events (up to $\sim$5 foe) with larger nickel production and, in some cases, unusually extended progenitors. We confirm a robust correlation between $^{56}$Ni mass, peak luminosity, and explosion energy, as well as between ejecta mass and recombination timescale. An anti-correlation between Ba II line strength and photospheric velocity indicates that stronger Ba II absorptions in 1987A-like SNe arise from more compact, slowly expanding ejecta. Our study underscores the need to extend analytical frameworks to include additional power sources, enabling scalable and accurate modeling of the growing number of peculiar transients.</description>

      <title>Diffusive or Ballistic? Distributions and Spectra of PeV Cosmic Rays around Microquasars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17994v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the standard Galactic cosmic-ray (CR) paradigm, protons are accelerated up to ~1 PeV by Galactic sources. While supernova remnants (SNRs) have been traditionally considered as the primary accelerators, recent observations by LHAASO and HAWC have detected very-high-energy (VHE) gamma rays exceeding 100 TeV from several microquasars, suggesting that these X-ray binaries can accelerate CRs beyond 1 PeV. We investigate the escape process of CRs from microquasars, focusing on the energy-dependent transport mechanisms. High-energy CRs are likely to have long mean free paths and move ballistically on scales smaller than their mean free path, while lower-energy CRs undergo diffusive propagation. This transition results in a spectral break in the CR distribution around the microquasar. We calculate CR energy spectra within a 10-30 pc radius for various diffusion coefficients and timescales. Our model predicts a spectral break and hardening at E_p ~10-100 TeV when the standard diffusion coefficient for the interstellar space is assumed. However, current VHE gamma-ray observations do not show clear spectral breaks, suggesting that the diffusion coefficient may be significantly reduced near microquasars, possibly due to magnetic field amplification by CR-driven turbulence.</description>

      <title>Disc Winds From Accreting Systems in the 2040s</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02028v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: What does the temporal evolution of disc winds tell us about accreting systems and the accretion process? Studies of accretion-disc outflows across all mass scales, including accreting white dwarfs, X-ray binaries, and active galactic nuclei, have shown that winds play a key role in regulating both the accretion flow and the surrounding environment. Disc winds therefore provide a common thread linking a broad range of scientific topics, from the microphysics of accretion to galaxy-scale feedback and evolution, as well as binary evolution and the predicted rates of energetic (multi-messenger) transient phenomena. Yet we still lack a comprehensive picture of the accretion-feedback process. Optical spectroscopy has revealed striking similarities across mass scales, hinting at common production mechanisms, and has shown that winds can evolve on timescales of only minutes. Progress, however, has been limited by their transient nature, sparse time coverage, and the lack of simultaneous, high-resolution spectroscopy. Time-domain facilities with high temporal and spectral resolution will allow us to track these events in high accretion-rate systems, constrain their launching mechanisms, and measure the mass, energy, and angular momentum they carry. This will provide crucial input for binary evolution models, wind feedback, and a unified view of accreting systems across mass scales.</description>

      <title>A multi-wavelength study of the 2025 low state of the intermediate polar BG CMi</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14156v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present multi-wavelength observations of the first recorded low state of the intermediate polar BG CMi. Optical monitoring of the source by members of the American Association of Variable Star Observers reveals a decrease of ~0.5 mag that lasted ~50 d in early 2025. During the low state the optical timing properties imply that BG CMi underwent a change in the accretion mode, as power at the spin frequency $\omega$ dramatically dropped. An XMM-Newton observation revealed a substantial decrease in intrinsic absorption and a slight increase in intrinsic X-ray luminosity, compared to archival Suzaku data. Timing analysis of the X-ray light curves shows that power shifted from the orbital frequency $\Omega$ (prominent in Suzaku data) to $2\Omega$ in the low state XMM-Newton data, along with the strengthening of certain orbital sidebands. We suggest that BG CMi transitioned to disk-overflow accretion, where the white dwarf accreted matter via both a disk and a stream, the latter becoming more dominant during the low state due to a decrease in the mass and size of the disk.</description>

      <title>Exploring selection biases in FRB dispersion-galaxy cross-correlations with magnetohydrodynamical simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03258v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dispersion measure (DM) of fast radio bursts (FRBs) in conjunction with their redshifts can be used as powerful probes of the distribution of extragalactic plasma. With a large enough sample, the free-electron--galaxy power spectrum $P_{eg}$ can be measured by cross-correlating FRB DMs with galaxy positions. However, a precise measurement of $P_{eg}$ requires a careful investigation of selection effects: the probability of both observing the FRB DM and obtaining a host galaxy redshift depends on their properties. We ray trace through the magnetohydrodynamic simulation IllustrisTNG to investigate the impact of expected observational selection effects on FRB dispersion--galaxy angular cross-correlations with a sample of 3000 FRBs at $0.3\leq z\leq 0.4$ . Our results show that cross-correlations with such an FRB sample are robust to properties of the FRB host galaxy: this includes DM contributions from the FRB host and optical follow-up selection effects. We also find that such cross-correlations are robust to DM-dependent and scattering selection effects specific to the CHIME/FRB survey. However, a DM-dependent selection effect that cuts off the 10\% most dispersed FRBs at a fixed redshift shell can bias the amplitude of the cross-correlation signal by over 50\% at angular scales of $\sim 0.1^\circ$, corresponding to $\sim$ Mpc physical scales. Our findings highlight the importance of both measuring and accounting for selection effects present in existing FRB surveys, as well as mitigating DM-dependent selection effects in the design of upcoming FRB surveys aiming to probe large-scale structure with FRBs.</description>

      <title>Speed of sound peak in isospin QCD: a natural prediction of the Medium Separation Scheme</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14343v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present predictions for the zero-temperature equation of state at finite isospin density using the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model within the medium separation scheme (MSS) -- a scheme that explicitly disentangles medium effects from the ultraviolet divergent vacuum terms. Recent lattice QCD results reveal a nonmonotonic speed of sound ($c_s^2$) as a function of isospin chemical potential ($\mu_I$), exhibiting explicit violation of the conformal bound $c_s^2 = 1/3$. These findings have attracted significant theoretical interest, as established models -- including the NJL model -- failed to anticipate this behavior prior to lattice simulations. Conventional NJL implementations yield unphysical artifacts, often attributed to regularization scale sensitivity stemming from nonrenormalizability. However, in this work, we demonstrate that the standard NJL framework combined with MSS quantitatively reproduces state-of-the-art lattice data for isospin QCD.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09252v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dense nucleonic matter is of vital importance for understanding compact stars and inferring the transition into deconfined quark phase. We present the $\textit{ab initio}$ exact calculations of infinite nucleonic matter with the state-of-the-art full configuration-interaction quantum Monte Carlo (FCIQMC) method, enabling us to rigorously benchmark many-body methods and assess the degree to which the nucleonic matter is correlated. This method has been numerically validated by exact diagonalization within a small model space. Calculations of nucleonic matter using chiral nuclear forces reveal that the symmetric nuclear matter is strikingly strongly correlated, raising questions on previous $\textit{ab initio}$ calculations of nuclear matter with many-body expansion truncations and offering insights into simultaneous descriptions of finite nuclei and infinite nucleonic matter from first principles.</description>

      <title>Dynamical tide modified Roche limit in eccentric, asynchronous binaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20183v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Roche limit, or the threshold separation within which a celestial object (the donor) M cannot remain in a stable configuration due to a companion's tidal field, has been well established when M is in hydrostatic equilibrium and has synchronous rotation in a circular orbit. However, limited analyses exist considering corrections to the Roche limit due to hydrodynamical effects. We fill in the gap by providing a general theoretical framework involving nonlinear hydrodynamics. We consider both exact nonlinear equations derived from an affine model describing incompressible ellipsoids and series-expanded ones that can be calculated for realistic stars and planets. Our formulation addresses the Roche problem in generic orbits and synchronization levels of M, and fully accounts for the history-dependent hydrodynamical effects. We show that as the orbital eccentricity increases, fluid instability is more likely to develop at the pericenter due to the increased dynamical tide that accumulates over multiple orbits. When M moves in a highly eccentric orbit (with eccentricity around 0.9) and the damping of the fluid is small, the threshold pericenter separation at which mass loss from M can occur can be at least 30% higher than the value predicted for a circular orbit with hydrostatic equilibrium. If only a single passage is considered, however, the threshold separation is 20% smaller than the static limit. The nonlinear interaction at each pericenter passage can also trigger a chaotic fluid evolution inside M even with moderate eccentricities, complementing previous studies of chaotic tides caused by random propagation phases. Our work has broad implications for interacting binaries in eccentric orbits, including migrating gaseous exoplanets, repeated partial tidal disruption events, and more.</description>

      <title>Constraints on gravitational waves from the 2024 Vela pulsar glitch</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17990v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Among known neutron stars, the Vela pulsar is one of the best targets for gravitational-wave searches. It is also one of the most prolific in terms of glitches, sudden frequency changes in a pulsar's rotation. Such glitches could cause a variety of transient gravitational-wave signals. Here we search for signals associated with a Vela glitch on 29 April 2024 in data of the two LIGO detectors from the fourth LIGO--Virgo--KAGRA observing run. We search both for seconds-scale burst-like emission, primarily from fundamental (f-)mode oscillations, and for longer quasi-monochromatic transients up to four months in duration, primarily from quasi-static quadrupolar deformations. We find no significant detection candidates, but for the first time we set direct observational upper limits on gravitational strain amplitude that are stricter than what can be indirectly inferred from the overall glitch energy scale. We discuss the short- and long-duration observational constraints in the context of specific emission models. These results demonstrate the potential of gravitational-wave probes of glitching pulsars as detector sensitivity continues to improve.</description>
