      <title>Remeasuring the $\gamma$-decay branching ratio of the Hoyle state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The radiative branching ratio of the Hoyle state is crucial to estimate the triple-$\alpha$ reaction rate in stellar environments at medium temperatures. Knowledge of the $\gamma$-decay channel is critical as this is the dominant radiative decay channel for the Hoyle state. A recent study by Kib\'edi et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 125, 182701 (2020)] has challenged our understanding of this astrophysically significant branching ratio and its constraints. The objective of this work was to perform a new measurement of the $\gamma$-decay branching ratio of the Hoyle state to deduce the radiative branching ratio of the Hoyle state. An additional objective was to independently verify aspects of the aforementioned measurement conducted by Kib\'edi et al. For the main experiment of this work, the Hoyle state was populated by the $^{12}\textrm{C}(p,p')$ reaction at 10.8 MeV at the Oslo Cyclotron Laboratory. The $\gamma$-decay branching ratio was deduced through triple-coincidence events, each consisting of a proton ejectile corresponding to the Hoyle state, and the subsequent $\gamma$-ray cascade. In the main experiment of this work, a $\gamma$-decay branching ratio of the Hoyle state of $\Gamma_{\gamma}/\Gamma=4.0(4)\times 10^{-4}$ was determined, yielding a corresponding radiative branching ratio of $\Gamma_{\textrm{rad}}/\Gamma=4.1(4) \times 10^{-4}$, which is in agreement with several recent studies, as well as the previously adopted ENSDF average of $\Gamma_{\textrm{rad}}/\Gamma=4.16(11)\times 10^{-4}$. Aspects of the analysis performed by Kib\'edi et al. were verified in this work and the source of discrepancy between the results of this work and that of Kib\'edi et al. could not be determined. Further independent and innovative studies for the radiative width of the Hoyle state will substantiate whether the discrepant result by Kib\'edi et al. should be excluded from future evaluations.</description>

      <title>$K^+\Lambda(1520)$ photoproduction at forward angles near threshold with the BGOOD experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The differential cross section for $\gamma p\rightarrow K^+\Lambda(1520)$ was measured from threshold to a centre-of-mass energy of 2090\,MeV at forward angles at the BGOOD experiment. The high statistical precision and resolution in centre-of-mass energy and angle allows a detailed characterisation of this low-momentum transfer kinematic region. The data agree with a previous LEPS measurement and support effective Lagrangian models that indicate that the contact term dominates the cross section near threshold.</description>

      <title>Low energy alpha-nucleus optical potential studied via (a,n) cross section measurements on Te isotopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In several processes of stellar nucleosynthesis, like the astrophysical gamma-process, nuclear reactions involving alpha particles play an important role. The description of these reactions necessitates the knowledge of the alpha-nucleus optical model potential (AOMP) which is highly ambiguous at low, astrophysical energies. This ambiguity introduces a substantial uncertainty in the stellar models for predicting elemental and isotopic abundances. The experimental study of the AOMP is thus necessary which can be implemented by measuring the cross section of alpha-induced nuclear reactions. At low energies, (a,n) reactions are suitable for such a purpose. Therefore, in the present work, the (a,n) cross sections of four Te isotopes have been measured, mostly for the first time, and compared with theoretical predictions. The (a,n) cross sections of 120,122,124,130Te have been measured in the energy range between about 10 and 17 MeV using the activation method. The detection of the gamma radiation following the decay of the radioactive reaction products were used to determine the cross sections. The measured cross sections are compared with statistical model calculations obtained from the widely used TALYS nuclear reaction simulation code. Predictions using various available AOMPs are investigated. It is found that the recently developed Atomki-V2 AOMP provides the best description for all studied reactions and this potential also reproduces well the total reaction cross sections from elastic scattering experiments, when they are available in literature. We recommend therefore to use the astrophysical reaction rates based on this potential for nucleosynthesis models of heavy elements.</description>

      <title>Methodology for Analyzing Proton Multiplicity Fluctuations with Azimuthal Partitions in Heavy-Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A primary objective in high-energy heavy-ion collisions is to investigate the phase transition between confined and deconfined color matter. Complementary to the cumulants of conserved charges integrated over the full azimuth, we introduce a novel experimental approach to explore particle fluctuations in azimuthal partitions, which are potentially sensitive to the first-order phase transition in heavy-ion collisions. We evaluate proton multiplicity ($N_w$) fluctuations in azimuthal partitions of width $w$ to quantitatively estimate the clustering tendency among these protons. The $\Delta \sigma^2$ observable is defined as the normalized difference between the variance of the $N_w$ distribution and the binomial baseline. We demonstrate the feasibility and characteristics of this observable through simulations using the AMPT and MUSIC+FIST models. We also use a Gaussian correlation model to illustrate that the dependence of $\Delta \sigma^2$ on $w$ can be parameterized to accurately extract the strength and the range of the input interaction among protons.</description>

      <title>PDFs, TMDs, and fragmentation functions of spin-1 hadrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Structure functions of the spin-1 deuteron will be investigated experimentally from the late 2020's at various facilities such as Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility, Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, nuclotron-based ion collider facility, and electron-ion colliders. We expect that a new high-energy spin-physics field could be created by these projects. In this paper, the current theoretical status is explained for the structure functions of spin-1 hadrons, especially on parton distribution functions, transverse-momentum dependent parton distributions, and fragmentation functions. Related multiparton distribution functions are also shown.</description>

      <title>Development of large-volume $^{130}$TeO$_2$ bolometers for the CROSS $2\beta$ decay search experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the development of thermal detectors based on large-size tellurium dioxide crystals (45x45x45 mm), containing tellurium enriched in $^{130}$Te to ~91%, for the CROSS double-beta decay experiment. A powder used for the crystals growth was additionally purified by the directional solidification method, resulting in the reduction of the concentration of impurities by a factor 10, to a few ppm of the total concentration of residual elements (the main impurity is Fe). The purest part of the ingot (the first ~200 mm, ~80% of the total length of the cylindrical part of the ingot) was determined by scanning segregation profiles of impurities (both on the surface and in center of the ingot) and used for the $^{130}$TeO$_2$ powder production with no evidence of re-contamination. The crystal growth was verified with precursors produced from powder with natural Te isotopic composition, and two small-size (20x20x10 mm) samples were tested at a sea-level laboratory showing high bolometric and spectrometric performance together with acceptable $^{210}$Po content (below 10 mBq/kg). This growth method was then applied for the production of six large cubic $^{130}$TeO$_2$ crystals for the CROSS experiment and 4 of them were taken randomly to be characterized at the Canfranc underground laboratory, in the CROSS-dedicated low-background cryogenic facility. Two $^{130}$TeO$_2$ samples were coated with a thin metal film in form of Al layer (on 4 sides) or AlPd grid (on a single side) to investigate the possibility to tag surface events by pulse-shape discrimination. Similarly to the small natural precursors, large-volume $^{130}$TeO$_2$ bolometers show high performance and even better internal purity ($^{210}$Po activity ~ 1 mBq/kg, while activities of $^{228}$Th and $^{226}$Ra are below 0.01 mBq/kg), satisfying requirements for the CROSS and, potentially, next-generation experiments.</description>

      <title>Electroproduction of the Lambda/Sigma^0 hyperons at Q^2~0.5 (GeV/c)^2 in forward angles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01173v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2018, the E12-17-003 experiment was conducted at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (JLab) to explore the possible existence of an nnLambda state in the reconstructed missing mass distribution from a tritium gas target [K. N. Suzuki et al., Prog. Theor. Exp. Phys. 2022, 013D01 (2022), B. Pandey et al., Phys. Rev. C 105, L051001 (2022)]. As part of this investigation, data was also collected using a gaseous hydrogen target, not only for a precise absolute mass scale calibration but also for the study of Lambda/Sigma^0 electroproduction. This dataset was acquired at Q^2~0.5 (GeV/c)^2, W=2.14 GeV, and theta_{gamma K}^{c.m.}~8 deg. It covers forward angles where photoproduction data is scarce and a low-Q^2 region that is of interest for hypernuclear experiments. On the other hand, this kinematic region is at a slightly higher Q^2 than previous hypernuclear experiments, thus providing crucial information for understanding the Q^2 dependence of the differential cross sections for Lambda/Sigma^0 hyperon electroproduction. This paper reports on the Q^2 dependence of the differential cross section for the e + p -&gt; e' + K^+ + Lambda/Sigma^0 reaction in the 0.2-0.8 (GeV/c)^2, and provides comparisons with the currently available theoretical models.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the mesonic decay branch of the $\bar{K}\!N\!N$ quasi-bound state</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01773v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We conducted measurements of $K^- + {^3{\rm He}} \to \pi \!Y \!N + N'$ reactions using a $1~{\rm GeV}/c$ $K^-$-beam, with the objective of understanding the broad decay width of $\bar{K} \!N \!N$ (approximately twice as broad as that of $\Lambda(1405)$ considered to be the $\bar{K} \!N$ quasi-bound state). We successfully reproduced distributions of the $\pi \! Y \! N$ invariant mass and momentum transfer for $\pi \! Y \! N$ using model fitting functions for $\bar{K} \!N \!N$ formation and quasi-free $\bar{K}$ absorption (${\rm QF}_{\bar{K}-{\rm abs}}$) processes. The model can describe the experimental data quite well, and four $\bar{K} \! N \! N \to \pi \! Y \! N $ cross-sections were obtained. The results indicate that mesonic decay is the dominant decay branch of $\bar{K} \! N \! N$. The results also suggest that $\Gamma_{\pi \Lambda N} \sim \Gamma_{\pi \Sigma N}$, which indicates that the $I_{\bar{K} \! N}=1$ absorption channel, in addition to the $I_{\bar{K} \! N}=0$ absorption channel, substantially contribute to the $\bar{K} \! N \! N$ decay, making the $\bar{K} \! N \! N$ state approximately twice as unstable as $\Lambda$(1405).</description>

      <title>Impact of the $^6$Li asymptotic normalization constant onto $\alpha$-induced reactions of astrophysical interest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.05636v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Indirect methods have become the predominant approach in experimental nuclear astrophysics for studying several low-energy nuclear reactions occurring in stars, as direct measurements of many of these relevant reactions are rendered infeasible due to their low reaction probability. Such indirect methods, however, require theoretical input that in turn can have significant poorly-quantified uncertainties, which can then be propagated to the reaction rates and have a large effect on our quantitative understanding of stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis processes. We present two such examples involving $\alpha$-induced reactions, $^{13}$C($\alpha,n)^{16}$O and $^{12}$C$(\alpha,\gamma)^{16}$O, for which the low-energy cross sections have been constrained with $(^6$Li$,d)$ transfer data. In this Letter, we discuss how a first-principle calculation of $^6$Li leads to a 21% reduction of the $^{12}$C$(\alpha,\gamma)^{16}$O cross sections with respect to a previous estimation. This calculation further resolves the discrepancy between recent measurements of the $^{13}$C$(\alpha,n)^{16}$O reaction and points to the need for improved theoretical formulations of nuclear reactions.</description>
