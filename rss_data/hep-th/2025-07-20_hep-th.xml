      <title>Moduli Space of SU(2) Singular Monopole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $SU(2)$ monopole with a Dirac singularity was constructed in Durcan (2007) and Cherkis and Durcan (2007). We study its moduli space by identifying the tangent direction to the moduli space. The tangent vectors to the moduli space are composed of the monopole's phase and translational zero modes. We construct the phase and translational zero modes using the Nahm transform. These zero modes are then used to construct the metric components $g_{00}$ and $g_{0q}$ of the $SU(2)$ singular monopole moduli space, where $0$ denotes the gauge coordinate and q denotes the translational coordinates. We find the moduli space to be the Taub-NUT space. It has been shown by Nakajima (1990) and Maciocia (1991) that there is an isomorphism between the monopole moduli space of regular monopoles and the moduli space of the Nahm data used to construct them. We compute the moduli space of the Nahm data of a singular monopole using the hyperk\"ahler quotient construction as described in Gibbons and Rychenkova (1997). We find it to be isometric to the moduli space of the singular monopole. Finally we make an explicit connection between the moduli space of the Nahm data and the monopole moduli space using Corrigan's inner product formula (Osborn 1981) independently proving this isomorphism.</description>

      <title>From Regular to Irregular: A Unified Origin for Argyres-Douglas Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose that Argyres-Douglas theories of type $D_p(\mathrm{SU}(N))$ and $(A_{p-1}, A_{N-1})$ - both realizable as Type A class $\mathcal{S}$ theories with irregular punctures - can be obtained via a sequence of mass deformations from a common ancestor: a class $\mathcal{S}$ theory with only regular punctures. Building on our previous work, this result establishes that these theories ultimately originate from 6d $\mathcal{N}=(1,0)$ orbi-instanton theories compactified on a torus. The requisite 4d mass deformations are realized as tractable Fayet-Iliopoulos deformations on the 3d mirror quiver. The core of our method is a constructive procedure that utilizes the Euclidean algorithm to define a chain of deformations connecting different $D_p(\mathrm{SU}(N))$ theories. By reversing this chain, we recursively build a "parent" star-shaped quiver for any given $(N,p)$. This quiver is the 3d mirror theory of the required class $\mathcal{S}$ ancestor. We substantiate our general claims with several detailed examples that explicitly illustrate the deformation procedure.</description>

      <title>Out-of-bounds hydrodynamics in holographic anisotropic Dirac semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a version of a strongly correlated 2+1-dimensional condensed matter system that features a thermal phase transition between a semimetal and an insulator through a semi-Dirac quantum critical region using AdS/CFT holography. We introduce backreaction into the bulk equations of motion to measure transport coefficients in the boundary; specifically the shear viscosity $\eta$. By explicitly breaking rotational symmetry we find a new instance of violation of the KSS-bound for the $\eta/s$ ratio in the quantum critical region, as well as a monotone dependence on temperature in the $T\to 0$ regime fixed by a Lifshitz dynamical critical exponent. We find that the Lifshitz critical exponent in the anisotropic direction is approximately equal to $2$ for our choice of backreaction parameters. We find explicit $T=0$ solutions separated by a quantum critical point in parameter space, showing that the thermal critical phase found in previous work comes from a quantum phase transition at zero temperature.</description>

      <title>Quantum droplets in curved space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the formation of quantum droplets in curved spacetime, highlighting the significant influence of curvature on the formation and properties of these objects. While our computations encompass various dimensions, we primarily focus on 2-dimensions. Our findings reveal a novel class of curvature-driven quantum effects leading to the formation of quasi-stable liquid droplets, suggesting a feasible pathway for experimental observation, particularly in microgravity environments.</description>

      <title>Gravity and the Higgs boson mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: According to usual calculations in quantum field theory, both in flat and curved spacetime, the mass $m^2$ of a scalar particle is quadratically sensitive to the ultimate scale of the theory, the UV physical cutoff $\Lambda$. In the present work, paying attention to the path integral measure and to the way $\Lambda$ is introduced, we calculate the one-loop effective action $\Gamma^{1l}$ for a scalar field on a non-trivial gravitational background. We find that $m^2$ presents only a (mild) logarithmic sensitivity to $\Lambda$. This is obtained without resorting to a supersymmetric embedding of the theory, nor to regularization schemes (as dimensional or zeta-function regularization) where power-like divergences are absent by construction. In view of the results of the present work, we finally speculate on the way the Minkowski limit should be approached.</description>

      <title>Probing the singularity at the holographic screen via $q$-holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the emergence of $q$-deformed spacetime in a lower-dimensional gravitational system whose asymptotic region geometrizes the global symmetry of a $q$-deformed CFT. More precisely, we consider the 2d sinh dilaton gravity model, whose classical metric solutions exhibit a curvature singularity at the holographic boundary. Our aim is to probe this UV near-boundary regime by injecting a small probe into the bulk, and identifying the geometrical features it observes. At the level of the two-point correlator, we see the emergence of $q$-deformed hyperbolic disk isometries. By formulating DSSYK in terms of the analogous sine dilaton gravity model, we expect this $q$-deformed holographic duality to persist.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a class of spontaneously broken $SU(2)$ gauge theories with adjoint scalar and look for exact magnetic monopole solutions in the Bogomol'nyi--Prasad--Sommerfield (BPS) limit. We find that some of the resulting solutions exhibit a new internal degree of freedom (a moduli space parameter) that controls the energy density profile of the monopole while keeping the total energy (mass) constant.</description>

      <title>Near-extremal quantum cross-section for charged fields and superradiance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the scattering and absorption properties of charged scalar fields on a near-extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole background. We show that in this low-temperature regime the near-horizon throat experiences large quantum fluctuations, whose leading contribution is described by the one dimensional Schwarzian effective action, while the soft $U(1)$ gauge modes can only contribute to subleading order. We investigate the role of the leading quantum effects both inside and outside the superradiant regime. These effects result in an enhanced reflection coefficient within the superradiant regime, while causing a suppression in the non-superradiant regime. On the other hand, the absorption cross-section increases in both regimes. Additional physical features appear as kinks in the reflection coefficient and absorption cross-section plots, corresponding to the shutdown of absorption in the superradiant regime and of stimulated emission in the non-superradiant regime.</description>

      <title>Jordanian spin chains for twisted strings in $AdS_5\times S^5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the integrable spin chain formulation of Jordanian deformations of the $AdS_5\times S^5$ superstring, realised via Drinfel'd twists. Among these models, we first identify a unique supergravity deformation confined to an $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ sector and with constant dilaton. We then develop a general framework for closed Drinfel'd twisted spin chains and construct an explicit map to undeformed models with twisted-boundary conditions. Applied to the non compact $\mathrm{XXX}_{-1/2}$ spin chain, the Jordanian twist breaks the Cartan generator labelling magnon excitations, obstructing the standard Bethe methods. Instead, using the twisted-boundary formulation, we initiate the spectral problem based on a residual root generator both in the thermodynamic limit and for short chains. We find that the ground state is non-trivially deformed, and is in agreement with the classical string result, while our analysis does not capture higher-spin excited states. We also study the asymptotics of the associated $Q$-system, which is well-behaved and compatible with the boundary-twist. While a full understanding of the spectrum remains open, our work provides concrete steps toward a spectral description of non-abelian twisted integrable models.</description>

      <title>Gravity MHV amplitudes via Berends-Giele currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Berends and Giele derived the Parke-Taylor formula for Yang-Mills MHV amplitudes by computing Berends-Giele currents involving gluons of all-plus and all-but-one-plus helicities. Remarkably, the all-plus current already encodes much of the Parke-Taylor formula structure. The all-but-one-plus current satisfies a more intricate recursion relation than the all-plus case, but one that can still be solved explicitly. This current turns out to be proportional to the all-plus current, which explains why the essential features of the MHV formula are already present at the all-plus level.
  In this paper, we carry out an analogous program for gravity. The all-plus graviton Berends-Giele current satisfies a recursion relation that is more involved than in the Yang-Mills case, but whose explicit solution is known: a sum over spanning trees of the complete graph on n vertices. We derive and solve the recursion relation for the all-but-one-plus graviton current. The solution is again given by a sum over spanning trees, where each tree contributes a term proportional to the corresponding all-plus current, multiplied by a factor given by a sum over subtrees. Only a small subset of these terms contributes to the MHV amplitude, which we recover explicitly. This provides a direct derivation of the gravity MHV formula from the gravitational Feynman rules - achieving what Berends, Giele, and Kuijf in their 1987 paper regarded as "hard to obtain directly from quantum gravity".</description>

Abstract: The recent paper "The asymptotically-free gauge theories" by Ben Gripaios and Khoi Le Nguyen Nguyen [arXiv:2507.12348] presents a proposed classification of gauge theories valid down to arbitrarily short scales. In this comment, we aim to clarify several points and address some statements that may be misleading. We also provide additional context by discussing relevant prior literature and existing classifications.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the four-dimensional action of spinors minimally coupled to a $U(1)$-gauge field in an Riemann-Cartan background. In this theory, we integrate over the spinors and study the resulting one-loop gauge-gravity effective action, paying special attention to the contributions that depend on both the gauge field and the torsion. We explicitly calculate the gauge-torsion term, which turns out to be finite, and comment on possible terms depending simultaneously on torsion, curvature, and gauge field.</description>

Abstract: We propose an AdS$\times$S factorization formula at the level of the generating function for correlators with arbitrary Kaluza-Klein configurations, and implement it in the supergravity limit of $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills. By incorporating this mechanism into Mellin space bootstrap, together with an observed $Z_2$ symmetry under AdS$\ \leftrightarrow\ $S, we manage to simultaneously work out unified formulas both for all five-point half-BPS correlators and for all four-point correlators with one superdescendant. This AdS\times$S bootstrap method is directly applicable to generic multi-point computation at tree level.</description>

      <title>Reanalyzing DESI DR1: 1. $\Lambda$CDM Constraints from the Power Spectrum and Bispectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first independent re-analysis of the galaxy clustering data from DESI Data Release 1, utilizing an effective field theory (EFT)-based full-shape model. We analyze the power spectra and bispectra of the public catalogs using a custom-built pipeline based on window-deconvolved quasi-optimal estimators, carefully accounting for all relevant systematic effects. Compared to the official collaboration analysis, we add the galaxy power spectrum hexadecapole and the bispectrum monopole, and also introduce a novel stochastic estimator for fiber collisions, which facilitates robust bispectrum analyses. As a first application, we perform an EFT-based full-shape analysis of the DESI power spectra and bispectra in the context of the standard cosmological model, $\Lambda$CDM. Using external priors on the physical baryon density and the primordial power spectrum tilt, we constrain the matter density fraction to $\Omega_m=0.284\pm 0.011$, the Hubble constant to $h=0.707\pm 0.011$, and the mass fluctuation amplitude to $\sigma_8=0.811\pm 0.030$. The bispectrum has a noticeable effect on parameter estimation: it sharpens the constraints on $\sigma_8$ and $\Omega_m$ by $\approx 10$\% and shifts $\Omega_m$ by $\approx 1\sigma$ towards the Planck $\Lambda$CDM value. Combining our full-shape likelihood with the official DESI DR2 BAO measurements, cosmological parameters shift further towards the \textit{Planck} values, with $\Omega_m=0.296\pm 0.007$, $h=0.688\pm 0.006$, $\sigma_8=0.818\pm 0.029$ (with tighter constraints obtained in joint analyses). Finally, the galaxy bispectrum data dramatically improves measurements of quadratic bias parameters, which are consistent with predictions from halo occupation distribution models. Our work highlights the importance of higher-order statistics and sets the stage for upcoming full-shape analyses of non-minimal cosmological models.</description>

      <title>Bipartite and tripartite entanglement in pure dephasing relativistic spin-boson model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study non-perturbatively the entanglement generation between two and three emitters in an exactly solvable relativistic variant of the spin-boson model, equivalent to the time-independent formulation of the Unruh-DeWitt detector model. We show that (i) (highly) entangled states of the two emitters require interactions very deep into the light cone, (ii) the mass of the field can generically improve the entanglement generation, (iii) unlike the bipartite case where it is possible to generate close to maximally entangled states via the spin-boson interactions, the generation of genuine tripartite entanglement is non-perturbatively hard even at sufficiently long times. Result (iii), in particular, suggests that probing the multipartite entanglement of a relativistic quantum field non-perturbatively requires either different probe-based techniques or variants of the UDW model. Along the way we provide the regularity conditions for the $N$-emitter model to have well-defined ground states in the Fock space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a theory-informed reinforcement-learning framework that recasts the combinatorial assignment of final-state particles in hadron collider events as a Markov decision process. A transformer-based Deep Q-Network, rewarded at each step by the logarithmic change in the tree-level matrix element, learns to map final-state particles to partons. Because the reward derives solely from first-principles theory, the resulting policy is label-free and fully interpretable, allowing every reconstructed particle to be traced to a definite partonic origin. The method is validated on event reconstruction for $t\bar{t}$, $t\bar{t}W$, and $t\bar{t}t\bar{t}$ processes at the Large Hadron Collider. The method maintains robust performance across all processes, demonstrating its scaling with increasing combinatorial complexity. We demonstrate how this method can be used to build a theory-informed classifier for effective discrimination of longitudinal $W^{+}W^{-}$ pairs, and show that we can construct theory-informed anomaly-detection tools using background process matrix elements. Building on theoretical calculations, this method offers a transparent alternative to black-box classifiers. Being built on the matrix element, the classification and anomaly scores naturally respect all physical symmetries and are much less susceptible to the implicit biases common to other methods. Thus, it provides a framework for precision measurements, hypothesis testing, and anomaly searches at the High-Luminosity LHC.</description>

      <title>The equation of state and surface tension of QCD in the first order phase transition region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We build up a complete description of QCD phase structure by applying the parametrization of the chiral and deconfinement order parameters upon the calculations from functional QCD approaches. In particular in the first order phase transition region at high chemical potential, both the phase transition line using Maxwell construction and the coexistence boundary lines from the spinodal decompostion are determined. We compute the thermodynamic quantities including the number density, the energy density, the pressure and also the free energy for both stable and unstable phases of QCD. Additionally, after applying a phenomenological description of the inhomogeneity of the QCD free energy, we obtain the surface tension of the first order phase transition of QCD.</description>

      <title>Two-loop renormalization and running of galaxy bias</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We systematically extend the framework of galaxy bias renormalization to two-loop order. For the minimal complete basis of 29 deterministic bias operators up to fifth order in the density field and at leading order in gradient expansion we explicitly work out one- and two-loop renormalization. The latter is provided in terms of double-hard limits of bias kernels, which we find to depend on only one function of the ratio of the loop momenta. After including stochasticity in terms of composite operator renormalization, we apply the framework to the two-loop power spectrum of biased tracers and provide a simple result suitable for numerical evaluation. In addition, we work out one- and two-loop renormalization group equations (RGE) for deterministic bias coefficients related to bias operators constructed from a smoothed density field, generalizing previous works. We identify a linear combination of bias operators with enhanced UV sensitivity, related to a positive eigenvalue of the RGE. Finally, we present an analogy with the RGE as used in quantum field theory, suggesting that a resummation of large logarithms as employed in the latter may also yield useful applications in the study of large-scale galaxy bias.</description>

      <title>Exotic Dark Matter and the DESI Anomaly</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exotic dark matter (EDM) refers to a dark matter species whose equation of state deviates from zero at late times. This behavior enables it to model a variety of non-standard late-time cosmologies, offering alternatives to various dark energy (DE) models, especially when the DE sector violates the null energy condition. In this work, by fitting to CMB, BAO, and Supernovae (SNe) data and comparing models in a Bayesian approach, we show that simple models of exotic dark matter are statistically comparable to the $w_0w_a$CDM DE model in explaining the recent anomaly in the late-time cosmological evolution suggested by DESI and supernova observations, although in both classes of models the evidence against the $\Lambda$CDM model only appears when the DES-Y5 or Union3 SNe dataset is included. The value of $H_0$ remains similar to that in the DE model, except in the no-SNe case, where the DE model predicts lower values than $\Lambda$CDM, thereby worsening the Hubble tension, whereas the EDM models yield values closer to that of $\Lambda$CDM, albeit with larger uncertainty. In addition, the EDM models predict a drastically different energy budget for the present-day universe compared to the standard model, and provide an explanation for a coincident problem in the DE-model explanation of the DESI anomaly.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the impact of the anomalous magnetic moment (AMM) of Dirac fermions on the fermionic Casimir effect under magnetic fields. We formulate it as an extension of the well-known Lifshitz formula. From our formula, we find that the AMM increases the fermionic Casimir energy. In particular, when the AMM is large enough, the Casimir energy is significantly enhanced by the gapless behavior of the lowest Landau level. We also quantitatively estimate the Casimir energy from electron, muon, and constituent quark fields under magnetic fields and propose possible phenomena at finite temperature and fermion density.</description>

      <title>Symmetrizing relativistic three-body partial wave amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: S matrix principles and symmetries impose constraints on three-particle scattering amplitudes, which can be formulated as a class of integral equations for their partial wave projections. However, these amplitudes are typically expressed in an asymmetric basis, where one of the initial and final state particles is singled out, and all quantum numbers are defined relative to this spectator. In this work, we show how to construct symmetric partial wave amplitudes, which have been symmetrized over all possible spectator combinations, using their asymmetric counterparts and sets of recoupling coefficients. We derive these recoupling coefficients for arbitrary angular momentum and isospin for arbitrary systems of spinless particles with SU(2) flavor symmetry. We propose a simple intensity observable suitable for visualizing the structure of three-body dynamics in Dalitz distributions. Finally, we provide some numerical examples of Dalitz distributions relevant for future lattice QCD calculations of $3\pi$ systems and provide numerical evidence that the symmetrization procedure is consistent with expected symmetries of Dalitz plots.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define entropic marginally outer trapped surfaces (E-MOTSs) as a generalization of apparent horizons. We then show that, under first-order perturbations around a stationary black hole, the dynamical black hole entropy proposed by Hollands, Wald, and Zhang, defined on a background Killing horizon, can be expressed as the Wall entropy evaluated on an E-MOTS associated with it. Our result ensures that the Hollands-Wald-Zhang entropy reduces to the standard Wald entropy in each stationary regime of a dynamical black hole, thereby reinforcing the robustness of the dynamical entropy formulation.</description>

      <title>Do mixed states exhibit deep thermalisation?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The notion of $deep$ $thermalisation$, where ensembles of pure states on a local subsystem, conditioned on measurement outcomes on its complement, approach universal maximum-entropy ensembles constrained only by conservation laws, represents a stronger form of ergodicity than conventional thermalisation. We show that this framework fails dramatically for mixed initial states, evolved unitarily, even with infinitesimal initial mixedness. To address this, we introduce a new paradigm of deep thermalisation for mixed states, fundamentally distinct from that for pure-state ensembles. In our formulation, the deep thermal ensemble arises by tracing out auxiliary degrees of freedom from a maximum-entropy ensemble defined on an augmented system, with the ensemble structure depending explicitly on the entropy of the initial state. We demonstrate that such ensembles emerge dynamically in generic, locally interacting chaotic systems. For the self-dual kicked Ising chain, which we show to be exactly solvable for a class of mixed initial states, we find exact emergence of the so-defined mixed-state deep thermal ensemble at finite times. Our results therefore lead to fundamental insights into how maximum entropy principles and deep thermalisation manifest themselves in unitary dynamics of states with finite entropy.</description>

      <title>An AI-powered Technology Stack for Solving Many-Electron Field Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18840v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum field theory (QFT) for interacting many-electron systems is fundamental to condensed matter physics, yet achieving accurate solutions confronts computational challenges in managing the combinatorial complexity of Feynman diagrams, implementing systematic renormalization, and evaluating high-dimensional integrals. We present a unifying framework that integrates QFT computational workflows with an AI-powered technology stack. A cornerstone of this framework is representing Feynman diagrams as computational graphs, which structures the inherent mathematical complexity and facilitates the application of optimized algorithms developed for machine learning and high-performance computing. Consequently, automatic differentiation, native to these graph representations, delivers efficient, fully automated, high-order field-theoretic renormalization procedures. This graph-centric approach also enables sophisticated numerical integration; our neural-network-enhanced Monte Carlo method, accelerated via massively parallel GPU implementation, efficiently evaluates challenging high-dimensional diagrammatic integrals. Applying this framework to the uniform electron gas, we determine the quasiparticle effective mass to a precision significantly surpassing current state-of-the-art simulations. Our work demonstrates the transformative potential of integrating AI-driven computational advances with QFT, opening systematic pathways for solving complex quantum many-body problems across disciplines.</description>

Abstract: This note aims to offer a non-technical and self-contained introduction to gravitational algebras and their applications in the nonequilibrium physics of gravitational systems. We begin by presenting foundational concepts from operator algebra theory and exploring their relevance to perturbative quantum gravity. Additionally, we provide a brief overview of the theory of nonequilibrium dynamical systems in finite dimensions and discuss its generalization to gravitational algebras. Specifically, we focus on entropy production in black hole backgrounds and fluctuation theorems in de Sitter spacetime.</description>

Abstract: In arXiv:2306.17553 a new supersymmetric integrable QFT was constructed from the relativistic limit of the worlsdheet theory of AdS$_3 \times$ S$^3\times $T$^4$ superstrings with mixed Ramond-Ramond and Neveu-Schwarz-Neveu-Schwarz flux. The model is closely reminiscent of one previously considered by Fendley and Intriligator, though it enjoys twice as many supersymmetries. In this paper we study its finite-volume and finite-temperature properties. We formulate the string hypothesis for the Bethe--Yang equations, write down the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz equations, and simplify them in the form of a Y-system. We obtain three decoupled sectors associated with massive, massless-chiral and massless-antichiral particles, for which we compute the UV central charge. We illustrate the similarities and differences between this model and the one of Fendley and Intriligator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04886v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Verlinde and Zurek (VZ) have proposed that quantum gravity fluctuations in causal diamonds lead to observable effects. In particular, they argued that in quantum gravity causal diamonds have an uncertainty in their size that scales as $\delta L \sim \sqrt{\ell_p L}$, i.e. fluctuations are enhanced from the Planck scale. In this work, we explore the origin of the VZ scaling by studying scalar perturbations in inflationary cosmology. We reinterpret these cosmological perturbations as fluctuations of the modular Hamiltonian associated with a causal diamond, establishing a connection between modular fluctuations and observable primordial perturbations. Independent of assumptions about the modular Hamiltonian or the background spacetime, our results show that -- whenever an (effective) spherically symmetric perturbation is quantized -- it can lead to the VZ scaling. However, whether such a mode exists in the vacuum of any theory of quantum gravity remains an open question.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05900v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An important theoretical achievement of the last century was the realization that strict renormalizability can be a powerful criterion to select Lagrangians in the framework of perturbative quantum field theory. The Standard Model Lagrangian (without gravity) is strictly renormalizable from a perturbative point of view. On the other hand, the inclusion of gravity seems not to respect this criterion, since general relativity is perturbatively non-renormalizable. The aim of this work is to provide concrete evidence that strict renormalizability is still a valid criterion even when applied to gravity. First, we show that adding quadratic curvature terms to the Einstein-Hilbert action gives rise to a strictly renormalizable theory known as quadratic gravity. Second, we argue that this unique theory represents the most conservative approach to quantum gravity and, at the same time, is highly predictive, as it can explain new physics beyond general relativity already in the sub-Planckian regime. In particular, it provides one of the best fits to the CMB anisotropies via Starobinsky inflation and makes sharp cosmological predictions that can be tested in the near future. Finally, we comment on the (super-)Planckian regime and conclude with a historical note.</description>

      <title>Complete Minimal Form Factors for Irrelevant Deformations of Integrable Quantum Field Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20517v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a method to compute the minimal form factors of diagonal integrable field theories perturbed by generalized $T \bar{T}$ perturbations. Building on existing results by the same authors, these MFFs are constructed in such a way as not to allow for any free parameters, an issue that plagued previous solutions. The MFFs are derived from a generalization of the standard integral representation which has been used since the birth of the form factor bootstrap program. Their asymptotics is characterized by exponential decay at large rapidities. By computing higher particle form factors, we find that any natural higher-particle solutions involve the cancellation of parts of the newly found MFF. We conclude that the assumption that the form factor equations, particularly the kinematic residue equation, remain unchanged in the presence of $T \bar{T}$ perturbations, is too strong. There is a trade-off between having MFFs satisfying desirable analyticity and asymptotic properties and finding analytic solutions to the form factor equations, which is likely solved by nontrivial changes to the form factor equations, especially those where locality or semilocality of fields are essential assumptions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04165v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the transport coefficients of a strongly coupled plasma in the context of holographic QCD models based on Einstein-dilaton gravity that are compatible with linear confinement at zero temperature. At finite temperature, the holographic model is characterized by an asymptotically anti-de Sitter (AdS) black hole coupled to a scalar field, the dilaton, which is quadratic in the radial direction. The inclusion of the scalar field results in an explicit breaking of the conformal symmetry in the dual field theory. In such systems, the Hawking temperature of the black hole corresponds to the plasma temperature in the dual field theory. We confirm the existence of a minimum temperature $T_{\min}$, above which two distinct classes of black hole solutions emerge: one corresponding to large black holes and the other to small black holes. We calculate some thermodynamic quantities -- such as entropy, specific heat, and speed of sound -- and find results that are consistent with similar holographic models. We calculate the quasinormal modes (QNM) of the tensor and vector sectors using the pseudospectral method. In the hydrodynamic regime, we derive the dispersion relation for the vector sector, from which we extract the shear viscosity and the ratio $\eta/s=1/4 \pi$. The bulk viscosity is calculated using the Kubo formula in the scalar sector. Finally, our results for the speed of sound are compared with the Lattice QCD predictions, and our results for the bulk viscosity are compared with those reported by the JETSCAPE collaboration.</description>

      <title>Redundancy Channels in the Conformal Bootstrap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05338v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A method for obstructing symmetry enhancement in numerical conformal bootstrap calculations is proposed. Symmetry enhancement refers to situations where bootstrap studies initialised with a certain symmetry end up allowing theories with higher symmetry. In such cases, it is shown that redundant operators in the less symmetric theory can descend from primary scaling operators of the more symmetric one, motivating the imposition of spectral gaps that are justified in the former but not the latter. The same mechanism can also be used to differentiate between decoupled and fully coupled theories which otherwise have the same global symmetry. A systematic understanding of this mechanism is developed and applied to distinguish the cubic from the $O(3)$ model in three dimensions, where a strip of disallowed parameter space, referred to as the cubic redundancy channel, emerges once a gap associated with a redundant operator of the cubic theory is imposed. The channel corresponds precisely to the region of parameter space where the assumed cubic symmetry would be enhanced to $O(3)$.</description>

Abstract: Color multiplet structure of the gauge fields and fermions on mass shell in SU(N) Yang-Mills theory is considered according to representations of Weyl group W(SU(N)). An important case of singlet dynamical solutions corresponding to one-dimensional irreducible representations of the Weyl group is revised on a strict basis. We demonstrate that Weyl group as a finite color subgroup of SU(N) manifests a universal singlet structure of one-particle Weyl symmetric quark-gluon solutions. It has been shown that Abelian projected SU(N) Yang-Mills theory with fermions admits only one type of a singlet constituent quark dressed in a singlet gluon field.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of spin-spin correlators weighted by fermion number measurements with low rapidity threshold in the 2D Ising free-fermion QFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13093v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the work, we study the averaged number of massive fermions above a low rapidity threshold $Y$, underlying the form-factor expansions of the spin-spin two-point correlators at an Euclidean distance $r$, in the 2D Ising QFT at the free massive fermion point. Despite the on-shell freeness, the spin operators are still far away from being Gaussian, and create particles in the asymptotic states with complicated correlations. We show how the number observables can still be incorporated into the integrable Sinh-Gordon/Painleve-III framework and controlled by linear differential equations with two variables $(r,Y)$. We show how the differential equations and the information of two crucial scaling functions arising in the $r\rightarrow 0$, $e^{Y}r={\cal O}(1)$ scaling limit, can be combined to fully determine the small-$r$ asymptotics of the observables, in the $\lambda$-extended form. The scaling functions, on the other hand, are analyzed by summing the exponential form-factor expansions directly, generalizing the traditional Ising connecting computations. We show carefully, how the singularities cancel in the physical value limit $\lambda \pi \rightarrow 1$ and how the power-corrections that collapse at this value can be resummed. In particular, we show for the physical $\lambda$-value, the scaling functions are related to an integrated four-point function in the Ising CFT and continue to control the asymptotics of the number-observables in the scaling limit up to ${\cal O}(r^3)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.00550v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Analog Hawking radiation emitted by a perfectly reflecting mirror in (1+3)-dimensional flat spacetime is investigated. This is accomplished by studying the reflected frequency and momentum based on Einstein's mirror, instead of the canonical way of solving, if possible, wave equations subjected to a dynamical Dirichlet boundary condition. In the case of a finite-size mirror, diffraction pattern appears in the radiation spectrum. Based on the relevant parameters in the proposed Analog Black Hole Evaporation via Lasers experiment, in which the Hawking temperature $T_{H}\simeq 0.03$ eV and the mirror area $\mathcal{A}\simeq (50\;\mu\mathrm{m})^{2}$, the Hawking photon yield is estimated to be $N\simeq 16$/laser shot.</description>

      <title>Exact solution of a non-Hermitian $\mathscr{PT}$-symmetric Heisenberg spin chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.06004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.06004v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct the exact solution of a non-Hermitian $\mathscr{PT}$-symmetric isotropic Heisenberg spin chain with integrable boundary fields. We find that the system exhibits two types of phases we refer to as $A$ and $B$ phases. In the $B$ type phase, the $\mathscr{PT}$- symmetry remains unbroken and it consists of eigenstates with only real energies, whereas the $A$ type phase contains a $\mathscr{PT}$-symmetry broken sector comprised of eigenstates with only complex energies and a sector of unbroken $\mathscr{PT}$-symmetry with eigenstates of real energies. The $\mathscr{PT}$-symmetry broken sector consists of pairs of eigenstates whose energies are complex conjugates of each other. The existence of two sectors in the $A$ type phase is associated with the exponentially localized bound states at the edges with complex energies which are described by boundary strings. We find that both $A$ and $B$ type phases can be further divided into sub-phases which exhibit different ground states. We also compute the bound state wavefunction in one magnon sector and find that as the imaginary value of the boundary parameter is increased, the exponentially localized wavefunction broadens thereby protruding more into the bulk, which indicates that exponentially localized bound states may not be stabilized for large imaginary values of the boundary parameter.</description>

      <title>Bounding Entanglement Entropy with Clifford Double Cosets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19874v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Following on our previous work arXiv:2204.07593 and arXiv:2306.01043 studying the orbits of quantum states under Clifford circuits via `reachability graphs', we introduce `contracted graphs' whose vertices represent classes of quantum states with the same entropy vector. These contracted graphs represent the double cosets of the Clifford group, where the left cosets are built from the stabilizer subgroup of the starting state and the right cosets are built from the entropy-preserving operators. We study contracted graphs for stabilizer states, as well as W states and Dicke states, discussing how the diameter of a state's contracted graph constrains the `entropic diversity' of its $2$-qubit Clifford orbit. We derive an upper bound on the number of entropy vectors that can be generated using any $n$-qubit Clifford circuit, for any quantum state. We speculate on the holographic implications for the relative proximity of gravitational duals of states within the same Clifford orbit. Although we concentrate on how entropy evolves under the Clifford group, our double-coset formalism, and thus the contracted graph picture, is extendable to generic gate sets and generic state properties.</description>

      <title>Constraining scalars of $16_H$ through proton decays in non-renormalisable $SO(10)$ models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14331v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-renormalisable versions of $SO(10)$\, based on irreducible representations with lesser degrees of freedom, are free of running into the catastrophe of non-perturbativity of standard model gauge couplings in contrast to the renormalisable versions having tensors with many degrees of freedom. $16_H$ is the smallest representation, participates in Yukawa Lagrangian at the non-renormalisable level, contributing to the charged and neutral fermion masses, and has six distinct scalars with different $B-L$ charges. We computed the leptoquark and diquark couplings of different pairs of scalars stemming from all possible decomposition of the term resulting from the coupling of $16_{H}$ with the ${\mathbf{16}}$ dimensional fermion multiplet of $SO(10)$,\, i.e. $\frac{{\mathbf{16}}\,{\mathbf{16}}\,16_{H}\,16_{H}}{\Lambda}$. Computing the tree and loop level contribution of different pairs to the effective dimension six, $B-L$ conserving operators, it turns out only three pairs, viz $\sigma\big(1,1,0\big)- T\big(3,1,\frac{1}{3}\big)$, and $H\big(1,2,-\frac{1}{2}\big)-\Delta\big(3,2,\frac{1}{6}\big)$, and $H-T$ can induce proton decay at tree level. Assuming that the Yukawa couplings of the $16_{H}$ are comparable to those of the $\overline{126}_{H}$ of a realistic $SO(10)$ model and setting the cutoff scale to the Planck scale typically constrains the $B-L$ breaking scale to be $4\sim 5$ orders of magnitude less than the cutoff scale $(\Lambda)$. Moreover, analysing the branching pattern of the leading two-body decay modes of the proton, we observed a preference for the proton to decay into second-generation mesons due to the hierarchical nature of Yukawa couplings. In a realistic $SO(10)$\, scenario, we find that $M_T &gt;10^{8}$ TeV, while $M_\Delta$ could be as light as a few TeV$s$.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the scattering of gravitino wave in a Schwarzschild spacetime, focusing on the long-wavelength limit. Using perturbative techniques, we compute the differential scattering cross section through the simulating wave function method. Our work demonstrates that the spin-dependence of the gravitino scattering cross section aligns with known behaviors for the scalar, neutrino, and electromagnetic waves.</description>

      <title>Kondo overscreening in the presence of superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01924v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a model describing a system where the superconductivity competes with the overscreened Kondo effect. The model consists of a single spin$-\frac{1}{2}$ quantum impurity at the edge of a quantum wire where spin$-1$ bulk fermions interact attractively, generating a (superconducting) mass gap. The competition between the Kondo screening and the superconductivity leads to a rich phase structure. We find that for strong Kondo coupling, there is a regime of phase space where the Kondo phase is stable with the impurity \textit{overscreened} by a multiparticle Kondo effect, and a Kondo scale is dynamically generated. When the bulk and boundary interaction strength are comparable, we find that a midgap state appears in the spectrum and screens the impurity, while in the ground state, the impurity is unscreened. This midgap state is akin to the Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) states that exist in the entire phase space in the BCS superconductor. Moreover, when the bulk superconducting interaction strength is stronger than the boundary Kondo interaction strength, the impurity can no longer be screened. Further, between the Kondo and YSR phases, we find a novel phase where, while the Kondo cloud overscreens the impurity, a boundary excitation exists that has vanishing energy in the thermodynamic limit. Similar phase diagrams that result from competition between different mechanisms were found for other models, too: the dissipative Kondo system, where dissipation competes with screening; the Kondo impurity coupled to spin-1/2 attractively interacting fermions where condensation competes with screening; and the XXX-Kondo model, where the lattice cutoff and the bulk spin interaction compete with screening.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09630v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Chern-Simons gravitational term is typically coupled to the inflaton field during inflation. However, this setup leads to ghost instabilities in the tensor sector, which severely constrain observable signatures of parity violation in cosmological correlators. In this work, we explore an alternative scenario where the Chern-Simons term is minimally coupled to an isocurvature field, $\sigma$, within a multi-field inflationary framework. Notably, this configuration leaves the quadratic action for tensor perturbations unaffected, thereby avoiding ghost instabilities. We analyze the resulting phenomenology and show that the model allows for parity-violating signatures and distinctive features in the primordial scalar-tensor bispectra, while remaining theoretically consistent and observationally viable.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of monitored SSH Model in Krylov Space: From Complexity to Quantum Fisher Information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03434v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the dynamics of a non-Hermitian SSH model that arises out of the no-click limit of a monitored SSH model in the Krylov space. We find that the saturation timescale of the complexity associated with the spread of the state in the Krylov subspace increases with the measurement rate, and late time behaviour differs across the $\mathrm{PT}$ symmetry transition point. Furthermore, extending the notion of this complexity for subsystems in Krylov space, we find that the scaling of its late time value with subsystem size shows a discontinuous jump across the $\mathrm{PT}$ transition point, indicating that it can be used as a suitable order parameter for such transition but not for the measurement-induced transition. Finally, we show that a generalized measure in the Krylov subspace, which contains information about the correlation landscape, such as Quantum Fisher information, which also possesses some structural similarity with the complexity functional, can be a promising probe of the measurement-induced phase.</description>

      <title>Testing the dark origin of neutrino masses with oscillation experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08439v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The origin of neutrino masses remains unknown to date. One popular idea involves interactions between neutrinos and ultralight dark matter, described as fields or particles with masses $m_\phi \ll 10\,\mathrm{eV}$. Due to the large phase-space number density, this type of dark matter exists in coherent states and can be effectively described by an oscillating classical field. As a result, neutrino mass-squared differences undergo field-induced interference in spacetime, potentially generating detectable effects in oscillation experiments. We demonstrate that if $m_\phi\gg 10^{-14}\,\mathrm{eV}$, the mechanism becomes sensitive to dark matter density fluctuations, which suppresses the oscillatory behavior of flavor-changing probabilities as a function of neutrino propagation distance in a model-independent way, thereby ruling out this regime. Furthermore, by analyzing data from the Kamioka Liquid Scintillator Antineutrino Detector (KamLAND), a benchmark long-baseline reactor experiment, we show that the hypothesis of a dark origin for the neutrino masses is disfavored for $m_\phi \ll 10^{-14}\,\mathrm{eV}$, compared to the case of constant mass values in vacuum. This result holds at more than the 4$\sigma$ level across different datasets and parameter choices. The mass range $10^{-17}\,\mathrm{eV} \lesssim m_\phi \lesssim 10^{-14}\,\mathrm{eV}$ can be further tested in current and future oscillation experiments by searching for time variations (rather than periodicity) in oscillation parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19688v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the impact of thermal effects on gravity-induced entanglement (GIE) in a system of quantum harmonic oscillators interacting with classical linearly polarized gravitational waves (GWs). Specifically, we model the endpoints of interferometer arms in LIGO-like detectors as two-dimensional oscillators. Following the thermofield dynamics (TFD) approach, our analysis reveals that while thermal effects alone do not generate entanglement between independent oscillator modes, they serve as a catalyst, modifying the dynamical imprint of GWs. Notably, we identify a mixing of Bose-Einstein and Maxwell-Boltzmann distributions driven by thermal influences, which affects the statistical behavior of the quantum subsystem. Furthermore, gravitational interactions induce a quantum memory effect, leading to emergent periodic behavior in the reduced subsystem. This suggests a novel gravitationally induced breaking of time-translation symmetry, reminiscent of a prethermal time crystal (PTC). Our findings indicate that such effects could provide new theoretical insights into classical gravitational wave interactions.</description>

      <title>Harvesting Fermionic Field Entanglement in Schwarzschild Spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06887v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore entanglement harvesting using two Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) detectors linearly coupled to the scalar density of a massless spin-1/2 field in 1+1 Schwarzschild spacetime. We consider different vacua, including the Boulware, Hartle-Hawking-Israel (HHI), and Unruh vacua, and investigate various configurations of detector trajectories. We find that the transition rate of the static UDW detector exhibits the expected Planckian behavior in the HHI state, while the Unruh state leads to the Helmholtz free energy density of a fermionic thermal bath. We demonstrate that the near-horizon entanglement properties for static detectors in the HHI state have similar behaviour to those in Minkowski vacua for uniformly accelerated detectors in Rindler spacetime. We further consider a different interaction Hamiltonian which breaks local Lorentz symmetry and find that the transition rate of the static detector still exhibits Planckian behavior in the HHI state, while in the Unruh state, it leads to the Helmholtz free energy density of a bosonic or fermionic thermal bath corresponding to the static or conformal 2-bein in interaction, respectively. We observe that the anti-Hawking effect enhances the entanglement between the two detectors while the gravitational redshift and Hawking radiation decrease it. In particular, due to the presence of the anti-Hawking effect, the mutual information and concurrence near the event horizon can be non-zero even for static detectors with static 2-bein, which is in contrast with the case of the scalar field. Conclusions are discussed.</description>

      <title>Primordial black holes from a curvaton: the role of bimodal distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09548v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the formation of primordial black holes in curvaton models of inflation, where the curvature perturbation is not only generated by the inflaton but also by a light scalar field (the curvaton) that decays after inflation. During inflation, both fields are subject to quantum diffusion, owing to small-scale vacuum fluctuations crossing out the Hubble radius. After inflation, whether the curvaton dominates the universe or not depends on its field value when inflation ends. Since that value is stochastic, different regions of the universe undergo different post-inflationary histories. In practice, we show that this results in a double-peaked distribution for the number of e-folds realised in these models. Since that number of e-folds is related to the curvature perturbation by the delta-N formalism, the presence of a second peak has important consequences for primordial black holes that we discuss.</description>

      <title>FRG analysis for a relativistic BEC in arbitrary spatial dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17668v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A relativistic Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) is studied within the complex scalar field theory using the functional renormalization group (FRG) under the local potential approximation. We investigate fluctuation effects on the relativistic BEC through numerical analyses for various spatial dimensions and chemical potentials. Our numerical results are consistent with the Mermin-Wagner theorem, and this consistency is also analytically confirmed from the flow equation. We also discuss a numerical instability of the FRG in lower spatial dimensions, which is evadable for certain parameter choices.</description>

      <title>About electroweak domain walls in Majoron models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02910v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Some time ago it was claimed in "Spontaneous Breaking of Lepton Number and Cosmological Domain Wall Problem" (Phys. Rev. Lett. 122, 151301 (2019)) that non perturbative instantons of the weak interaction $\text{SU}(2)_\text{W}$ lead to the formation of domain walls in Majoron models owing to the anomaly of the spontaneously broken global lepton number $L$ symmetry $\text{U}(1)_L$ with respect to $\text{SU}(2)_\text{W}$. We point out that it has long been known, that this effect can be completely rotated away unless there is a source of explicit $B+L$ breaking present, where $B$ denotes baryon number. We further estimate the tiny instanton induced Majoron mass from $B+L$ breaking and analyze the cosmological impact of such domain walls including possible finite temperature effects. In general this scenario does not lead to a cosmological catastrophe.</description>

      <title>Prospects for probing dark matter particles and primordial black holes with the Square Kilometre Array using the 21 cm power spectrum at cosmic dawn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02651v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Probing the nature of dark matter (DM) remains an outstanding problem in modern cosmology. The 21 cm signal, as a sensitive tracer of neutral hydrogen during cosmic dawn, provides a unique means to investigate DM nature during this critical epoch. Annihilation and decay of DM particles, as well as Hawking radiation of primordial black holes (PBHs), can modify the thermal and ionization histories of the early universe, leaving distinctive imprints on the 21 cm power spectrum. Therefore, the redshifted 21 cm power spectrum serves as a powerful tool to investigate such DM processes. In this work, we systematically assess the potential of the upcoming Square Kilometre Array (SKA) to constrain DM and PBH parameters using the 21 cm power spectrum. Assuming $10,000$ hours of integration time, the SKA is projected to reach sensitivities of $\langle\sigma v\rangle \leq 10^{-28}\,{\rm cm}^{3}\,{\rm s}^{-1}$ and $\tau\geq 10^{28}\,{\rm seconds}$, for $10\,{\rm GeV}$ DM particles. It can also probe PBHs with masses of $10^{16}\,\mathrm{g}$ and abundances $f_{\mathrm{PBH}} \leq 10^{-6}$. These results indicate that the SKA could place constraints on DM annihilation, decay, and PBH Hawking radiation that are up to two to three orders of magnitude stronger than current limits. Furthermore, the SKA is expected to exceed existing bounds on sub-GeV DM and to probe Hawking radiation from PBHs with masses above $10^{17}\,{\rm g}$, which are otherwise inaccessible by conventional cosmological probes. Overall, the SKA holds great promise for advancing our understanding of both DM particles and PBHs, potentially offering new insights into the fundamental nature of DM.</description>

      <title>Cornering Natural SUSY at a Tera-$Z$ Factory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03073v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The future circular $e^+ e^-$ collider (FCC-ee) stands out as the next flagship project in particle physics, dedicated to uncovering the microscopic origin of the Higgs boson. In this context, we assess indirect probes of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM), a well-established benchmark hypothesis, exploring the complementarity between Higgs measurements and electroweak precision tests at the $Z$-pole. We study three key sectors: the heavy Higgs doublet, scalar top partners, and light gauginos and higgsinos, focusing on the parameter space favored by naturalness. Remarkably, the Tera-$Z$ program consistently offers significantly greater indirect sensitivity than the Mega-$h$ run. While promising, these prospects hinge on reducing SM uncertainties. Accordingly, we highlight key precision observables for targeted theoretical work.</description>

      <title>Dark Walker in the Early Universe: A Strongly Coupled Sector Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06454v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the phenomenology of the ``Dark Walker'' -- an $\text{SU}(3)$ theory with eight flavors of massless fundamental fermions in the dark sector. During inflation, its walking dynamics generate primordial non-Gaussianities through the exchange of unparticles, while accounting for the current dark matter relic abundance if the resulting massive pseudoscalars behave as strongly interacting massive particles (SIMPs). This provides a simple yet concrete example of a strongly coupled sector during inflation.</description>

      <title>Penrose process in magnetized non-Kerr rotating spacetime with anomalous quadrupole moment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08401v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the magnetic Penrose process in the Quevedo-Mashhoon spacetime, immersed in a uniform magnetic field $B$. This metric is a stationary, axisymmetric, asymptotically flat vacuum solution to Einstein's equations with an arbitrary anomalous quadrupole moment ${\cal Q}$. A non-vanishing ${\cal Q}$ significantly modifies the near-horizon geometry, creating a multi-lobe ergoregion. Both ${\cal Q}$ and $B$ strongly influence the negative-energy region, which can extend well beyond the ergoregion, enabling the magnetic Penrose process to operate far from the ergoregion. Their combined effects allow energy extraction efficiency $\eta$ to far exceed that of the mechanical Penrose process. The maximum efficiency undergoes three distinct evolutionary stages as ${\cal Q}$ varies. In the absence of the magnetic field, efficiency is optimized for more negative ${\cal Q}$ (yielding a more oblate spacetime than Kerr). When electromagnetic interactions dominate, efficiency peaks when the infalling fragment's charge and $B$ share the same sign and ${\cal Q}$ is more positive (producing a more prolate spacetime than Kerr). These findings support the magnetic Penrose process as a theoretical framework for high-energy cosmic phenomena (e.g., extragalactic high-energy radiation) and as a tool to test the Kerr hypothesis.</description>
