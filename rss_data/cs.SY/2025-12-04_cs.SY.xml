      <title>Time-Invariant Polytopic and Interval Observers for Uncertain Linear Systems via Non-Square Transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents novel polytopic and interval observer designs for uncertain linear continuous-time (CT) and discrete-time (DT) systems subjected to bounded disturbances and noise. Our approach guarantees enclosure of the true state and input-to-state stability (ISS) of the polytopic and interval set estimates. Notably, our approach applies to all detectable systems that are stabilized by any optimal observer design, utilizing a potentially non-square (lifted) time-invariant coordinate transformation based on polyhedral Lyapunov functions and mixed-monotone embedding systems that do not impose any positivity constraints, enabling feasible and optimal observer designs, even in cases where previous methods fail. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated through several examples of uncertain linear CT and DT systems.</description>

      <title>Variable-Impedance Muscle Coordination under Slow-Rate Control Frequencies and Limited Observation Conditions Evaluated through Legged Locomotion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human motor control remains agile and robust despite limited sensory information for feedback, a property attributed to the body's ability to perform morphological computation through muscle coordination with variable impedance. However, it remains unclear how such low-level mechanical computation reduces the control requirements of the high-level controller. In this study, we implement a hierarchical controller consisting of a high-level neural network trained by reinforcement learning and a low-level variable-impedance muscle coor dination model with mono- and biarticular muscles in monoped locomotion task. We systematically restrict the high-level controller by varying the control frequency and by introducing biologically inspired observation conditions: delayed, partial, and substituted observation. Under these conditions, we evaluate how the low-level variable-impedance muscle coordination contributes to learning process of high-level neural network. The results show that variable-impedance muscle coordination enables stable locomotion even under slow-rate control frequency and limited observation conditions. These findings demonstrate that the morphological computation of muscle coordination effectively offloads high-frequency feedback of the high-level controller and provide a design principle for the controller in motor control.</description>

      <title>Resilient AFE Drive Control using Neural Networks with Tracking Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Industrial installations across several sectors have seen a dramatic increase in productivity, accuracy and efficiency over the last decade due to expanded utilization of medium voltage, variable speed power electronic converters to drive their processes. Specifically, active front-end (AFE) drives have become popular due to their ability to deliver power while maintaining safe electrical setpoints. However, under abnormal grid conditions such as phase loss, conventional AFE control may fail to enforce safety constraints, potentially leading to drive shutdown and significant financial losses. In this work, we propose using reference-tracking Performance Boosting (rPB) to improve the resilience of standard AFE control to faults. This neural-network control framework provides a principled way to optimize transient performance while preserving the steady-state tracking properties of AFE-based drives. By carefully shaping the input signals to the rPB controller, we ensure that it activates only during grid faults, leaving nominal operation unaffected. Simulation results show that the proposed approach successfully maintains the DC bus voltage and the grid current within safe limits during single-phase loss events.</description>

      <title>Physics-Based Communication Compression via Lyapunov-Weighted Event-Triggered Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Event-Triggered Control (ETC) reduces communication overhead in networked systems by transmitting only when stability requires it. Conventional mechanisms use isotropic error thresholds ($\|e\| \le \sigma \|x\|$), treating all directions equally. This ignores stability geometry and triggers conservatively. We propose a static directional triggering mechanism that exploits this asymmetry. By weighting errors via the Lyapunov matrix $P$, we define an anisotropic half-space scaling with instantaneous energy margins: larger deviations tolerated along stable modes, strict bounds where instability threatens. We prove global asymptotic stability and exclusion of Zeno behavior. Monte Carlo simulations ($N=100$) show 43.6\% fewer events than optimally tuned isotropic methods while achieving $2.1\times$ better control performance than time-varying alternatives. The mechanism functions as a runtime safety gate for learning-based controllers operating under communication constraints.</description>

      <title>A Perception-feedback position-tracking control for quadrotors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper a position-tracking controller for quadrotors based on perception feedback is developed, which directly uses measurements from onboard sensors such as low cost IMUs and GPS to generate the control commands without state estimation. Bias in gyros sensors are corrected to enhance the tracking performance. Practical stability of the origin of the tracking error system in the presence of external disturbances is proved using the Lyapunov analysis, which turns out to exponential stability in the absence of external disturbances. Numerical simulations are included to illustrate the proposed control scheme and to verify the robustness of the proposed controller under noisy measurements and parameter uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Covariance Control for a class of Stochastic Discrete-time Linear Systems using the S-Variable Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper deals with the problem of covariance control for a class of linear stochastic discrete-time systems in the Stochastic Model Predictive Control (SMPC) framework. The considered systems are affected by independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) additive and parametric stochastic uncertainties (potentially unbounded), in addition to polytopic deterministic uncertainties bounding the mean of the state and input parameters. The control design conditions presented in this paper are formulated as Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs), using the S-variable approach in order to reduce the potential conservatism. These conditions are derived using a deterministic exact characterization of the covariance dynamics, the latter involves bilinear terms in the control gain. A technique to linearize such dynamics is presented, it results in a descriptor representation allowing to derive sufficient conditions for covariance control design. The derived condition is firstly compared to a known necessary and sufficient stability condition for systems without deterministic uncertainties and additive stochastic noise, although more conservative, it turns out to be more numerically tractable. Then, the same condition is used to design controllers that are robust to both deterministic and stochastic uncertainties. Several numerical examples are presented for comparison and illustration.</description>

      <title>Output-Constrained Controller with Fuzzy-Tuned Parameters for Overhead Cranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study proposes a fuzzy-adjusted nonlinear control method based on torque jitter output limit constraints for overhead crane systems with double pendulum effects. The proposed control method can effectively suppress swing and achieve precise positioning. Firstly, by enhancing the coupling relationship between the trolley displacement and swing angle, a composite signal with an error term was designed. Then, an energy-based Lyapunov function was constructed using the composite error signal, which incorporated a new formulation of the inertia matrix and potential energy function. Subsequently, using the backstepping method in conjunction with the hyperbolic tangent function, a controller with partial performance constraints was designed. In addition, to further enhance the system's dynamic performance, a fuzzy control scheme with online adjustable system parameters was designed. Finally, the stability of the system is proven using Lyapunov theory combined with LaSalle's invariance principle. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed controller exhibits superior performance and robustness.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Sequential Convex Programming Framework for Unbalanced Three-Phase AC OPF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a hybrid Sequential Convex Programming (SCP) framework for solving the unbalanced three-phase AC Optimal Power Flow (OPF) problem. The method combines a fixed McCormick outer approximation of bilinear voltage-current terms, first-order Taylor linearisations, and an adaptive trust-region constraint to preserve feasibility and promote convergence. The resulting formulation remains convex at each iteration and ensures convergence to a stationary point that satisfies the first-order Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions of the nonlinear OPF. Case studies on standard IEEE feeders and a real low-voltage (LV) network in Cyprus demonstrate high numerical accuracy with optimality gap below 0.1% and up to 2x faster runtimes compared to IPOPT. These results confirm that the method is accurate and computationally efficient for large-scale unbalanced distribution networks.</description>

      <title>Sample-Efficient Model-Free Policy Gradient Methods for Stochastic LQR via Robust Linear Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Policy gradient algorithms are widely used in reinforcement learning and belong to the class of approximate dynamic programming methods. This paper studies two key policy gradient algorithms - the Natural Policy Gradient and the Gauss-Newton Method - for solving the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) problem in unknown stochastic linear systems. The main challenge lies in obtaining an unbiased gradient estimate from noisy data due to errors-in-variables in linear regression. This issue is addressed by employing a primal-dual estimation procedure. Using this novel gradient estimation scheme, the paper establishes convergence guarantees with a sample complexity of order O(1/epsilon). Theoretical results are further supported by numerical experiments, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.</description>

      <title>CaFTRA: Frequency-Domain Correlation-Aware Feedback-Free MIMO Transmission and Resource Allocation for 6G and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03767v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fundamental design of wireless systems toward AI-native 6G and beyond is driven by the need for ever-increasing demand of mobile data traffic, extreme spectral efficiency, and adaptability across diverse service scenarios. To overcome the limitations posed by feedback-based multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) transmission, we propose a novel frequency-domain Correlation-aware Feedback-free MIMO Transmission and Resource Allocation (CaFTRA) framework tailored for fully-decoupled radio access networks (FD-RAN) to meet the emerging requirements of AI-Native 6G and beyond. By leveraging artificial intelligence (AI), CaFTRA effectively eliminates real-time uplink feedback by predicting channel state information (CSI) based solely on user geolocation. We introduce a Learnable Queries-driven Transformer Network for CSI mapping from user geolocation, which utilizes multi-head attention and learnable query embeddings to accurately capture frequency-domain correlations among resource blocks (RBs), thereby significantly improving the precision of CSI prediction. Once base stations (BSs) adopt feedback-free transmission, their downlink transmission coverage can be significantly expanded due to the elimination of frequent uplink feedback. To enable efficient resource scheduling under such extensive-coverage scenarios, we apply a low-complexity many-to-one matching theory-based algorithm for efficient multi-BS association and multi-RB resource allocation, which is proven to converge to a stable matching within limited iterations. Simulation results demonstrate that CaFTRA achieves stable matching convergence and significant gains in spectral efficiency and user fairness compared to 5G, underscoring its potential value for 6G standardization efforts.</description>

      <title>Exact and Parametric Dynamical System Representation of Nonlinear Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parametric representations of various functions are fundamental tools in science and engineering. This paper introduces a fixed-initial-state constant-input dynamical system (FISCIDS) representation, which provides an exact and parametric model for a broad class of nonlinear functions. A FISCIDS representation of a given nonlinear function consists of an input-affine dynamical system with a fixed initial state and constant input. The argument of the function is applied as the constant input to the input-affine system, and the value of the function is the output of the input-affine system at a fixed terminal time. We show that any differentially algebraic function has a quadratic FISCIDS representation. We also show that there exists an analytic function that is not differentially algebraic but has a quadratic FISCIDS representation. Therefore, most functions in practical problems in science and engineering can be represented by a quadratic FISCIDS representation.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning for UAV-Assisted 5G Network Slicing: A Comparative Study of MAPPO, MADDPG, and MADQN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing demand for robust, scalable wireless networks in the 5G-and-beyond era has led to the deployment of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) as mobile base stations to enhance coverage in dense urban and underserved rural areas. This paper presents a Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL) framework that integrates Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO), Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG), and Multi-Agent Deep Q-Networks (MADQN) to jointly optimize UAV positioning, resource allocation, Quality of Service (QoS), and energy efficiency through 5G network slicing. The framework adopts Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE), enabling autonomous real-time decision-making while preserving global coordination. Users are prioritized into Premium (A), Silver (B), and Bronze (C) slices with distinct QoS requirements. Experiments in realistic urban and rural scenarios show that MAPPO achieves the best overall QoS-energy tradeoff, especially in interference-rich environments; MADDPG offers more precise continuous control and can attain slightly higher SINR in open rural settings at the cost of increased energy usage; and MADQN provides a computationally efficient baseline for discretized action spaces. These findings demonstrate that no single MARL algorithm is universally dominant; instead, algorithm suitability depends on environmental topology, user density, and service requirements. The proposed framework highlights the potential of MARL-driven UAV systems to enhance scalability, reliability, and differentiated QoS delivery in next-generation wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Fault-Tolerant Control of Steam Temperature in HRSG Superheater under Actuator Fault Using a Sliding Mode Observer and PINN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel fault-tolerant control framework for steam temperature regulation in Heat Recovery Steam Generators (HRSGs) subject to actuator faults. Addressing the critical challenge of valve degradation in superheater spray attemperators, we propose a synergistic architecture comprising three components: (1) a Sliding Mode Observer (SMO) for estimation of unmeasured thermal states, (2) a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) for estimating multiplicative actuator faults using physical laws as constraints, and (3) a one-sided Sliding Mode Controller (SMC) that adapts to the estimated faults while minimizing excessive actuation.
  The key innovation lies in the framework of closed-loop physics-awareness, where the PINN continuously informs both the observer and controller about fault severity while preserving thermodynamic consistency.
  Rigorous uniform ultimate boundedness (UUB) is established via Lyapunov analysis under practical assumptions. Validated on real HRSG operational data, the framework demonstrates effective fault adaptation, reduced temperature overshoot, and maintains steam temperature within 1{\deg}C of the setpoint under valve effectiveness loss.
  This work bridges control theory and physics-guided machine learning to deliver a practically deployable solution for power plant resilience, with extensions applicable to thermal systems subject to multiplicative faults.</description>

      <title>An Information Theory of Finite Abstractions and their Fundamental Scalability Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03977v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finite abstractions are discrete approximations of dynamical systems, such that the set of abstraction trajectories contains, in a formal sense, all system trajectories. There is a consensus that abstractions suffer from the curse of dimensionality: for the same ``accuracy" (how closely the abstraction represents the system), the abstraction size scales poorly with system dimensions. And, yet, after decades of research on abstractions, there are no formal results concerning their accuracy-size tradeoff. In this work, we derive a statistical, quantitative theory of abstractions' accuracy-size tradeoff and uncover fundamental limits on their scalability, through rate-distortion theory -- the branch of information theory studying lossy compression. Abstractions are viewed as encoder-decoder pairs, encoding trajectories of dynamical systems in a higher-dimensional ambient space. Rate represents abstraction size, while distortion describes abstraction accuracy, defined as the spatial average deviation between abstract trajectories and system ones. We obtain a fundamental lower bound on the minimum abstraction distortion, given the system dynamics and a threshold on abstraction size. The bound depends on the complexity of the dynamics, through generalized entropy. We demonstrate the bound's tightness on certain dynamical systems. Finally, we showcase how the developed theory can be employed to construct optimal abstractions, in terms of the size-accuracy tradeoff, through an example on a chaotic system.</description>

      <title>Applied Neural Network-Based Active Control for Vortex-Induced Vibrations Suppression in a Two-Degree-of-Freedom Cylinder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vortex-Induced Vibrations (VIVs) of cylindrical structures present significant challenges in various engineering applications, including marine risers, tall buildings, and renewable energy systems. Hence, it is vital to control Vortex-Induced Vibrations of cylindrical structures. For this purpose, in this study a novel approach is introduced to VIV control, based on a model-based active control strategy integrated with a Neural Network (NN) in the presence of uncertainty modeling. The proposed method utilizes a closed-loop control system, where feedback from the system's dynamic state is used to generate adaptive control commands, enabling the system to respond to changing flow conditions and nonlinearities. Then, the controllability analysis is conducted to assess the efficiency of the control strategy in mitigating VIV. Two control approaches are implemented: simple learning and composite learning. Both strategies significantly enhance vibration suppression, achieving up to 99% reduction in vibrations despite uncertainties in the system. The results demonstrate the potential of the proposed method to enhance the efficiency, stability, and lifespan of structures subject to VIV.</description>

Abstract: Encrypted control has been extensively studied to ensure the confidentiality of system states and control inputs for networked control systems. This paper presents a computationally efficient encrypted control framework for networked systems enabled by quantum communication. A quantum channel between sensors and actuators is used to generate identical secret keys, whose security is further enhanced through quantum key distribution. These keys enable lightweight encryption and decryption while preserving confidentiality and control accuracy. We develop a novel encryption-decryption architecture for state-feedback control of linear systems based on quantum keys, and characterize the impact of quantum state errors on closed-loop stability. In particular, we establish the existence of a critical threshold on intrinsic quantum noise below which stability is guaranteed. In contrast to classical encrypted control schemes, which may collapse under a single key-bit error, the proposed quantum encrypted control exhibits strong robustness to key imperfections. We further adopt quantization techniques to address the scenarios with limited communication bits in practical situations, and implement privacy protection for quantum keys based on a stochastic quantizer. These results demonstrate that integrating quantum technologies into control systems in a nontrivial and principled manner, even at their current level of maturity, can yield substantial performance gains in reducing computational complexity and improving resilience to key errors while ensuring security against multiple eavesdropping sources.</description>

      <title>PerFACT: Motion Policy with LLM-Powered Dataset Synthesis and Fusion Action-Chunking Transformers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning methods have significantly enhanced motion planning for robotic manipulators by leveraging prior experiences within planning datasets. However, state-of-the-art neural motion planners are primarily trained on small datasets collected in manually generated workspaces, limiting their generalizability to out-of-distribution scenarios. Additionally, these planners often rely on monolithic network architectures that struggle to encode critical planning information. To address these challenges, we introduce Motion Policy with Dataset Synthesis powered by large language models (LLMs) and Fusion Action-Chunking Transformers (PerFACT), which incorporates two key components. Firstly, a novel LLM-powered workspace generation method, MotionGeneralizer, enables large-scale planning data collection by producing a diverse set of semantically feasible workspaces. Secondly, we introduce Fusion Motion Policy Networks (MpiNetsFusion), a generalist neural motion planner that uses a fusion action-chunking transformer to better encode planning signals and attend to multiple feature modalities. Leveraging MotionGeneralizer, we collect 3.5M trajectories to train and evaluate MpiNetsFusion against state-of-the-art planners, which shows that the proposed MpiNetsFusion can plan several times faster on the evaluated tasks.</description>

      <title>Left shifting analysis of Human-Autonomous Team interactions to analyse risks of autonomy in high-stakes AI systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developing high-stakes autonomous systems that include Artificial Intelligence (AI) components is complex; the consequences of errors can be catastrophic, yet it is challenging to plan for all operational cases. In stressful scenarios for the human operator, such as short decision-making timescales, the risk of failures is exacerbated. A lack of understanding of AI failure modes obstructs this and so blocks the robust implementation of applications of AI in smart systems. This prevents early risk identification, leading to increased time, risk and cost of projects.
  A key tenet of Systems Engineering and acquisition engineering is centred around a "left-shift" in test and evaluation activities to earlier in the system lifecycle, to allow for "accelerated delivery of [systems] that work". We argue it is therefore essential that this shift includes the analysis of AI failure cases as part of the design stages of the system life cycle. Our proposed framework enables the early characterisation of risks emerging from human-autonomy teaming (HAT) in operational contexts. The cornerstone of this is a new analysis of AI failure modes, built on the seminal modelling of human-autonomy teams laid out by LaMonica et al., 2022. Using the analysis of the interactions between human and autonomous systems and exploring the failure modes within each aspect, our approach provides a way to systematically identify human-AI interactions risks across the operational domain of the system of interest. The understanding of the emergent behaviour enables increased robustness of the system, for which the analysis should be undertaken over the whole scope of its operational design domain. This approach is illustrated through an example use case for an AI assistant supporting a Command &amp; Control (C2) System.</description>

      <title>Market share maximizing strategies of CAV fleet operators may cause chaos in our cities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics and equilibria of a new kind of routing games, where players - drivers of future autonomous vehicles - may switch between individual (HDV) and collective (CAV) routing. In individual routing, just like today, drivers select routes minimizing expected travel costs, whereas in collective routing an operator centrally assigns vehicles to routes. The utility is then the average experienced travel time discounted with individually perceived attractiveness of automated driving. The market share maximising strategy amounts to offering utility greater than for individual routing to as many drivers as possible. Our theoretical contribution consists in developing a rigorous mathematical framework of individualized collective routing and studying algorithms which fleets of CAVs may use for their market-share optimization. We also define bi-level CAV - HDV equilibria and derive conditions which link the potential marketing behaviour of CAVs to the behavioural profile of the human population. Practically, we find that the fleet operator may often be able to equilibrate at full market share by simply mimicking the choices HDVs would make. In more realistic heterogenous human population settings, however, we discover that the market-share maximizing fleet controller should use highly variable mixed strategies as a means to attract or retain customers. The reason is that in mixed routing the powerful group player can control which vehicles are routed via congested and uncongested alternatives. The congestion pattern generated by CAVs is, however, not known to HDVs before departure and so HDVs cannot select faster routes and face huge uncertainty whichever alternative they choose. Consequently, mixed market-share maximising fleet strategies resulting in unpredictable day-to-day driving conditions may, alarmingly, become pervasive in our future cities.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Control and Automation Framework for Acousto-Holographic Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Manual operation of microscopes for repetitive tasks in cell biology is a significant bottleneck, consuming invaluable expert time, and introducing human error. Automation is essential, and while Digital Holographic Microscopy (DHM) offers powerful, label-free quantitative phase imaging (QPI), its inherently noisy and low-contrast holograms make robust autofocus and object detection challenging. We present the design, integration, and validation of a fully automated closed-loop DHM system engineered for high-throughput mechanical characterization of biological cells. The system integrates automated serpentine scanning, real-time YOLO-based object detection, and a high-performance, multi-threaded software architecture using pinned memory and SPSC queues. This design enables the GPU-accelerated reconstruction pipeline to run fully in parallel with the 50 fps data acquisition, adding no sequential overhead. A key contribution is the validation of a robust, multi-stage holographic autofocus strategy; we demonstrate that a selected metric (based on a low-pass filter and standard deviation) provides reliable focusing for noisy holograms where conventional methods (e.g., Tenengrad, Laplacian) fail entirely. Performance analysis of the complete system identifies the 2.23-second autofocus operation-not reconstruction-as the primary throughput bottleneck, resulting in a 9.62-second analysis time per object. This work delivers a complete functional platform for autonomous DHM screening and provides a clear, data-driven path for future optimization, proposing a hybrid brightfield imaging modality to address current bottlenecks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The US Naval Research Laboratory's (NRL's) Autonomous Planning In-space Assembly Reinforcement-learning free-flYer (APIARY) experiment pioneers the use of reinforcement learning (RL) for control of free-flying robots in the zero-gravity (zero-G) environment of space. On Tuesday, May 27th 2025 the APIARY team conducted the first ever, to our knowledge, RL control of a free-flyer in space using the NASA Astrobee robot on-board the International Space Station (ISS). A robust 6-degrees of freedom (DOF) control policy was trained using an actor-critic Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) network within the NVIDIA Isaac Lab simulation environment, randomizing over goal poses and mass distributions to enhance robustness. This paper details the simulation testing, ground testing, and flight validation of this experiment. This on-orbit demonstration validates the transformative potential of RL for improving robotic autonomy, enabling rapid development and deployment (in minutes to hours) of tailored behaviors for space exploration, logistics, and real-time mission needs.</description>

      <title>Crossing the Sim2Real Gap Between Simulation and Ground Testing to Space Deployment of Autonomous Free-flyer Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) offers transformative potential for robotic control in space. We present the first on-orbit demonstration of RL-based autonomous control of a free-flying robot, the NASA Astrobee, aboard the International Space Station (ISS). Using NVIDIA's Omniverse physics simulator and curriculum learning, we trained a deep neural network to replace Astrobee's standard attitude and translation control, enabling it to navigate in microgravity. Our results validate a novel training pipeline that bridges the simulation-to-reality (Sim2Real) gap, utilizing a GPU-accelerated, scientific-grade simulation environment for efficient Monte Carlo RL training. This successful deployment demonstrates the feasibility of training RL policies terrestrially and transferring them to space-based applications. This paves the way for future work in In-Space Servicing, Assembly, and Manufacturing (ISAM), enabling rapid on-orbit adaptation to dynamic mission requirements.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Optimization for Automatic Tuning of Torque-Level Nonlinear Model Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an auto-tuning framework for torque-based Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (nMPC), where the MPC serves as a real-time controller for optimal joint torque commands. The MPC parameters, including cost function weights and low-level controller gains, are optimized using high-dimensional Bayesian Optimization (BO) techniques, specifically Sparse Axis-Aligned Subspace (SAASBO) with a digital twin (DT) to achieve precise end-effector trajectory real-time tracking on an UR10e robot arm. The simulation model allows efficient exploration of the high-dimensional parameter space, and it ensures safe transfer to hardware. Our simulation results demonstrate significant improvements in tracking performance (+41.9%) and reduction in solve times (-2.5%) compared to manually-tuned parameters. Moreover, experimental validation on the real robot follows the trend (with a +25.8% improvement), emphasizing the importance of digital twin-enabled automated parameter optimization for robotic operations.</description>

      <title>Semi-Markov Decision Process Framework for Age of Incorrect Information Minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a remote estimation system, we study age of incorrect information (AoII), which is a recently proposed semantic-aware freshness metric. In particular, we assume an information source observing a discrete-time finite-state Markov chain (DTMC) and employing push-based transmissions of status update packets towards the monitor which is tasked with remote estimation of the source. The source-to-monitor channel delay is assumed to have a general discrete-time phase-type (DPH) distribution, whereas the zero-delay reverse channel ensures that the source has perfect information on AoII and the remote estimate. A multi-threshold transmission policy is employed where packet transmissions are initiated when the AoII process exceeds a threshold which may be different for each estimation value. In this general setting, our goal is to minimize the weighted sum of time average of an arbitrary function of AoII and estimation, and transmission costs, by suitable choice of the thresholds. We formulate the problem as a semi-Markov decision process (SMDP) with the same state-space as the original DTMC to obtain the optimum multi-threshold policy whereas the parameters of the SMDP are obtained by using a novel stochastic tool called dual-regime absorbing Markov chain (DR-AMC), and its corresponding absorption time distribution named as dual-regime DPH (DR-DPH).</description>

      <title>Anti-bullying Adaptive Cruise Control: A proactive right-of-way protection approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12197v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) systems have been widely commercialized in recent years. However, existing ACC systems remain vulnerable to close-range cut-ins, a behavior that resembles "road bullying". To address this issue, this research proposes an Anti-bullying Adaptive Cruise Control (AACC) approach, which is capable of proactively protecting right-of-way against such "road bullying" cut-ins. To handle diverse "road bullying" cut-in scenarios smoothly, the proposed approach first leverages an online Inverse Optimal Control (IOC) based algorithm for individual driving style identification. Then, based on Stackelberg competition, a game-theoretic-based motion planning framework is presented in which the identified individual driving styles are utilized to formulate cut-in vehicles' reaction functions. By integrating such reaction functions into the ego vehicle's motion planning, the ego vehicle could consider cut-in vehicles' all possible reactions to find its optimal right-of-way protection maneuver. To the best of our knowledge, this research is the first to model vehicles' interaction dynamics and develop an interactive planner that adapts cut-in vehicle's various driving styles. Simulation results show that the proposed approach can prevent "road bullying" cut-ins and be adaptive to different cut-in vehicles' driving styles. It can improve safety and comfort by up to 79.8% and 20.4%. The driving efficiency has benefits by up to 19.33% in traffic flow. The proposed approach can also adopt more flexible driving strategies. Furthermore, the proposed approach can support real-time field implementation by ensuring less than 50 milliseconds computation time.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Oscillatory Response of Automated Vehicle Car-following: Theoretical Analysis with Traffic State and Control Input Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24029v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a framework grounded in the theory of describing function (DF) and incremental-input DF to theoretically analyze the nonlinear oscillatory response of automated vehicles (AVs) car-following (CF) amidst traffic oscillations, considering the limits of traffic state and control input. While prevailing approaches largely ignore these limits (i.e., saturation of acceleration/deceleration and speed) and focus on linear string stability analysis, this framework establishes a basis for theoretically analyzing the frequency response of AV systems with nonlinearities imposed by these limits. To this end, trajectories of CF pairs are decomposed into nominal and oscillatory trajectories, subsequently, the controlled AV system is repositioned within the oscillatory trajectory coordinates. Built on this base, DFs are employed to approximate the frequency responses of nonlinear saturation components by using their first harmonic output, thereby capturing the associated amplification ratio and phase shift. Considering the closed-loop nature of AV control systems, where system states and control input mutually influence each other, amplification ratios and phase shifts are balanced within the loop to ensure consistency. This balancing process may render multiple solutions, hence the incremental-input DF is further applied to identify the reasonable ones. The proposed method is validated by estimations from Simulink, and further comparisons with prevailing methods are conducted. Results confirm the alignment of our framework with Simulink results and exhibit its superior accuracy in analysis compared to the prevailing methods. Furthermore, the framework proves valuable in string stability analysis, especially when conventional linear methods offer misleading insights.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05343v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies sensor placement when detection performance varies stochastically due to environmental factors over space and time and false alarms are present, but a filter is used to attenuate the effect. We introduce a unified model that couples detection and false alarms through an availability function, which captures how false alarms reduce effective sensing and filtering responses to the disturbance. Building on this model, we give a sufficient condition under which filtering improves detection. In addition, we derive a coverage-based lower bound on the void probability. Furthermore, we prove robustness guarantees showing that performance remains stable when detection probabilities are learned from limited data. We validate the approach with numerical studies using AIS vessel-traffic data and synthetic maritime scenarios. Together, these results provide theory and practical guidance for deploying sensors in dynamic, uncertain environments.</description>

      <title>Pricing Problems in Adoption of New Technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21951v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a generalization of the Bass diffusion model in discrete-time that explicitly models the effect of price in adoption. Our model is different from earlier price-incorporated models and fits well to adoption data for various products. We then utilize this model to study two decision-making problems. First, we provide a series of structural results on optimal pricing strategies to maximize profits from product sales by a monopolist over a finite horizon. We fully characterize the optimal pricing strategy in the single-period problem, and establish several structural properties of the same for the multi-period counterpart. Second, we study a Stackelberg game between a policy-maker and a monopolist, where the former seeks to maximize adoption through rebates, while the latter focuses on profits. For this problem, we analytically characterize crucial properties of the equilibrium path of the single-period game, and demonstrate how they carry over to the multi-period variant.</description>

      <title>A Unified Bayesian Framework for Stochastic Data-Driven Smoothing, Prediction, and Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01475v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extending data-driven algorithms based on Willems' fundamental lemma to stochastic data often requires empirical and customized workarounds. This work presents a unified Bayesian framework that provides a systematic and general method for handling stochastic data-driven tasks, including smoothing, prediction, and control, via maximum a posteriori estimation. This framework formulates a unified trajectory estimation problem for the three tasks by specifying different types of trajectory knowledge. Then, a Bayesian problem is solved that optimally combines trajectory knowledge with a data-driven characterization of the trajectory from offline data for a general class of stochastic disturbances. Under specific conditions, this problem is shown to generalize existing data-driven prediction and control algorithms. Numerical examples demonstrate the performance of the unified approach for all three tasks against other data-driven and system identification approaches.</description>

      <title>Fleet Size and Mix Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows for Mobile Fast Chargers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02381v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The electrification of off-road heavy equipment presents operational challenges for agencies serving remote sites with limited fixed charging infrastructure. Existing mobile fast charging vehicle (MFCV) planning approaches typically treat fleet design and routing as separate problems, fixing vehicle characteristics before dispatch. This paper formulates a fleet size and mix capacitated vehicle routing problem with time windows (FSMCVRPTW) for MFCV deployment, jointly optimizing fleet composition, charger specifications, routing, and scheduling within a unified mixed-integer linear program. The model incorporates heterogeneous MFCV types with varying power ratings, battery capacities, fuel range, and cost structures, minimizing total daily cost from labor, fuel, amortized capital expenditure, and energy purchase under temporal service windows, resource budgets, and energy-delivery constraints. The formulation is implemented in Python/Gurobi and applied to two case studies using California Department of Transportation wheel-loader data in Los Angeles (dense urban) and Truckee (sparse mountainous). Results show that simultaneous optimization yields compact, well-utilized fleets that meet all service windows while revealing strong sensitivity of unit cost to demand density and geography. The proposed FSMCVRPTW framework provides a generalizable decision-support methodology that co-designs fleet size, charger power, routing, and service schedules in a single optimization layer for context-aware, cost-efficient mobile fast charging.</description>

      <title>Marginalize, Rather than Impute: Probabilistic Wind Power Forecasting with Incomplete Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03631v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning methods are widely and successfully used for probabilistic wind power forecasting, yet the pervasive issue of missing values (e.g., due to sensor faults or communication outages) has received limited attention. The prevailing practice is impute-then-predict, but conditioning on point imputations biases parameter estimates and fails to propagate uncertainty from missing features. Our approach treats missing features and forecast targets uniformly: we learn a joint generative model of features and targets from incomplete data and, at operational deployment, condition on the observed features and marginalize the unobserved ones to produce forecasts. This imputation-free procedure avoids error introduced by imputation and preserves uncertainty aroused from missing features. In experiments, it improves forecast quality in terms of continuous ranked probability score relative to impute-then-predict baselines while incurring substantially lower computational cost than common alternatives.</description>

      <title>Quaternion-Based Sliding Mode Control for Six Degrees of Freedom Flight Control of Quadrotors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10934v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite extensive research on sliding mode control (SMC) design for quadrotors, the existing approaches suffer from certain limitations. Euler angle-based SMC formulations suffer from poor performance in high-pitch or -roll maneuvers. Quaternion-based SMC approaches have unwinding issues and complex architecture. Coordinate-free methods are slow and only almost globally stable. This paper presents a new six degrees of freedom SMC flight controller to address the above limitations. We use a cascaded architecture with a position controller in the outer loop and a quaternion-based attitude controller in the inner loop. The position controller generates the desired trajectory for the attitude controller using a coordinate-free approach. The quaternion-based attitude controller uses the natural characteristics of the quaternion hypersphere, featuring a simple structure while providing global stability and avoiding unwinding issues. We compare our controller with three other common control methods conducting challenging maneuvers like flip-over and high-speed trajectory tracking in the presence of model uncertainties and disturbances. Our controller consistently outperforms the benchmark approaches with less control effort and actuator saturation, offering highly effective and efficient flight control.</description>

      <title>Concentration of Cumulative Reward in Markov Decision Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18551v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the concentration properties of cumulative reward in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), focusing on both asymptotic and non-asymptotic settings. We introduce a unified approach to characterize reward concentration in MDPs, covering both infinite-horizon settings (i.e., average and discounted reward frameworks) and finite-horizon setting. Our asymptotic results include the law of large numbers, the central limit theorem, and the law of iterated logarithms, while our non-asymptotic bounds include Azuma-Hoeffding-type inequalities and a non-asymptotic version of the law of iterated logarithms. Additionally, we explore two key implications of our results. First, we analyze the sample path behavior of the difference in rewards between any two stationary policies. Second, we show that two alternative definitions of regret for learning policies proposed in the literature are rate-equivalent. Our proof techniques rely on a martingale decomposition of cumulative reward, properties of the solution to the policy evaluation fixed-point equation, and both asymptotic and non-asymptotic concentration results for martingale difference sequences.</description>

      <title>Welfare and Cost Aggregation for Multi-Agent Control: When to Choose Which Social Cost Function, and Why?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20772v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many multi-agent socio-technical systems rely on aggregating heterogeneous agents' costs into a social cost function (SCF) to coordinate resource allocation in domains like energy grids, water allocation, or traffic management. The choice of SCF often entails implicit assumptions and may lead to undesirable outcomes if not rigorously justified. In this paper, we demonstrate that what determines which SCF ought to be used is the degree to which individual costs can be compared across agents and which axioms the aggregation shall fulfill. Drawing on the results from social choice theory, we provide guidance on how this process can be used in control applications. We demonstrate which assumptions about interpersonal utility comparability - ranging from ordinal level comparability to full cardinal comparability - together with a choice of desirable axioms, inform the selection of a correct SCF, be it the classical utilitarian sum, the Nash SCF, or maximin. We then demonstrate how the proposed framework can be applied for principled allocations of water and transportation resources.</description>

      <title>Computationally Efficient Signal Detection with Unknown Bandwidths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09342v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Signal detection in environments with unknown signal bandwidth and time intervals is a fundamental problem in adversarial and spectrum-sharing scenarios. This paper addresses the problem of detecting signals occupying unknown degrees of freedom from non-coherent power measurements, where the signal is constrained to an interval in one dimension or a hyper-cube in multiple dimensions. A GLRT is derived, resulting in a straightforward metric involving normalized average signal energy for each candidate signal set. We present bounds on false alarm and missed detection probabilities, demonstrating their dependence on SNR and signal set sizes. To overcome the inherent computational complexity of exhaustive searches, we propose a computationally efficient binary search method, reducing the complexity from O(N^2) to O(N) for one-dimensional cases. Simulations indicate that the method maintains performance near exhaustive searches and achieves asymptotic consistency, with interval-of-overlap converging to one under constant SNR as measurement size increases. The simulation studies also demonstrate superior performance and reduced complexity compared to contemporary neural network-based approaches, specifically outperforming custom-trained U-Net models in spectrum detection tasks.</description>

      <title>MathBode: Measuring the Stability of LLM Reasoning using Frequency Response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23143v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents MathBode, a dynamic diagnostic for mathematical reasoning in large language models (LLMs). Instead of one-shot accuracy, MathBode treats each parametric problem as a system: we drive a single parameter sinusoidally and fit first-harmonic responses of model outputs and exact solutions. This yields interpretable, frequency-resolved metrics -- gain (amplitude tracking) and phase (lag) -- that form Bode-style fingerprints. Across five closed-form families (linear solve, ratio/saturation, compound interest, 2x2 linear systems, similar triangles), the diagnostic surfaces systematic low-pass behavior and growing phase lag that accuracy alone obscures. We compare several models against a symbolic baseline that calibrates the instrument ($G \approx 1$, $\phi \approx 0$). Results separate frontier from mid-tier models on dynamics, providing a compact, reproducible protocol that complements standard benchmarks with actionable measurements of reasoning fidelity and consistency. We open-source the dataset and code to enable further research and adoption.</description>
