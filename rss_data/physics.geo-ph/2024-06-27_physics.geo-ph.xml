      <title>GlobalTomo: A global dataset for physics-ML seismic wavefield modeling and FWI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Global seismic tomography, taking advantage of seismic waves from natural earthquakes, provides essential insights into the earth's internal dynamics. Advanced Full-waveform Inversion (FWI) techniques, whose aim is to meticulously interpret every detail in seismograms, confront formidable computational demands in forward modeling and adjoint simulations on a global scale. Recent advancements in Machine Learning (ML) offer a transformative potential for accelerating the computational efficiency of FWI and extending its applicability to larger scales. This work presents the first 3D global synthetic dataset tailored for seismic wavefield modeling and full-waveform tomography, referred to as the GlobalTomo dataset. This dataset is uniquely comprehensive, incorporating explicit wave physics and robust geophysical parameterization at realistic global scales, generated through state-of-the-art forward simulations optimized for 3D global wavefield calculations. Through extensive analysis and the establishment of ML baselines, we illustrate that ML approaches are particularly suitable for global FWI, overcoming its limitations with rapid forward modeling and flexible inversion strategies. This work represents a cross-disciplinary effort to enhance our understanding of the earth's interior through physics-ML modeling.</description>

      <title>Depth Dependence of Coseismic Off-Fault Damage and its Effects on Rupture Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Faults are complex systems embedded in an evolving medium fractured by seismic ruptures. This off-fault damage zone is shown to be thermo-hydro-mechano-chemically coupled to the main fault plane by a growing number of studies. Yet, off-fault medium is still, for the most part, modelled as a purely elastic -- hence passive -- medium. Using a micromechanical model that accounts for dynamic changes of elastic moduli and inelastic strains related to crack growth, we investigate the depth variation of dynamically triggered off-fault damage and its counter-impact on earthquake slip dynamics. We show that the damage zone, while narrowing with depth, also becomes denser and contrary to prevailing assumptions continues to act as an energy sink, significantly influencing rupture dynamics by stabilizing slip rates. Furthermore, we observe that damage formation markedly reduces rupture velocity and delays, or even prevents, the transition to supershear speeds even for a narrow damage zone. This underscores the critical need to incorporate the complex interplay between the main fault plane and its surrounding medium across the entire seismogenic zone. As a proof of concept, we introduce a 1D spring-slider model that captures bulk elastic variations, by modulating spring stiffness, and normal stress variations that emulate changes in bulk load. This simple model demonstrates the occurrence of slow slip events alongside conventional earthquakes, driven by the dynamic interaction between bulk temporal evolution and fault slip dynamics, without necessitating any changes to frictional properties.</description>
