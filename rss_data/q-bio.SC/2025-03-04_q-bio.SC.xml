      <title>Insights into new mechanosensitive behaviors of G protein-coupled receptors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) represent a diverse and vital family of membrane proteins that mediate intracellular signaling in response to extracellular stimuli, playing critical roles in physiology and disease. Traditionally recognized as chemical signal transducers, GPCRs have recently been implicated in mechanotransduction, the process of converting mechanical stimuli into cellular responses. This review explores the emerging role of GPCRs in sensing and responding to mechanical forces, with a particular focus on the cardiovascular system. Cardiovascular homeostasis is heavily influenced by mechanical forces such as shear stress, cyclic stretch, and pressure, which are central to both normal physiology and the pathogenesis of diseases like hypertension and atherosclerosis. GPCRs, including the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) and the $\beta$2-adrenergic receptor ($\beta$2-AR), have demonstrated the ability to integrate mechanical and chemical signals, potentially through conformational changes and/or modulation of lipid interactions, leading to biased signaling. Recent studies highlight the dual activation mechanisms of GPCRs, with $\beta$2-AR now serving as a key example of how mechanical and ligand-dependent pathways contribute to cardiovascular regulation. This review synthesizes current knowledge of GPCR mechanosensitivity, emphasizing its implications for cardiovascular health and disease, and explores advancements in methodologies poised to further unravel the mechanistic intricacies of these receptors.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous model for superdiffusive movement of dense-core vesicles in C. elegans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18237v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transport of dense core vesicles (DCVs) in neurons is crucial for distributing molecules like neuropeptides and growth factors. We studied the experimental trajectories of dynein-driven directed movement of DCVs in the ALA neuron C. elegans over a duration of up to 6 seconds. We analysed the DCV movement in three strains of C. elegans: 1) with normal kinesin-1 function, 2) with reduced function in kinesin light chain 2 (KLC-2), and 3) a null mutation in kinesin light chain 1 (KLC-1). We find that DCVs move superdiffusively with displacement variance $var(x) \sim t^2$ in all three strains with low reversal rates and frequent immobilization of DCVs. The distribution of DCV displacements fits a beta-binomial distribution with the mean and the variance following linear and quadratic growth patterns, respectively. We propose a simple heterogeneous random walk model to explain the observed superdiffusive retrograde transport behaviour of DCV movement. This model involves a random probability with the beta density for a DCV to resume its movement or remain in the same position.</description>
