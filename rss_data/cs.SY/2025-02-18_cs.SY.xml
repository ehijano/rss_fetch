      <title>Performance of energy harvesters with parameter mismatch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the impact of parameter mismatch on the stability of cross-well motion in energy harvesters, using a basin stability metric. Energy harvesters, essential for converting ambient energy into electricity, increasingly incorporate multi-well systems to enhance efficiency. However, these systems are sensitive to initial conditions and parameter variations, which can affect their ability to sustain optimal cross-well motion -- a state associated with maximum power output. Our analysis compared four harvester types under varying levels of parameter mismatch, assessing resilience of the devices to parameter variations. By identifying safe operating ranges within the excitation parameter space, this study provides practical guidance for designing robust, stable harvesters capable of maintaining cross-well motion despite parameter uncertainties. These insights contribute to advancing the reliability of energy harvesting devices in real-world applications where parameter mismatches are inevitable.</description>

      <title>Lifetime Analysis of Circular $k$-out-of-$n$: G Balanced Systems in a Shock Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines the lifetime distributions of circular $k$-out-of-$n$: G balanced systems operating in a shock environment, providing a unified framework for both discrete- and continuous-time perspectives. The system remains functioning only if at least $k$ operating units satisfy a predefined balance condition (BC). Building on this concept, we demonstrate that the shock numbers to failure (SNTF) follow a discrete phase-type distribution by modeling the system's stochastic dynamics with a finite Markov chain and applying BC-based state space consolidation. Additionally, we develop a computationally efficient method for directly computing multi-step transition probabilities of the underlying Markov chain. Next, assuming the inter-arrival times between shocks follow a phase-type distribution, we establish that the continuous-time system lifetime, or the time to system failure (TTF), also follows a phase-type distribution with different parameters. Extensive numerical studies illustrate the impact of key parameters-such as the number of units, minimum requirement of the number of operating units, individual unit reliability, choice of balance condition, and inter-shock time distribution-on the SNTF, TTF, and their variability.</description>

      <title>Safe Multi-agent Satellite Servicing with Control Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of control barrier functions under uncertain pose information of multiple small servicing agents is analyzed for a satellite servicing application. The application consists of modular servicing agents deployed towards a tumbling space object from a mothership. Relative position and orientation of each agent is obtained via fusion of relative range and inertial measurement sensors. The control barrier functions are utilized to avoid collisions with other agents for the application of simultaneously relocating servicing agents on a tumbling body. A differential collision detection and avoidance framework using the polytopic hull of the tumbling space object is utilized to safely guide the agents away from the tumbling object.</description>

      <title>Synthesis of Dynamic Masks for Information-Theoretic Opacity in Stochastic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the synthesis of dynamic information releasing mechanisms, referred to as ''masks'', to minimize information leakage from a stochastic system to an external observer. Specifically, for a stochastic system, an observer aims to infer whether the final state of the system trajectory belongs to a set of secret states. The dynamic mask seeks to regulate sensor information in order to maximize the observer's uncertainty about the final state, a property known as final-state opacity. While existing supervisory control literature on dynamic masks primarily addresses qualitative opacity, we propose quantifying opacity in stochastic systems by conditional entropy, which is a measure of information leakage in information security. We then formulate a constrained optimization problem to synthesize a dynamic mask that maximizes final-state opacity under a total cost constraint on masking. To solve this constrained optimal dynamic mask synthesis problem, we develop a novel primal-dual policy gradient method. Additionally, we present a technique for computing the gradient of conditional entropy with respect to the masking policy parameters, leveraging observable operators in hidden Markov models. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we apply our method to an illustrative example and a stochastic grid world scenario, showing how our algorithm optimally enforces final-state opacity under cost constraints.</description>

      <title>Can Large Language Model Agents Balance Energy Systems?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a hybrid approach that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with a multi-scenario Stochastic Unit Commitment (SUC) framework, focusing on both efficiency and reliability under high wind generation uncertainties. Numerical experiments on small-to-medium-sized test systems show that while the traditional SUC approach yields a total cost of 99.05 million USD with 3.04 GWh of load curtailment, the LLM-assisted SUC (LLM-SUC) reduces costs to 98.87 million USD and lowers load curtailment to 2.32 GWh, an improvement of nearly 24%. Both methods maintain zero wind curtailment, confirming robust renewable integration. By employing an LLM agent that helps balance the energy system more effectively, the proposed framework enhances demand fulfillment at reduced costs, illustrating the potential of AI to inform generator commitments in uncertain operating conditions. Further gains may be realized by refining prompt design, incorporating historical operational data, and extending this approach to higher-dimensional uncertainties and energy storage systems, ultimately fostering greater resilience, efficiency, and adaptability in next-generation power system operations.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Feedback Linearization and LQG/LTR Control: A Comparative Study for a Single-Machine Infinite-Bus System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a comparative study of three advanced control strategies for a single-machine infinite-bus (SMIB) system: the nonlinear feedback linearizing controller (NFLC), the integral-NFLC (INFLC), and the linear-quadratic-Gaussian/loop transfer recovery (LQG/LTR) control. The NFLC and INFLC techniques use exact feedback linearization to precisely cancel the SMIB system nonlinearities, enabling the use of decentralized, linear, and optimal controllers for the decoupled generator and turbine-governor systems while remaining unaffected by the SMIB system's internal dynamics and operating conditions. In contrast, the LQG/LTR approach employs an enhanced Kalman filter, designed using the LTR procedure and a detailed frequency-domain loop-shaping analysis, to achieve a reasonable trade-off between optimal performance, noise/disturbance rejection, robustness recovery, and stability margins for the SMIB system. We provide a control synthesis framework for constructing practical, verifiable, scalable, and resilient linear and nonlinear controllers for SMIB and multi-machine power systems by utilizing a high-fidelity plant model for validation, a reduced-order control-design model, and the correlations between the two models' control inputs. Rigorous simulations and comparative analysis of the proposed controllers and a full-state linear-quadratic regulator show the benefits, constraints, and trade-offs of each controller in terms of transient response, steady-state error, robustness, rotor angle stability, frequency control, and voltage regulation under different operating conditions. Ultimately, this study aims to guide the selection of appropriate control strategies for large-scale power systems, enhancing the overall resilience and reliability of the electric grid.</description>

      <title>PPAC Driven Multi-die and Multi-technology Floorplanning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In heterogeneous integration, where different dies may utilize distinct technologies, floorplanning across multiple dies inherently requires simultaneous technology selection. This work presents the first systematic study of multi-die and multi-technology floorplanning. Unlike many conventional approaches, which are primarily driven by area and wirelength, this study additionally considers performance, power, and cost, highlighting the impact of technology selection. A simulated annealing method and a reinforcement learning techniques are developed. Experimental results show that the proposed techniques significantly outperform a naive baseline approach.</description>

      <title>Reducing Computational Complexity of Rigidity-Based UAV Trajectory Optimization for Real-Time Cooperative Target Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate and swift localization of the target is crucial in emergencies. However, accurate position data of a target mobile device, typically obtained from global navigation satellite systems (GNSS), cellular networks, or WiFi, may not always be accessible to first responders. For instance, 1) accuracy and availability can be limited in challenging signal reception environments, and 2) in regions where emergency location services are not mandatory, certain mobile devices may not transmit their location during emergencies. As an alternative localization method, a network of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be employed to passively locate targets by collecting radio frequency (RF) signal measurements, such as received signal strength (RSS). In these situations, UAV trajectories play a critical role in localization performance, influencing both accuracy and search time. Previous studies optimized UAV trajectories using the determinant of the Fisher information matrix (FIM), but its performance declines under unfavorable geometric conditions, such as when UAVs start from a single base, leading to position ambiguity. To address this, our prior work introduced a rigidity-based approach, which improved the search time compared to FIM-based methods in our simulation case. However, the high computational cost of rigidity-based optimization, primarily due to singular value decomposition (SVD), limits its practicality. In this paper, we applied techniques to reduce computational complexity, including randomized SVD, smooth SVD, and vertex pruning.</description>

      <title>Runtime Enforcement of CPS against Signal Temporal Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs), especially those involving autonomy, need guarantees of their safety. Runtime Enforcement (RE) is a lightweight method to formally ensure that some specified properties are satisfied over the executions of the system. Hence, there is recent interest in the RE of CPS. However, existing methods are not designed to tackle specifications suitable for the hybrid dynamics of CPS. With this in mind, we develop runtime enforcement of CPS using properties defined in Signal Temporal Logic (STL).
  In this work, we aim to construct a runtime enforcer for a given STL formula to minimally modify a signal to satisfy the formula. To achieve this, the STL formula to be enforced is first translated into a timed transducer, while the signal to be corrected is encoded as timed words. We provide timed transducers for the temporal operators \emph{until} and \emph{release} noting that other temporal operators can be expressed using these two. Our approach enables effective enforcement of STL properties for CPS. A case study is provided to illustrate the approach and generate empirical evidence of its suitability for CPS.</description>

      <title>Real Time Control of Tandem-Wing Experimental Platform Using Concerto Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the CRL2RT algorithm, an advanced reinforcement learning method aimed at improving the real-time control performance of the Direct-Drive Tandem-Wing Experimental Platform (DDTWEP). Inspired by dragonfly flight, DDTWEP's tandem wing structure causes nonlinear and unsteady aerodynamic interactions, leading to complex load behaviors during pitch, roll, and yaw maneuvers. These complexities challenge stable motion control at high frequencies (2000 Hz). To overcome these issues, we developed the CRL2RT algorithm, which combines classical control elements with reinforcement learning-based controllers using a time-interleaved architecture and a rule-based policy composer. This integration ensures finite-time convergence and single-life adaptability. Experimental results under various conditions, including different flapping frequencies and yaw disturbances, show that CRL2RT achieves a control frequency surpassing 2500 Hz on standard CPUs. Additionally, when integrated with classical controllers like PID, Adaptive PID, and Model Reference Adaptive Control (MRAC), CRL2RT enhances tracking performance by 18.3% to 60.7%. These findings demonstrate CRL2RT's broad applicability and superior performance in complex real-time control scenarios, validating its effectiveness in overcoming existing control strategy limitations and advancing robust, efficient real-time control for biomimetic aerial vehicles.</description>

      <title>Multi-Objective Planning with Contextual Lexicographic Reward Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous agents are often required to plan under multiple objectives whose preference ordering varies based on context. The agent may encounter multiple contexts during its course of operation, each imposing a distinct lexicographic ordering over the objectives, with potentially different reward functions associated with each context. Existing approaches to multi-objective planning typically consider a single preference ordering over the objectives, across the state space, and do not support planning under multiple objective orderings within an environment. We present Contextual Lexicographic Markov Decision Process (CLMDP), a framework that enables planning under varying lexicographic objective orderings, depending on the context. In a CLMDP, both the objective ordering at a state and the associated reward functions are determined by the context. We employ a Bayesian approach to infer a state-context mapping from expert trajectories. Our algorithm to solve a CLMDP first computes a policy for each objective ordering and then combines them into a single context-aware policy that is valid and cycle-free. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is evaluated in simulation and using a mobile robot.</description>

      <title>Efficient Stabilization of Hybrid Coulomb Spacecraft Formations using Control Lyapunov Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A control allocation algorithm using control Lyapunov functions to determine stabilizing charges and thrusts of hybrid Coulomb spacecraft formations (HCSFs) is presented. The goal is to stabilize a desired configuration while minimizing the thruster actuation and maximizing Coulomb actuation to minimize propellant usage. A proportion of the decrease of the control Lyapunov function is designated for Coulomb actuation and the rest is performed by thrusters. Simulations show that an 85% reduction of propellant compared to using solely thrusters is attainable using the proposed algorithm. It is shown that the best role for thrusters in a HCSF is to provide small corrections that cannot be provided by Coulomb actuation.</description>

      <title>Reachability-Aware Reinforcement Learning for Collision Avoidance in Human-Machine Shared Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human-machine shared control in critical collision scenarios aims to aid drivers' accident avoidance through intervening only when necessary. Existing methods count on replanning collision-free trajectories and imposing human-machine tracking, which usually interrupts the driver's intent and increases the risk of conflict. Additionally, the lack of guaranteed trajectory feasibility under extreme conditions can compromise safety and reliability. This paper introduces a Reachability-Aware Reinforcement Learning framework for shared control, guided by Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis. Machine intervention is activated only when the vehicle approaches the Collision Avoidance Reachable Set (CARS), which represents states where collision is unavoidable. First, we precompute the reachability distributions and the CARS by solving the Bellman equation using offline data. To reduce human-machine conflicts, we develop a driver model for sudden obstacles and propose an authority allocation strategy considering key collision avoidance features. Finally, we train a reinforcement learning agent to reduce human-machine conflicts while enforcing the hard constraint of avoiding entry into the CARS. The proposed method was tested on a real vehicle platform. Results show that the controller intervenes effectively near CARS to prevent collisions while maintaining improved original driving task performance. Robustness analysis further supports its flexibility across different driver attributes.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of a planar multimodal periodic filter at THz frequencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a planar multimodal periodic filter that is constructed from alternating sections of coplanar stripline and the odd-mode of a finite-ground plane coplanar waveguide constructed on a 1 um silicon nitride substrate to facilitate operation at THz frequencies. The multimode configuration differs from standard single-mode periodic filters and enables flexible designs and the possibility for active control of the filter characteristics. For this proof-of-concept, we present the relevant theory and design procedures required to develop a band-stop filter that has a center frequency of fc = 0.8 THz and a bandwidth of df = 0.07 THz. We find good agreement between theory, simulation, and experiment.</description>

      <title>Sparse learning with concave regularization: relaxation of the irrepresentable condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning sparse models from data is an important task in all those frameworks where relevant information should be identified within a large dataset. This can be achieved by formulating and solving suitable sparsity promoting optimization problems. As to linear regression models, Lasso is the most popular convex approach, based on an $\ell_1$-norm regularization. In contrast, in this paper, we analyse a concave regularized approach, and we prove that it relaxes the irrepresentable condition, which is sufficient and essentially necessary for Lasso to select the right significant parameters. In practice, this has the benefit of reducing the number of necessary measurements with respect to Lasso. Since the proposed problem is non-convex, we also discuss different algorithms to solve it, and we illustrate the obtained enhancement via numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>A Physics-Informed Machine Learning Framework for Safe and Optimal Control of Autonomous Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As autonomous systems become more ubiquitous in daily life, ensuring high performance with guaranteed safety is crucial. However, safety and performance could be competing objectives, which makes their co-optimization difficult. Learning-based methods, such as Constrained Reinforcement Learning (CRL), achieve strong performance but lack formal safety guarantees due to safety being enforced as soft constraints, limiting their use in safety-critical settings. Conversely, formal methods such as Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) Reachability Analysis and Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) provide rigorous safety assurances but often neglect performance, resulting in overly conservative controllers. To bridge this gap, we formulate the co-optimization of safety and performance as a state-constrained optimal control problem, where performance objectives are encoded via a cost function and safety requirements are imposed as state constraints. We demonstrate that the resultant value function satisfies a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation, which we approximate efficiently using a novel physics-informed machine learning framework. In addition, we introduce a conformal prediction-based verification strategy to quantify the learning errors, recovering a high-confidence safety value function, along with a probabilistic error bound on performance degradation. Through several case studies, we demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework in enabling scalable learning of safe and performant controllers for complex, high-dimensional autonomous systems.</description>

      <title>Dictionary-Learning-Based Data Pruning for System Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: System identification is normally involved in augmenting time series data by time shifting and nonlinearisation (via polynomial basis), which introduce redundancy both feature-wise and sample-wise. Many research works focus on reducing redundancy feature-wise, while less attention is paid to sample-wise redundancy. This paper proposes a novel data pruning method, called (mini-batch) FastCan, to reduce sample-wise redundancy based on dictionary learning. Time series data is represented by some representative samples, called atoms, via dictionary learning. The useful samples are selected based on their correlation with the atoms. The method is tested on one simulated dataset and two benchmark datasets. The R-squared between the coefficients of models trained on the full and the coefficients of models trained on pruned datasets is adopted to evaluate the performance of data pruning methods. It is found that the proposed method significantly outperforms the random pruning method.</description>

      <title>How to Divide: A Set Partitioning Strategy Balancing the Trade-off Between Intra-Subset Correlation and Inter-Subset Gain Mutual Influence in Distributed Attack Detection Scheduling Task</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, the efficiency of attack detection in large-scale sensor networks has remained a critical research challenge. Studies have shown that while distributed algorithms offer higher efficiency compared to centralized approaches, they often come at the cost of reduced performance. To strike a balance between detection efficiency and performance in large-scale sensor networks, this paper explores the feasibility of extending existing algorithms to a distributed framework. Starting from the perspective of set partitioning strategies, this study analyzes the key factor that contributes to the performance differences between distributed and centralized algorithms. By examining the gain mutual influence of sensor subsets, an optimal set partitioning strategy is designed to minimize inter-subset mutual influence while enhancing intra-subset correlation. To further reduce the computational cost of gain updates, a suboptimal partitioning strategy based on Grassmann distance is proposed, improving the efficiency of selecting suspicious sensors. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that this approach effectively reduces the computational cost of gain updates while maintaining detection performance. Finally, simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in enhancing attack detection performance.</description>

      <title>Matrix Low-dimensional Qubit Casting Based Quantum Electromagnetic Transient Network Simulation Program</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In modern power systems, the integration of converter-interfaced generations requires the development of electromagnetic transient network simulation programs (EMTP) that can capture rapid fluctuations. However, as the power system scales, the EMTP's computing complexity increases exponentially, leading to a curse of dimensionality that hinders its practical application. Facing this challenge, quantum computing offers a promising approach for achieving exponential acceleration. To realize this in noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers, the variational quantum linear solution (VQLS) was advocated because of its robustness against depolarizing noise. However, it suffers data inflation issues in its preprocessing phase, and no prior research has applied quantum computing to high-frequency switching EMT networks.To address these issues, this paper first designs the matrix low-dimension qubit casting (MLQC) method to address the data inflation problem in the preprocessing of the admittance matrix for VQLS in EMT networks. Besides, we propose a real-only quantum circuit reduction method tailored to the characteristics of the EMT network admittance matrices. Finally, the proposed quantum EMTP algorithm (QEMTP) has been successfully verified for EMT networks containing a large number of high-frequency switching elements.</description>

      <title>On Data-Driven Robust Optimization With Multiple Uncertainty Subsets: Unified Uncertainty Set Representation and Mitigating Conservatism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Constructing uncertainty sets as unions of multiple subsets has emerged as an effective approach for creating compact and flexible uncertainty representations in data-driven robust optimization (RO). This paper focuses on two separate research questions. The first concerns the computational challenge in applying these uncertainty sets in RO-based predictive control. To address this, a monolithic mixed-integer representation of the uncertainty set is proposed to uniformly describe the union of multiple subsets, enabling the computation of the worst-case uncertainty scenario across all subsets within a single mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem. The second research question focuses on mitigating the conservatism of conventional RO formulations by leveraging the structure of the uncertainty set. To achieve this, a novel objective function is proposed to exploit the uncertainty set structure and integrate the existing RO and distributionally robust optimization (DRO) formulations, yielding less conservative solutions than conventional RO formulations while avoiding the high-dimensional continuous uncertainty distributions and incurring high computational burden typically associated with existing DRO formulations. Given the proposed formulations, numerically efficient computation methods based on column-and-constraint generation (CCG) are also developed. Extensive simulations across three case studies are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulations are highly valuable in marine robotics, offering a cost-effective and controlled environment for testing in the challenging conditions of underwater and surface operations. Given the high costs and logistical difficulties of real-world trials, simulators capable of capturing the operational conditions of subsea environments have become key in developing and refining algorithms for remotely-operated and autonomous underwater vehicles. This paper highlights recent enhancements to the Stonefish simulator, an advanced open-source platform supporting development and testing of marine robotics solutions. Key updates include a suite of additional sensors, such as an event-based camera, a thermal camera, and an optical flow camera, as well as, visual light communication, support for tethered operations, improved thruster modelling, more flexible hydrodynamics, and enhanced sonar accuracy. These developments and an automated annotation tool significantly bolster Stonefish's role in marine robotics research, especially in the field of machine learning, where training data with a known ground truth is hard or impossible to collect.</description>

Abstract: Modern AESA technology enables RF systems to not only perform various radar, communication and electronic warfare tasks on a single aperture, but even to execute multiple tasks concurrently. These capabilities increase system complexity and require intelligent or cognitive resource management. This paper introduces such a resource management framework based on quality of service based resource allocation and Monte Carlo tree search allowing for optimal system usage and profound decision-making. Furthermore, we present experimental verification in a complex application scenario.</description>

In the present paper we analyze a chain of transport equations with boundary and point controls with regard to this property. Both for Dirichlet and Neumann boundary and coupling conditions, we show a necessary and sufficient criterion on control domains which allow for the domain-uniform stabilization of this equation. We illustrate the results by means of a numerical example.</description>

      <title>Design Considerations Based on Stability for a Class of TCP Algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) continues to be the dominant transport protocol on the Internet. The stability of fluid models has been a key consideration in the design of TCP and the performance evaluation of TCP algorithms. Based on local stability analysis, we formulate some design considerations for a class of TCP algorithms. We begin with deriving sufficient conditions for the local stability of a generalized TCP algorithm in the presence of heterogeneous round-trip delays. Within this generalized model, we consider three specific variants of TCP: TCP Reno, Compound TCP, and Scalable TCP. The sufficient conditions we derive are scalable across network topologies with one, two, and many bottleneck links. We are interested in networks with intermediate and small drop-tail buffers as they offer smaller queuing delays. The small buffer regime is more attractive as the conditions for stability are decentralized. TCP algorithms that follow our design considerations can provide stable operation on any network topology, irrespective of the number of bottleneck links or delays in the network.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a computationally-efficient method for evaluating the feasibility of Quadratic Programs (QPs) for online constrained control. Based on the duality principle, we first show that the feasibility of a QP can be determined by the solution of a properly-defined Linear Program (LP). Our analysis yields a LP that can be solved more efficiently compared to the original QP problem, and more importantly, is simpler in form and can be solved more efficiently compared to existing methods that assess feasibility via LPs. The computational efficiency of the proposed method compared to existing methods for feasibility evaluation is demonstrated in comparative case studies as well as a feasible-constraint selection problem, indicating its promise for online feasibility evaluation of optimization-based controllers.</description>

      <title>WeVibe: Weight Change Estimation Through Audio-Induced Shelf Vibrations In Autonomous Stores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Weight change estimation is crucial in various applications, particularly for detecting pick-up and put-back actions when people interact with the shelf while shopping in autonomous stores. Moreover, accurate weight change estimation allows autonomous stores to automatically identify items being picked up or put back, ensuring precise cost estimation. However, the conventional approach of estimating weight changes requires specialized weight-sensing shelves, which are densely deployed weight scales, incurring intensive sensor consumption and high costs. Prior works explored the vibration-based weight sensing method, but they failed when the location of weight change varies.
  In response to these limitations, we made the following contributions: (1) We propose WeVibe, a first item weight change estimation system through active shelf vibration sensing. The main intuition of the system is that the weight placed on the shelf influences the dynamic vibration response of the shelf, thus altering the shelf vibration patterns. (2) We model a physics-informed relationship between the shelf vibration response and item weight across multiple locations on the shelf based on structural dynamics theory. This relationship is linear and allows easy training of a weight estimation model at a new location without heavy data collection. (3) We evaluate our system on a gondola shelf organized as the real-store settings. WeVibe achieved a mean absolute error down to 38.07g and a standard deviation of 31.2g with one sensor and 10% samples from three weight classes on estimating weight change from 0g to 450g, which can be leveraged for differentiating items with more than 100g differences.</description>

      <title>VoLUT: Efficient Volumetric streaming enhanced by LUT-based super-resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 3D volumetric video provides immersive experience and is gaining traction in digital media. Despite its rising popularity, the streaming of volumetric video content poses significant challenges due to the high data bandwidth requirement. A natural approach to mitigate the bandwidth issue is to reduce the volumetric video's data rate by downsampling the content prior to transmission. The video can then be upsampled at the receiver's end using a super-resolution (SR) algorithm to reconstruct the high-resolution details. While super-resolution techniques have been extensively explored and advanced for 2D video content, there is limited work on SR algorithms tailored for volumetric videos.
  To address this gap and the growing need for efficient volumetric video streaming, we have developed VoLUT with a new SR algorithm specifically designed for volumetric content. Our algorithm uniquely harnesses the power of lookup tables (LUTs) to facilitate the efficient and accurate upscaling of low-resolution volumetric data. The use of LUTs enables our algorithm to quickly reference precomputed high-resolution values, thereby significantly reducing the computational complexity and time required for upscaling. We further apply adaptive video bit rate algorithm (ABR) to dynamically determine the downsampling rate according to the network condition and stream the selected video rate to the receiver. Compared to related work, VoLUT is the first to enable high-quality 3D SR on commodity mobile devices at line-rate. Our evaluation shows VoLUT can reduce bandwidth usage by 70% , boost QoE by 36.7% for volumetric video streaming and achieve
  3D SR speed-up with no quality compromise.</description>

Abstract: Car-following (CF) algorithms are crucial components of traffic simulations and have been integrated into many production vehicles equipped with Advanced Driving Assistance Systems (ADAS). Insights from the model of car-following behavior help us understand the causes of various macro phenomena that arise from interactions between pairs of vehicles. Car-following models encompass multiple disciplines, including traffic engineering, physics, dynamic system control, cognitive science, machine learning, and reinforcement learning. This paper presents an extensive survey that highlights the differences, complementarities, and overlaps among microscopic traffic flow and control models based on their underlying principles and design logic. It reviews representative algorithms, ranging from theory-based kinematic models, Psycho-Physical Models, and Adaptive cruise control models to data-driven algorithms like Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Imitation Learning (IL). The manuscript discusses the strengths and limitations of these models and explores their applications in different contexts. This review synthesizes existing researches across different domains to fill knowledge gaps and offer guidance for future research by identifying the latest trends in car following models and their applications.</description>

      <title>A Multiobjective Reinforcement Learning Framework for Microgrid Energy Management</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.08692v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The emergence of microgrids (MGs) has provided a promising solution for decarbonizing and decentralizing the power grid, mitigating the challenges posed by climate change. However, MG operations often involve considering multiple objectives that represent the interests of different stakeholders, leading to potentially complex conflicts. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel multi-objective reinforcement learning framework that explores the high-dimensional objective space and uncovers the tradeoffs between conflicting objectives. This framework leverages exogenous information and capitalizes on the data-driven nature of reinforcement learning, enabling the training of a parametric policy without the need for long-term forecasts or knowledge of the underlying uncertainty distribution. The trained policies exhibit diverse, adaptive, and coordinative behaviors with the added benefit of providing interpretable insights on the dynamics of their information use. We employ this framework on the Cornell University MG (CU-MG), which is a combined heat and power MG, to evaluate its effectiveness. The results demonstrate performance improvements in all objectives considered compared to the status quo operations and offer more flexibility in navigating complex operational tradeoffs.</description>

Abstract: Flexible grid topology has become a key enabler of flexibility in modern power grids, particularly for congestion management. Studying the effects of combinatorial topological changes is therefore of significant interest, though it remains computationally intensive in most cases. To address this, we revisit the superposition theorem, which has served as the foundation for the decomposition of numerous power system problems over the past decades, particularly those involving changes in generation and loads. However, its application has traditionally been restricted to fixed grid topologies, breaking down as soon as a topology change occurs. In this paper, we extend the superposition theorem to accommodate varying grid topologies by leveraging well-known distribution factors. This unified framework applies to all types of topological changes, including line disconnection and reconnection, as well as bus splitting and merging. We provide numerical experiments to validate our approach and highlight its advantages in terms of speed-up and interpretability. Finally, we demonstrate its application in two key use cases: remedial action search and updated security analysis following a topological change. Our results show that the proposed approach achieves more than an order-of-magnitude speed-up for real-sized grids compared to the fastest power flow solvers.</description>

      <title>High-Performance Distributed Control for Large-Scale Linear Systems: A Partitioned Distributed Observer Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06903v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, the distributed-observer-based distributed control law has shown powerful ability to arbitrarily approximate the centralized control performance. However, the traditional distributed observer requires each local observer to reconstruct the state information of the whole system, which is unrealistic for large-scale scenarios. To fill this gap, this paper develops a greedy-idea-based large-scale system partition algorithm, which can significantly reduce the dimension of local observers. Then, the partitioned distributed observer for large-scale systems is proposed to overcome the problem that the system dynamics are difficult to estimate due to the coupling between partitions. Furthermore, the two-layer Lyapunov analysis method is adopted and the dynamic transformation lemma of compact errors is proven, which solves the problem of analyzing stability of the error dynamic of the partitioned distributed observer. Finally, it is proved that the distributed control law based on the partitioned distributed observer can also arbitrarily approximate the control performance of the centralized control law, and the dimension of the local observer is greatly reduced compared with the traditional method. The simulation results show that when the similarity between the physical network and the communication network is about 80%, the local observer dimension is greatly reduced by 90% and the relative error between the performance of the distributed control law and that of the centralized control law is less than 1%.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Dual Gradient Tracking for Distributed Resource Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18275v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates privacy issues in distributed resource allocation over directed networks, where each agent holds a private cost function and optimizes its decision subject to a global coupling constraint through local interaction with other agents. Conventional methods for resource allocation over directed networks require all agents to transmit their original data to neighbors, which poses the risk of disclosing sensitive and private information. To address this issue, we propose an algorithm called differentially private dual gradient tracking (DP-DGT) for distributed resource allocation, which obfuscates the exchanged messages using independent Laplacian noise. Our algorithm ensures that the agents' decisions converge to a neighborhood of the optimal solution almost surely. Furthermore, without the assumption of bounded gradients, we prove that the cumulative differential privacy loss under the proposed algorithm is finite even when the number of iterations goes to infinity. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to simultaneously achieve these two goals in distributed resource allocation problems over directed networks. Finally, numerical simulations on economic dispatch problems within the IEEE 14-bus system illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Lyapunov-Based Deep Residual Neural Network (ResNet) Adaptive Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07385v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep Neural Network (DNN)-based controllers have emerged as a tool to compensate for unstructured uncertainties in nonlinear dynamical systems. A recent breakthrough in the adaptive control literature provides a Lyapunov-based approach to derive weight adaptation laws for each layer of a fully-connected feedforward DNN-based adaptive controller. However, deriving weight adaptation laws from a Lyapunov-based analysis remains an open problem for deep residual neural networks (ResNets). This paper provides the first result on Lyapunov-derived weight adaptation for a ResNet-based adaptive controller. A nonsmooth Lyapunov-based analysis is provided to guarantee asymptotic tracking error convergence. Comparative Monte Carlo simulations are provided to demonstrate the performance of the developed ResNet-based adaptive controller. The ResNet-based adaptive controller shows a 64% improvement in the tracking and function approximation performance, in comparison to a fully-connected DNN-based adaptive controller.</description>

      <title>Reserve Provision from Electric Vehicles: Aggregate Boundaries and Stochastic Model Predictive Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07454v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Controlled charging of electric vehicles, EVs, is a major potential source of flexibility to facilitate the integration of variable renewable energy and reduce the need for stationary energy storage. To offer system services from EVs, fleet aggregators must address the uncertainty of individual driving and charging behaviour. This paper introduces a means of forecasting the service volume available from EVs by considering several EV batteries as one conceptual battery with aggregate power and energy boundaries. Aggregation avoids the difficult prediction of individual driving behaviour. The predictability of the boundaries is demonstrated using a multiple linear regression model which achieves a normalised root mean square error of 20% - 40% for a fleet of 1,000 EVs. A two-stage stochastic model predictive control algorithm is used to schedule reserve services on a day-ahead basis addressing risk trade-offs by including Conditional Value-at-Risk in the objective function. A case study with 1.2 million domestic EV charge records from Great Britain illustrates that increasing fleet size improves prediction accuracy, thereby increasing reserve revenues and decreasing an aggregator's operational costs. For fleet sizes of 400 or above, cost reductions plateau at 60% compared to uncontrolled charging, with an average of 1.8kW of reserve provided per vehicle.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning for Equitable Load Shedding: Real-time Solution via Learning Binding Constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18989v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Timely and effective load shedding in power systems is critical for maintaining supply-demand balance and preventing cascading blackouts. To eliminate load shedding bias against specific regions in the system, optimization-based methods are uniquely positioned to help balance between economical and equity considerations. However, the resulting optimization problem involves complex constraints, which can be time-consuming to solve and thus cannot meet the real-time requirements of load shedding. To tackle this challenge, in this paper we present an efficient machine learning algorithm to enable millisecond-level computation for the optimization-based load shedding problem. Numerical studies on both a 3-bus toy example and a realistic RTS-GMLC system have demonstrated the validity and efficiency of the proposed algorithm for delivering equitable and real-time load shedding decisions.</description>

      <title>Certifiable Reachability Learning Using a New Lipschitz Continuous Value Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07866v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new reachability learning framework for high-dimensional nonlinear systems, focusing on reach-avoid problems. These problems require computing the reach-avoid set, which ensures that all its elements can safely reach a target set despite disturbances within pre-specified bounds. Our framework has two main parts: offline learning of a newly designed reachavoid value function, and post-learning certification. Compared to prior work, our new value function is Lipschitz continuous and its associated Bellman operator is a contraction mapping, both of which improve the learning performance. To ensure deterministic guarantees of our learned reach-avoid set, we introduce two efficient post-learning certification methods. Both methods can be used online for real-time local certification or offline for comprehensive certification. We validate our framework in a 12-dimensional crazyflie drone racing hardware experiment and a simulated 10-dimensional highway take-over example.</description>

      <title>An Analysis of Logit Learning with the r-Lambert Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05044v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The well-known replicator equation in evolutionary game theory describes how population-level behaviors change over time when individuals make decisions using simple imitation learning rules. In this paper, we study evolutionary dynamics based on a fundamentally different class of learning rules known as logit learning. Numerous previous studies on logit dynamics provide numerical evidence of bifurcations of multiple fixed points for several types of games. Our results here provide a more explicit analysis of the logit fixed points and their stability properties for the entire class of two-strategy population games -- by way of the $r$-Lambert function. We find that for Prisoner's Dilemma and anti-coordination games, there is only a single fixed point for all rationality levels. However, coordination games exhibit a pitchfork bifurcation: there is a single fixed point in a low-rationality regime, and three fixed points in a high-rationality regime. We provide an implicit characterization for the level of rationality where this bifurcation occurs. In all cases, the set of logit fixed points converges to the full set of Nash equilibria in the high rationality limit.</description>

      <title>Advancements in Electric Vehicle Charging Optimization: A Survey of Reinforcement Learning Approaches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16425v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In response to global warming and energy shortages, there has been a significant shift towards integrating renewable energy sources, energy storage systems, and electric vehicles. Deploying electric vehicles within smart grids offers a promising solution to reduce carbon emissions. However, managing the charging and discharging processes of them as distributed power supplies present significant challenges. Additionally, the intermittent nature of renewable energy, uncertainties in electric vehicle-related parameters, fluctuating energy prices, and varying loads make maintaining stable power system operations more complex. Effective management systems for electric vehicle battery charging are crucial to coordinating these processes and ensuring a secure, efficient, and reliable power system. Reinforcement learning, enhanced by deep learning, has gained substantial interest for its model-free approach and real-time optimization, effectively managing electric vehicle charging by maximizing cumulative rewards. This review synthesizes existing literature on reinforcement learning-based frameworks, objectives, and architectures for electric vehicle charging coordination strategies in power systems, classifying methods into centralized and decentralized categories. Additionally, the article offers suggestions for future research directions to further enhance reinforcement learning-based electric vehicle charging optimization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17553v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we quantify voltage and current phasor-based measurement requirements for the unique estimation of the electric grid topology and admittance parameters. Our approach is underpinned by the concept of a rigidity matrix that has been extensively studied in graph rigidity theory. Specifically, we show that the rank of the rigidity matrix is the same as that of a voltage coefficient matrix in a corresponding electric power system. Accordingly, we show that there is a minimum number of measurements required to uniquely estimate the admittance matrix and corresponding grid topology. By means of a numerical example on the IEEE 4-node radial network, we demonstrate that our approach is suitable for applications in electric power grids.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01918v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Numerous real-world systems, including manufacturing processes, supply chains, and robotic systems, involve multiple independent entities with diverse objectives. The potential for conflicts arises from the inability of these entities to accurately predict and anticipate each other's actions. To address this challenge, we propose the Preemptive Holistic Collaborative System (PHCS) framework. By enabling information sharing and collaborative planning among independent entities, the PHCS facilitates the preemptive resolution of potential conflicts. We apply the PHCS framework to the specific context of road transportation, resulting in the Preemptive Holistic Collaborative Road Transportation System (PHCRTS). This system leverages shared driving intentions and pre-planned trajectories to optimize traffic flow and enhance safety. Simulation experiments in a two-lane merging scenario demonstrate the effectiveness of PHCRTS, reducing vehicle time delays by 90%, increasing traffic capacity by 300%, and eliminating accidents. The PHCS framework offers a promising approach to optimize the performance and safety of complex systems with multiple independent entities.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-Aware Critic Augmentation for Hierarchical Multi-Agent EV Charging Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18047v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The advanced bidirectional EV charging and discharging technology, aimed at supporting grid stability and emergency operations, has driven a growing interest in workplace applications. It not only reduces electricity expenses but also enhances the resilience in handling practical matters, such as peak power limitation, fluctuating energy prices, and unpredictable EV departures. Considering these factors systematically can benefit energy efficiency in office buildings and for EV users simultaneously. To employ AI to address these issues, we propose HUCA, a novel real-time charging control for regulating energy demands for both the building and EVs. HUCA employs hierarchical actor-critic networks to dynamically reduce electricity costs in buildings, accounting for the needs of EV charging in the dynamic pricing scenario. To tackle the uncertain EV departures, we introduce a new critic augmentation to account for departure uncertainties in evaluating the charging decisions, while maintaining the robustness of the charging control. Experiments on real-world electricity datasets under both simulated certain and uncertain departure scenarios demonstrate that HUCA outperforms baselines in terms of total electricity costs while maintaining competitive performance in fulfilling EV charging requirements. A case study also manifests that HUCA effectively balances energy supply between the building and EVs based on real-time information, showcasing its potential as a key AI-driven solution for vehicle charging control.</description>

Abstract: A framework for identifying nonlinear port-Hamiltonian systems using input-state-output data is introduced. The framework utilizes neural networks' universal approximation capacity to effectively represent complex dynamics in a structured way. We show that using the structure helps to make long-term predictions compared to baselines that do not incorporate physics. We also explore different architectures based on MLPs, KANs, and using prior information. The technique is validated through examples featuring nonlinearities in either the skew-symmetric terms, the dissipative terms, or the Hamiltonian.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04195v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper integrates prior knowledge into direct learning of safe controllers for linear uncertain systems under disturbances. To this end, we characterize the set of all closed-loop systems that can be explained by available prior knowledge of the system model and the disturbances. We leverage matrix zonotopes for data-based characterization of closed-loop systems and show that the explainability of closed-loop systems by prior knowledge can be formalized by adding an equality conformity constraint to the matrix zonotope. We then leverage the resulting constraint matrix zonotope and design safe controllers that conform with both data and prior knowledge. This is achieved by ensuring the inclusion of a constrained zonotope of all possible next states in a {\lambda}-scaled level set of the safe set. We consider both polytope and zonotope safe sets and provide set inclusion conditions using linear programming.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04649v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integer-order calculus often falls short in capturing the long-range dependencies and memory effects found in many real-world processes. Fractional calculus addresses these gaps via fractional-order integrals and derivatives, but fractional-order dynamical systems pose substantial challenges in system identification and optimal control due to the lack of standard control methodologies. In this paper, we theoretically derive the optimal control via linear quadratic regulator (LQR) for fractional-order linear time-invariant (FOLTI) systems and develop an end-to-end deep learning framework based on this theoretical foundation. Our approach establishes a rigorous mathematical model, derives analytical solutions, and incorporates deep learning to achieve data-driven optimal control of FOLTI systems. Our key contributions include: (i) proposing an innovative system identification method control strategy for FOLTI systems, (ii) developing the first end-to-end data-driven learning framework, Fractional-Order Learning for Optimal Control (FOLOC), that learns control policies from observed trajectories, and (iii) deriving a theoretical analysis of sample complexity to quantify the number of samples required for accurate optimal control in complex real-world problems. Experimental results indicate that our method accurately approximates fractional-order system behaviors without relying on Gaussian noise assumptions, pointing to promising avenues for advanced optimal control.</description>

Abstract: We propose a novel non-parametric learning paradigm for the identification of drift and diffusion coefficients of multi-dimensional non-linear stochastic differential equations, which relies upon discrete-time observations of the state. The key idea essentially consists of fitting a RKHS-based approximation of the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation to such observations, yielding theoretical estimates of non-asymptotic learning rates which, unlike previous works, become increasingly tighter when the regularity of the unknown drift and diffusion coefficients becomes higher. Our method being kernel-based, offline pre-processing may be profitably leveraged to enable efficient numerical implementation, offering excellent balance between precision and computational complexity.</description>

      <title>On convergence analysis of feedback control with integral action and discontinuous relay perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03724v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider third-order dynamic systems which have an integral feedback action and discontinuous relay disturbance. More specifically for the applications, the focus is on the integral plus state-feedback control of the motion systems with discontinuous Coulomb-type friction. We recall the stiction region is globally attractive where the resulting hybrid system has also solutions in Filippov sense, while the motion trajectories remain in that idle state (called in tribology as stiction) until the formulated sliding-mode condition is violated by the growing integral feedback quantity. We analyze the conditions for occurrence of the slowly converging stick-slip cycles. We also show that the hybrid system is globally but only asymptotically stable, and almost always not exponentially. A particular case of the exponential convergence can appear for some initial values, assuming the characteristic equation of the linear subsystem has dominant real roots. Illustrative numerical examples are provided alongside with the developed analysis. In addition, a laboratory example is shown with experimental evidence to support the convergence analysis provided.</description>

      <title>A Master-Follower Teleoperation System for Robotic Catheterization: Design, Characterization, and Tracking Control</title>

Abstract: Minimally invasive robotic surgery has gained significant attention over the past two decades. Telerobotic systems, combined with robot-mediated minimally invasive techniques, have enabled surgeons and clinicians to mitigate radiation exposure for medical staff and extend medical services to remote and hard-to-reach areas. To enhance these services, teleoperated robotic surgery systems incorporating master and follower devices should offer transparency, enabling surgeons and clinicians to remotely experience a force interaction similar to the one the follower device experiences with patients' bodies. This paper presents the design and development of a three-degree-of-freedom master-follower teleoperated system for robotic catheterization. To resemble manual intervention by clinicians, the follower device features a grip-insert-release mechanism to eliminate catheter buckling and torsion during operation. The bidirectionally navigable ablation catheter is statically characterized for force-interactive medical interventions. The system's performance is evaluated through approaching and open-loop path tracking over typical circular, infinity-like, and spiral paths. Path tracking errors are presented as mean Euclidean error (MEE) and mean absolute error (MAE). The MEE ranges from 0.64 cm (infinity-like path) to 1.53 cm (spiral path). The MAE also ranges from 0.81 cm (infinity-like path) to 1.92 cm (spiral path). The results indicate that while the system's precision and accuracy with an open-loop controller meet the design targets, closed-loop controllers are necessary to address the catheter's hysteresis and dead zone, and system nonlinearities.</description>

      <title>RoboMNIST: A Multimodal Dataset for Multi-Robot Activity Recognition Using WiFi Sensing, Video, and Audio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16703v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel dataset for multi-robot activity recognition (MRAR) using two robotic arms integrating WiFi channel state information (CSI), video, and audio data. This multimodal dataset utilizes signals of opportunity, leveraging existing WiFi infrastructure to provide detailed indoor environmental sensing without additional sensor deployment. Data were collected using two Franka Emika robotic arms, complemented by three cameras, three WiFi sniffers to collect CSI, and three microphones capturing distinct yet complementary audio data streams. The combination of CSI, visual, and auditory data can enhance robustness and accuracy in MRAR. This comprehensive dataset enables a holistic understanding of robotic environments, facilitating advanced autonomous operations that mimic human-like perception and interaction. By repurposing ubiquitous WiFi signals for environmental sensing, this dataset offers significant potential aiming to advance robotic perception and autonomous systems. It provides a valuable resource for developing sophisticated decision-making and adaptive capabilities in dynamic environments.</description>

      <title>Lyapunov Neural ODE State-Feedback Control Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00393v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks are increasingly used as an effective way to represent control policies in various learning-based control paradigms. For continuous-time optimal control problems (OCPs), which are central to many decision-making tasks, control policy learning can be cast as a neural ordinary differential equation (NODE) problem wherein state and control constraints are naturally accommodated. This paper presents a NODE approach to solving continuous-time OCPs for the case of stabilizing a known constrained nonlinear system around an equilibrium state. The approach, termed Lyapunov-NODE control (L-NODEC), uses a novel Lyapunov loss formulation that incorporates an exponentially-stabilizing control Lyapunov function to learn a state-feedback neural control policy. The proposed Lyapunov loss allows L-NODEC to guarantee exponential stability of the controlled system, as well as its adversarial robustness to perturbations to the initial state. The performance of L-NODEC is illustrated in two problems, including a dose delivery problem in plasma medicine, wherein L-NODEC effectively stabilizes the controlled system around the equilibrium state despite perturbations to the initial state and reduces the inference time necessary to reach equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Image-Based Visual Servoing for Enhanced Cooperation of Dual-Arm Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19432v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The cooperation of a pair of robot manipulators is required to manipulate a target object without any fixtures. The conventional control methods coordinate the end-effector pose of each manipulator with that of the other using their kinematics and joint coordinate measurements. Yet, the manipulators' inaccurate kinematics and joint coordinate measurements can cause significant pose synchronization errors in practice. This paper thus proposes an image-based visual servoing approach for enhancing the cooperation of a dual-arm manipulation system. On top of the classical control, the visual servoing controller lets each manipulator use its carried camera to measure the image features of the other's marker and adapt its end-effector pose with the counterpart on the move. Because visual measurements are robust to kinematic errors, the proposed control can reduce the end-effector pose synchronization errors and the fluctuations of the interaction forces of the pair of manipulators on the move. Theoretical analyses have rigorously proven the stability of the closed-loop system. Comparative experiments on real robots have substantiated the effectiveness of the proposed control.</description>
