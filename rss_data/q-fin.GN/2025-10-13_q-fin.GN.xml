      <title>A Multimodal Approach to SME Credit Scoring Integrating Transaction and Ownership Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) are known to play a vital role in economic growth, employment, and innovation. However, they tend to face significant challenges in accessing credit due to limited financial histories, collateral constraints, and exposure to macroeconomic shocks. These challenges make an accurate credit risk assessment by lenders crucial, particularly since SMEs frequently operate within interconnected firm networks through which default risk can propagate. This paper presents and tests a novel approach for modelling the risk of SME credit, using a unique large data set of SME loans provided by a prominent financial institution. Specifically, our approach employs Graph Neural Networks to predict SME default using multilayer network data derived from common ownership and financial transactions between firms. We show that combining this information with traditional structured data not only improves application scoring performance, but also explicitly models contagion risk between companies. Further analysis shows how the directionality and intensity of these connections influence financial risk contagion, offering a deeper understanding of the underlying processes. Our findings highlight the predictive power of network data, as well as the role of supply chain networks in exposing SMEs to correlated default risk.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Machine Learning for Predicting Startup Funding, Patenting, and Exits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study develops an interpretable machine learning framework to forecast startup outcomes, including funding, patenting, and exit. A firm-quarter panel for 2010-2023 is constructed from Crunchbase and matched to U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) data. Three horizons are evaluated: next funding within 12 months, patent-stock growth within 24 months, and exit through an initial public offering (IPO) or acquisition within 36 months. Preprocessing is fit on a development window (2010-2019) and applied without change to later cohorts to avoid leakage. Class imbalance is addressed using inverse-prevalence weights and the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique for Nominal and Continuous features (SMOTE-NC). Logistic regression and tree ensembles, including Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost, are compared using the area under the precision-recall curve (PR-AUC) and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). Patent, funding, and exit predictions achieve AUROC values of 0.921, 0.817, and 0.872, providing transparent and reproducible rankings for innovation finance.</description>
