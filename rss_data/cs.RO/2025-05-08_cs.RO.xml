      <title>Soft yet Effective Robots via Holistic Co-Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soft robots promise inherent safety via their material compliance for seamless interactions with humans or delicate environments. Yet, their development is challenging because it requires integrating materials, geometry, actuation, and autonomy into complex mechatronic systems. Despite progress, the field struggles to balance task-specific performance with broader factors like durability and manufacturability - a difficulty that we find is compounded by traditional sequential design processes with their lack of feedback loops. In this perspective, we review emerging co-design approaches that simultaneously optimize the body and brain, enabling the discovery of unconventional designs highly tailored to the given tasks. We then identify three key shortcomings that limit the broader adoption of such co-design methods within the soft robotics domain. First, many rely on simulation-based evaluations focusing on a single metric, while real-world designs must satisfy diverse criteria. Second, current methods emphasize computational modeling without ensuring feasible realization, risking sim-to-real performance gaps. Third, high computational demands limit the exploration of the complete design space. Finally, we propose a holistic co-design framework that addresses these challenges by incorporating a broader range of design values, integrating real-world prototyping to refine evaluations, and boosting efficiency through surrogate metrics and model-based control strategies. This holistic framework, by simultaneously optimizing functionality, durability, and manufacturability, has the potential to enhance reliability and foster broader acceptance of soft robotics, transforming human-robot interactions.</description>

      <title>Towards Cognitive Collaborative Robots: Semantic-Level Integration and Explainable Control for Human-Centric Cooperation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is a preprint of a review article that has not yet undergone peer review. The content is intended for early dissemination and academic discussion. The final version may differ upon formal publication. As the Fourth Industrial Revolution reshapes industrial paradigms, human-robot collaboration (HRC) has transitioned from a desirable capability to an operational necessity. In response, collaborative robots (Cobots) are evolving beyond repetitive tasks toward adaptive, semantically informed interaction with humans and environments. This paper surveys five foundational pillars enabling this transformation: semantic-level perception, cognitive action planning, explainable learning and control, safety-aware motion design, and multimodal human intention recognition. We examine the role of semantic mapping in transforming spatial data into meaningful context, and explore cognitive planning frameworks that leverage this context for goal-driven decision-making. Additionally, we analyze explainable reinforcement learning methods, including policy distillation and attention mechanisms, which enhance interpretability and trust. Safety is addressed through force-adaptive control and risk-aware trajectory planning, while seamless human interaction is supported via gaze and gesture-based intent recognition. Despite these advancements, challenges such as perception-action disjunction, real-time explainability limitations, and incomplete human trust persist. To address these, we propose a unified Cognitive Synergy Architecture, integrating all modules into a cohesive framework for truly human-centric cobot collaboration.</description>

      <title>Satellite Autonomous Clock Fault Monitoring with Inter-Satellite Ranges Using Euclidean Distance Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To address the need for robust positioning, navigation, and timing services in lunar environments, this paper proposes a novel onboard clock phase jump detection framework for satellite constellations using range measurements obtained from dual one-way inter-satellite links. Our approach leverages vertex redundantly rigid graphs to detect faults without relying on prior knowledge of satellite positions or clock biases, providing flexibility for lunar satellite networks with diverse satellite types and operators. We model satellite constellations as graphs, where satellites are vertices and inter-satellite links are edges. The proposed algorithm detects and identifies satellites with clock jumps by monitoring the singular values of the geometric-centered Euclidean distance matrix (GCEDM) of 5-clique sub-graphs. The proposed method is validated through simulations of a GPS constellation and a notional constellation around the Moon, demonstrating its effectiveness in various configurations.</description>

      <title>Bridging Model Predictive Control and Deep Learning for Scalable Reachability Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis is a widely used method for ensuring the safety of robotic systems. Traditional approaches compute reachable sets by numerically solving an HJ Partial Differential Equation (PDE) over a grid, which is computationally prohibitive due to the curse of dimensionality. Recent learning-based methods have sought to address this challenge by approximating reachability solutions using neural networks trained with PDE residual error. However, these approaches often suffer from unstable training dynamics and suboptimal solutions due to the weak learning signal provided by the residual loss. In this work, we propose a novel approach that leverages model predictive control (MPC) techniques to guide and accelerate the reachability learning process. Observing that HJ reachability is inherently rooted in optimal control, we utilize MPC to generate approximate reachability solutions at key collocation points, which are then used to tactically guide the neural network training by ensuring compliance with these approximations. Moreover, we iteratively refine the MPC generated solutions using the learned reachability solution, mitigating convergence to local optima. Case studies on a 2D vertical drone, a 13D quadrotor, a 7D F1Tenth car, and a 40D publisher-subscriber system demonstrate that bridging MPC with deep learning yields significant improvements in the robustness and accuracy of reachable sets, as well as corresponding safety assurances, compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Contact-Aware Safety in Soft Robots Using High-Order Control Barrier and Lyapunov Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robots operating alongside people, particularly in sensitive scenarios such as aiding the elderly with daily tasks or collaborating with workers in manufacturing, must guarantee safety and cultivate user trust. Continuum soft manipulators promise safety through material compliance, but as designs evolve for greater precision, payload capacity, and speed, and increasingly incorporate rigid elements, their injury risk resurfaces. In this letter, we introduce a comprehensive High-Order Control Barrier Function (HOCBF) + High-Order Control Lyapunov Function (HOCLF) framework that enforces strict contact force limits across the entire soft-robot body during environmental interactions. Our approach combines a differentiable Piecewise Cosserat-Segment (PCS) dynamics model with a convex-polygon distance approximation metric, named Differentiable Conservative Separating Axis Theorem (DCSAT), based on the soft robot geometry to enable real-time, whole-body collision detection, resolution, and enforcement of the safety constraints. By embedding HOCBFs into our optimization routine, we guarantee safety and actively regulate environmental coupling, allowing, for instance, safe object manipulation under HOCLF-driven motion objectives. Extensive planar simulations demonstrate that our method maintains safety-bounded contacts while achieving precise shape and task-space regulation. This work thus lays a foundation for the deployment of soft robots in human-centric environments with provable safety and performance.</description>

      <title>OpenHelix: A Short Survey, Empirical Analysis, and Open-Source Dual-System VLA Model for Robotic Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dual-system VLA (Vision-Language-Action) architectures have become a hot topic in embodied intelligence research, but there is a lack of sufficient open-source work for further performance analysis and optimization. To address this problem, this paper will summarize and compare the structural designs of existing dual-system architectures, and conduct systematic empirical evaluations on the core design elements of existing dual-system architectures. Ultimately, it will provide a low-cost open-source model for further exploration. Of course, this project will continue to update with more experimental conclusions and open-source models with improved performance for everyone to choose from.

      <title>Improving Failure Prediction in Aircraft Fastener Assembly Using Synthetic Data in Imbalanced Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automating aircraft manufacturing still relies heavily on human labor due to the complexity of the assembly processes and customization requirements. One key challenge is achieving precise positioning, especially for large aircraft structures, where errors can lead to substantial maintenance costs or part rejection. Existing solutions often require costly hardware or lack flexibility. Used in aircraft by the thousands, threaded fasteners, e.g., screws, bolts, and collars, are traditionally executed by fixed-base robots and usually have problems in being deployed in the mentioned manufacturing sites. This paper emphasizes the importance of error detection and classification for efficient and safe assembly of threaded fasteners, especially aeronautical collars. Safe assembly of threaded fasteners is paramount since acquiring sufficient data for training deep learning models poses challenges due to the rarity of failure cases and imbalanced datasets. The paper addresses this by proposing techniques like class weighting and data augmentation, specifically tailored for temporal series data, to improve classification performance. Furthermore, the paper introduces a novel problem-modeling approach, emphasizing metrics relevant to collar assembly rather than solely focusing on accuracy. This tailored approach enhances the models' capability to handle the challenges of threaded fastener assembly effectively.</description>

      <title>Omnidirectional vision sensors based on catadioptric systems with discrete infrared photoreceptors for swarm robotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we fabricated and studied two designs for omnidirectional vision sensors for swarm robotics, based on catadioptric systems consisting of a mirror with rotational symmetry, eight discrete infrared photodiodes and a single LED, in order to provide localization and navigation abilities for mobile robotic agents. We considered two arrangements for the photodiodes: one in which they point upward into the mirror, and one in which they point outward, perpendicular to the mirror. To determine which design offers a better field of view on the plane, as well as detection of distance and orientation between two agents, we developed a test rail with three degrees of freedom to experimentally and systematically measure the signal registered by the photodiodes of a given sensor (in a single readout) from the light emitted by another as functions of the distance and orientation. Afterwards, we processed and analyzed the experimental data to develop mathematical models for the mean response of a photodiode in each design. Finally, by numerically inverting the models, we compared the two designs in terms of their accuracy. Our results show that the design with the photodiodes pointing upward resolves better the distance, while the other resolves better the orientation of the emitting agent, both providing an omnidirectional field of view.</description>

      <title>MIHRaGe: A Mixed-Reality Interface for Human-Robot Interaction via Gaze-Oriented Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Individuals with upper limb mobility impairments often require assistive technologies to perform activities of daily living. While gaze-tracking has emerged as a promising method for robotic assistance, existing solutions lack sufficient feedback mechanisms, leading to uncertainty in user intent recognition and reduced adaptability. This paper presents the MIHRAGe interface, an integrated system that combines gaze-tracking, robotic assistance, and a mixed-reality to create an immersive environment for controlling the robot using only eye movements. The system was evaluated through an experimental protocol involving four participants, assessing gaze accuracy, robotic positioning precision, and the overall success of a pick and place task. Results showed an average gaze fixation error of 1.46 cm, with individual variations ranging from 1.28 cm to 2.14 cm. The robotic arm demonstrated an average positioning error of +-1.53 cm, with discrepancies attributed to interface resolution and calibration constraints. In a pick and place task, the system achieved a success rate of 80%, highlighting its potential for improving accessibility in human-robot interaction with visual feedback to the user.</description>

      <title>NMPC-Lander: Nonlinear MPC with Barrier Function for UAV Landing on a Mobile Platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quadcopters are versatile aerial robots gaining popularity in numerous critical applications. However, their operational effectiveness is constrained by limited battery life and restricted flight range. To address these challenges, autonomous drone landing on stationary or mobile charging and battery-swapping stations has become an essential capability. In this study, we present NMPC-Lander, a novel control architecture that integrates Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) with Control Barrier Functions (CBF) to achieve precise and safe autonomous landing on both static and dynamic platforms. Our approach employs NMPC for accurate trajectory tracking and landing, while simultaneously incorporating CBF to ensure collision avoidance with static obstacles. Experimental evaluations on the real hardware demonstrate high precision in landing scenarios, with an average final position error of 9.0 cm and 11 cm for stationary and mobile platforms, respectively. Notably, NMPC-Lander outperforms the B-spline combined with the A* planning method by nearly threefold in terms of position tracking, underscoring its superior robustness and practical effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Scalable Aerial GNSS Localization for Marine Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate localization is crucial for water robotics, yet traditional onboard Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) approaches are difficult or ineffective due to signal reflection on the water's surface and its high cost of aquatic GNSS receivers. Existing approaches, such as inertial navigation, Doppler Velocity Loggers (DVL), SLAM, and acoustic-based methods, face challenges like error accumulation and high computational complexity. Therefore, a more efficient and scalable solution remains necessary. This paper proposes an alternative approach that leverages an aerial drone equipped with GNSS localization to track and localize a marine robot once it is near the surface of the water. Our results show that this novel adaptation enables accurate single and multi-robot marine robot localization.</description>

      <title>NAMO-LLM: Efficient Navigation Among Movable Obstacles with Large Language Model Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several planners have been proposed to compute robot paths that reach desired goal regions while avoiding obstacles. However, these methods fail when all pathways to the goal are blocked. In such cases, the robot must reason about how to reconfigure the environment to access task-relevant regions - a problem known as Navigation Among Movable Objects (NAMO). While various solutions to this problem have been developed, they often struggle to scale to highly cluttered environments. To address this, we propose NAMO-LLM, a sampling-based planner that searches over robot and obstacle configurations to compute feasible plans specifying which obstacles to move, where, and in what order. Its key novelty is a non-uniform sampling strategy guided by Large Language Models (LLMs) biasing the tree construction toward directions more likely to yield a solution. We show that NAMO-LLM is probabilistically complete and demonstrate through experiments that it efficiently scales to cluttered environments, outperforming related works in both runtime and plan quality.</description>

      <title>SCU-Hand: Soft Conical Universal Robotic Hand for Scooping Granular Media from Containers of Various Sizes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automating small-scale experiments in materials science presents challenges due to the heterogeneous nature of experimental setups. This study introduces the SCU-Hand (Soft Conical Universal Robot Hand), a novel end-effector designed to automate the task of scooping powdered samples from various container sizes using a robotic arm. The SCU- Hand employs a flexible, conical structure that adapts to dif- ferent container geometries through deformation, maintaining consistent contact without complex force sensing or machine learning-based control methods. Its reconfigurable mechanism allows for size adjustment, enabling efficient scooping from diverse container types. By combining soft robotics principles with a sheet-morphing design, our end-effector achieves high flexibility while retaining the necessary stiffness for effective powder manipulation. We detail the design principles, fabri- cation process, and experimental validation of the SCU-Hand. Experimental validation showed that the scooping capacity is about 20% higher than that of a commercial tool, with a scooping performance of more than 95% for containers of sizes between 67 mm to 110 mm. This research contributes to laboratory automation by offering a cost-effective, easily implementable solution for automating tasks such as materials synthesis and characterization processes.</description>

      <title>Beyond Task Performance: Human Experience in Human-Robot Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human interaction experience plays a crucial role in the effectiveness of human-machine collaboration, especially as interactions in future systems progress towards tighter physical and functional integration. While automation design has been shown to impact task performance, its influence on human experi- ence metrics such as flow, sense of agency (SoA), and embodiment remains underexplored. This study investigates how variations in automation design affect these psychological experience mea- sures and examines correlations between subjective experience and physiological indicators. A user study was conducted in a simulated wood workshop, where participants collaborated with a lightweight robot under four automation levels. The results of the study indicate that medium automation levels enhance flow, SoA and embodiment, striking a balance between support and user autonomy. In contrast, higher automation, despite optimizing task performance, diminishes perceived flow and agency. Furthermore, we observed that grip force might be considered as a real-time proxy of SoA, while correlations with heart rate variability were inconclusive. The findings underscore the necessity for automation strategies that integrate human- centric metrics, aiming to optimize both performance and user experience in collaborative robotic systems</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automating the packing of objects with robots is a key challenge in industrial automation, where efficient object perception plays a fundamental role. This paper focuses on scenarios where precise 3D reconstruction is not required, prioritizing cost-effective and scalable solutions. The proposed Low-Resolution Next Best View (LR-NBV) algorithm leverages a utility function that balances pose redundancy and acquisition density, ensuring efficient object reconstruction. Experimental validation demonstrates that LR-NBV consistently outperforms standard NBV approaches, achieving comparable accuracy with significantly fewer poses. This method proves highly suitable for applications requiring efficiency, scalability, and adaptability without relying on high-precision sensing.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning-based Cooperative Autonomous Driving in Smart Intersections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unsignalized intersections pose significant safety and efficiency challenges due to complex traffic flows. This paper proposes a novel roadside unit (RSU)-centric cooperative driving system leveraging global perception and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication. The core of the system is an RSU-based decision-making module using a two-stage hybrid reinforcement learning (RL) framework. At first, policies are pre-trained offline using conservative Q-learning (CQL) combined with behavior cloning (BC) on collected dataset. Subsequently, these policies are fine-tuned in the simulation using multi-agent proximal policy optimization (MAPPO), aligned with a self-attention mechanism to effectively solve inter-agent dependencies. RSUs perform real-time inference based on the trained models to realize vehicle control via V2I communications. Extensive experiments in CARLA environment demonstrate high effectiveness of the proposed system, by: \textit{(i)} achieving failure rates below 0.03\% in coordinating three connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) through complex intersection scenarios, significantly outperforming the traditional Autoware control method, and \textit{(ii)} exhibiting strong robustness across varying numbers of controlled agents and shows promising generalization capabilities on other maps.</description>

      <title>Automating Box Folding: Sequence Extraction and Ranking Methodologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Box folding represents a crucial challenge for automated packaging systems. This work bridges the gap between existing methods for folding sequence extraction and approaches focused on the adaptability of automated systems to specific box types. An innovative method is proposed to identify and rank folding sequences, enabling the transformation of a box from an initial state to a desired final configuration. The system evaluates and ranks these sequences based on their feasibility and compatibility with available hardware, providing recommendations for real-world implementations. Finally, an illustrative use case is presented, where a robot performs the folding of a box.</description>

      <title>RGB-Event Fusion with Self-Attention for Collision Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring robust and real-time obstacle avoidance is critical for the safe operation of autonomous robots in dynamic, real-world environments. This paper proposes a neural network framework for predicting the time and collision position of an unmanned aerial vehicle with a dynamic object, using RGB and event-based vision sensors. The proposed architecture consists of two separate encoder branches, one for each modality, followed by fusion by self-attention to improve prediction accuracy. To facilitate benchmarking, we leverage the ABCD [8] dataset collected that enables detailed comparisons of single-modality and fusion-based approaches. At the same prediction throughput of 50Hz, the experimental results show that the fusion-based model offers an improvement in prediction accuracy over single-modality approaches of 1% on average and 10% for distances beyond 0.5m, but comes at the cost of +71% in memory and + 105% in FLOPs. Notably, the event-based model outperforms the RGB model by 4% for position and 26% for time error at a similar computational cost, making it a competitive alternative. Additionally, we evaluate quantized versions of the event-based models, applying 1- to 8-bit quantization to assess the trade-offs between predictive performance and computational efficiency. These findings highlight the trade-offs of multi-modal perception using RGB and event-based cameras in robotic applications.</description>

      <title>A Case Study on the Application of Digital Twins for Enhancing CPS Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To ensure the availability and reduce the downtime of complex cyber-physical systems across different domains, e.g., agriculture and manufacturing, fault tolerance mechanisms are implemented which are complex in both their development and operation. In addition, cyber-physical systems are often confronted with limited hardware resources or are legacy systems, both often hindering the addition of new functionalities directly on the onboard hardware. Digital Twins can be adopted to offload expensive computations, as well as providing support through fault tolerance mechanisms, thus decreasing costs and operational downtime of cyber-physical systems. In this paper, we show the feasibility of a Digital Twin used for enhancing cyber-physical system operations, specifically through functional augmentation and increased fault tolerance, in an industry-oriented use case.</description>

      <title>Do We Still Need to Work on Odometry for Autonomous Driving?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past decades, a tremendous amount of work has addressed the topic of ego-motion estimation of moving platforms based on various proprioceptive and exteroceptive sensors. At the cost of ever-increasing computational load and sensor complexity, odometry algorithms have reached impressive levels of accuracy with minimal drift in various conditions. In this paper, we question the need for more research on odometry for autonomous driving by assessing the accuracy of one of the simplest algorithms: the direct integration of wheel encoder data and yaw rate measurements from a gyroscope. We denote this algorithm as Odometer-Gyroscope (OG) odometry. This work shows that OG odometry can outperform current state-of-the-art radar-inertial SE(2) odometry for a fraction of the computational cost in most scenarios. For example, the OG odometry is on top of the Boreas leaderboard with a relative translation error of 0.20%, while the second-best method displays an error of 0.26%. Lidar-inertial approaches can provide more accurate estimates, but the computational load is three orders of magnitude higher than the OG odometry. To further the analysis, we have pushed the limits of the OG odometry by purposely violating its fundamental no-slip assumption using data collected during a heavy snowstorm with different driving behaviours. Our conclusion shows that a significant amount of slippage is required to result in non-satisfactory pose estimates from the OG odometry.</description>

      <title>Estimating Dynamic Soft Continuum Robot States From Boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate state estimation is essential for effective control of robots. For soft robots, this task is particularly challenging because their states are inherently infinite-dimensional functions due to the robots' continuous deformability. Traditional sensing techniques, however, can only provide discrete measurements. Recently, a dynamic state estimation method known as a boundary observer was introduced, which leverages Cosserat rod theory to recover all infinite-dimensional states by measuring only the velocity twist at the robot's tip. In this work, we present a novel boundary observer that can also recover infinite-dimensional dynamic states, but instead relies on measuring the internal wrench at the robot's base. This design exploits the duality between the velocity twist at the tip and the internal wrench at the base, with both types of boundary observers being inspired by principles of energy dissipation. Despite the mathematical duality, the proposed approach offers a distinct advantage: it requires only a 6-axis force/torque sensor embedded at the base, eliminating the need for external sensing systems such as motion capture cameras. Moreover, combining both tip- and base-based techniques enhances energy dissipation, accelerates convergence, and improves estimation accuracy. We validate the proposed algorithms through both simulation studies and experiments based on tendon-driven continuum robots. Our results demonstrate that all boundary observers converge to the ground truth within 3 seconds, even with significantly deviated initial conditions. Furthermore, they recover from unknown perturbations and effectively track high-frequency vibrations. We also show that combining the dual techniques further improves convergence speed and accuracy. Finally, the computational efficiency of these algorithms indicates their feasibility for real-time state estimation.</description>

Abstract: Model-based planning and execution systems offer a principled approach to building flexible autonomous robots that can perform diverse tasks by automatically combining a host of basic skills. This idea is almost as old as modern robotics. Yet, while diverse general-purpose reasoning architectures have been proposed since, general-purpose systems that are integrated with modern robotic platforms have emerged only recently, starting with the influential ROSPlan system. Since then, a growing number of model-based systems for robot task-level control have emerged. In this paper, we consider the diverse design choices and issues existing systems attempt to address, the different solutions proposed so far, and suggest avenues for future development.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Task Decomposition for Execution Monitoring and Error Recovery: Understanding the Rationale Behind Task Demonstrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-step manipulation tasks where robots interact with their environment and must apply process forces based on the perceived situation remain challenging to learn and prone to execution errors. Accurately simulating these tasks is also difficult. Hence, it is crucial for robust task performance to learn how to coordinate end-effector pose and applied force, monitor execution, and react to deviations. To address these challenges, we propose a learning approach that directly infers both low- and high-level task representations from user demonstrations on the real system. We developed an unsupervised task segmentation algorithm that combines intention recognition and feature clustering to infer the skills of a task. We leverage the inferred characteristic features of each skill in a novel unsupervised anomaly detection approach to identify deviations from the intended task execution. Together, these components form a comprehensive framework capable of incrementally learning task decisions and new behaviors as new situations arise. Compared to state-of-the-art learning techniques, our approach significantly reduces the required amount of training data and computational complexity while efficiently learning complex in-contact behaviors and recovery strategies. Our proposed task segmentation and anomaly detection approaches outperform state-of-the-art methods on force-based tasks evaluated on two different robotic systems.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a compliant manipulation system capable of placing items onto densely packed shelves. The wide diversity of items and strict business requirements for high producing rates and low defect generation have prohibited warehouse robotics from performing this task. Our innovations in hardware, perception, decision-making, motion planning, and control have enabled this system to perform over 500,000 stows in a large e-commerce fulfillment center. The system achieves human levels of packing density and speed while prioritizing work on overhead shelves to enhance the safety of humans working alongside the robots.</description>

      <title>Modeling Personalized Difficulty of Rehabilitation Exercises Using Causal Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rehabilitation robots are often used in game-like interactions for rehabilitation to increase a person's motivation to complete rehabilitation exercises. By adjusting exercise difficulty for a specific user throughout the exercise interaction, robots can maximize both the user's rehabilitation outcomes and the their motivation throughout the exercise. Previous approaches have assumed exercises have generic difficulty values that apply to all users equally, however, we identified that stroke survivors have varied and unique perceptions of exercise difficulty. For example, some stroke survivors found reaching vertically more difficult than reaching farther but lower while others found reaching farther more challenging than reaching vertically. In this paper, we formulate a causal tree-based method to calculate exercise difficulty based on the user's performance. We find that this approach accurately models exercise difficulty and provides a readily interpretable model of why that exercise is difficult for both users and caretakers.</description>

      <title>PARC: Physics-based Augmentation with Reinforcement Learning for Character Controllers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Humans excel in navigating diverse, complex environments with agile motor skills, exemplified by parkour practitioners performing dynamic maneuvers, such as climbing up walls and jumping across gaps. Reproducing these agile movements with simulated characters remains challenging, in part due to the scarcity of motion capture data for agile terrain traversal behaviors and the high cost of acquiring such data. In this work, we introduce PARC (Physics-based Augmentation with Reinforcement Learning for Character Controllers), a framework that leverages machine learning and physics-based simulation to iteratively augment motion datasets and expand the capabilities of terrain traversal controllers. PARC begins by training a motion generator on a small dataset consisting of core terrain traversal skills. The motion generator is then used to produce synthetic data for traversing new terrains. However, these generated motions often exhibit artifacts, such as incorrect contacts or discontinuities. To correct these artifacts, we train a physics-based tracking controller to imitate the motions in simulation. The corrected motions are then added to the dataset, which is used to continue training the motion generator in the next iteration. PARC's iterative process jointly expands the capabilities of the motion generator and tracker, creating agile and versatile models for interacting with complex environments. PARC provides an effective approach to develop controllers for agile terrain traversal, which bridges the gap between the scarcity of motion data and the need for versatile character controllers.</description>

      <title>Trajectory Entropy Reinforcement Learning for Predictable and Robust Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simplicity is a critical inductive bias for designing data-driven controllers, especially when robustness is important. Despite the impressive results of deep reinforcement learning in complex control tasks, it is prone to capturing intricate and spurious correlations between observations and actions, leading to failure under slight perturbations to the environment. To tackle this problem, in this work we introduce a novel inductive bias towards simple policies in reinforcement learning. The simplicity inductive bias is introduced by minimizing the entropy of entire action trajectories, corresponding to the number of bits required to describe information in action trajectories after the agent observes state trajectories. Our reinforcement learning agent, Trajectory Entropy Reinforcement Learning, is optimized to minimize the trajectory entropy while maximizing rewards. We show that the trajectory entropy can be effectively estimated by learning a variational parameterized action prediction model, and use the prediction model to construct an information-regularized reward function. Furthermore, we construct a practical algorithm that enables the joint optimization of models, including the policy and the prediction model. Experimental evaluations on several high-dimensional locomotion tasks show that our learned policies produce more cyclical and consistent action trajectories, and achieve superior performance, and robustness to noise and dynamic changes than the state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>TrajEvo: Designing Trajectory Prediction Heuristics via LLM-driven Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trajectory prediction is a crucial task in modeling human behavior, especially in fields as social robotics and autonomous vehicle navigation. Traditional heuristics based on handcrafted rules often lack accuracy, while recently proposed deep learning approaches suffer from computational cost, lack of explainability, and generalization issues that limit their practical adoption. In this paper, we introduce TrajEvo, a framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically design trajectory prediction heuristics. TrajEvo employs an evolutionary algorithm to generate and refine prediction heuristics from past trajectory data. We introduce a Cross-Generation Elite Sampling to promote population diversity and a Statistics Feedback Loop allowing the LLM to analyze alternative predictions. Our evaluations show TrajEvo outperforms previous heuristic methods on the ETH-UCY datasets, and remarkably outperforms both heuristics and deep learning methods when generalizing to the unseen SDD dataset. TrajEvo represents a first step toward automated design of fast, explainable, and generalizable trajectory prediction heuristics. We make our source code publicly available to foster future research at https://github.com/ai4co/trajevo.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a robotic dummy head that fuses the acoustic realism of conventional audiological mannequins with the mobility of robots. The proposed device is capable of moving, talking, and listening as people do, and can be used to automate spatially-stationary audio experiments, thus accelerating the pace of audio research. Critically, the device may also be used as a moving sound source in dynamic experiments, due to its quiet motor. This feature differentiates our work from previous robotic acoustic research platforms. Validation that the robot enables high quality audio data collection is provided through various experiments and acoustic measurements. These experiments also demonstrate how the robot might be used to study adaptive binaural beamforming. Design files are provided as open-source to stimulate novel audio research.</description>

Abstract: Vision is well-known for its use in manipulation, especially using visual servoing. To make it robust, multiple cameras are needed to expand the field of view. That is computationally challenging. Merging multiple views and using Q-learning allows the design of more effective representations and optimization of sample efficiency. Such a solution might be expensive to deploy. To mitigate this, we introduce a Merge And Disentanglement (MAD) algorithm that efficiently merges views to increase sample efficiency while augmenting with single-view features to allow lightweight deployment and ensure robust policies. We demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of our approach using Meta-World and ManiSkill3. For project website and code, see https://aalmuzairee.github.io/mad</description>

Abstract: What does it take to build mobile manipulation systems that can competently operate on previously unseen objects in previously unseen environments? This work answers this question using opening of articulated structures as a mobile manipulation testbed. Specifically, our focus is on the end-to-end performance on this task without any privileged information, i.e. the robot starts at a location with the novel target articulated object in view, and has to approach the object and successfully open it. We first develop a system for this task, and then conduct 100+ end-to-end system tests across 13 real world test sites. Our large-scale study reveals a number of surprising findings: a) modular systems outperform end-to-end learned systems for this task, even when the end-to-end learned systems are trained on 1000+ demonstrations, b) perception, and not precise end-effector control, is the primary bottleneck to task success, and c) state-of-the-art articulation parameter estimation models developed in isolation struggle when faced with robot-centric viewpoints. Overall, our findings highlight the limitations of developing components of the pipeline in isolation and underscore the need for system-level research, providing a pragmatic roadmap for building generalizable mobile manipulation systems.

      <description>arXiv:2403.14293v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As robots become increasingly integrated into various industries, understanding how humans respond to robotic failures is critical. This study systematically examines trust dynamics and system design by analyzing human reactions to robot failures. We conducted a four-stage survey to explore how trust evolves throughout human-robot interactions. The first stage collected demographic data and initial trust levels. The second stage focused on preliminary expectations and perceptions of robotic capabilities. The third stage examined interaction details, including robot precision and error acknowledgment. Finally, the fourth stage assessed post-interaction perceptions, evaluating trust dynamics, forgiveness, and willingness to recommend robotic technologies. Results indicate that trust in robotic systems significantly increased when robots acknowledged their errors or limitations. Additionally, participants showed greater willingness to suggest robots for future tasks, highlighting the importance of direct engagement in shaping trust dynamics. These findings provide valuable insights for designing more transparent, responsive, and trustworthy robotic systems. By enhancing our understanding of human-robot interaction (HRI), this study contributes to the development of robotic technologies that foster greater public acceptance and adoption.</description>

      <title>LiRA: Light-Robust Adversary for Model-based Reinforcement Learning in Real World</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19617v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Model-based reinforcement learning has attracted much attention due to its high sample efficiency and is expected to be applied to real-world robotic applications. In the real world, as unobservable disturbances can lead to unexpected situations, robot policies should be taken to improve not only control performance but also robustness. Adversarial learning is an effective way to improve robustness, but excessive adversary would increase the risk of malfunction, and make the control performance too conservative. Therefore, this study addresses a new adversarial learning framework to make reinforcement learning robust moderately and not conservative too much. To this end, the adversarial learning is first rederived with variational inference. In addition, \textit{light robustness}, which allows for maximizing robustness within an acceptable performance degradation, is utilized as a constraint. As a result, the proposed framework, so-called LiRA, can automatically adjust adversary level, balancing robustness and conservativeness. The expected behaviors of LiRA are confirmed in numerical simulations. In addition, LiRA succeeds in learning a force-reactive gait control of a quadrupedal robot only with real-world data collected less than two hours.</description>

      <title>Multi-Robot Motion Planning with Diffusion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03072v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion models have recently been successfully applied to a wide range of robotics applications for learning complex multi-modal behaviors from data. However, prior works have mostly been confined to single-robot and small-scale environments due to the high sample complexity of learning multi-robot diffusion models. In this paper, we propose a method for generating collision-free multi-robot trajectories that conform to underlying data distributions while using only single-robot data. Our algorithm, Multi-robot Multi-model planning Diffusion (MMD), does so by combining learned diffusion models with classical search-based techniques -- generating data-driven motions under collision constraints. Scaling further, we show how to compose multiple diffusion models to plan in large environments where a single diffusion model fails to generalize well. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in planning for dozens of robots in a variety of simulated scenarios motivated by logistics environments.

      <description>arXiv:2502.05667v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The inherent uncertainty of dynamic environments poses significant challenges for modeling robot behavior, particularly in tasks such as collision avoidance. This paper presents an online controller synthesis framework tailored for robots equipped with deep learning-based perception components, with a focus on addressing distribution shifts. Our approach integrates periodic monitoring and repair mechanisms for the deep neural network perception component, followed by uncertainty reassessment. These uncertainty evaluations are injected into a parametric discrete-time markov chain, enabling the synthesis of robust controllers via probabilistic model checking. To ensure high system availability during the repair process, we propose a dual-component configuration that seamlessly transitions between operational states. Through a case study on robot collision avoidance, we demonstrate the efficacy of our method, showcasing substantial performance improvements over baseline approaches. This work provides a comprehensive and scalable solution for enhancing the safety and reliability of autonomous systems operating in uncertain environments.</description>

      <title>MonoForce: Learnable Image-conditioned Physics Engine</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10156v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel model for the prediction of robot trajectories on rough offroad terrain from the onboard camera images. This model enforces the laws of classical mechanics through a physics-aware neural symbolic layer while preserving the ability to learn from large-scale data as it is end-to-end differentiable. The proposed hybrid model integrates a black-box component that predicts robot-terrain interaction forces with a neural-symbolic layer. This layer includes a differentiable physics engine that computes the robot's trajectory by querying these forces at the points of contact with the terrain. As the proposed architecture comprises substantial geometrical and physics priors, the resulting model can also be seen as a learnable physics engine conditioned on real images that delivers $10^4$ trajectories per second. We argue and empirically demonstrate that this architecture reduces the sim-to-real gap and mitigates out-of-distribution sensitivity. The differentiability, in conjunction with the rapid simulation speed, makes the model well-suited for various applications including model predictive control, trajectory shooting, supervised and reinforcement learning or SLAM. The codes and data are publicly available.</description>

      <title>$\texttt{SPIN}$: distilling $\texttt{Skill-RRT}$ for long-horizon prehensile and non-prehensile manipulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18015v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current robots struggle with long-horizon manipulation tasks requiring sequences of prehensile and non-prehensile skills, contact-rich interactions, and long-term reasoning. We present $\texttt{SPIN}$ ($\textbf{S}$kill $\textbf{P}$lanning to $\textbf{IN}$ference), a framework that distills a computationally intensive planning algorithm into a policy via imitation learning. We propose $\texttt{Skill-RRT}$, an extension of RRT that incorporates skill applicability checks and intermediate object pose sampling for solving such long-horizon problems. To chain independently trained skills, we introduce $\textit{connectors}$, goal-conditioned policies trained to minimize object disturbance during transitions. High-quality demonstrations are generated with $\texttt{Skill-RRT}$ and distilled through noise-based replay in order to reduce online computation time. The resulting policy, trained entirely in simulation, transfers zero-shot to the real world and achieves over 80% success across three challenging long-horizon manipulation tasks and outperforms state-of-the-art hierarchical RL and planning methods.</description>

      <title>Evaluation Framework for Sensor Configuration Impact on Deep Learning-Based Perception</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05939v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current research on automotive perception systems predominantly focusses on either improving the performance of sensor technology or enhancing the perception functions in isolation. High-level perception functions are increasingly based on deep learning (DL) models due to their improved performance and generalisability compared to traditional algorithms. Despite the vital need to evaluate the performance of DL-based perception functions under real-world conditions using onboard sensor inputs, there is a lack of frameworks to implement such systematic evaluations. This paper presents a versatile framework to evaluate the impact of perception sensor modalities and parameter settings on DL-based perception functions. Using a simulation environment, the framework facilitates sensor modality selection and parameter tuning under different operational design domain conditions. Its effectiveness is demonstrated through a case study involving a state-of-the-art surround trajectory prediction model, highlighting performance differences across the sensor modalities radar and camera. Different settings for the parameter, horizontal field of view (HFOV) were evaluated to identify the optimal configuration. The results indicate that a radar sensor with a narrow HFOV is the most suitable configuration for the evaluated perception algorithm. The proposed framework offers a holistic approach to the design of the perception sensor suite, significantly contributing to the development of robust perception systems for automated driving systems.</description>

      <title>Bimanual Regrasp Planning and Control for Active Reduction of Object Pose Uncertainty</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22240v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Precisely grasping an object is a challenging task due to pose uncertainties. Conventional methods have used cameras and fixtures to reduce object uncertainty. They are effective but require intensive preparation, such as designing jigs based on the object geometry and calibrating cameras with high-precision tools fabricated using lasers. In this study, we propose a method to reduce the uncertainty of the position and orientation of a grasped object without using a fixture or a camera. Our method is based on the concept that the flat finger pads of a parallel gripper can reduce uncertainty along its opening/closing direction through flat surface contact. Three orthogonal grasps by parallel grippers with flat finger pads collectively constrain an object's position and orientation to a unique state. Guided by the concepts, we develop a regrasp planning and admittance control approach that sequentially finds and leverages three orthogonal grasps of two robotic arms to actively reduce uncertainties in the object pose. We evaluated the proposed method on different initial object uncertainties and verified that it had good repeatability. The deviation levels of the experimental trials were on the same order of magnitude as those of an optical tracking system, demonstrating strong relative inference performance.</description>

      <title>Graph-based Path Planning with Dynamic Obstacle Avoidance for Autonomous Parking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12616v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Safe and efficient path planning in parking scenarios presents a significant challenge due to the presence of cluttered environments filled with static and dynamic obstacles. To address this, we propose a novel and computationally efficient planning strategy that seamlessly integrates the predictions of dynamic obstacles into the planning process, ensuring the generation of collision-free paths. Our approach builds upon the conventional Hybrid A star algorithm by introducing a time-indexed variant that explicitly accounts for the predictions of dynamic obstacles during node exploration in the graph, thus enabling dynamic obstacle avoidance. We integrate the time-indexed Hybrid A star algorithm within an online planning framework to compute local paths at each planning step, guided by an adaptively chosen intermediate goal. The proposed method is validated in diverse parking scenarios, including perpendicular, angled, and parallel parking. Through simulations, we showcase our approach's potential in greatly improving the efficiency and safety when compared to the state of the art spline-based planning method for parking situations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00831v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficient path planning in robotics, particularly within large-scale, dynamic environments, remains a significant hurdle. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer strong reasoning capabilities, their high computational cost and limited adaptability in dynamic scenarios hinder real-time deployment on edge devices. We present SmallPlan -- a novel framework leveraging LLMs as teacher models to train lightweight Small Language Models (SLMs) for high-level path planning tasks. In SmallPlan, the SLMs provide optimal action sequences to navigate across scene graphs that compactly represent full-scaled 3D scenes. The SLMs are trained in a simulation-powered, interleaved manner with LLM-guided supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). This strategy not only enables SLMs to successfully complete navigation tasks but also makes them aware of important factors like travel distance and number of trials. Through experiments, we demonstrate that the fine-tuned SLMs perform competitively with larger models like GPT-4o on sequential path planning, without suffering from hallucination and overfitting. SmallPlan is resource-efficient, making it well-suited for edge-device deployment and advancing practical autonomous robotics.</description>

      <title>RoBridge: A Hierarchical Architecture Bridging Cognition and Execution for General Robotic Manipulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01709v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Operating robots in open-ended scenarios with diverse tasks is a crucial research and application direction in robotics. While recent progress in natural language processing and large multimodal models has enhanced robots' ability to understand complex instructions, robot manipulation still faces the procedural skill dilemma and the declarative skill dilemma in open environments. Existing methods often compromise cognitive and executive capabilities. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose RoBridge, a hierarchical intelligent architecture for general robotic manipulation. It consists of a high-level cognitive planner (HCP) based on a large-scale pre-trained vision-language model (VLM), an invariant operable representation (IOR) serving as a symbolic bridge, and a generalist embodied agent (GEA). RoBridge maintains the declarative skill of VLM and unleashes the procedural skill of reinforcement learning, effectively bridging the gap between cognition and execution. RoBridge demonstrates significant performance improvements over existing baselines, achieving a 75% success rate on new tasks and an 83% average success rate in sim-to-real generalization using only five real-world data samples per task. This work represents a significant step towards integrating cognitive reasoning with physical execution in robotic systems, offering a new paradigm for general robotic manipulation.</description>

Abstract: How can we teach humanoids to climb staircases and sit on chairs using the surrounding environment context? Arguably, the simplest way is to just show them-casually capture a human motion video and feed it to humanoids. We introduce VIDEOMIMIC, a real-to-sim-to-real pipeline that mines everyday videos, jointly reconstructs the humans and the environment, and produces whole-body control policies for humanoid robots that perform the corresponding skills. We demonstrate the results of our pipeline on real humanoid robots, showing robust, repeatable contextual control such as staircase ascents and descents, sitting and standing from chairs and benches, as well as other dynamic whole-body skills-all from a single policy, conditioned on the environment and global root commands. VIDEOMIMIC offers a scalable path towards teaching humanoids to operate in diverse real-world environments.</description>

      <title>Context-aware LLM-based Safe Control Against Latent Risks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11863v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autonomous control systems face significant challenges in performing complex tasks in the presence of latent risks. To address this, we propose an integrated framework that combines Large Language Models (LLMs), numerical optimization, and optimization-based control to facilitate efficient subtask learning while ensuring safety against latent risks. The framework decomposes complex tasks into a sequence of context-aware subtasks that account for latent risks. These subtasks and their parameters are then refined through a multi-time-scale process: high-layer multi-turn in-context learning, mid-layer LLM Chain-of-Thought reasoning and numerical optimization, and low-layer model predictive control. The framework iteratively improves decisions by leveraging qualitative feedback and optimized trajectory data from lower-layer optimization processes and a physics simulator. We validate the proposed framework through simulated case studies involving robot arm and autonomous vehicle scenarios. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework can mediate actions based on the context and latent risks and learn complex behaviors efficiently.</description>

Abstract: LiDAR loop closure detection (LCD) is crucial for consistent Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) but faces challenges in robustness and accuracy. Existing methods, including semantic graph approaches, often suffer from coarse geometric representations and lack temporal robustness against noise, dynamics, and viewpoint changes. We introduce PNE-SGAN, a Probabilistic NDT-Enhanced Semantic Graph Attention Network, to overcome these limitations. PNE-SGAN enhances semantic graphs by using Normal Distributions Transform (NDT) covariance matrices as rich, discriminative geometric node features, processed via a Graph Attention Network (GAT). Crucially, it integrates graph similarity scores into a probabilistic temporal filtering framework (modeled as an HMM/Bayes filter), incorporating uncertain odometry for motion modeling and utilizing forward-backward smoothing to effectively handle ambiguities. Evaluations on challenging KITTI sequences (00 and 08) demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving Average Precision of 96.2\% and 95.1\%, respectively. PNE-SGAN significantly outperforms existing methods, particularly in difficult bidirectional loop scenarios where others falter. By synergizing detailed NDT geometry with principled probabilistic temporal reasoning, PNE-SGAN offers a highly accurate and robust solution for LiDAR LCD, enhancing SLAM reliability in complex, large-scale environments.</description>

Abstract: In autonomous driving, place recognition is critical for global localization in GPS-denied environments. LiDAR and radar-based place recognition methods have garnered increasing attention, as LiDAR provides precise ranging, whereas radar excels in adverse weather resilience. However, effectively leveraging LiDAR-radar fusion for place recognition remains challenging. The noisy and sparse nature of radar data limits its potential to further improve recognition accuracy. In addition, heterogeneous radar configurations complicate the development of unified cross-modality fusion frameworks. In this paper, we propose LRFusionPR, which improves recognition accuracy and robustness by fusing LiDAR with either single-chip or scanning radar. Technically, a dual-branch network is proposed to fuse different modalities within the unified polar coordinate bird's eye view (BEV) representation. In the fusion branch, cross-attention is utilized to perform cross-modality feature interactions. The knowledge from the fusion branch is simultaneously transferred to the distillation branch, which takes radar as its only input to further improve the robustness. Ultimately, the descriptors from both branches are concatenated, producing the multimodal global descriptor for place retrieval. Extensive evaluations on multiple datasets demonstrate that our LRFusionPR achieves accurate place recognition, while maintaining robustness under varying weather conditions. Our open-source code will be released at https://github.com/QiZS-BIT/LRFusionPR.</description>
