      <title>A Theoretical Analysis of Molecular Quantum (MolQ) Communication Channel in the Gut-Brain Axis Synapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gut-brain axis is the communication link between the gut and the brain. Although it is known that the gut-brain axis plays a pivotal role in homeostasis, its overall mechanism is still not known. However, for neural synapses, classical molecular communication is described by the formation of ligand-receptor complexes, which leads to the opening of ion channels. Moreover, there are some conditions that need to be fulfilled before the opening of the ion channel. In this study, we will consider the gut-brain axis, where neurotransmitters diffuse through the synaptic cleft, considering molecular communication. On the vagus nerve (VN) membrane, i.e., the post-synaptic membrane of the synapse, it undergoes a quantum communication (QC), which initiates the opening of the ion channel, thus initiating the communication signal from the gut to the brain. It evolves a new paradigm of communication approach, Molecular Quantum (MolQ) communication. Based on the QC model, we theoretically analyzes the output states, and QC is simulated considering the incoming neurotransmitter's concentration and validated by analyzing the entropy and the mutual information of the input, i.e., neurotransmitter's concentration, and output, i.e., ion channel opening.</description>

      <title>The mouth speaks as much as the eyes: Free-ranging dogs depend on inner facial features for human recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The human face is a multi-signal system continuously transmitting information of identity and emotion. In shared human-animal environments, the face becomes a reliable tool of heterospecific recognition. Because humans display mixed behaviour and pose differential risk to animals, adaptable decision-making based on recognition and classification of humans confer a fitness benefit. The human-dog dyad is an ideal model to study heterospecific recognition due to their shared history, niche overlap, and cognitive co-evolution. Multiple studies on pet dogs have examined their human facial information processing. However, no study has examined these perceptual abilities in free-living populations in their natural habitat where the human-dog relationship is more complex and impacts survival. Comprehensive behavioural analysis of 416 free-ranging dogs in an approach-based task with differential facial occlusion of a human, demonstrated that these dogs recognize and discriminate between familiar and unfamiliar people. Negative behaviours like aggression and avoidance were unlikely to be displayed. Inner facial components like eyes, nose and mouth were more important than outer components like hair in human recognition. Unlike in pet dogs, the occlusion of even a single inner component of the face prevented recognition by facial cue alone. Personality and habitat conditions influenced the behavioural strategy adopted by the dogs too. Considering the ambiguous nature of human interactions, recognition and response in free-ranging dogs relied on dual assessment of identity and intent of a human based, in part, on their ontogeny. Such a cue-processing system highlights the selection pressures inherent in the unpredictable environment of free-living populations.</description>

      <title>How Aligned are Different Alignment Metrics?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, various methods and benchmarks have been proposed to empirically evaluate the alignment of artificial neural networks to human neural and behavioral data. But how aligned are different alignment metrics? To answer this question, we analyze visual data from Brain-Score (Schrimpf et al., 2018), including metrics from the model-vs-human toolbox (Geirhos et al., 2021), together with human feature alignment (Linsley et al., 2018; Fel et al., 2022) and human similarity judgements (Muttenthaler et al., 2022). We find that pairwise correlations between neural scores and behavioral scores are quite low and sometimes even negative. For instance, the average correlation between those 80 models on Brain-Score that were fully evaluated on all 69 alignment metrics we considered is only 0.198. Assuming that all of the employed metrics are sound, this implies that alignment with human perception may best be thought of as a multidimensional concept, with different methods measuring fundamentally different aspects. Our results underline the importance of integrative benchmarking, but also raise questions about how to correctly combine and aggregate individual metrics. Aggregating by taking the arithmetic average, as done in Brain-Score, leads to the overall performance currently being dominated by behavior (95.25% explained variance) while the neural predictivity plays a less important role (only 33.33% explained variance). As a first step towards making sure that different alignment metrics all contribute fairly towards an integrative benchmark score, we therefore conclude by comparing three different aggregation options.</description>

      <title>Impact of dendritic non-linearities on the computational capabilities of neurons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiple neurophysiological experiments have shown that dendritic non-linearities can have a strong influence on synaptic input integration. In this work we model a single neuron as a two-layer computational unit with non-overlapping sign-constrained synaptic weights and a biologically plausible form of dendritic non-linearity, which is analytically tractable using statistical physics methods. Using both analytical and numerical tools, we demonstrate several key computational advantages of non-linear dendritic integration with respect to models with linear synaptic integration. We find that the dendritic non-linearity concurrently enhances the number of possible learned input-output associations and the learning velocity, and we characterize how capacity and learning speed depend on the implemented non-linearity and the levels of dendritic and somatic inhibition. We find that experimentally observed connection probabilities naturally emerge in neurons with sign-constrained synapses as a consequence of non-linear dendritic integration, while in models with linear integration, an additional robustness parameter must be introduced in order to reproduce realistic connection probabilities. Non-linearly induced sparsity comes with a second central advantage for neuronal information processing, i.e. input and synaptic noise robustness. By testing our model on standard real-world benchmark datasets inspired by deep learning practice, we observe empirically that the non-linearity provides an enhancement in generalization performance, showing that it enables to capture more complex input/output relations.</description>

      <title>Scaling Law in Neural Data: Non-Invasive Speech Decoding with 175 Hours of EEG Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) hold great potential for aiding individuals with speech impairments. Utilizing electroencephalography (EEG) to decode speech is particularly promising due to its non-invasive nature. However, recordings are typically short, and the high variability in EEG data has led researchers to focus on classification tasks with a few dozen classes. To assess its practical applicability for speech neuroprostheses, we investigate the relationship between the size of EEG data and decoding accuracy in the open vocabulary setting. We collected extensive EEG data from a single participant (175 hours) and conducted zero-shot speech segment classification using self-supervised representation learning. The model trained on the entire dataset achieved a top-1 accuracy of 48\% and a top-10 accuracy of 76\%, while mitigating the effects of myopotential artifacts. Conversely, when the data was limited to the typical amount used in practice ($\sim$10 hours), the top-1 accuracy dropped to 2.5\%, revealing a significant scaling effect. Additionally, as the amount of training data increased, the EEG latent representation progressively exhibited clearer temporal structures of spoken phrases. This indicates that the decoder can recognize speech segments in a data-driven manner without explicit measurements of word recognition. This research marks a significant step towards the practical realization of EEG-based speech BCIs.</description>

      <title>Left/Right Brain, human motor control and the implications for robotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14057v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural Network movement controllers promise a variety of advantages over conventional control methods, however, they are not widely adopted due to their inability to produce reliably precise movements. This research explores a bilateral neural network architecture as a control system for motor tasks. We aimed to achieve hemispheric specialisation similar to what is observed in humans across different tasks; the dominant system (usually the right hand, left hemisphere) excels at tasks involving coordination and efficiency of movement, and the non-dominant system performs better at tasks requiring positional stability. Specialisation was achieved by training the hemispheres with different loss functions tailored to the expected behaviour of the respective hemispheres. We compared bilateral models with and without specialised hemispheres, with and without inter-hemispheric connectivity (representing the biological Corpus Callosum), and unilateral models with and without specialisation. The models were trained and tested on two tasks common in the human motor control literature: the random reach task, suited to the dominant system, a model with better coordination, and the hold position task, suited to the non-dominant system, a model with more stable movement. Each system outperformed the non-preferred system in its preferred task. For both tasks, a bilateral model outperformed the non-preferred hand and was as good or better than the preferred hand. The results suggest that the hemispheres could collaborate on tasks or work independently to their strengths. This study provides ideas for how a biologically inspired bilateral architecture could be exploited for industrial motor control.</description>
