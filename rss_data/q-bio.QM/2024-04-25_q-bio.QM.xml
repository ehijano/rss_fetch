      <title>ApisTox: a new benchmark dataset for the classification of small molecules toxicity on honey bees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The global decline in bee populations poses significant risks to agriculture, biodiversity, and environmental stability. To bridge the gap in existing data, we introduce ApisTox, a comprehensive dataset focusing on the toxicity of pesticides to honey bees (Apis mellifera). This dataset combines and leverages data from existing sources such as ECOTOX and PPDB, providing an extensive, consistent, and curated collection that surpasses the previous datasets. ApisTox incorporates a wide array of data, including toxicity levels for chemicals, details such as time of their publication in literature, and identifiers linking them to external chemical databases. This dataset may serve as an important tool for environmental and agricultural research, but also can support the development of policies and practices aimed at minimizing harm to bee populations. Finally, ApisTox offers a unique resource for benchmarking molecular property prediction methods on agrochemical compounds, facilitating advancements in both environmental science and cheminformatics. This makes it a valuable tool for both academic research and practical applications in bee conservation.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-based Prediction of Breast Cancer Tumor and Immune Phenotypes from Histopathology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interactions between tumor cells and the tumor microenvironment (TME) dictate therapeutic efficacy of radiation and many systemic therapies in breast cancer. However, to date, there is not a widely available method to reproducibly measure tumor and immune phenotypes for each patient's tumor. Given this unmet clinical need, we applied multiple instance learning (MIL) algorithms to assess activity of ten biologically relevant pathways from the hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) slide of primary breast tumors. We employed different feature extraction approaches and state-of-the-art model architectures. Using binary classification, our models attained area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) scores above 0.70 for nearly all gene expression pathways and on some cases, exceeded 0.80. Attention maps suggest that our trained models recognize biologically relevant spatial patterns of cell sub-populations from H&amp;E. These efforts represent a first step towards developing computational H&amp;E biomarkers that reflect facets of the TME and hold promise for augmenting precision oncology.</description>

      <title>Beyond Boolean networks, a multi-valued approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Boolean networks can be viewed as functions on the set of binary strings of a given length, described via logical rules. They were introduced as dynamic models into biology, in particular as logical models of intracellular regulatory networks involving genes, proteins, and metabolites. Since genes can have several modes of action, depending on their expression levels, binary variables are often not sufficiently rich, requiring the use of multi-valued networks instead. The steady state analysis of Boolean networks is computationally complex, and increasing the number of variable values beyond $2$ adds substantially to this complexity, and no general methods are available beyond simulation. The main contribution of this paper is to give an algorithm to compute the steady states of a multi-valued network that has a complexity that, in many cases, is essentially the same as that for the case of binary values. Our approach is based on a representation of multi-valued networks using multi-valued logic functions, providing a biologically intuitive representation of the network. Furthermore, it uses tools to compute lattice points in rational polytopes, tapping a rich area of algebraic combinatorics as a source for combinatorial algorithms for Boolean network analysis. An implementation of the algorithm is provided.</description>

      <title>COVID-19 Detection from Exhaled Breath</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.19211v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus emerged in 2019, causing a COVID-19 pandemic that resulted in 7 million deaths out of 770 million reported cases over the next four years. The global health emergency called for unprecedented efforts to monitor and reduce the rate of infection, pushing the study of new diagnostic methods. In this paper, we introduce a cheap, fast, and non-invasive detection system, which exploits only the exhaled breath. Specifically, provided an air sample, the mass spectra in the 10--351 mass-to-charge range are measured using an original nano-sampling device coupled with a high-precision spectrometer; then, the raw spectra are processed by custom software algorithms; the clean and augmented data are eventually classified using state-of-the-art machine-learning algorithms. An uncontrolled clinical trial was conducted between 2021 and 2022 on some 300 subjects who were concerned about being infected, either due to exhibiting symptoms or having quite recently recovered from illness. Despite the simplicity of use, our system showed a performance comparable to the traditional polymerase-chain-reaction and antigen testing in identifying cases of COVID-19 (that is, 0.95 accuracy, 0.94 recall, 0.96 specificity, and 0.92 F1-score). In light of these outcomes, we think that the proposed system holds the potential for substantial contributions to routine screenings and expedited responses during future epidemics, as it yields results comparable to state-of-the-art methods, providing them in a more rapid and less invasive manner.</description>

      <title>FlowCyt: A Comparative Study of Deep Learning Approaches for Multi-Class Classification in Flow Cytometry Benchmarking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00024v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents FlowCyt, the first comprehensive benchmark for multi-class single-cell classification in flow cytometry data. The dataset comprises bone marrow samples from 30 patients, with each cell characterized by twelve markers. Ground truth labels identify five hematological cell types: T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, Monocytes, Mast cells, and Hematopoietic Stem/Progenitor Cells (HSPCs). Experiments utilize supervised inductive learning and semi-supervised transductive learning on up to 1 million cells per patient. Baseline methods include Gaussian Mixture Models, XGBoost, Random Forests, Deep Neural Networks, and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). GNNs demonstrate superior performance by exploiting spatial relationships in graph-encoded data. The benchmark allows standardized evaluation of clinically relevant classification tasks, along with exploratory analyses to gain insights into hematological cell phenotypes. This represents the first public flow cytometry benchmark with a richly annotated, heterogeneous dataset. It will empower the development and rigorous assessment of novel methodologies for single-cell analysis.</description>
