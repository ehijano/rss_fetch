      <title>Quantum Advantage from Sampling Shallow Circuits: Beyond Hardness of Marginals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a family of distributions $\{\mathcal{D}_n\}_n$ with $\mathcal{D}_n$ over $\{0, 1\}^n$ and a family of depth-$7$ quantum circuits $\{C_n\}_n$ such that $\mathcal{D}_n$ is produced exactly by $C_n$ with the all zeros state as input, yet any constant-depth classical circuit with bounded fan-in gates evaluated on any binary product distribution has total variation distance $1 - e^{-\Omega(n)}$ from $\mathcal{D}_n$. Moreover, the quantum circuits we construct are geometrically local and use a relatively standard gate set: Hadamard, controlled-phase, CNOT, and Toffoli gates. All previous separations of this type suffer from some undesirable constraint on the classical circuit model or the quantum circuits witnessing the separation.
  Our family of distributions is inspired by the Parity Halving Problem of Watts, Kothari, Schaeffer, and Tal (STOC, 2019), which built on the work of Bravyi, Gosset, and K\"onig (Science, 2018) to separate shallow quantum and classical circuits for relational problems.</description>

      <title>k-SUM Hardness Implies Treewidth-SETH</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that if k-SUM is hard, in the sense that the standard algorithm is essentially optimal, then a variant of the SETH called the Primal Treewidth SETH is true. Formally: if there is an $\varepsilon&gt;0$ and an algorithm which solves SAT in time $(2-\varepsilon)^{tw}|\phi|^{O(1)}$, where $tw$ is the width of a given tree decomposition of the primal graph of the input, then there exists a randomized algorithm which solves k-SUM in time $n^{(1-\delta)\frac{k}{2}}$ for some $\delta&gt;0$ and all sufficiently large $k$. We also establish an analogous result for the k-XOR problem, where integer addition is replaced by component-wise addition modulo $2$.
  As an application of our reduction we are able to revisit tight lower bounds on the complexity of several fundamental problems parameterized by treewidth (Independent Set, Max Cut, $k$-Coloring). Our results imply that these bounds, which were initially shown under the SETH, also hold if one assumes the k-SUM or k-XOR Hypotheses, arguably increasing our confidence in their validity.</description>

      <title>3-Local Hamiltonian Problem and Constant Relative Error Quantum Partition Function Approximation: $O(2^{\frac{n}{2}})$ Algorithm Is Nearly Optimal under QSETH</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the computational complexity of the Local Hamiltonian (LH) problem and the approximation of the Quantum Partition Function (QPF), two central problems in quantum many-body physics and quantum complexity theory. Both problems are known to be QMA-hard, and under the widely believed assumption that $\mathsf{BQP} \neq \mathsf{QMA}$, no efficient quantum algorithm exits. The best known quantum algorithm for LH runs in $O\bigl(2^{\frac{n}{2}(1 - o(1))}\bigr)$ time, while for QPF, the state-of-the-art algorithm achieves relative error $\delta$ in $O^\ast\bigl(\frac{1}{\delta}\sqrt{\frac{2^n}{Z}}\bigr)$ time, where $Z$ denotes the value of the partition function. A nature open question is whether more efficient algorithms exist for both problems.
  In this work, we establish tight conditional lower bounds showing that these algorithms are nearly optimal. Under the plausible Quantum Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (QSETH), we prove that no quantum algorithm can solve either LH or approximate QPF significantly faster than $O(2^{n/2})$, even for 3-local Hamiltonians. In particular, we show: 1) 3-local LH cannot be solved in time $O(2^{\frac{n}{2}(1-\varepsilon)})$ for any $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ under QSETH; 2) 3-local QPF cannot be approximated up to any constant relative error in $O(2^{\frac{n}{2}(1-\varepsilon)})$ time for any $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ under QSETH; and 3) we present a quantum algorithm that approximates QPF up to relative error $1/2 + 1/\mathrm{poly}(n)$ in $O^\ast(2^{n/2})$ time, matching our conditional lower bound.
  Notably, our results provide the first fine-grained lower bounds for both LH and QPF with fixed locality. This stands in sharp contrast to QSETH and the trivial fine-grained lower bounds for LH, where the locality of the SAT instance and the Hamiltonian depends on the parameter $\varepsilon$ in the $O(2^{\frac{n}{2}(1-\varepsilon)})$ running time.</description>

      <title>No exponential quantum speedup for $\mathrm{SIS}^\infty$ anymore</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 2021, Chen, Liu, and Zhandry presented an efficient quantum algorithm for the average-case $\ell_\infty$-Short Integer Solution ($\mathrm{SIS}^\infty$) problem, in a parameter range outside the normal range of cryptographic interest, but still with no known efficient classical algorithm. This was particularly exciting since $\mathrm{SIS}^\infty$ is a simple problem without structure, and their algorithmic techniques were different from those used in prior exponential quantum speedups.
  We present efficient classical algorithms for all of the $\mathrm{SIS}^\infty$ and (more general) Constrained Integer Solution problems studied in their paper, showing there is no exponential quantum speedup anymore.</description>

      <title>Conjugate queries can help</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a natural problem over input quantum oracles $U$ which cannot be solved with exponentially many black-box queries to $U$ and $U^\dagger$, but which can be solved with constant many queries to $U$ and $U^*$, or $U$ and $U^{\mathrm{T}}$. We also demonstrate a quantum commitment scheme that is secure against adversaries that query only $U$ and $U^\dagger$, but is insecure if the adversary can query $U^*$. These results show that conjugate and transpose queries do give more power to quantum algorithms, lending credence to the idea put forth by Zhandry that cryptographic primitives should prove security against these forms of queries.
  Our key lemma is that any circuit using $q$ forward and inverse queries to a state preparation unitary for a state $\sigma$ can be simulated to $\varepsilon$ error with $n = \mathcal{O}(q^2/\varepsilon)$ copies of $\sigma$. Consequently, for decision tasks, algorithms using (forward and inverse) state preparation queries only ever perform quadratically better than sample access. These results follow from straightforward combinations of existing techniques; our contribution is to state their consequences in their strongest, most counter-intuitive form. In doing so, we identify a motif where generically strengthening a quantum resource can be possible if the output is allowed to be random, bypassing no-go theorems for deterministic algorithms. We call this the acorn trick.</description>

      <title>Optimal lower bounds for quantum state tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that $n = \Omega(rd/\varepsilon^2)$ copies are necessary to learn a rank $r$ mixed state $\rho \in \mathbb{C}^{d \times d}$ up to error $\varepsilon$ in trace distance. This matches the upper bound of $n = O(rd/\varepsilon^2)$ from prior work, and therefore settles the sample complexity of mixed state tomography. We prove this lower bound by studying a special case of full state tomography that we refer to as projector tomography, in which $\rho$ is promised to be of the form $\rho = P/r$, where $P \in \mathbb{C}^{d \times d}$ is a rank $r$ projector. A key technical ingredient in our proof, which may be of independent interest, is a reduction which converts any algorithm for projector tomography which learns to error $\varepsilon$ in trace distance to an algorithm which learns to error $O(\varepsilon)$ in the more stringent Bures distance.</description>

      <title>Efficient Closest Matrix Product State Learning in Logarithmic Depth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning the closest matrix product state (MPS) representation of a quantum state is known to enable useful tools for prediction and analysis of complex quantum systems.
  In this work, we study the problem of learning MPS in following setting: given many copies of an input MPS, the task is to recover a classical description of the state. The best known polynomial-time algorithm, introduced by [LCLP10, CPF+10], requires linear circuit depth and $O(n^5)$ samples, and has seen no improvement in over a decade. The strongest known lower bound is only $\Omega(n)$. The combination of linear depth and high sample complexity renders existing algorithms impractical for near-term or even early fault-tolerant quantum devices.
  We show a new efficient MPS learning algorithm that runs in $O(\log n)$ depth and has sample complexity $O(n^3)$. Also, we can generalize our algorithm to learn closest MPS state, in which the input state is not guaranteed to be close to the MPS with a fixed bond dimension. Our algorithms also improve both sample complexity and circuit depth of previous known algorithm.</description>

      <title>Quantum Max-Cut is NP hard to approximate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We unconditionally prove that it is NP-hard to compute a constant multiplicative approximation to the QUANTUM MAX-CUT problem on an unweighted graph of constant bounded degree. The proof works in two stages: first we demonstrate a generic reduction to computing the optimal value of a quantum problem, from the optimal value over product states. Then we prove an approximation preserving reduction from MAX-CUT to PRODUCT-QMC the product state version of QUANTUM MAX-CUT. More precisely, in the second part, we construct a PTAS reduction from MAX-CUT$_k$ (the rank-k constrained version of MAX-CUT) to MAX-CUT$_{k+1}$, where MAX-CUT and PRODUCT-QMC coincide with MAX-CUT$_1$ and MAX-CUT$_3$ respectively. We thus prove that Max-Cut$_k$ is APX-complete for all constant $k$.</description>

      <title>Verifying Graph Neural Networks with Readout is Intractable</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a logical language for reasoning about quantized aggregate-combine graph neural networks with global readout (ACR-GNNs). We provide a logical characterization and use it to prove that verification tasks for quantized GNNs with readout are (co)NEXPTIME-complete. This result implies that the verification of quantized GNNs is computationally intractable, prompting substantial research efforts toward ensuring the safety of GNN-based systems. We also experimentally demonstrate that quantized ACR-GNN models are lightweight while maintaining good accuracy and generalization capabilities with respect to non-quantized models.</description>

      <title>Timeline Problems in Temporal Graphs: Vertex Cover vs. Dominating Set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A temporal graph is a finite sequence of graphs, called snapshots, over the same vertex set. Many temporal graph problems turn out to be much more difficult than their static counterparts. One such problem is \textsc{Timeline Vertex Cover} (also known as \textsc{MinTimeline$_\infty$}), a temporal analogue to the classical \textsc{Vertex Cover} problem. In this problem, one is given a temporal graph $\mathcal{G}$ and two integers $k$ and $\ell$, and the goal is to cover each edge of each snapshot by selecting for each vertex at most $k$ activity intervals of length at most $\ell$ each. Here, an edge $uv$ in the $i$th snapshot is covered, if an activity interval of $u$ or $v$ is active at time $i$. In this work, we continue the algorithmic study of \textsc{Timeline Vertex Cover} and introduce the \textsc{Timeline Dominating Set} problem where we want to dominate all vertices in each snapshot by the selected activity intervals.
  We analyze both problems from a classical and parameterized point of view and also consider partial problem versions, where the goal is to cover (dominate) at least $t$ edges (vertices) of the snapshots. With respect to the parameterized complexity, we consider the temporal graph parameters vertex-interval-membership-width $(vimw)$ and interval-membership-width $(imw)$. We show that all considered problems admit FPT-algorithms when parameterized by $vimw + k+\ell$. This provides a smaller parameter combination than the ones used for previously known FPT-algorithms for \textsc{Timeline Vertex Cover}. Surprisingly, for $imw+ k+\ell$, \textsc{Timeline Dominating Set} turns out to be easier than \textsc{Timeline Vertex Cover}, by also admitting an FPT-algorithm, whereas the vertex cover version is NP-hard even if $imw+\, k+\ell$ is constant. We also consider parameterization by combinations of $n$, the vertex set size, with $k$ or $\ell$ and parameterization by $t$.</description>

      <title>Computing moment polytopes - with a focus on tensors, entanglement and matrix multiplication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tensors are fundamental in mathematics, computer science, and physics. Their study through algebraic geometry and representation theory has proved very fruitful in the context of algebraic complexity theory and quantum information. In particular, moment polytopes have been understood to play a key role. In quantum information, moment polytopes (also known as entanglement polytopes) provide a framework for the single-particle quantum marginal problem and offer a geometric characterization of entanglement. In algebraic complexity, they underpin quantum functionals that capture asymptotic tensor relations. More recently, moment polytopes have also become foundational to the emerging field of scaling algorithms in computer science and optimization.
  Despite their fundamental role and interest from many angles, much is still unknown about these polytopes, and in particular for tensors beyond $\mathbb{C}^2\otimes\mathbb{C}^2\otimes\mathbb{C}^2$ and $\mathbb{C}^2\otimes\mathbb{C}^2\otimes\mathbb{C}^2\otimes\mathbb{C}^2$ only sporadically have they been computed. We give a new algorithm for computing moment polytopes of tensors (and in fact moment polytopes for the general class of reductive algebraic groups) based on a mathematical description by Franz (J. Lie Theory 2002).
  This algorithm enables us to compute moment polytopes of tensors of dimension an order of magnitude larger than previous methods, allowing us to compute with certainty, for the first time, all moment polytopes of tensors in $\mathbb{C}^3\otimes\mathbb{C}^3\otimes\mathbb{C}^3$, and with high probability those in $\mathbb{C}^4\otimes\mathbb{C}^4\otimes\mathbb{C}^4$ (which includes the $2\times 2$ matrix multiplication tensor). We discuss how these explicit moment polytopes have led to several new theoretical directions and results.</description>

      <title>A Graph Width Perspective on Partially Ordered Hamiltonian Paths and Cycles II: Vertex and Edge Deletion Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of finding a Hamiltonian path or cycle with precedence constraints in the form of a partial order on the vertex set. We study the complexity for graph width parameters for which the ordinary problems $\mathsf{Hamiltonian\ Path}$ and $\mathsf{Hamiltonian\ Cycle}$ are in $\mathsf{FPT}$. In particular, we focus on parameters that describe how many vertices and edges have to be deleted to become a member of a certain graph class. We show that the problems are $\mathsf{W[1]}$-hard for such restricted cases as vertex distance to path and vertex distance to clique. We complement these results by showing that the problems can be solved in $\mathsf{XP}$ time for vertex distance to outerplanar and vertex distance to block. Furthermore, we present some $\mathsf{FPT}$ algorithms, e.g., for edge distance to block. Additionally, we prove para-$\mathsf{NP}$-hardness when considered with the edge clique cover number.</description>

      <title>Random unitaries from Hamiltonian dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nature of randomness and complexity growth in systems governed by unitary dynamics is a fundamental question in quantum many-body physics. This problem has motivated the study of models such as local random circuits and their convergence to Haar-random unitaries in the long-time limit. However, these models do not correspond to any family of physical time-independent Hamiltonians. In this work, we address this gap by studying the indistinguishability of time-independent Hamiltonian dynamics from truly random unitaries. On one hand, we establish a no-go result showing that for any ensemble of constant-local Hamiltonians and any evolution times, the resulting time-evolution unitary can be efficiently distinguished from Haar-random and fails to form a $2$-design or a pseudorandom unitary (PRU). On the other hand, we prove that this limitation can be overcome by increasing the locality slightly: there exist ensembles of random polylog-local Hamiltonians in one-dimension such that under constant evolution time, the resulting time-evolution unitary is indistinguishable from Haar-random, i.e. it forms both a unitary $k$-design and a PRU. Moreover, these Hamiltonians can be efficiently simulated under standard cryptographic assumptions.</description>

Abstract: Random unitaries sampled from the Haar measure serve as fundamental models for generic quantum many-body dynamics. Under standard cryptographic assumptions, recent works have constructed polynomial-size quantum circuits that are computationally indistinguishable from Haar-random unitaries, establishing the concept of pseudorandom unitaries (PRUs). While PRUs have found broad implications in many-body physics, they fail to capture the energy conservation that governs physical systems. In this work, we investigate the computational complexity of generating PRUs that conserve energy under a fixed and known Hamiltonian $H$. We provide an efficient construction of energy-conserving PRUs when $H$ is local and commuting with random coefficients. Conversely, we prove that for certain translationally invariant one-dimensional $H$, there exists an efficient quantum algorithm that can distinguish truly random energy-conserving unitaries from any polynomial-size quantum circuit. This establishes that energy-conserving PRUs cannot exist for these Hamiltonians. Furthermore, we prove that determining whether energy-conserving PRUs exist for a given family of one-dimensional local Hamiltonians is an undecidable problem. Our results reveal an unexpected computational barrier that fundamentally separates the generation of generic random unitaries from those obeying the basic physical constraint of energy conservation.</description>

      <title>Hardness of recognizing phases of matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that recognizing the phase of matter of an unknown quantum state is quantum computationally hard. More specifically, we show that the quantum computational time of any phase recognition algorithm must grow exponentially in the range of correlations $\xi$ of the unknown state. This exponential growth renders the problem practically infeasible for even moderate correlation ranges, and leads to super-polynomial quantum computational time in the system size $n$ whenever $\xi = \omega(\log n)$. Our results apply to a substantial portion of all known phases of matter, including symmetry-breaking phases and symmetry-protected topological phases for any discrete on-site symmetry group in any spatial dimension. To establish this hardness, we extend the study of pseudorandom unitaries (PRUs) to quantum systems with symmetries. We prove that symmetric PRUs exist under standard cryptographic conjectures, and can be constructed in extremely low circuit depths. We also establish hardness for systems with translation invariance and purely classical phases of matter. A key technical limitation is that the locality of the parent Hamiltonians of the states we consider is linear in $\xi$; the complexity of phase recognition for Hamiltonians with constant locality remains an important open question.</description>

      <title>How hard is it to verify a classical shadow?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical shadows are succinct classical representations of quantum states which allow one to encode a set of properties P of a quantum state rho, while only requiring measurements on logarithmically many copies of rho in the size of P. In this work, we initiate the study of verification of classical shadows, denoted classical shadow validity (CSV), from the perspective of computational complexity, which asks: Given a classical shadow S, how hard is it to verify that S predicts the measurement statistics of a quantum state? We show that even for the elegantly simple classical shadow protocol of [Huang, Kueng, Preskill, Nature Physics 2020] utilizing local Clifford measurements, CSV is QMA-complete. This hardness continues to hold for the high-dimensional extension of said protocol due to [Mao, Yi, and Zhu, PRL 2025]. Among other results, we also show that CSV for exponentially many observables is complete for a quantum generalization of the second level of the polynomial hierarchy, yielding the first natural complete problem for such a class.</description>

      <title>Complexity and algorithms for matching cut problems in graphs without long induced paths and cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.05402v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a graph, a (perfect) matching cut is an edge cut that is a (perfect) matching. Matching Cut (MC), respectively, Perfect Matching Cut (PMC), is the problem of deciding whether a given graph has a matching cut, respectively, a perfect matching cut. The Disconnected Perfect Matching problem (DPM) is to decide if a graph has a perfect matching that contains a matching cut. Solving an open problem posed in [Lucke, Paulusma, Ries (ISAAC 2022, Algorithmica 2023)], we show that PMC is NP-complete in graphs without induced 14-vertex path $P_{14}$. Our reduction also works simultaneously for MC and DPM, improving the previous hardness results of MC on $P_{15}$-free graphs and of DPM on $P_{19}$-free graphs to $P_{14}$-free graphs for both problems. Actually, we prove a slightly stronger result: within $P_{14}$-free 8-chordal graphs (graphs without chordless cycles of length at least 9), it is hard to distinguish between those without matching cuts (respectively, perfect matching cuts, disconnected perfect matchings) and those in which every matching cut is a perfect matching cut. Moreover, assuming the Exponential Time Hypothesis, none of these problems can be solved in $2^{o(n)}$ time for $n$-vertex $P_{14}$-free 8-chordal graphs.
  On the positive side, we show that, as for MC [Moshi (JGT 1989)], DPM and PMC are polynomially solvable when restricted to 4-chordal graphs. Together with the negative results, this partly answers an open question on the complexity of PMC in $k$-chordal graphs asked in [Le, Telle (WG 2021, TCS 2022) &amp; Lucke, Paulusma, Ries (MFCS 2023, TCS 2024)].</description>

      <title>Strategyproofness-Exposing Descriptions of Matching Mechanisms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.13148v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A menu description exposes strategyproofness by presenting a mechanism to player $i$ in two steps. Step (1) uses others' reports to describe $i$'s menu of potential outcomes. Step (2) uses $i$'s report to select $i$'s favorite outcome from her menu. We provide novel menu descriptions of the Deferred Acceptance (DA) and Top Trading Cycles (TTC) matching mechanisms. For TTC, our description additionally yields a proof of the strategyproofness of TTC's traditional description, in a way that we prove is impossible for DA.</description>

      <title>On the average-case complexity of learning output distributions of quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.05765v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we show that learning the output distributions of brickwork random quantum circuits is average-case hard in the statistical query model. This learning model is widely used as an abstract computational model for most generic learning algorithms. In particular, for brickwork random quantum circuits on $n$ qubits of depth $d$, we show three main results:
  - At super logarithmic circuit depth $d=\omega(\log(n))$, any learning algorithm requires super polynomially many queries to achieve a constant probability of success over the randomly drawn instance.
  - There exists a $d=O(n)$, such that any learning algorithm requires $\Omega(2^n)$ queries to achieve a $O(2^{-n})$ probability of success over the randomly drawn instance.
  - At infinite circuit depth $d\to\infty$, any learning algorithm requires $2^{2^{\Omega(n)}}$ many queries to achieve a $2^{-2^{\Omega(n)}}$ probability of success over the randomly drawn instance.
  As an auxiliary result of independent interest, we show that the output distribution of a brickwork random quantum circuit is constantly far from any fixed distribution in total variation distance with probability $1-O(2^{-n})$, which confirms a variant of a conjecture by Aaronson and Chen.</description>

      <title>Nearest Neighbor CCP-Based Molecular Sequence Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04922v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Molecular sequence analysis is crucial for comprehending several biological processes, including protein-protein interactions, functional annotation, and disease classification. The large number of sequences and the inherently complicated nature of protein structures make it challenging to analyze such data. Finding patterns and enhancing subsequent research requires the use of dimensionality reduction and feature selection approaches. Recently, a method called Correlated Clustering and Projection (CCP) has been proposed as an effective method for biological sequencing data. The CCP technique is still costly to compute even though it is effective for sequence visualization. Furthermore, its utility for classifying molecular sequences is still uncertain. To solve these two problems, we present a Nearest Neighbor Correlated Clustering and Projection (CCP-NN)-based technique for efficiently preprocessing molecular sequence data. To group related molecular sequences and produce representative supersequences, CCP makes use of sequence-to-sequence correlations. As opposed to conventional methods, CCP doesn't rely on matrix diagonalization, therefore it can be applied to a range of machine-learning problems. We estimate the density map and compute the correlation using a nearest-neighbor search technique. We performed molecular sequence classification using CCP and CCP-NN representations to assess the efficacy of our proposed approach. Our findings show that CCP-NN considerably improves classification task accuracy as well as significantly outperforms CCP in terms of computational runtime.</description>

      <title>Approximate Degrees of Multisymmetric Properties with Application to Quantum Claw Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02243v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The claw problem is central in the fields of theoretical computer science as well as cryptography. The optimal quantum query complexity of the problem is known to be $\Omega\left(\sqrt{G}+(FG)^{1/3} \right)$ for input functions $f\colon [F]\to Z$ and $g\colon [G]\to Z$. However, the lower bound was proved when the range $Z$ is sufficiently large (i.e., $|{Z}|=\Omega(FG)$). The current paper proves the lower bound holds even for every smaller range $Z$ with $|{Z}|\ge F+G$. This implies that $\Omega\left(\sqrt{G}+(FG)^{1/3} \right)$ is tight for every such range. In addition, the lower bound $\Omega\left(\sqrt{G}+F^{1/3}G^{1/6}M^{1/6}\right)$ is provided for even smaller range $Z=[M]$ with every $M\in [2,F+G]$ by reducing the claw problem for $|{Z}|= F+G$. The proof technique is general enough to apply to any $k$-symmetric property (e.g., the $k$-claw problem), i.e., the Boolean function $\Phi$ on the set of $k$ functions with different-size domains and a common range such that $\Phi$ is invariant under the permutations over each domain and the permutations over the range. More concretely, it generalizes Ambainis's argument [Theory of Computing, 1(1):37-46] to the multiple-function case by using the notion of multisymmetric polynomials.</description>

      <title>Finding a Fair Scoring Function for Top-$k$ Selection: From Hardness to Practice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11575v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Selecting a subset of the $k$ "best" items from a dataset of $n$ items, based on a scoring function, is a key task in decision-making. Given the rise of automated decision-making software, it is important that the outcome of this process, called top-$k$ selection, is fair. Here we consider the problem of identifying a fair linear scoring function for top-$k$ selection. The function computes a score for each item as a weighted sum of its (numerical) attribute values, and must ensure that the selected subset includes adequate representation of a minority or historically disadvantaged group. Existing algorithms do not scale efficiently, particularly in higher dimensions. Our hardness analysis shows that in more than two dimensions, no algorithm is likely to achieve good scalability with respect to dataset size, and the computational complexity is likely to increase rapidly with dimensionality. However, the hardness results also provide key insights guiding algorithm design, leading to our two-pronged solution: (1) For small values of $k$, our hardness analysis reveals a gap in the hardness barrier. By addressing various engineering challenges, including achieving efficient parallelism, we turn this potential of efficiency into an optimized algorithm delivering substantial practical performance gains. (2) For large values of $k$, where the hardness is robust, we employ a practically efficient algorithm which, despite being theoretically worse, achieves superior real-world performance. Experimental evaluations on real-world datasets then explore scenarios where worst-case behavior does not manifest, identifying areas critical to practical performance. Our solution achieves speed-ups of up to several orders of magnitude compared to SOTA, an efficiency made possible through a tight integration of hardness analysis, algorithm design, practical engineering, and empirical evaluation.</description>
