      <title>Autoregressive long-horizon prediction of plasma edge dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate modeling of scrape-off layer (SOL) and divertor-edge dynamics is vital for designing plasma-facing components in fusion devices. High-fidelity edge fluid/neutral codes such as SOLPS-ITER capture SOL physics with high accuracy, but their computational cost limits broad parameter scans and long transient studies. We present transformer-based, autoregressive surrogates for efficient prediction of 2D, time-dependent plasma edge state fields. Trained on SOLPS-ITER spatiotemporal data, the surrogates forecast electron temperature, electron density, and radiated power over extended horizons. We evaluate model variants trained with increasing autoregressive horizons (1-100 steps) on short- and long-horizon prediction tasks. Longer-horizon training systematically improves rollout stability and mitigates error accumulation, enabling stable predictions over hundreds to thousands of steps and reproducing key dynamical features such as the motion of high-radiation regions. Measured end-to-end wall-clock times show the surrogate is orders of magnitude faster than SOLPS-ITER, enabling rapid parameter exploration. Prediction accuracy degrades when the surrogate enters physical regimes not represented in the training dataset, motivating future work on data enrichment and physics-informed constraints. Overall, this approach provides a fast, accurate surrogate for computationally intensive plasma edge simulations, supporting rapid scenario exploration, control-oriented studies, and progress toward real-time applications in fusion devices.</description>

      <title>The role of particle feedback on particle acceleration in magnetic reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic reconnection is a ubiquitous process in astrophysical plasmas and an efficient mechanism for particle acceleration. Using 2.5D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations with a co-evolving fluid-particle framework, we investigate how particle feedback affects reconnection and acceleration. Our simulations demonstrate that particle feedback to the fluid amplifies shear flows within magnetic islands, which strengthens the convective electric field and thereby boosts particle acceleration. This mechanism results in a higher maximum particle energy and a harder non-thermal energy spectrum. The guide field suppresses both the increase in gas internal energy and particle acceleration. These findings highlight the complex interplay between feedback, guide fields, and reconnection dynamics.</description>

      <title>Computing Flux-Surface Shapes in Tokamaks and Stellarators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is currently no agreed-upon methodology for characterizing a stellarator magnetic field geometry, and yet modern stellarator designs routinely attain high levels of magnetic-field quasi-symmetry through careful flux-surface shaping. Here, we introduce a general method for computing the shape of an ideal-MHD equilibrium that can be used in both axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric configurations. This framework uses a Fourier mode analysis to define the shaping modes (e.g. elongation, triangularity, squareness, etc.) of cross-sections that can be non-planar. Relative to an axisymmetric equilibrium, the additional degree of freedom in a non-axisymmetric equilibrium manifests as a rotation of each shaping mode about the magnetic axis. Using this method, a shaping analysis is performed on non-axisymmetric configurations with precise quasi-symmetry and select cases from the QUASR database spanning a range of quasi-symmetry quality. Empirically, we find that quasi-symmetry results from a spatial resonance between shape complexity and shape rotation about the magnetic axis. The quantitative features of this resonance correlate closely with a configuration's rotational transform and number of field periods. Based on these observations, it is conjectured that this shaping paradigm can facilitate systematic investigations into the relationship between general flux-surface geometries and other figures of merit.</description>

      <title>Cataloging the nonlinear waves excited by moving a charged body in the dusty plasma medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nonlinear waves excited by the movement of a charged body in the dusty plasma medium are studied. A charged body moving through a dusty plasma medium can generate diverse nonlinear waves, such as precursors and pinned solitons. These wave excitations under weakly nonlinear and dispersive limits are described theoretically by the forced Korteweg-de Vries (fKdV) type equation. We have examined the role of the driver in shaping and evolving these wave excitations. In particular we studied the effect of primarily three source parameters, namely, amplitude, width, and flow speed, on the evolution of nonlinear structures. The driver generates a perturbation in the stable system configuration, which couples with medium characteristics and eventually evolves into propagating excitations. Our finding shows that the excitation of nonlinear structure by a moving body in a plasma medium is not just dictated by the mach number but also the features of the source such as amplitude and width. As a novel finding apart from pinned and precursor solitons, we observe another nonlinear structure that lags behind the source term, maintaining its shape and speed as it propagates. These features are the first ever theoretical depiction of such lagging structures.</description>

      <title>Runaway electron avalanche and macroscopic beam formation: simulations of the DTT full power scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transition of the Divertor Tokamak Test (DTT) facility from its initial commissioning phase (Day-0, plasma current $I_{p}=2$ MA) to the full power scenario ($I_{p}=5.5$ MA) introduces a critical shift in the dynamics of runaway electrons (REs) generation. While previous predictive studies of the low-current scenario indicated a robust safety margin against RE beam formation, this work reveals that the exponential scaling of the RE avalanche gain with plasma current severely narrows the safe operational window in the full power scenario. Using the non-linear magnetohydrodynamic code JOREK, we perform comprehensive 2D simulations of the current quench (CQ) phase of several disruption scenarios, systematically scanning initial RE seed currents and injected impurity levels. The results demonstrate that in the full power scenario, the avalanche multiplication factor is sufficiently high ($G_\text{av} \approx 1.3 \cdot 10^5$) to convert a mere 5.5 A seed current into macroscopic RE beams of $\approx 0.7$ MA when large amounts of impurities are present. For even higher RE seeds, the RE current can peak at $ \approx 3.2$ MA, constituting up to $\approx$ 80% of the total plasma current during the CQ. These findings suggest that, unlike the Day-0 phase, the disruption mitigation strategy for the full power scenario involves a careful balance between thermal load mitigation and RE avoidance, necessitating a well-chosen quantity of injected impurities. This work provides the baseline needed for future estimations of RE loads on the plasma-facing components of DTT, which will be essential for designing and positioning mitigation components like sacrificial limiters.</description>

      <title>Achieving High Efficiency And Enhanced Beam Quality In Laser Wakefield Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Laser wakefield acceleration, characterized by the extremely high electric field gradient exceeding 100GV/m, is regarded as a compact and cost affordable technology for the next generation of particle colliders and light sources. However, it has always been a major challenge to effectively increase the energy transfer efficiency from the laser to the accelerated beam, while ensuring the beam quality remains suitable for practical applications. This study demonstrates that the laser with shorter pulse duration allows for a two-step dechirping process of the accelerated electron beam with charge of nanocoulomb level. The electron beams with an energy spread of 1% can be generated with the energy transfer efficiency of 10% to 30% in a large parameter space. For example, one electron beam with the energy of 420MeV, the charge of 5.5nC and the RMS energy spread of 2% can be produced using an 8.3J laser pulse with 7.2fs duration.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamically Consistent Vibrational-Electron Heating: Generalized Model for Multi-Quantum Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23072v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of electron temperature ($T_{\rm e}$) is critical for non-equilibrium plasma applications ranging from hypersonic flight to plasma-assisted combustion. We recently proposed a thermodynamically consistent model for vibrational-electron heating [Phys. Fluids 37, 096141 (2025)] that enforces the convergence of $T_{\rm e}$ to the vibrational temperature ($T_{\rm v}$) at equilibrium. However, the original derivation was restricted to single-quantum transitions, limiting its validity to low-temperature regimes ($T_{\rm e} \lesssim 1.5$ eV). In this Letter, we generalize the model to include multi-quantum overtone transitions, extending its applicability to high-energy regimes. We demonstrate that previous models neglecting hot-band transitions incur a systematic heating error of $\exp(-\theta_{\rm v}/T_{\rm v})$, where $\theta_{\rm v}$ is the characteristic vibrational temperature. This error exceeds 40\% when $T_{\rm v}$ is greater than $\theta_{\rm v}$, effectively preventing thermal relaxation. To correct this, we derive a formulation where the total heating rate is a summation of channel-specific cooling rates $Q_{\rm e-v}^{(m)}$, each associated with a quantum jump $m$, scaled by a thermodynamic factor $\exp(m\theta_{\rm v}/T_{\rm e}-m\theta_{\rm v}/T_{\rm v})$. This generalized model preserves thermodynamic consistency by ensuring zero net energy transfer at equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Positron Bunch Radiation in the System of Tightly Packed Nanotubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.08282</link>
      <description>arXiv:1512.08282v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Radiation emitted by a bunch of positrons channeled in nanotubes at zero emission angle is studied taking into account medium polarization. The formation of radiation is characterized by an energy threshold that depends on the oscillation amplitude of each positron. When the bunch energy reaches the maximum value of the threshold energy, radiation is produced by all positrons in the bunch. The nanotube potential barrier is described using a harmonic model. The spectral line shape of the radiation from the positron bunch, the fundamental radiation frequency, and the number of emitted photons are determined. It is shown that a system of tightly packed carbon nanotubes can generate an intense, quasi-monochromatic, and directed beam of circularly polarized soft X-ray photons with an energy of about $3$~\SI{}{\kilo\electronvolt} (wavelength $4.1$~\SI{}{\angstrom}).</description>

      <title>Electrode Geometry Optimization in Vortex-Type Seawater Magnetohydrodynamic Generators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22446v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) generators present a promising pathway for clean energy conversion by directly transforming conductive fluids' kinetic energy into electricity. This study investigates the impact of electrode geometry modifications on the performance of a vortex-type seawater MHD generator. Three electrode designs, partial, whole-area, and spiral, are analyzed through combined analytical and numerical simulations using COMSOL Multiphysics. The study focuses on internal resistance reduction, current density distribution, and overall power output. The results indicate that electrode area and spacing are critical determinants of performance. The whole-area electrode achieves the highest output, with a 155 percent increase in power compared to the baseline partial electrode. The spiral electrode demonstrates reduced internal resistance and improved current flow but exhibits lower open-circuit voltage due to reduced electrode spacing. The simulations show strong agreement with theoretical models, with deviations of less than 4 percent in open-circuit voltage predictions. These findings highlight the importance of geometric optimization for advancing seawater-based MHD generators as sustainable and efficient energy conversion systems.</description>
