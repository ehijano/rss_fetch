      <title>Topologically 1-based T-minimal Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove group existence and structure theorems in a general setting of tame topological theories. More precisely, we identify a linear/non-linear dividing line -- called topological 1-basedness -- among the class of t-minimal theories with the independent neighborhood property. This is a wide class including all visceral theories, as well as all dense weakly o-minimal and C-minimal theories (even those where exchange fails).
  Now assume $\mathcal M$ is highly saturated and t-minimal with the independent neighborhood property. We show that if $\mathcal M$ is non-trivial and topologically 1-based, it admits a type-definable abelian group $(G,+)$ with $G$ an open subset of $M$. Moreover, we can ensure that $G$ is a topological group with the subspace topology inherited from $M$; and in this case, we show that the induced structure on $G$ satisfies an appropriate topological analog of the Hrushovski-Pillay classification of 1-based stable groups.</description>

      <title>Borel Polychromatic Number of Grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Borel polychromatic colorings of grid graphs arising from free Borel actions of $\mathbb{Z}^d$. A polychromatic coloring is one in which every unit $d$-dimensional cube sees all available colors. In the classical setting, every grid admits a $2^d$-polychromatic coloring, while in the Borel setting this fails. Our main result shows that every free $\mathbb{Z}^d$-action admits a Borel $(2^d-1)$-polychromatic coloring. This result is sharp: any action where the generators act ergodically does not admit a Borel $2^d$-polychromatic coloring. We conclude with open directions for extending the theory beyond cube tilings and for exploring the dependence of Borel polychromatic numbers on the underlying action.</description>

      <title>Uniformization of ladder system colorings and stationary precaliber forcings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the relationship between variants of the uniformization property for ladder system colorings and fragments of Martin's Axiom. The well-known forcing properties of having precaliber $\aleph_1$ and being $\sigma$-centered correspond to uncountable refinement and countable decomposition into centered subsets, respectively, and the associated forcing axioms have been widely studied. In this paper, we focus on a forcing axiom for the property corresponding to stationary refinement, namely the stationary precaliber $\aleph_1$ property. Analogously, we observe that ladder system coloring uniformization also admits both stationary refinement and countable decomposition variants. We discuss the interaction between these uniformization properties and various forcing axioms. Through this analysis, we obtain as a main result the separation between the forcing axioms for stationary precaliber $\aleph_1$ and for $\sigma$-linked posets.</description>

      <title>Decidability of Extensions of Presburger Arithmetic by Hardy Field Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the extension of Presburger arithmetic by the class of sub-polynomial Hardy field functions, and show the majority of these extensions to be undecidable. More precisely, we show that the theory $\mathrm{Th}(\mathbb{Z}; &lt;, +, \lfloor f \rceil)$, where $f$ is a Hardy field function and $\lfloor \cdot \rceil$ the nearest integer operator, is undecidable when $f$ grows polynomially faster than $x$. Further, we show that when $f$ grows sub-linearly quickly, but still as fast as some polynomial, the theory $\mathrm{Th}(\mathbb{Z}; &lt;, +, \lfloor f \rceil)$ is undecidable.</description>

      <title>Imaginaries, products and the adele ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.11678v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe the imaginary sorts of infinite products in terms of imaginary sorts of the factors. We extend the result to certain reduced powers and then to infinite products $\prod_{i\in I} M_i$ enriched with a predicate for the ideal of finite subsets of $I$. As a special case, using the Hils-Rideau-Kikuchi uniform $p$-adic elimination of imaginaries, we find the imaginary sorts of the ring of rational adeles. Our methods include the use of the Harrington-Kechris-Louveau Glimm-Efros dichotomy both for transitioning from monadic second order imaginaries to first-order reducts, and for proving a certain ``one-way'' model-theoretic orthogonality within the adelic imaginaries.</description>

      <title>Basic Category Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.09375</link>
      <description>arXiv:1612.09375v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This short introductory category theory textbook is for readers with relatively little mathematical background (e.g. the first half of an undergraduate mathematics degree). At its heart is the concept of a universal property, important throughout mathematics. After a chapter introducing the basic definitions, separate chapters present three ways of expressing universal properties: via adjoint functors, representable functors, and limits. A final chapter ties the three together.
  For each new categorical concept, a generous supply of examples is provided, taken from different parts of mathematics. At points where the leap in abstraction is particularly great (such as the Yoneda lemma), the reader will find careful and extensive explanations.</description>
