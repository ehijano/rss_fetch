      <title>Numerical study of Lagrangian velocity structure functions using acceleration statistics and a spatial-temporal perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fundamental relation in Lagrangian Kolmogorov theory is concerned with inertial range scaling of the second-order velocity structure function over intermediate time lags at sufficiently high Reynolds numbers. However, the scaling is not well observed, and it is uncertain whether the scaling constant ($C_0$) truly approaches a constant value at asymptotic Reynolds numbers. In this paper, direct numerical simulation of forced isotropic turbulence at Taylor-scale Reynolds numbers between 140 and 1300 is used to help advance understanding in this subject. Uncertainties arising from modest simulation time spans are addressed by expressing the velocity structure function in terms of the acceleration autocorrelation, which suggests that $C_0$ may be sensitive to intermittency effects, leading to a sustained, although weak, Reynolds number dependence. The Lagrangian velocity increment is examined from a spatial-temporal perspective, as a combination of convective (spatial) and local (temporal) contributions, which are subject to a strong but incomplete mutual cancellation dependent on Reynolds number and time lag. The convective increment is strongly influenced by the particle displacement, which is driven by large-scale dynamics and can thus grow into inertial range dimensions in space within just a few Kolmogorov time scales, without fully satisfying classical Lagrangian inertial-range requirements. An overall conclusion in this work is that both the limited range of time scales (narrower than for length scales) and the effects of particle displacements have significant roles in the observed behavior of the second-order Lagrangian velocity structure function.</description>

      <title>Vertical velocities in quasigeostrophic laboratory vortices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present study, we test the predictions of the {\omega}-Equation against laboratory experiments with direct measurements of the vertical velocity w. Our results are further completed through the use of theoretical models of oceanic vortices, with the aim of helping oceanographers in better quantifying regions of upwelling and downwelling in the ocean. Using a rotating table and density stratification, we investigate non-axisymmetric surface vortices. The predicted vertical velocities calculated from the {\omega}-Equation are relatively small (|w| ~ 20 {\mu}m/s) and primarily appear at the vortex edges, where the vorticity sign changes, acting to restore flow stratification. However, our estimates of w, obtained from the divergence of the horizontal velocity field measured by PIV, are five times larger. This discrepancy is further confirmed by direct particle tracking measurements, which indicate a magnitude of approximately 100 {\mu}m/s for w. To address this inconsistency, we incorporate dissipative terms into the {\omega}-Equation to assess the role of viscous diffusion in enhancing internal recirculation in the vortex and thus vertical velocity magnitude. This hypothesis is favorably tested on a Gaussian vortex model.</description>

      <title>On the essential structure of exact traveling-wave solutions in viscoelastic flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine elastic travelling-wave (`arrowhead') solutions in a viscoelastic, unidirectionally body-forced flow, focusing on their existence and morphological changes as the Weissenberg number, $\mathrm{Wi}$, and streamwise duct length, $L$, are varied. We find that branch topology varies from an isola at low $L$ through a two-sided reconnection at intermediate $L$ to a branch which exists at asymptotically large $\mathrm{Wi}$ for larger $L$. At intermediate $L$ more than two arrowhead solutions can coexist at a given $(\mathrm{Wi}, L)$ choice due to extra saddle node bifurcations. Secondly, the canonical arrowhead consists of two legs joined by an arched head that blocks throughflow and traps a counter-rotating vortex pair, while a polymer strand can emerge as a by-product of a strong extensional region attached/detached to the arrowhead arch. Thirdly, a minimal domain length $L_{\min}$ required to sustain an arrowhead is found to vary non-monotonically with $\mathrm{Wi}$; for $\mathrm{Wi}\ge 20$, detached-strand states control $L_{\min}$ with a relation $L_{\min}\approx 0.125\mathrm{Wi}+1.5$. And fourthly, in sufficiently long domains, the upper branch becomes a localised single arrowhead whose streamwise extent depends on $\mathrm{Wi}$, whereas the lower branch can proliferate into a train of arrowheads at high $\mathrm{Wi}$, a phenomenon not previously reported.</description>

      <title>Transient and periodic shear wave propagation in a solid-fluid coupled system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A coupled system composed of a Newtonian fluid located on a sinusoidally-forced elastic solid is studied analytically and numerically. The focus is on the transient evolution from the beginning of the forced oscillations and on the periodic behaviour established once the transient has vanished. The analytical solution is expressed as series summations that elucidate the propagation and reflections of elastic transverse waves through the solid layer and the viscous dissipation of oscillations in the fluid layer. Short-term transients in both the fluid and the solid form at every interaction between an elastic wave and a solid boundary. The long-term transient, quantified by the power balance in the fluid layer, instead pertains to the formation of all the elastic waves in the solid layer. The system can be viewed as a generalised transient Stokes layer generated by the elastic waves or as a damped resonant oscillator when the velocity at the fluid-solid interface increases significantly with respect to the amplitude. A parametric study is carried out for three applications of technological interest, i.e. the indirect measurement of fluid viscosity, the turbulent drag reduction by travelling shear waves and the sensing and manipulation of biological flows.</description>

      <title>HydroGym: A Reinforcement Learning Platform for Fluid Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling and controlling fluid flows is critical for several fields of science and engineering, including transportation, energy, and medicine. Effective flow control can lead to, e.g., lift increase, drag reduction, mixing enhancement, and noise reduction. However, controlling a fluid faces several significant challenges, including high-dimensional, nonlinear, and multiscale interactions in space and time. Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently shown great success in complex domains, such as robotics and protein folding, but its application to flow control is hindered by a lack of standardized benchmark platforms and the computational demands of fluid simulations. To address these challenges, we introduce HydroGym, a solver-independent RL platform for flow control research. HydroGym integrates sophisticated flow control benchmarks, scalable runtime infrastructure, and state-of-the-art RL algorithms. Our platform includes 42 validated environments spanning from canonical laminar flows to complex three-dimensional turbulent scenarios, validated over a wide range of Reynolds numbers. We provide non-differentiable solvers for traditional RL and differentiable solvers that dramatically improve sample efficiency through gradient-enhanced optimization. Comprehensive evaluation reveals that RL agents consistently discover robust control principles across configurations, such as boundary layer manipulation, acoustic feedback disruption, and wake reorganization. Transfer learning studies demonstrate that controllers learned at one Reynolds number or geometry adapt efficiently to new conditions, requiring approximately 50% fewer training episodes. The HydroGym platform is highly extensible and scalable, providing a framework for researchers in fluid dynamics, machine learning, and control to add environments, surrogate models, and control algorithms to advance science and technology.</description>

      <title>The resonance behavior of a bubble near a boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analytical model for the frequency response of a gas microbubble oscillating near a spherical inclusion of arbitrary size and mechanical nature (rigid, fluid, or viscoelastic) immersed in a viscous compressible fluid. The model considers both radial and nonspherical oscillations in the linear regime and predicts how their resonance frequencies and oscillation amplitudes are altered by the bubble size, material properties, and distance to the nearby sphere. As a key application, we demonstrate that scanning the frequency response of a bubble near a viscoelastic object, such as an erythrocyte-like particle mimicking a biological cell, offers a way to recover its mechanical properties through inverse modeling, opening new possibilities for high-resolution elastography at the microscale.</description>

      <title>Design, Testing and Numerical Modelling of a Low-Speed Wind Tunnel Gust Generator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding and accurately reproducing gust-induced unsteady aerodynamics is essential for improving load prediction, aeroelastic analysis, and control strategies in aircraft, uninhabited aerial vehicles, and wind turbines, particularly in regimes where nonlinear flow phenomena dominate. In this work, a low-speed wind tunnel gust generator based on oscillating vanes is designed, manufactured, and characterised through a combined experimental and numerical investigation. The system is intended to reproduce deterministic gust profiles relevant to aircraft, uninhabited aerial vehicles, and wind-turbine applications, operating in highly unsteady aerodynamic regimes. Experimental measurements using hot-wire anemometry are performed to quantify the generated gust field under a range of free-stream velocities, amplitudes, and forcing frequencies. In parallel, time-accurate CFD simulations are conducted using a deforming-mesh approach to validate the measurements and to analyse the flow physics associated with gust formation and propagation. Particular attention is given to the negative velocity peaks inherent to classical '1-cos' gust profiles. A modified vane motion protocol is proposed and shown to significantly reduce the negative peak factor while maintaining a substantial gust ratio. Numerical results reveal that secondary flow-angle variations arise from nonlinear interactions between vortices shed by adjacent vanes.</description>

      <title>The influence of energy-containing scales on the distribution of spectral energy transfers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present computations of individual mode-to-mode energy transfers from direct numerical simulations of homogeneous isotropic turbulence. Unlike previous approaches based on shell-filtered velocity fields, this method distinguishes between the energy exchanged by each pair of modes within a triad. We introduce a potential function based on the energy content of the modes involved and show that it predicts the distribution of intense energy transfers in the vicinity of the sampling mode considered. By performing simulations with forcing applied at intermediate wavenumbers, we demonstrate that the region of most intense transfers is determined by the spectral location of the energy-containing scales rather than by the local or nonlocal character of the triad. Direct energy exchanges with the energy-containing range are suppressed by geometric constraints from the divergence-free condition, but persist as residuals when the sampling mode is close to the energy-containing scales. The comparison with an estimator derived from EDQNM theory shows good agreement and recovers the forward, scale-local nature of energy transfer consistent with the cascade picture.</description>

      <title>Fluid-inertia torques from particle-shape symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical simulation of particle motion in fluids at low particle Reynolds numbers is often based on empirical force and torque models obtained by fitting force and torque from ab-initio computations for simple particle shapes such as spheres, spheroids, or cylindrical disks and fibres. To do the same for more complex particles shapes, one needs to first know how particle shape constrains the dependence of force and torque on flow velocity, its gradient, and on particle orientation. Here we use symmetry analysis and perturbation theory to determine the form of the hydrodynamic torque on a particle settling in a quiescent fluid at low but non-zero particle Reynolds numbers, for particle shapes with different point-group symmetries. The symmetry conclusions are verified by comparing with explicit calculations for nearly spherical particles.</description>

      <title>Tuna-Like Swimmers Experience a Fluid-Mediated Stable Side-by-Side Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: New free-swimming experiments and simulations are conducted on a pair of three-dimensional, bio-robotic swimmers composed of a body and tail section based on Yellowfin tuna, Thunnus albacares. It is discovered that the pair converges spontaneously to a side-by-side schooling formation that is stable to perturbations in the swimming direction at a fixed lateral spacing. We reveal that for close lateral spacings of 43% of the body length and thick, tuna-like bodies with a 22% thickness-to-length ratio, the flow between the swimmers is accelerated in a "channeling effect" due to flow constriction. Consequently, this creates a low-pressure zone that is the primary mechanism generating a fluid-mediated restorative force, thereby making the side-by-side formation hydrodynamically stable. This quasi-steady mechanism makes the stability of the formation insensitive to the phase synchronization between the bio-robots in contrast to previous results for schooling foils. Moreover, in the side-by-side formation tunalike swimmers are seen to have only a small reduction in their swimming speed and a concurrent small rise in their cost of transport. By leveraging this channeling effect, bio-robotic schools may be able to maintain a schooling formation with little or no control. This flow mechanism may also be present in biological schools of tuna-like fish where it may sculpt the formations observed in nature.</description>

      <title>Selective trapping of bacteria in porous media by cell length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bacteria commonly inhabit porous environments such as host tissues, soil, and marine sediments, where complex geometries constrain and redirect their motion. Although bacterial motility has been studied in porous media, the roles of cell length and pore shape in navigating these environments remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate how cell morphology and pore architecture jointly determine bacterial spreading behavior. Using genetically engineered E. coli with tunable cell length, we performed single-cell tracking in microfluidic devices that mimic ordered and disordered porous structures. We find that elongated bacteria traverse ordered pore networks more effectively than short cells, exhibiting straighter paths, greater directional persistence, and enhanced exploration efficiency. In contrast, in disordered porous media, elongated bacteria become trapped in dead-end regions for extended periods, resulting in markedly reduced navigational efficiency. Together, these results reveal how cell shape and environmental geometry interact to govern bacterial transport. Moreover, we suggest a new mechanism for separating antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) bacteria from elongated susceptible cells in designer porous media.</description>

      <title>An Asymptotic Approach for Modeling Multiscale Complex Fluids at the Fast Relaxation Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new asymptotic strategy for general micro-macro models which analyze complex viscoelastic fluids governed by coupled multiscale dynamics. In such models, the elastic stress appearing in the macroscopic continuum equation is derived from the microscopic kinetic theory, which makes direct numerical simulations computationally expensive. To address this challenge, we introduce a formal asymptotic scheme that expands the density function around an equilibrium distribution, thereby reducing the high computational cost associated with the fully coupled microscopic processes while still maintaining the dynamic microscopic feedback in explicit expressions. The proposed asymptotic expansion is based on a detailed physical scaling law which characterizes the multiscale balance at the fast relaxation limit of the microscopic state. An asymptotic closure model for the macroscopic fluid equation is then derived according to the explicit asymptotic density expansion. Furthermore, the resulting closure model preserves the energy-dissipation law inherited from the original fully coupled multiscale system. Numerical experiments are performed to validate the asymptotic density formula and the corresponding flow velocity equations in several micro-macro models. This new asymptotic strategy offers a promising approach for efficient computations of a wide range of multiscale complex fluids.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We experimentally measure paticle acceleration within the bulk during the discharge of a granular silo. We highlight the existence of a deceleration wave emerging at the outlet level near the dead zone and propagates toward the top of the medium. The wave emission frequency is extracted from spatiotemporal diagrams of the Eulerian instantaneous acceleration profiles. Surprisingly, we find that this frequency decreases with the cohesion of the medium and is independent of the outlet size.</description>

      <title>Learning vertical coordinates via automatic differentiation of a dynamical core</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Terrain-following coordinates in atmospheric models often imprint their grid structure onto the solution, particularly over steep topography, where distorted coordinate layers can generate spurious horizontal and vertical motion. Standard formulations, such as hybrid or SLEVE coordinates, mitigate these errors by using analytic decay functions controlled by heuristic scale parameters that are typically tuned by hand and fixed a priori. In this work, we propose a framework to define a parametric vertical coordinate system as a learnable component within a differentiable dynamical core. We develop an end-to-end differentiable numerical solver for the two-dimensional non-hydrostatic Euler equations on an Arakawa C-grid, and introduce a NEUral Vertical Enhancement (NEUVE) terrain-following coordinate based on an integral transformed neural network that guarantees monotonicity. A key feature of our approach is the use of automatic differentiation to compute exact geometric metric terms, thereby eliminating truncation errors associated with finite-difference coordinate derivatives. By coupling simulation errors through the time integration to the parameterization, our formulation finds a grid structure optimized for both the underlying physics and numerics. Using several standard tests, we demonstrate that these learned coordinates reduce the mean squared error by a factor of 1.4 to 2 in non-linear statistical benchmarks, and eliminate spurious vertical velocity striations over steep topography.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we revisit the Generalized Navier Boundary condition (GNBC) introduced by Qian et al.\ in the sharp interface Volume-of-Fluid context. We replace the singular uncompensated Young stress by a smooth function with a characteristic width $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ that is understood as a physical parameter of the model. Therefore, we call the model the ``Contact Region GNBC'' (CR-GNBC). We show that the model is consistent with the fundamental kinematics of the contact angle transport described by Fricke, K\"ohne and Bothe. We implement the model in the geometrical Volume-of-Fluid solver Basilisk using a ``free angle'' approach. This means that the dynamic contact angle is not prescribed but reconstructed from the interface geometry and subsequently applied as an input parameter to compute the uncompensated Young stress. We couple this approach to the two-phase Navier Stokes solver and study the withdrawing tape problem with a receding contact line. It is shown that the model allows for grid-independent solutions and leads to a full regularization of the singularity at the moving contact line, which is in accordance with the thin-film equation subject to this boundary condition. In particular, it is shown that the curvature at the moving contact line is finite and mesh converging. As predicted by the fundamental kinematics, the parallel shear stress component vanishes at the moving contact line for quasi-stationary states (i.e. for $\dot{\theta}_d=0$) and the dynamic contact angle is determined by a balance between the uncompensated Young stress and an effective contact line friction. Furthermore, a non-linear generalization of the model is proposed, which aims at reproducing the Molecular Kinetic Theory of Blake and Haynes for quasi-stationary states.</description>

      <title>Collective effects of neighbouring melting ice objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16926v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a study on the melting dynamics of neighbouring ice bodies by means of idealised simulations, focusing on collective effects, with the goal of obtaining fundamental insight into how collective interactions influence the melting of ice. Two neighbouring (vertically or horizontally aligned), square-shaped, and equally sized ice objects (size on the order of centimetres) are immersed in quiescent fresh water at a temperature of 20{\deg}C. By performing two-dimensional direct numerical simulations, and using the phase-field method to model the phase change, the collective melting of these objects is studied. When the objects are horizontally aligned, no significant influence of the neighbouring object on the melting time is observed. On the other hand, when vertically aligned, though the melting of the upper object is mostly unaffected, the melting time and the morphology of the lower ice body strongly depends on the initial inter-object distance. We report that the melting of the bottom object can be enhanced by more than 10%, or delayed more than 20%, displaying a non-monotonic dependence on the initial object size. We show that this behaviour results from a non-trivial competition between layering of cold fluid, which lowers the heat transfer, and convective flows, which favour mixing and heat transfer. For this melting in mixed convection, we were able to collapse our data onto a single curve.</description>

      <title>Emergent dynamical scaling in the inviscid limit of 3D stochastic Navier-Stokes equation with thermal noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05811v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the Navier-Stokes equation in the presence of thermal noise, both at finite viscosity (revisiting the seminal work by Forster-Nelson-Stephen) and in the inviscid limit, which has not yet been explored. We determine the space-time velocity correlations in this dynamics, using functional renormalisation group and direct numerical simulations. While spectrally truncated three-dimensional Euler flows reach a stationary equilibrium state, they exhibit non-trivial temporal correlations. We show that these non-trivial correlations persist for small but finite viscosity, yielding an emergent $\tau\sim k^{-1}$ dynamical scaling, where $\tau$ is the decorrelation time. We characterise the crossover from the scaling $\tau\sim 1/(\nu k^2)$, expected at large viscosity, to the scaling $\tau\sim 1/(u_{\rm rms}k)$ found in the inviscid limit.</description>

      <title>Mean velocity profile in stably stratified turbulent channel flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03349v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Monin-Obukhov Similarity Theory (MOST) is a cornerstone of atmospheric science for describing turbulence in stable boundary layers. Extending MOST to stably stratified turbulent channel flows, however, is non-trivial due to confinement by solid walls and the much smaller turbulent length scales involved. In this study, we investigate the applicability of MOST in closed channels and identify where and to what extent the theory remains valid. A key finding is that the ratio of the half-channel height to the Obukhov length serves as a governing parameter for identifying distinct flow regions and determining the scaling of the mean velocity within them. Hence, we propose a closure relation to estimate this ratio directly from the governing input parameters: friction Reynolds and friction Richardson numbers ($Re_{\tau}$ and $Ri_{\tau}$). The framework is tested against a series of direct numerical simulations (DNS) across a range of $Re_{\tau}$ and $Ri_{\tau}$. The reconstructed velocity profiles enable accurate prediction of the skin friction coefficient crucial for quantifying pressure losses in stratified flows in engineering applications.</description>

      <title>Verification of Convergent-Divergent Nozzle Designs in Propulsion Aerospace Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11667v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The performance of convergent and divergent nozzles is critical in aerospace propulsion systems, where the efficient expansion of high-temperature, high-pressure gases directly impacts thrust generation. In this study, we investigate a series of nozzle geometries using numerical simulations in ANSYS Fluent, guided by classical compressible flow theory, initially developed by Ludwig Prandtl. The governing equations of conservation of mass, momentum, and energy are solved under steady-state conditions, with emphasis on shock formation, boundary-layer effects, and Mach number distributions across the nozzle throat and divergent section. Parametric analyses are conducted to evaluate the influence of nozzle contour, area ratio, and throat geometry on flow acceleration and thrust coefficient. The results demonstrate close agreement with theoretical predictions of isentropic compressible flow while also highlighting deviations due to viscous and three-dimensional effects. These findings provide design insights for optimizing nozzle performance across propulsion applications, from launch vehicles to high-speed air-breathing systems. We obtained absolute error differences of 2.05 percent, 6.03 percent, and 9.9 percent in the throat temperature measurements for the RL10B2, SSME-40k, and A-1 nozzles, respectively.</description>

      <title>The long way of a viscous vortex dipole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13562v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the evolution of a viscous vortex dipole in $R^2$ originating from a pair of point vortices with opposite circulations. At high Reynolds number $Re &gt;&gt; 1$, the dipole can travel a very long way, compared to the distance between the vortex centers, before being slowed down and eventually destroyed by diffusion. In this regime we construct an accurate approximation of the solution in the form of a two-parameter asymptotic expansion involving the aspect ratio of the dipole and the inverse Reynolds number. We then show that the exact solution of the Navier-Stokes equations remains close to the approximation on a time interval of length $O(Re^\sigma)$, where $\sigma &lt; 1$ is arbitrary. This improves upon previous results which were essentially restricted to $\sigma = 0$. As an application, we provide a rigorous justification of an existing formula which gives the leading order correction to the translation speed of the dipole due to finite size effects.</description>
