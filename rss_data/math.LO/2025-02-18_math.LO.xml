      <title>Walks along a weak square sequence and the non-semiproperness of Namba forcings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we demonstrate that if, for every $\kappa$-complete fine filter $F$ over $\mathcal{P}_{\kappa}\lambda$, the associated Namba forcing $\mathrm{Nm}(\kappa,\lambda,F)$ is semiproper, then $\square(\mu,{&lt;}\aleph_1)$ fails for all regular $\mu \in [\lambda, 2^{\lambda}]$ under the certain cardinal arithmetic. In particular, this result establishes that the consistency strength of the semiproperness of $\mathrm{Nm}(\aleph_2,F)$ for every $\aleph_2$-complete filter $F$ over $\aleph_2$ exceeds the strength of infinitely many Woodin cardinals.
  Minimal walk methods associated with a square sequece play a central role in this paper. These observations introduce two-cardinal walks with naive $C$-sequences and show that the existence of non-reflecting stationary subsets implies $\mathcal{P}_{\kappa}\lambda \not\to [I_{\kappa\lambda}^{+}]^{3}_{\lambda}$.</description>

      <title>Sharply k-transitive actions on ultrahomogeneous structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given an action of a group $G$ by automorphisms on an infinite relational structure $\mathcal{M}$, we say that the action is structurally sharply $k$-transitive if, for any two $k$-tuples $\bar{a}, \bar{b} \in M^k$ of distinct elements such that $\bar{a} \mapsto \bar{b}$ is an isomorphism, there exists exactly one element of $G$ sending $\bar{a}$ to $\bar{b}$. This generalises the well-known notion of a sharply $k$-transitive action on a set. We show that, for $k \leq 3$, a wide range of countable ultrahomogeneous structures admit structurally sharply $k$-transitive actions by finitely generated virtually free groups, giving a substantial answer to a question of Cameron from the book Oligomorphic Permutation Groups. We also show that the random $k$-hypertournament admits a structurally sharply $k$-transitive action for $k=4,5$, and that $\mathbb{Q}$ and several of its reducts admit structurally sharply $k$-transitive actions for all $k$. (This contrasts with the case of sets, where for $k \geq 4$ there are no sharply $k$-transitive actions on infinite sets by results of Tits and Hall.) We also show the existence of sharply $2$-transitive actions of finitely generated virtually free groups on an infinite set, solving the open question of whether such actions exist for hyperbolic groups.

      <title>Normality, Relativization, and Randomness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10204v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Normal numbers were introduced by Borel and later proven to be a weak notion of algorithmic randomness. We introduce here a natural relativization of normality based on generalized number representation systems. We explore the concepts of supernormal numbers that correspond to semicomputable relativizations, and that of highly normal numbers in terms of computable ones.
  We prove several properties of these new randomness concepts. Both supernormality and high normality generalize Borel absolute normality. Supernormality is strictly between 2-randomness and effective dimension 1, while high normality corresponds exactly to sequences of computable dimension 1 providing a more natural characterization of this class.</description>

      <title>Reasoning from hypotheses in *-continuous action lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02118v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The class of all $\ast$-continuous Kleene algebras, whose description includes an infinitary condition on the iteration operator, plays an important role in computer science. The complexity of reasoning in such algebras - ranging from the equational theory to the Horn one, with restricted fragments of the latter in between - was analyzed by Kozen (2002). This paper deals with similar problems for $\ast$-continuous residuated Kleene lattices, also called $\ast$-continuous action lattices, where the product operation is augmented by residuals. We prove that, in the presence of residuals, the fragment of the corresponding Horn theory with $\ast$-free hypotheses has the same complexity as the $\omega^\omega$ iteration of the halting problem, and hence is properly hyperarithmetical. We also prove that if only commutativity conditions are allowed as hypotheses, then the complexity drops down to $\Pi^0_1$ (i.e. the complement of the halting problem), which is the same as that for $\ast$-continuous Kleene algebras. In fact, we get stronger upper bound results: the fragments under consideration are translated into suitable fragments of infinitary action logic with exponentiation, and our upper bounds are obtained for the latter ones.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we construct a compact subset of the real plane whose path-connectedness equivalence relation is Borel bireducible to a nonsmooth hyperfinite Borel equivalence relation. This answers a question of \cite{bec98}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10531v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that every non-trivial ordered abelian group $G$ is augmentable by infinite elements, i.e., we have $G\preccurlyeq H\oplus G$ for some non-trivial ordered abelian group $H$. As an application, we show that when $k$ is a field of characteristic 0, then $k$ is not $t$-henselian if and only if all henselian valuations with residue field $k$ are ($\emptyset$-)definable.</description>

      <title>On foundations for deductive mathematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02507v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article was motivated by the discovery of a potential new foundation for mainstream mathematics. The goals are to clarify the relationships between primitives, foundations, and deductive practice; to understand how to determine what is, or isn't, a foundation; and get clues as to how a foundation can be optimized for effective human use.
  For this we turn to history and professional practice of the subject. We have no asperations to Philosophy.
  The first section gives a short abstract discussion, focusing on the significance of consistency. The next briefly describes foundations, explicit and implicit, at a few key periods in mathematical history. We see, for example, that at the primitive level human intuitions are essential, but can be problematic. We also see that traditional axiomatic set theories, Zermillo-Fraenkel-Choice (ZFC) in particular, are not quite consistent with mainstream practice. The final section sketches the proposed new foundation and gives the basic argument that it is uniquely qualified to be considered {the} foundation of mainstream deductive mathematics. The ``coherent limit axiom'' characterizes the new theory among ZFC-like theories. This axiom plays a role in recursion, but is implicitly assumed in mainstream work so does not provide new leverage there. In principle it should settle set-theory questions such as the continuum hypothesis.</description>

      <title>G\"odel Incompleteness Theorem for PAC Learnable Theory from the view of complexity measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10211v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Different from the view that information is objective reality, this paper adopts the idea that all information needs to be compiled by the interpreter before it can be observed. From the traditional complexity definition, this paper defines the complexity under "the interpreter", which means that heuristically finding the best interpreter is equivalent to using PAC to find the most suitable interpreter. Then we generalize the observation process to the formal system with functors, in which we give concrete proof of the generalized G\"odel incompleteness theorem which indicates that there are some objects that are PAC-learnable, but the best interpreter is not found among the alternative interpreters. A strong enough machine algorithm cannot be interpretable in the face of any object. There are always objects that make a strong enough machine learning algorithm uninterpretable, which puts an upper bound on the generalization ability of strong AI.</description>
