      <title>Network Models of Expertise in the Complex Task of Operating Particle Accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We implement a network-based approach to study expertise in a complex real-world task: operating particle accelerators. Most real-world tasks we learn and perform (e.g., driving cars, operating complex machines, solving mathematical problems) are difficult to learn because they are complex, and the best strategies are difficult to find from many possibilities. However, how we learn such complex tasks remains a partially solved mystery, as we cannot explain how the strategies evolve with practice due to the difficulties of collecting and modeling complex behavioral data. As complex tasks are generally networks of many elementary subtasks, we model task performance as networks or graphs of subtasks and investigate how the networks change with expertise. We develop the networks by processing the text in a large archive of operator logs from 14 years of operations using natural language processing and machine learning. The network changes are examined using a set of measures at four levels of granularity - individual subtasks, interconnections among subtasks, groups of subtasks, and the whole complex task. We find that the operators consistently change with expertise at the subtask, the interconnection, and the whole-task levels, but they show remarkable similarity in how subtasks are grouped. These results indicate that the operators of all stages of expertise adopt a common divide-and-conquer approach by breaking the complex task into parts of manageable complexity, but they differ in the frequency and structure of nested subtasks. Operational logs are common data sources from real-world settings where people collaborate with hardware and software environments to execute complex tasks, and the network models investigated in this study can be expanded to accommodate multi-modal data. Therefore, our network-based approach provides a practical way to investigate expertise in the real world.</description>

      <title>Faces speak louder than words: Emotions versus textual sentiment in the 2024 USA Presidential Election</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sentiment analysis of textual content has become a well-established solution for analyzing social media data. However, with the rise of images and videos as primary modes of expression, more information on social media is conveyed visually. Among these, facial expressions serve as one of the most direct indicators of emotional content in images. This study analyzes a dataset of Instagram posts related to the 2024 U.S. presidential election, spanning April 5, 2024, to August 9, 2024, to compare the relationship between textual and facial sentiment. Our findings reveal that facial expressions generally align with text sentiment, although neutral and negative facial expressions provide critical information beyond valence. Furthermore, during politically significant events such as Donald Trump's conviction and assassination attempt, posts depicting Trump showed a 12% increase in negative sentiment. Crucially, Democrats use their opponent's fear to depict weakness whereas Republicans use their candidate's anger to depict resilience. Our research highlights the potential of integrating facial expression analysis with textual sentiment analysis to uncover deeper insights into social media dynamics.</description>

      <title>Emoji Retrieval from Gibberish or Garbled Social Media Text: A Novel Methodology and A Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emojis are widely used across social media platforms but are often lost in noisy or garbled text, posing challenges for data analysis and machine learning. Conventional preprocessing approaches recommend removing such text, risking the loss of emojis and their contextual meaning. This paper proposes a three-step reverse-engineering methodology to retrieve emojis from garbled text in social media posts. The methodology also identifies reasons for the generation of such text during social media data mining. To evaluate its effectiveness, the approach was applied to 509,248 Tweets about the Mpox outbreak, a dataset referenced in about 30 prior works that failed to retrieve emojis from garbled text. Our method retrieved 157,748 emojis from 76,914 Tweets. Improvements in text readability and coherence were demonstrated through metrics such as Flesch Reading Ease, Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level, Coleman-Liau Index, Automated Readability Index, Dale-Chall Readability Score, Text Standard, and Reading Time. Additionally, the frequency of individual emojis and their patterns of usage in these Tweets were analyzed, and the results are presented.</description>

      <title>Supervised centrality Cvia sparse network influence regression: an application to the 2021 henan floods' social network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The social characteristics of players in a social network are closely associated with their network positions and relational importance. Identifying those influential players in a network is of great importance as it helps to understand how ties are formed, how information is propagated, and, in turn, can guide the dissemination of new information. Motivated by a Sina Weibo social network analysis of the 2021 Henan Floods, where response variables for each Sina Weibo user are available, we propose a new notion of supervised centrality that emphasizes the task-specific nature of a player's centrality. To estimate the supervised centrality and identify important players, we develop a novel sparse network influence regression by introducing individual heterogeneity for each user. To overcome the computational difficulties in fitting the model for large social networks, we further develop a forward-addition algorithm and show that it can consistently identify a superset of the influential Sina Weibo users. We apply our method to analyze three responses in the Henan Floods data: the number of comments, reposts, and likes, and obtain meaningful results. A further simulation study corroborates the developed method.</description>

      <title>Are We in the AI-Generated Text World Already? Quantifying and Monitoring AIGT on Social Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social media platforms are experiencing a growing presence of AI-Generated Texts (AIGTs). However, the misuse of AIGTs could have profound implications for public opinion, such as spreading misinformation and manipulating narratives. Despite its importance, a systematic study to assess the prevalence of AIGTs on social media is still lacking. To address this gap, this paper aims to quantify, monitor, and analyze the AIGTs on online social media platforms. We first collect a dataset (SM-D) with around 2.4M posts from 3 major social media platforms: Medium, Quora, and Reddit. Then, we construct a diverse dataset (AIGTBench) to train and evaluate AIGT detectors. AIGTBench combines popular open-source datasets and our AIGT datasets generated from social media texts by 12 LLMs, serving as a benchmark for evaluating mainstream detectors. With this setup, we identify the best-performing detector (OSM-Det). We then apply OSM-Det to SM-D to track AIGTs over time and observe different trends of AI Attribution Rate (AAR) across social media platforms from January 2022 to October 2024. Specifically, Medium and Quora exhibit marked increases in AAR, rising from 1.77% to 37.03% and 2.06% to 38.95%, respectively. In contrast, Reddit shows slower growth, with AAR increasing from 1.31% to 2.45% over the same period. Our further analysis indicates that AIGTs differ from human-written texts across several dimensions, including linguistic patterns, topic distributions, engagement levels, and the follower distribution of authors. We envision our analysis and findings on AIGTs in social media can shed light on future research in this domain.</description>

      <title>Semi-supervised Credit Card Fraud Detection via Attribute-Driven Graph Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Credit card fraud incurs a considerable cost for both cardholders and issuing banks. Contemporary methods apply machine learning-based classifiers to detect fraudulent behavior from labeled transaction records. But labeled data are usually a small proportion of billions of real transactions due to expensive labeling costs, which implies that they do not well exploit many natural features from unlabeled data. Therefore, we propose a semi-supervised graph neural network for fraud detection. Specifically, we leverage transaction records to construct a temporal transaction graph, which is composed of temporal transactions (nodes) and interactions (edges) among them. Then we pass messages among the nodes through a Gated Temporal Attention Network (GTAN) to learn the transaction representation. We further model the fraud patterns through risk propagation among transactions. The extensive experiments are conducted on a real-world transaction dataset and two publicly available fraud detection datasets. The result shows that our proposed method, namely GTAN, outperforms other state-of-the-art baselines on three fraud detection datasets. Semi-supervised experiments demonstrate the excellent fraud detection performance of our model with only a tiny proportion of labeled data.</description>

      <title>MotifGPL: Motif-Enhanced Graph Prototype Learning for Deciphering Urban Social Segregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social segregation in cities, spanning racial, residential, and income dimensions, is becoming more diverse and severe. As urban spaces and social relations grow more complex, residents in metropolitan areas experience varying levels of social segregation. If left unaddressed, this could lead to increased crime rates, heightened social tensions, and other serious issues. Effectively quantifying and analyzing the structures within urban spaces and resident interactions is crucial for addressing segregation. Previous studies have mainly focused on surface-level indicators of urban segregation, lacking comprehensive analyses of urban structure and mobility. This limitation fails to capture the full complexity of segregation. To address this gap, we propose a framework named Motif-Enhanced Graph Prototype Learning (MotifGPL),which consists of three key modules: prototype-based graph structure extraction, motif distribution discovery, and urban graph structure reconstruction. Specifically, we use graph structure prototype learning to extract key prototypes from both the urban spatial graph and the origin-destination graph, incorporating key urban attributes such as points of interest, street view images, and flow indices. To enhance interpretability, the motif distribution discovery module matches each prototype with similar motifs, representing simpler graph structures reflecting local patterns. Finally, we use the motif distribution results to guide the reconstruction of the two graphs. This model enables a detailed exploration of urban spatial structures and resident mobility patterns, helping identify and analyze motif patterns that influence urban segregation, guiding the reconstruction of urban graph structures. Experimental results demonstrate that MotifGPL effectively reveals the key motifs affecting urban social segregation and offer robust guidance for mitigating this issue.</description>

      <title>Post-pandemic social contacts in Italy: implications for social distancing measures on in-person school and work attendance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The collection of updated data on social contact patterns following the COVID-19 pandemic disruptions is crucial for future epidemiological assessments and evaluating non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) based on physical distancing. We conducted two waves of an online survey in March 2022 and March 2023 in Italy, gathering data from a representative population sample on direct (verbal/physical interactions) and indirect (prolonged co-location in indoor spaces) contacts. Using a generalized linear mixed model, we examined determinants of individuals' total social contacts and evaluated the potential impact of work-from-home and distance learning on the transmissibility of respiratory pathogens. In-person attendance at work or school emerged as a primary driver of social contacts. Adults attending in person reported a mean of 1.69 (95% CI: 1.56-1.84) times the contacts of those staying home; among children and adolescents, this ratio increased to 2.38 (95% CI: 1.98-2.87). We estimated that suspending all non-essential work alone would marginally reduce transmissibility. However, combining distance learning for all education levels with work-from-home policies could decrease transmissibility by up to 23.7% (95% CI: 18.2%-29.0%). Extending these measures to early childcare services would yield only minimal additional benefits. These results provide useful data for modelling the transmission of respiratory pathogens in Italy after the end of the COVID-19 emergency. They also provide insights into the potential epidemiological effectiveness of social distancing interventions targeting work and school attendance, supporting considerations on the balance between the expected benefits and their heavy societal costs.</description>

      <title>Public emotions on Internet: In case of AIGC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03779v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The proliferation of interactive AI like ChatGPT has fueled intense public discourse surrounding AI- generated content (AIGC). While some fear job displacement, others anticipate productivity gains. Social media provides a rich source of data reflecting public opinion, attitudes, and behaviors. By examining the factors influencing collective sentiment toward AIGC on various platforms, we can refine products, marketing, and AI models themselves. Our research utilized a novel system for real-time tracking and detailed visualization of public mood related to AIGC. This system enabled analysis of the dynamics shaping opinions on nine AIGC products across China's three leading social media sites. Our findings reveal a negative correlation between user demographics (age and education) and positive sentiment towards AIGC on Douyin, contrasting with Weibo's susceptibility to the rapid spread of extreme viewpoints. This work uniquely connects group dynamics theory with social media sentiment, offering valuable guidance for managing online opinion and tailoring targeted campaigns.</description>

      <title>Can Large Language Models Improve the Adversarial Robustness of Graph Neural Networks?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08685v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, especially for topology perturbations, and many methods that improve the robustness of GNNs have received considerable attention. Recently, we have witnessed the significant success of large language models (LLMs), leading many to explore the great potential of LLMs on GNNs. However, they mainly focus on improving the performance of GNNs by utilizing LLMs to enhance the node features. Therefore, we ask: Will the robustness of GNNs also be enhanced with the powerful understanding and inference capabilities of LLMs? By presenting the empirical results, we find that despite that LLMs can improve the robustness of GNNs, there is still an average decrease of 23.1% in accuracy, implying that the GNNs remain extremely vulnerable against topology attacks. Therefore, another question is how to extend the capabilities of LLMs on graph adversarial robustness. In this paper, we propose an LLM-based robust graph structure inference framework, LLM4RGNN, which distills the inference capabilities of GPT-4 into a local LLM for identifying malicious edges and an LM-based edge predictor for finding missing important edges, so as to recover a robust graph structure. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LLM4RGNN consistently improves the robustness across various GNNs. Even in some cases where the perturbation ratio increases to 40%, the accuracy of GNNs is still better than that on the clean graph.
