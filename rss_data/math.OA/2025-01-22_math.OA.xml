      <title>Boundary representations from constrained interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study $C^*$-envelopes of finite-dimensional operator algebras arising from constrained interpolation problems on the unit disc. In particular, we consider interpolation problems for the algebra $H^\infty_{\text{node}}$ that consists of bounded analytic functions on the unit disk that satisfy $ f(0) = f(\lambda)$ for some $0 \neq \lambda \in \mathbb{D}$. We show that there exist choices of four interpolation nodes that exclude both $0$ and $\lambda$, such that if $I$ is the ideal of functions that vanish at the interpolation nodes, then $C^*_e(H^\infty_{\text{node}}/I)$ is infinite-dimensional. This differs markedly from the behavior of the algebra corresponding to interpolation nodes that contain the constrained points studied in the literature. Additionally, we use the distance formula to provide a completely isometric embedding of $C^*_e(H^\infty_{\text{node}}/I)$ for any choice of $n$ interpolation nodes that do not contain the constrained points into $M_n(G^2_{nc})$, where $G^2_{nc}$ is Brown's noncommutative Grassmannian.</description>

      <title>Simplicity of $C^*$-algebras of contracting self-similar groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the $C^*$-algebra associated by Nekrashevych to a contracting self-similar group is simple if and only if the corresponding complex $\ast$-algebra is simple. We also improve on Steinberg and Szaka\'c's algorithm to determine if the $\ast$-algebra is simple. This provides an interesting class of non-Hausdorff amenable, effective and minimal ample groupoids for which simplicity of the $C^*$-algebra and the complex $\ast$-algebra are equivalent.</description>

      <title>Sesquilinear forms as eigenvectors in quasi *-algebras, with an application to ladder elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a particular class of sesquilinear forms on a {Banach quasi *-algebra} $(\A[\|.\|],\Ao[\|.\|_0])$ which we call {\em eigenstates of an element} $a\in\A$, and we deduce some of their properties. We further apply our definition to a family of ladder elements, i.e. elements of $\A$ obeying certain commutation relations physically motivated, and we discuss several results, including orthogonality and biorthogonality of the forms, via GNS-representation.</description>

      <title>Matrix Ordering through Spectral and Nilpotent Structures in Totally Ordered Complex Number Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Matrix inequalities play a pivotal role in mathematics, generalizing scalar inequalities and providing insights into linear operator structures. However, the widely used L\"owner ordering, which relies on real-valued eigenvalues, is limited to Hermitian matrices, restricting its applicability to non-Hermitian systems increasingly relevant in fields like non-Hermitian physics. To overcome this, we develop a total ordering relation for complex numbers, enabling comparisons of the spectral components of general matrices with complex eigenvalues. Building on this, we introduce the Spectral and Nilpotent Ordering (SNO), a partial order for arbitrary matrices of the same dimensions. We further establish a theoretical framework for majorization ordering with complex-valued functions, which aids in refining SNO and analyzing spectral components. An additional result is the extension of the Schur--Ostrowski criterion to the complex domain. Moreover, we characterize Jordan blocks of matrix functions using a generalized dominance order for nilpotent components, facilitating systematic analysis of non-diagonalizable matrices. Finally, we derive monotonicity and convexity conditions for functions under the SNO framework, laying a new mathematical foundation for advancing matrix analysis.</description>

      <title>A Noncommutative Nullstellensatz for Perfect Two-Answer Quantum Nonlocal Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a noncommutative version of the Nullstellensatz, motivated by the study of quantum nonlocal games. It has been proved that a two-answer nonlocal game with a perfect quantum strategy also admits a perfect classical strategy. We generalize this result to the infinite-dimensional case, showing that a two-answer game with a perfect commuting operator strategy also admits a perfect classical strategy. This result induces a special case of noncommutative Nullstellensatz.</description>

      <title>The quantum metric structure of quantum SU(2)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.06043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.06043v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a two parameter family of Dirac operators on quantum SU(2) and analyse their properties from the point of view of non-commutative metric geometry. It is shown that these Dirac operators give rise to compact quantum metric structures, and that the corresponding two parameter family of compact quantum metric spaces varies continuously in Rieffel's quantum Gromov-Hausdorff distance. This continuity result includes the classical case where we recover the round 3-sphere up to a global scaling factor on the metric. Our main technical tool is a quantum SU(2) analogue of the Berezin transform, together with its associated fuzzy approximations, the analysis of which also leads to a systematic way of approximating Lipschitz operators by means of polynomial expressions in the generators.</description>

      <title>(Quantum) discreteness, spectrum compactness and uniform continuity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.15139v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a number of results linking properties of actions by compact groups (both quantum and classical) on Banach spaces, such as uniform continuity, spectrum finiteness and extensibility of the actions across several constructions. Examples include: (a) a unitary representation of a compact quantum group induces a continuous action on the $C^*$-algebra of bounded operators if and only if it has finitely many isotypic components, and hence is uniformly continuous; (b) a compact quantum group is finite if and only if its continuous actions on $C^*$-algebras lift to continuous actions on either the multiplier algebras or von Neumann envelopes thereof; (c) a (classical) locally compact group $\mathbb{G}$ is discrete if and only if the forgetful functor from $\mathbb{G}$-acted-upon compact $T_2$ spaces back to compact $T_2$ spaces creates coproducts; (d) a representation of a linearly reductive quantum group has finitely many isotypic components if and only if its restrictions to two topologically-generating quantum subgroups, one of which is normal, do; (e) equivalent characterizations of uniform continuity for actions of compact groups on Banach spaces, e.g. that such an action is uniformly continuous if and only if its restrictions to a pro-torus and to pro-$p$ subgroups are.</description>

Abstract: We consider the $C^*$-algebra generated by finitely many annihilation operators acting on the weakly monotone Fock space, and we call it weakly monotone $C^*$-algebra. We give an abstract representation for this algebra, showing that it is isomorphic to a suitable quotient of a Cuntz-Krieger $C^*$-algebra $\mathcal{O}_A$ corresponding to a suitable matrix $A$. Furthermore, we show that the diagonal subalgebra of the weakly monotone $C^*$-algebra is a MASA and we give the detailed description of its Gelfand spectrum.</description>

      <title>Characterizations of homomorphisms among unital completely positive maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07229v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that a unital completely positive map between finite-dimensional C*-algebras is a homomorphism if and only if it is completely entropy-nonincreasing, where the relevant notion of entropy is a variant of von Neumann entropy. This adjusted von Neumann entropy is the negative of the relative entropy with respect to the uniform state on the C*-algebra, up to an additive constant. As an intermediate step, we prove that a unital completely positive map between finite-dimensional C*-algebras is a homomorphism if and only if its adjusted Choi operator is a projection. Both equivalences generalize familiar facts about stochastic maps between finite sets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00206v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a class of left cancellative categories we call ordinal graphs for which there is a functor $d:\Lambda\rightarrow\mathrm{Ord}$ by which morphisms of $\Lambda$ factor. We use generators and relations to study the Cuntz-Krieger algebra $\mathcal{O}\left(\Lambda\right)$ defined by Spielberg. In particular, we construct a $\mathrm{C}^{*}$-correspondence $X_{\alpha}$ for each $\alpha\in\mathrm{Ord}$ in order to apply Ery\"uzl\"u and Tomforde's condition (S) and prove a Cuntz-Krieger uniqueness theorem for ordinal graphs.</description>

      <title>The maximal coarse Baum-Connes conjecture for spaces that admit an A-by-FCE coarse fibration structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06660v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a concept of A-by-FCE coarse fibration structure for metric spaces, which serves as a generalization of the A-by-CE structure for a sequence of group extensions proposed by Deng, Wang, and Yu. We prove that the maximal coarse Baum-Connes conjecture holds for metric spaces with bounded geometry that admit an A-by-FCE coarse fibration structure. As an application, the relative expanders constructed by Arzhantseva and Tessera, as well as the box spaces derived from an ``amenable-by-Haagerup'' group extension, admit the A-by-FCE coarse fibration structure. Consequently, the maximal coarse Baum-Connes conjecture holds for these spaces, which may not admit an FCE structure, i.e. fibred coarse embedding into Hilbert space.</description>
