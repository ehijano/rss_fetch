      <title>Solving Wave Equations in the Space of Schwartz Distributions: The Beauty of Generalised functions in Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper concerns the study and resolution of wave equations in the space of Schwartz distributions. Wave phenomena are widespread in many branches of physics and chemistry, such as optics, gravitation, quantum mechanics, chemical waves and often arise from instantaneous sources represented by Schwartz distributions f. Hence, there is a need to study the Cauchy problem in the space of generalised functions. Specifically, it has been proven that the instantaneous source f can always be represented as an appropriate sum of single point like sources. Under this hypothesis, each wave equation with an instantaneous source f remains associated with an equation with a point-like source represented by a Dirac delta function. The solution to the associated equation is an elementary perturbation that propagates in spacetime, defined as the fundamental solution. We proved that the solution to a wave equation with source f is given by the convolution product between one of the fundamental solutions and the generalised function f representing the instantaneous source. We investigated the physical and mathematical properties of three dimensional, two dimensional, and one dimensional fundamental solutions. Notably, we proved that the three-dimensional solution described diffraction phenomena, whereas the other two described wave diffusion phenomena. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the transition from a diffractive to a diffusive regime occurs through the continuation of an ansatz generalised function. In this paper, we discuss possible applications to solid state physics and the resolution of crystallographic structures.</description>

      <title>The heat engine of magnetic black holes in AdS space with rational nonlinear electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The heat engine of magnetic black holes in Einstein-AdS gravity coupled to rational nonlinear electrodynamics, as the working substance, is studied. The dynamical negative cosmological constant is considered as a thermodynamic pressure. We investigate the efficiency of black hole heat engines in extended space thermodynamics for rectangle closed path in the $P - V$ plane and the maximally efficient Carnot cycles. The exact efficiency formula which is written in terms of the mass of the black hole is obtained. It was demonstrated that the black hole efficiency decreases when the nonlinear electrodynamics coupling increases and the black hole efficiency increases if the magnetic charge increases. The relation between the efficiency, event horizon radiuses (entropy) and pressure is obtained. We study an efficiency of the holographic heat engine of a cycle in the vicinity of a critical point. Thus, the heat engine of our model can produce work.</description>

      <title>The Modification of Feynman Diagrams in Curved Space-Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the behavior of quantum particles in weak gravitational fields. We examine scalar and spinor particles, showing that these quantum particles in weak gravitational fields follow geodesic trajectories, aligning with classical expectations. Further, we explore the impact of gravitational fields on Yukawa interaction $\lambda \bar{\Psi} \Phi \Psi$, revealing that Feynman diagrams are modified due to the curvature, affecting propagators and interaction dynamics. The presence of spatially-dependent factors in propagators underscores the localized nature of gravitational effects on particle interactions.</description>

      <title>Gravitization Equation and Zero Energy Momentum Tensor with Cancellation Law in Gravitational Quantum Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze essential properties about gravitational quantum field theory (GQFT) grounded on spin gauge symmetry by taking the general theory of quantum electrodynamics as example. A constraint equation for the field strength of gravigaiuge field is obtained to be as gravitization equation in spin-related gravigauge spacetime, which indicates how the gravitational effect emerges from non-commutative relation of gravigauge derivative operator. By representing the action in Minkowski spacetime, we show that translational invariance leads to zero energy momentum tensor in GQFT when applying for equations of motion for all basic fields including gravigauge field, which extends conservation law of energy momentum tensor in quantum field theory to cancellation law of energy momentum tensor in GQFT. An equivalence between general gravitational equation and zero energy momentum tensor is naturally resulted in GQFT.</description>

      <title>Exact solution of the Heat Equation for initial polynomials or splines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exact evolution in time and space of a distribution of the temperature (or density of diffusing matter) in an isotropic homogeneous medium is determined where the initial distribution is described by a piecewise polynomial. In two dimensions, the boundaries of each polynomial must lie on a grid of lines parallel to the axes, while in three dimensions the boundaries must lie on planes perpendicular to the axes. The distribution at any position and later time is expressed as a finite linear combination of Gaussians and Error Functions. The underlying theory is developed in detail for one, two, and three dimensional space, and illustrative examples are examined.</description>

      <title>Massless Neutrino Oscillations via Quantum Tunneling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.00691</link>
      <description>arXiv:1502.00691v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the current theory, neutrino oscillations require that the masses of neutrinos are non-vanishing. By analogy with the oscillation of quantum two-state system, we assume that neutrino oscillations may be regarded as quantum tunneling process. The difference of the quantum numbers of two particles may be regarded as a barrier between them. Thus neutrinos with vanishing mass can also oscillate. The hypothesis can also be applied to quark mixing, flavor violation of charged leptons, CP violation of neutral kaons and electroweak mixing.</description>

      <title>Testing stimulated emission photon directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15399v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While naively laser only causes excitation of external target, e.g. Rabi cycle, STED microscopy or backward ASE in optical amplifiers demonstrate it can also cause its deexitation, however, under uncommon condition of being prepared as excited. These two causalities are governed by absorption-stimulated emission pair of equations, and swap places in perspective of CPT symmetry, however, it means photon direction of stimulated emission should be opposite to usually assumed. This article discusses various arguments and proposes simple direct tests to experimentally verify existence of such backward photon trajectories, complementing consequent forward textbook trajectories. There are already indirect experimental arguments, like backward ASE, lack of Rabi cycle for free electron laser, or recent "negative time evidence" experiment in the news. Depending on the result: it should lead to new applications like 2WQC more symmetric quantum computers, or macroscopic violation of CPT symmetry, so far probably tested only in microscopic settings. Also proposed forward/backward/bidirectional photon sources are discussed.</description>
