      <title>Untethered thin dielectric elastomer actuated soft robot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thin dielectric elastomer actuator (DEA) features a unique in-plane configuration, enabling low-profile designs capable of accessing millimetre-scale narrow spaces. However, most existing DEA-powered soft robots require high voltages and wired power connections, limiting their ability to operate in confined environments. This study presents an untethered thin soft robot (UTS-Robot) powered by thin dielectric elastomer actuators (TS-DEA). The robot measures 38 mm in length, 6 mm in height, and weighs just 2.34 grams, integrating flexible onboard electronics to achieve fully untethered actuation. The TS-DEA, operating at resonant frequencies of 86 Hz under a low driving voltage of 220 V, adopts a dual-actuation sandwiched structure, comprising four dielectric elastomer layers bonded to a compressible tensioning mechanism at its core. This design enables high power density actuation and locomotion via three directional friction pads. The low-voltage actuation is achieved by fabricating each elastomer layer via spin coating to an initial thickness of 50 um, followed by biaxial stretching to 8 um. A comprehensive design and modelling framework has been developed to optimise TS-DEA performance. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the bare TS-DEA achieves a locomotion speed of 12.36 mm/s at resonance, the untethered configuration achieves a locomotion speed of 0.5 mm/s, making it highly suitable for navigating confined and complex environments.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Human-Robot Interaction Intent Detection Using RGB-based Pose and Emotion Cues with Cross-Camera Model Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Service robots in public spaces require real-time understanding of human behavioral intentions for natural interaction. We present a practical multimodal framework for frame-accurate human-robot interaction intent detection that fuses camera-invariant 2D skeletal pose and facial emotion features extracted from monocular RGB video. Unlike prior methods requiring RGB-D sensors or GPU acceleration, our approach resource-constrained embedded hardware (Raspberry Pi 5, CPU-only). To address the severe class imbalance in natural human-robot interaction datasets, we introduce a novel approach to synthesize temporally coherent pose-emotion-label sequences for data re-balancing called MINT-RVAE (Multimodal Recurrent Variational Autoencoder for Intent Sequence Generation). Comprehensive offline evaluations under cross-subject and cross-scene protocols demonstrate strong generalization performance, achieving frame- and sequence-level AUROC of 0.95. Crucially, we validate real-world generalization through cross-camera evaluation on the MIRA robot head, which employs a different onboard RGB sensor and operates in uncontrolled environments not represented in the training data. Despite this domain shift, the deployed system achieves 91% accuracy and 100% recall across 32 live interaction trials. The close correspondence between offline and deployed performance confirms the cross-sensor and cross-environment robustness of the proposed multimodal approach, highlighting its suitability for ubiquitous multimedia-enabled social robots.</description>

      <title>Unifying Deep Predicate Invention with Pre-trained Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-horizon robotic tasks are hard due to continuous state-action spaces and sparse feedback. Symbolic world models help by decomposing tasks into discrete predicates that capture object properties and relations. Existing methods learn predicates either top-down, by prompting foundation models without data grounding, or bottom-up, from demonstrations without high-level priors. We introduce UniPred, a bilevel learning framework that unifies both. UniPred uses large language models (LLMs) to propose predicate effect distributions that supervise neural predicate learning from low-level data, while learned feedback iteratively refines the LLM hypotheses. Leveraging strong visual foundation model features, UniPred learns robust predicate classifiers in cluttered scenes. We further propose a predicate evaluation method that supports symbolic models beyond STRIPS assumptions. Across five simulated and one real-robot domains, UniPred achieves 2-4 times higher success rates than top-down methods and 3-4 times faster learning than bottom-up approaches, advancing scalable and flexible symbolic world modeling for robotics.</description>

      <title>Robotic VLA Benefits from Joint Learning with Motion Image Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have achieved remarkable progress in robotic manipulation by mapping multimodal observations and instructions directly to actions. However, they typically mimic expert trajectories without predictive motion reasoning, which limits their ability to reason about what actions to take. To address this limitation, we propose joint learning with motion image diffusion, a novel strategy that enhances VLA models with motion reasoning capabilities. Our method extends the VLA architecture with a dual-head design: while the action head predicts action chunks as in vanilla VLAs, an additional motion head, implemented as a Diffusion Transformer (DiT), predicts optical-flow-based motion images that capture future dynamics. The two heads are trained jointly, enabling the shared VLM backbone to learn representations that couple robot control with motion knowledge. This joint learning builds temporally coherent and physically grounded representations without modifying the inference pathway of standard VLAs, thereby maintaining test-time latency. Experiments in both simulation and real-world environments demonstrate that joint learning with motion image diffusion improves the success rate of pi-series VLAs to 97.5% on the LIBERO benchmark and 58.0% on the RoboTwin benchmark, yielding a 23% improvement in real-world performance and validating its effectiveness in enhancing the motion reasoning capability of large-scale VLAs.</description>

      <title>Embodied4C: Measuring What Matters for Embodied Vision-Language Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-language navigation requires agents to reason and act under constraints of embodiment. While vision-language models (VLMs) demonstrate strong generalization, current benchmarks provide limited understanding of how embodiment -- i.e., the choice of physical platform, sensor configuration, and modality alignment -- influences perception, reasoning, and control. We introduce Embodied4C, a closed-loop benchmark designed as a Turing test for embodied reasoning. The benchmark evaluates the core embodied capabilities of VLMs across three heterogeneous embodiments -- autonomous vehicles, aerial drones, and robotic manipulators -- through approximately 1.1K one-shot reasoning questions and 58 goal-directed navigation tasks. These tasks jointly assess four foundational dimensions: semantic, spatial, temporal, and physical reasoning. Each embodiment presents dynamic sensor configurations and environment variations to probe generalization beyond platform-specific adaptation. To prevent embodiment overfitting, Embodied4C integrates domain-far queries targeting abstract and cross-context reasoning. Comprehensive evaluation across ten state-of-the-art VLMs and four embodied control baselines shows that cross-modal alignment and instruction tuning matter more than scale, while spatial and temporal reasoning remains the primary bottleneck for reliable embodied competence.</description>

      <title>Design and Integration of Thermal and Vibrotactile Feedback for Lifelike Touch in Social Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zoomorphic Socially Assistive Robots (SARs) offer an alternative source of social touch for individuals who cannot access animal companionship. However, current SARs provide only limited, passive touch-based interactions and lack the rich haptic cues, such as warmth, heartbeat or purring, that are characteristic of human-animal touch. This limits their ability to evoke emotionally engaging, life-like physical interactions.
  We present a multimodal tactile prototype, which was used to augment the established PARO robot, integrating thermal and vibrotactile feedback to simulate feeling biophysiological signals. A flexible heating interface delivers body-like warmth, while embedded actuators generate heartbeat-like rhythms and continuous purring sensations. These cues were iteratively designed and calibrated with input from users and haptics experts. We outline the design process and offer reproducible guidelines to support the development of emotionally resonant and biologically plausible touch interactions with SARs.</description>

      <title>Design of a Polymer-based Steerable Cannula for Neurosurgical Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robotically steerable compliant surgical tools offer several advantages over rigid tools, including enhanced dexterity, reduced tissue damage, and the ability to generate non-linear trajectories in minimally invasive neurosurgical procedures. Many existing robotic neurosurgical tools are designed using stainless steel or nitinol materials. Using polymer-based materials instead can offer advantages such as reduced interference in magnetic resonance imaging, enhanced safety for guiding electrically powered instruments, and reduced tissue damage due to inherent compliance. Several polymer materials have been used in robotic surgical applications, such as polyimide, polycarbonate, and elastic resin. Various fabrication strategies have also been proposed, including standard microfabrication techniques, thermal drawing, and 3-D printing. In our previous work, a tendon-driven, notched-tube was designed for several neurosurgical robotic tools, utilizing laser micromachining to reduce the stiffness of the tube in certain directions. This fabrication method is desirable because it has a single-step process, has high precision, and does not require a cleanroom or harsh chemicals. Past studies have explored laser-micromachining of polymer material for surgical applications such as stent fabrication. In this work, we explore extending the use of the laser micromachining approach to the fabrication of polyimide (PI) robotically steerable cannulas for neurosurgical applications. Utilizing the method presented in this work, we fabricated joints as small as 1.5 mm outer diameter (OD). Multiple joints were fabricated using PI tubes of different ODs, and the loading behavior of the fabricated joints was experimentally characterized.</description>

      <title>SurgiPose: Estimating Surgical Tool Kinematics from Monocular Video for Surgical Robot Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imitation learning (IL) has shown immense promise in enabling autonomous dexterous manipulation, including learning surgical tasks. To fully unlock the potential of IL for surgery, access to clinical datasets is needed, which unfortunately lack the kinematic data required for current IL approaches. A promising source of large-scale surgical demonstrations is monocular surgical videos available online, making monocular pose estimation a crucial step toward enabling large-scale robot learning. Toward this end, we propose SurgiPose, a differentiable rendering based approach to estimate kinematic information from monocular surgical videos, eliminating the need for direct access to ground truth kinematics. Our method infers tool trajectories and joint angles by optimizing tool pose parameters to minimize the discrepancy between rendered and real images. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct experiments on two robotic surgical tasks: tissue lifting and needle pickup, using the da Vinci Research Kit Si (dVRK Si). We train imitation learning policies with both ground truth measured kinematics and estimated kinematics from video and compare their performance. Our results show that policies trained on estimated kinematics achieve comparable success rates to those trained on ground truth data, demonstrating the feasibility of using monocular video based kinematic estimation for surgical robot learning. By enabling kinematic estimation from monocular surgical videos, our work lays the foundation for large scale learning of autonomous surgical policies from online surgical data.</description>

      <title>Towards Autonomous Navigation in Endovascular Interventions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases remain the leading cause of global mortality, with minimally invasive treatment options offered through endovascular interventions. However, the precision and adaptability of current robotic systems for endovascular navigation are limited by heuristic control, low autonomy, and the absence of haptic feedback. This thesis presents an integrated AI-driven framework for autonomous guidewire navigation in complex vascular environments, addressing key challenges in data availability, simulation fidelity, and navigational accuracy.
  A high-fidelity, real-time simulation platform, CathSim, is introduced for reinforcement learning based catheter navigation, featuring anatomically accurate vascular models and contact dynamics. Building on CathSim, the Expert Navigation Network is developed, a policy that fuses visual, kinematic, and force feedback for autonomous tool control. To mitigate data scarcity, the open-source, bi-planar fluoroscopic dataset Guide3D is proposed, comprising more than 8,700 annotated images for 3D guidewire reconstruction. Finally, SplineFormer, a transformer-based model, is introduced to directly predict guidewire geometry as continuous B-spline parameters, enabling interpretable, real-time navigation.
  The findings show that combining high-fidelity simulation, multimodal sensory fusion, and geometric modelling substantially improves autonomous endovascular navigation and supports safer, more precise minimally invasive procedures.</description>

      <title>On Swarm Leader Identification using Probing Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying the leader within a robotic swarm is crucial, especially in adversarial contexts where leader concealment is necessary for mission success. This work introduces the interactive Swarm Leader Identification (iSLI) problem, a novel approach where an adversarial probing agent identifies a swarm's leader by physically interacting with its members. We formulate the iSLI problem as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) and employ Deep Reinforcement Learning, specifically Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), to train the prober's policy. The proposed approach utilizes a novel neural network architecture featuring a Timed Graph Relationformer (TGR) layer combined with a Simplified Structured State Space Sequence (S5) model. The TGR layer effectively processes graph-based observations of the swarm, capturing temporal dependencies and fusing relational information using a learned gating mechanism to generate informative representations for policy learning. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our TGR-based model outperforms baseline graph neural network architectures and exhibits significant zero-shot generalization capabilities across varying swarm sizes and speeds different from those used during training. The trained prober achieves high accuracy in identifying the leader, maintaining performance even in out-of-training distribution scenarios, and showing appropriate confidence levels in its predictions. Real-world experiments with physical robots further validate the approach, confirming successful sim-to-real transfer and robustness to dynamic changes, such as unexpected agent disconnections.</description>

      <title>Alternating Minimization for Time-Shifted Synergy Extraction in Human Hand Coordination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying motor synergies -- coordinated hand joint patterns activated at task-dependent time shifts -- from kinematic data is central to motor control and robotics. Existing two-stage methods first extract candidate waveforms (via SVD) and then select shifted templates using sparse optimization, requiring at least two datasets and complicating data collection. We introduce an optimization-based framework that jointly learns a small set of synergies and their sparse activation coefficients. The formulation enforces group sparsity for synergy selection and element-wise sparsity for activation timing. We develop an alternating minimization method in which coefficient updates decouple across tasks and synergy updates reduce to regularized least-squares problems. Our approach requires only a single data set, and simulations show accurate velocity reconstruction with compact, interpretable synergies.</description>

      <title>LLaViDA: A Large Language Vision Driving Assistant for Explicit Reasoning and Enhanced Trajectory Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trajectory planning is a fundamental yet challenging component of autonomous driving. End-to-end planners frequently falter under adverse weather, unpredictable human behavior, or complex road layouts, primarily because they lack strong generalization or few-shot capabilities beyond their training data. We propose LLaViDA, a Large Language Vision Driving Assistant that leverages a Vision-Language Model (VLM) for object motion prediction, semantic grounding, and chain-of-thought reasoning for trajectory planning in autonomous driving. A two-stage training pipeline--supervised fine-tuning followed by Trajectory Preference Optimization (TPO)--enhances scene understanding and trajectory planning by injecting regression-based supervision, produces a powerful "VLM Trajectory Planner for Autonomous Driving." On the NuScenes benchmark, LLaViDA surpasses state-of-the-art end-to-end and other recent VLM/LLM-based baselines in open-loop trajectory planning task, achieving an average L2 trajectory error of 0.31 m and a collision rate of 0.10% on the NuScenes test set.

      <title>Fractional-order Modeling for Nonlinear Soft Actuators via Particle Swarm Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling soft pneumatic actuators with high precision remains a fundamental challenge due to their highly nonlinear and compliant characteristics. This paper proposes an innovative modeling framework based on fractional-order differential equations (FODEs) to accurately capture the dynamic behavior of soft materials. The unknown parameters within the fractional-order model are identified using particle swarm optimization (PSO), enabling parameter estimation directly from experimental data without reliance on pre-established material databases or empirical constitutive laws. The proposed approach effectively represents the complex deformation phenomena inherent in soft actuators. Experimental results validate the accuracy and robustness of the developed model, demonstrating improvement in predictive performance compared to conventional modeling techniques. The presented framework provides a data-efficient and database-independent solution for soft actuator modeling, advancing the precision and adaptability of soft robotic system design.</description>

      <title>On The Computational Complexity for Minimizing Aerial Photographs for Full Coverage of a Planar Region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the popularity of drone technologies, aerial photography have become prevalent in many daily scenarios such as environment monitoring, structure inspection, law enforcement etc. A central challenge in this domain is the efficient coverage of a target area with photographs that can entirely capture the region, while respecting constraints such as the image resolution, and limited number of pictures that can be taken. This work investigates the computational complexity of several fundamental problems arised from this challenge. By abstracting the aerial photography problem into the coverage problems in computational geometry, we demonstrate that most of these problems are in fact computationally intractable, with the implication that traditional algorithms cannot solve them efficiently. The intuitions of this work can extend beyond aerial photography to broader applications such as pesticide spraying, and strategic sensor placement.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning Position Control of a Quadrotor Using Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a new Reinforcement Learning (RL) based control architecture for quadrotors. With the literature focusing on controlling the four rotors' RPMs directly, this paper aims to control the quadrotor's thrust vector. The RL agent computes the percentage of overall thrust along the quadrotor's z-axis along with the desired Roll ($\phi$) and Pitch ($\theta$) angles. The agent then sends the calculated control signals along with the current quadrotor's Yaw angle ($\psi$) to an attitude PID controller. The PID controller then maps the control signals to motor RPMs. The Soft Actor-Critic algorithm, a model-free off-policy stochastic RL algorithm, was used to train the RL agents. Training results show the faster training time of the proposed thrust vector controller in comparison to the conventional RPM controllers. Simulation results show smoother and more accurate path-following for the proposed thrust vector controller.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Entropy Tuning in Reinforcement Learning Low-Level Quadcopter Control: Stochasticity vs Determinism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the impact of dynamic entropy tuning in Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms that train a stochastic policy. Its performance is compared against algorithms that train a deterministic one. Stochastic policies optimize a probability distribution over actions to maximize rewards, while deterministic policies select a single deterministic action per state. The effect of training a stochastic policy with both static entropy and dynamic entropy and then executing deterministic actions to control the quadcopter is explored. It is then compared against training a deterministic policy and executing deterministic actions. For the purpose of this research, the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm was chosen for the stochastic algorithm while the Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) was chosen for the deterministic algorithm. The training and simulation results show the positive effect the dynamic entropy tuning has on controlling the quadcopter by preventing catastrophic forgetting and improving exploration efficiency.</description>

      <title>Learning Semantic Atomic Skills for Multi-Task Robotic Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While imitation learning has shown impressive results in single-task robot manipulation, scaling it to multi-task settings remains a fundamental challenge due to issues such as suboptimal demonstrations, trajectory noise, and behavioral multi-modality. Existing skill-based methods attempt to address this by decomposing actions into reusable abstractions, but they often rely on fixed-length segmentation or environmental priors that limit semantic consistency and cross-task generalization. In this work, we propose AtomSkill, a novel multi-task imitation learning framework that learns and leverages a structured Atomic Skill Space for composable robot manipulation. Our approach is built on two key technical contributions. First, we construct a Semantically Grounded Atomic Skill Library by partitioning demonstrations into variable-length skills using gripper-state keyframe detection and vision-language model annotation. A contrastive learning objective ensures the resulting skill embeddings are both semantically consistent and temporally coherent. Second, we propose an Action Generation module with Keypose Imagination, which jointly predicts a skill's long-horizon terminal keypose and its immediate action sequence. This enables the policy to reason about overarching motion goals and fine-grained control simultaneously, facilitating robust skill chaining. Extensive experiments in simulated and real-world environments show that AtomSkill consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across diverse manipulation tasks.</description>

      <title>AOMGen: Photoreal, Physics-Consistent Demonstration Generation for Articulated Object Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) and world-model methods have improved generalization in tasks such as robotic manipulation and object interaction. However, Successful execution of such tasks depends on large, costly collections of real demonstrations, especially for fine-grained manipulation of articulated objects. To address this, we present AOMGen, a scalable data generation framework for articulated manipulation which is instantiated from a single real scan, demonstration and a library of readily available digital assets, yielding photoreal training data with verified physical states. The framework synthesizes synchronized multi-view RGB temporally aligned with action commands and state annotations for joints and contacts, and systematically varies camera viewpoints, object styles, and object poses to expand a single execution into a diverse corpus. Experimental results demonstrate that fine-tuning VLA policies on AOMGen data increases the success rate from 0% to 88.7%, and the policies are tested on unseen objects and layouts.</description>

      <title>When Robots Say No: The Empathic Ethical Disobedience Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robots must balance compliance with safety and social expectations as blind obedience can cause harm, while over-refusal erodes trust. Existing safe reinforcement learning (RL) benchmarks emphasize physical hazards, while human-robot interaction trust studies are small-scale and hard to reproduce. We present the Empathic Ethical Disobedience (EED) Gym, a standardized testbed that jointly evaluates refusal safety and social acceptability. Agents weigh risk, affect, and trust when choosing to comply, refuse (with or without explanation), clarify, or propose safer alternatives. EED Gym provides different scenarios, multiple persona profiles, and metrics for safety, calibration, and refusals, with trust and blame models grounded in a vignette study. Using EED Gym, we find that action masking eliminates unsafe compliance, while explanatory refusals help sustain trust. Constructive styles are rated most trustworthy, empathic styles -- most empathic, and safe RL methods improve robustness but also make agents more prone to overly cautious behavior. We release code, configurations, and reference policies to enable reproducible evaluation and systematic human-robot interaction research on refusal and trust. At submission time, we include an anonymized reproducibility package with code and configs, and we commit to open-sourcing the full repository after the paper is accepted.</description>

      <title>STORM: Search-Guided Generative World Models for Robotic Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present STORM (Search-Guided Generative World Models), a novel framework for spatio-temporal reasoning in robotic manipulation that unifies diffusion-based action generation, conditional video prediction, and search-based planning. Unlike prior Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models that rely on abstract latent dynamics or delegate reasoning to language components, STORM grounds planning in explicit visual rollouts, enabling interpretable and foresight-driven decision-making. A diffusion-based VLA policy proposes diverse candidate actions, a generative video world model simulates their visual and reward outcomes, and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) selectively refines plans through lookahead evaluation. Experiments on the SimplerEnv manipulation benchmark demonstrate that STORM achieves a new state-of-the-art average success rate of 51.0 percent, outperforming strong baselines such as CogACT. Reward-augmented video prediction substantially improves spatio-temporal fidelity and task relevance, reducing Frechet Video Distance by over 75 percent. Moreover, STORM exhibits robust re-planning and failure recovery behavior, highlighting the advantages of search-guided generative world models for long-horizon robotic manipulation.</description>

      <title>Systematic Benchmarking of SUMO Against Data-Driven Traffic Simulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a systematic benchmarking of the model-based microscopic traffic simulator SUMO against state-of-the-art data-driven traffic simulators using large-scale real-world datasets. Using the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) and the Waymo Open Sim Agents Challenge (WOSAC), we evaluate SUMO under both short-horizon (8s) and long-horizon (60s) closed-loop simulation settings. To enable scalable evaluation, we develop Waymo2SUMO, an automated pipeline that converts WOMD scenarios into SUMO simulations. On the WOSAC benchmark, SUMO achieves a realism meta metric of 0.653 while requiring fewer than 100 tunable parameters. Extended rollouts show that SUMO maintains low collision and offroad rates and exhibits stronger long-horizon stability than representative data-driven simulators. These results highlight complementary strengths of model-based and data-driven approaches for autonomous driving simulation and benchmarking.</description>

      <title>Offline Reinforcement Learning for End-to-End Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: End-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving models that take only camera images as input and directly predict a future trajectory are appealing for their computational efficiency and potential for improved generalization via unified optimization; however, persistent failure modes remain due to reliance on imitation learning (IL). While online reinforcement learning (RL) could mitigate IL-induced issues, the computational burden of neural rendering-based simulation and large E2E networks renders iterative reward and hyperparameter tuning costly. We introduce a camera-only E2E offline RL framework that performs no additional exploration and trains solely on a fixed simulator dataset. Offline RL offers strong data efficiency and rapid experimental iteration, yet is susceptible to instability from overestimation on out-of-distribution (OOD) actions. To address this, we construct pseudo ground-truth trajectories from expert driving logs and use them as a behavior regularization signal, suppressing imitation of unsafe or suboptimal behavior while stabilizing value learning. Training and closed-loop evaluation are conducted in a neural rendering environment learned from the public nuScenes dataset. Empirically, the proposed method achieves substantial improvements in collision rate and route completion compared with IL baselines. Our code will be available at [URL].</description>

      <title>CauTraj: A Causal-Knowledge-Guided Framework for Lane-Changing Trajectory Planning of Autonomous Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enhancing the performance of trajectory planners for lane - changing vehicles is one of the key challenges in autonomous driving within human - machine mixed traffic. Most existing studies have not incorporated human drivers' prior knowledge when designing trajectory planning models. To address this issue, this study proposes a novel trajectory planning framework that integrates causal prior knowledge into the control process. Both longitudinal and lateral microscopic behaviors of vehicles are modeled to quantify interaction risk, and a staged causal graph is constructed to capture causal dependencies in lane-changing scenarios. Causal effects between the lane-changing vehicle and surrounding vehicles are then estimated using causal inference, including average causal effects (ATE) and conditional average treatment effects (CATE). These causal priors are embedded into a model predictive control (MPC) framework to enhance trajectory planning. The proposed approach is validated on naturalistic vehicle trajectory datasets. Experimental results show that: (1) causal inference provides interpretable and stable quantification of vehicle interactions; (2) individual causal effects reveal driver heterogeneity; and (3) compared with the baseline MPC, the proposed method achieves a closer alignment with human driving behaviors, reducing maximum trajectory deviation from 1.2 m to 0.2 m, lateral velocity fluctuation by 60%, and yaw angle variability by 50%. These findings provide methodological support for human-like trajectory planning and practical value for improving safety, stability, and realism in autonomous vehicle testing and traffic simulation platforms.</description>

      <title>DSO-VSA: a Variable Stiffness Actuator with Decoupled Stiffness and Output Characteristics for Rehabilitation Robotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stroke-induced motor impairment often results in substantial loss of upper-limb function, creating a strong demand for rehabilitation robots that enable safe and transparent physical human-robot interaction (pHRI). Variable stiffness actuators are well suited for such applications. However, in most existing designs, stiffness is coupled with the deflection angle, complicating both modeling and control. To address this limitation, this paper presents a variable stiffness actuator featuring decoupled stiffness and output behavior for rehabilitation robotics. The system integrates a variable stiffness mechanism that combines a variable-length lever with a hypocycloidal straight-line mechanism to achieve a linear torque-deflection relationship and continuous stiffness modulation from near zero to theoretically infinite. It also incorporates a differential transmission mechanism based on a planetary gear system that enables dual-motor load sharing. A cascade PI controller is further developed on the basis of the differential configuration, in which the position-loop term jointly regulates stiffness and deflection angle, effectively suppressing stiffness fluctuations and output disturbances. The performance of prototype was experimentally validated through stiffness calibration, stiffness regulation, torque control, decoupled characteristics, and dual-motor load sharing, indicating the potential for rehabilitation exoskeletons and other pHRI systems.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Classification Network Guided Trajectory Planning for Four-Wheel Independent Steering Autonomous Parking Considering Obstacle Attributes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Four-wheel Independent Steering (4WIS) vehicles have attracted increasing attention for their superior maneuverability. Human drivers typically choose to cross or drive over the low-profile obstacles (e.g., plastic bags) to efficiently navigate through narrow spaces, while existing planners neglect obstacle attributes, causing inefficiency or path-finding failures. To address this, we propose a trajectory planning framework integrating the 4WIS hybrid A* and Optimal Control Problem (OCP), in which the hybrid A* provides an initial path to enhance the OCP solution. Specifically, a multimodal classification network is introduced to assess scene complexity (hard/easy task) by fusing image and vehicle state data. For hard tasks, guided points are set to decompose complex tasks into local subtasks, improving the search efficiency of 4WIS hybrid A*. The multiple steering modes of 4WIS vehicles (Ackermann, diagonal, and zero-turn) are also incorporated into node expansion and heuristic designs. Moreover, a hierarchical obstacle handling strategy is designed to guide the node expansion considering obstacle attributes, i.e., 'non-traversable', 'crossable', and 'drive-over' obstacles. It allows crossing or driving over obstacles instead of the 'avoid-only' strategy, greatly enhancing success rates of pathfinding. We also design a logical constraint for the 'drive-over' obstacle by limiting its velocity to ensure safety. Furthermore, to address dynamic obstacles with motion uncertainty, we introduce a probabilistic risk field model, constructing risk-aware driving corridors that serve as linear collision constraints in OCP. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed framework's effectiveness in generating safe, efficient, and smooth trajectories for 4WIS vehicles, especially in constrained environments.</description>

      <title>InDRiVE: Reward-Free World-Model Pretraining for Autonomous Driving via Latent Disagreement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) can reduce interaction cost for autonomous driving by learning a predictive world model, but it typically still depends on task-specific rewards that are difficult to design and often brittle under distribution shift. This paper presents InDRiVE, a DreamerV3-style MBRL agent that performs reward-free pretraining in CARLA using only intrinsic motivation derived from latent ensemble disagreement. Disagreement acts as a proxy for epistemic uncertainty and drives the agent toward under-explored driving situations, while an imagination-based actor-critic learns a planner-free exploration policy directly from the learned world model. After intrinsic pretraining, we evaluate zero-shot transfer by freezing all parameters and deploying the pretrained exploration policy in unseen towns and routes. We then study few-shot adaptation by training a task policy with limited extrinsic feedback for downstream objectives (lane following and collision avoidance). Experiments in CARLA across towns, routes, and traffic densities show that disagreement-based pretraining yields stronger zero-shot robustness and robust few-shot collision avoidance under town shift and matched interaction budgets, supporting the use of intrinsic disagreement as a practical reward-free pretraining signal for reusable driving world models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the 19th International Symposium on Advances in Robot Kinematics the author introduced a novel class of continuous flexible discrete surfaces and mentioned that these so-called P-hedra (or P-nets) allow direct access to their spatial shapes by three control polylines. In this follow-up paper we study this intuitive method, which makes these flexible planar quad surfaces suitable for transformable design tasks by means of interactive tools. The construction of P-hedra from the control polylines can also be used for an efficient algorithmic computation of their isometric deformations. In addition we discuss flexion limits, bifurcation configurations, developable/flat-foldable pattern and tubular P-hedra.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Robotic Placement via Grasp-Dependent Feasibility Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study whether inexpensive, physics-free supervision can reliably prioritize grasp-place candidates for budget-aware pick-and-place. From an object's initial pose, target pose, and a candidate grasp, we generate two path-aware geometric labels: path-wise inverse kinematics (IK) feasibility across a fixed approach-grasp-lift waypoint template, and a transit collision flag from mesh sweeps along the same template. A compact dual-output MLP learns these signals from pose encodings, and at test time its scores rank precomputed candidates for a rank-then-plan policy under the same IK gate and planner as the baseline. Although learned from cheap labels only, the scores transfer to physics-enabled executed trajectories: at a fixed planning budget the policy finds successful paths sooner with fewer planner calls while keeping final success on par or better. This work targets a single rigid cuboid with side-face grasps and a fixed waypoint template, and we outline extensions to varied objects and richer waypoint schemes.</description>

      <title>A Framework for Deploying Learning-based Quadruped Loco-Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quadruped mobile manipulators offer strong potential for agile loco-manipulation but remain difficult to control and transfer reliably from simulation to reality. Reinforcement learning (RL) shows promise for whole-body control, yet most frameworks are proprietary and hard to reproduce on real hardware. We present an open pipeline for training, benchmarking, and deploying RL-based controllers on the Unitree B1 quadruped with a Z1 arm. The framework unifies sim-to-sim and sim-to-real transfer through ROS, re-implementing a policy trained in Isaac Gym, extending it to MuJoCo via a hardware abstraction layer, and deploying the same controller on physical hardware. Sim-to-sim experiments expose discrepancies between Isaac Gym and MuJoCo contact models that influence policy behavior, while real-world teleoperated object-picking trials show that coordinated whole-body control extends reach and improves manipulation over floating-base baselines. The pipeline provides a transparent, reproducible foundation for developing and analyzing RL-based loco-manipulation controllers and will be released open source to support future research.</description>

      <title>Affordance RAG: Hierarchical Multimodal Retrieval with Affordance-Aware Embodied Memory for Mobile Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we address the problem of open-vocabulary mobile manipulation, where a robot is required to carry a wide range of objects to receptacles based on free-form natural language instructions. This task is challenging, as it involves understanding visual semantics and the affordance of manipulation actions. To tackle these challenges, we propose Affordance RAG, a zero-shot hierarchical multimodal retrieval framework that constructs Affordance-Aware Embodied Memory from pre-explored images. The model retrieves candidate targets based on regional and visual semantics and reranks them with affordance scores, allowing the robot to identify manipulation options that are likely to be executable in real-world environments. Our method outperformed existing approaches in retrieval performance for mobile manipulation instruction in large-scale indoor environments. Furthermore, in real-world experiments where the robot performed mobile manipulation in indoor environments based on free-form instructions, the proposed method achieved a task success rate of 85%, outperforming existing methods in both retrieval performance and overall task success.</description>

      <title>DTCCL: Disengagement-Triggered Contrastive Continual Learning for Autonomous Bus Planners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous buses run on fixed routes but must operate in open, dynamic urban environments. Disengagement events on these routes are often geographically concentrated and typically arise from planner failures in highly interactive regions. Such policy-level failures are difficult to correct using conventional imitation learning, which easily overfits to sparse disengagement data. To address this issue, this paper presents a Disengagement-Triggered Contrastive Continual Learning (DTCCL) framework that enables autonomous buses to improve planning policies through real-world operation. Each disengagement triggers cloud-based data augmentation that generates positive and negative samples by perturbing surrounding agents while preserving route context. Contrastive learning refines policy representations to better distinguish safe and unsafe behaviors, and continual updates are applied in a cloud-edge loop without human supervision. Experiments on urban bus routes demonstrate that DTCCL improves overall planning performance by 48.6 percent compared with direct retraining, validating its effectiveness for scalable, closed-loop policy improvement in autonomous public transport.</description>

      <title>IndoorUAV: Benchmarking Vision-Language UAV Navigation in Continuous Indoor Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) enables agents to navigate in complex environments by following natural language instructions grounded in visual observations. Although most existing work has focused on ground-based robots or outdoor Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), indoor UAV-based VLN remains underexplored, despite its relevance to real-world applications such as inspection, delivery, and search-and-rescue in confined spaces. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{IndoorUAV}, a novel benchmark and method specifically tailored for VLN with indoor UAVs. We begin by curating over 1,000 diverse and structurally rich 3D indoor scenes from the Habitat simulator. Within these environments, we simulate realistic UAV flight dynamics to collect diverse 3D navigation trajectories manually, further enriched through data augmentation techniques. Furthermore, we design an automated annotation pipeline to generate natural language instructions of varying granularity for each trajectory. This process yields over 16,000 high-quality trajectories, comprising the \textbf{IndoorUAV-VLN} subset, which focuses on long-horizon VLN. To support short-horizon planning, we segment long trajectories into sub-trajectories by selecting semantically salient keyframes and regenerating concise instructions, forming the \textbf{IndoorUAV-VLA} subset. Finally, we introduce \textbf{IndoorUAV-Agent}, a novel navigation model designed for our benchmark, leveraging task decomposition and multimodal reasoning. We hope IndoorUAV serves as a valuable resource to advance research on vision-language embodied AI in the indoor aerial navigation domain.</description>

      <title>EGM: Efficiently Learning General Motion Tracking Policy for High Dynamic Humanoid Whole-Body Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning a general motion tracking policy from human motions shows great potential for versatile humanoid whole-body control. Conventional approaches are not only inefficient in data utilization and training processes but also exhibit limited performance when tracking highly dynamic motions. To address these challenges, we propose EGM, a framework that enables efficient learning of a general motion tracking policy. EGM integrates four core designs. Firstly, we introduce a Bin-based Cross-motion Curriculum Adaptive Sampling strategy to dynamically orchestrate the sampling probabilities based on tracking error of each motion bin, eficiently balancing the training process across motions with varying dificulty and durations. The sampled data is then processed by our proposed Composite Decoupled Mixture-of-Experts (CDMoE) architecture, which efficiently enhances the ability to track motions from different distributions by grouping experts separately for upper and lower body and decoupling orthogonal experts from shared experts to separately handle dedicated features and general features. Central to our approach is a key insight we identified: for training a general motion tracking policy, data quality and diversity are paramount. Building on these designs, we develop a three-stage curriculum training flow to progressively enhance the policy's robustness against disturbances. Despite training on only 4.08 hours of data, EGM generalized robustly across 49.25 hours of test motions, outperforming baselines on both routine and highly dynamic tasks.</description>

      <title>CoDrone: Autonomous Drone Navigation Assisted by Edge and Cloud Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous navigation for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles faces key challenges from limited onboard computational resources, which restrict deployed deep neural networks to shallow architectures incapable of handling complex environments. Offloading tasks to remote edge servers introduces high latency, creating an inherent trade-off in system design. To address these limitations, we propose CoDrone - the first cloud-edge-end collaborative computing framework integrating foundation models into autonomous UAV cruising scenarios - effectively leveraging foundation models to enhance performance of resource-constrained unmanned aerial vehicle platforms. To reduce onboard computation and data transmission overhead, CoDrone employs grayscale imagery for the navigation model. When enhanced environmental perception is required, CoDrone leverages the edge-assisted foundation model Depth Anything V2 for depth estimation and introduces a novel one-dimensional occupancy grid-based navigation method - enabling fine-grained scene understanding while advancing efficiency and representational simplicity of autonomous navigation. A key component of CoDrone is a Deep Reinforcement Learning-based neural scheduler that seamlessly integrates depth estimation with autonomous navigation decisions, enabling real-time adaptation to dynamic environments. Furthermore, the framework introduces a UAV-specific vision language interaction module incorporating domain-tailored low-level flight primitives to enable effective interaction between the cloud foundation model and the UAV. The introduction of VLM enhances open-set reasoning capabilities in complex unseen scenarios. Experimental results show CoDrone outperforms baseline methods under varying flight speeds and network conditions, achieving a 40% increase in average flight distance and a 5% improvement in average Quality of Navigation.</description>

      <title>WorldRFT: Latent World Model Planning with Reinforcement Fine-Tuning for Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Latent World Models enhance scene representation through temporal self-supervised learning, presenting a perception annotation-free paradigm for end-to-end autonomous driving. However, the reconstruction-oriented representation learning tangles perception with planning tasks, leading to suboptimal optimization for planning. To address this challenge, we propose WorldRFT, a planning-oriented latent world model framework that aligns scene representation learning with planning via a hierarchical planning decomposition and local-aware interactive refinement mechanism, augmented by reinforcement learning fine-tuning (RFT) to enhance safety-critical policy performance. Specifically, WorldRFT integrates a vision-geometry foundation model to improve 3D spatial awareness, employs hierarchical planning task decomposition to guide representation optimization, and utilizes local-aware iterative refinement to derive a planning-oriented driving policy. Furthermore, we introduce Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), which applies trajectory Gaussianization and collision-aware rewards to fine-tune the driving policy, yielding systematic improvements in safety. WorldRFT achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on both open-loop nuScenes and closed-loop NavSim benchmarks. On nuScenes, it reduces collision rates by 83% (0.30% -&gt; 0.05%). On NavSim, using camera-only sensors input, it attains competitive performance with the LiDAR-based SOTA method DiffusionDrive (87.8 vs. 88.1 PDMS).</description>

      <title>Vision-Language-Policy Model for Dynamic Robot Task Planning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bridging the gap between natural language commands and autonomous execution in unstructured environments remains an open challenge for robotics. This requires robots to perceive and reason over the current task scene through multiple modalities, and to plan their behaviors to achieve their intended goals. Traditional robotic task-planning approaches often struggle to bridge low-level execution with high-level task reasoning, and cannot dynamically update task strategies when instructions change during execution, which ultimately limits their versatility and adaptability to new tasks. In this work, we propose a novel language model-based framework for dynamic robot task planning. Our Vision-Language-Policy (VLP) model, based on a vision-language model fine-tuned on real-world data, can interpret semantic instructions and integrate reasoning over the current task scene to generate behavior policies that control the robot to accomplish the task. Moreover, it can dynamically adjust the task strategy in response to changes in the task, enabling flexible adaptation to evolving task requirements. Experiments conducted with different robots and a variety of real-world tasks show that the trained model can efficiently adapt to novel scenarios and dynamically update its policy, demonstrating strong planning autonomy and cross-embodiment generalization.

      <title>Translating Flow to Policy via Hindsight Online Imitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in hierarchical robot systems leverage a high-level planner to propose task plans and a low-level policy to generate robot actions. This design allows training the planner on action-free or even non-robot data sources (e.g., videos), providing transferable high-level guidance. Nevertheless, grounding these high-level plans into executable actions remains challenging, especially with the limited availability of high-quality robot data. To this end, we propose to improve the low-level policy through online interactions. Specifically, our approach collects online rollouts, retrospectively annotates the corresponding high-level goals from achieved outcomes, and aggregates these hindsight-relabeled experiences to update a goal-conditioned imitation policy. Our method, Hindsight Flow-conditioned Online Imitation (HinFlow), instantiates this idea with 2D point flows as the high-level planner. Across diverse manipulation tasks in both simulation and physical world, our method achieves more than $2\times$ performance improvement over the base policy, significantly outperforming the existing methods. Moreover, our framework enables policy acquisition from planners trained on cross-embodiment video data, demonstrating its potential for scalable and transferable robot learning.</description>

      <title>Are All Data Necessary? Efficient Data Pruning for Large-scale Autonomous Driving Dataset via Trajectory Entropy Maximization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collecting large-scale naturalistic driving data is essential for training robust autonomous driving planners. However, real-world datasets often contain a substantial amount of repetitive and low-value samples, which lead to excessive storage costs and bring limited benefits to policy learning. To address this issue, we propose an information-theoretic data pruning method that effectively reduces the training data volume without compromising model performance. Our approach evaluates the trajectory distribution information entropy of driving data and iteratively selects high-value samples that preserve the statistical characteristics of the original dataset in a model-agnostic manner. From a theoretical perspective, we show that maximizing trajectory entropy effectively constrains the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the pruned subset and the original data distribution, thereby maintaining generalization ability. Comprehensive experiments on the NuPlan benchmark with a large-scale imitation learning framework demonstrate that the proposed method can reduce the dataset size by up to 40% while maintaining closed-loop performance. This work provides a lightweight and theoretically grounded approach for scalable data management and efficient policy learning in autonomous driving systems.</description>

Abstract: Rigid body dynamics simulators are important tools for the design, analysis and optimization of mechanical systems in a variety of technical and scientific applications. This study examines four different simulation environments (Adams, Simscape, OpenModelica, and VEROSIM), focusing in particular on the comparison of the modeling methods, the numerical solvers, and the treatment of numerical problems that arise especially in closed-loop kinematics (esp. redundant boundary conditions and static equilibrium problem). A novel and complex crane boom of a real forestry machine serves as a practical benchmark application example. The direct comparison of the different solution approaches in the examined simulation tools supports the user in selecting the most suitable tool for his application.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robot manipulation, a key capability of embodied AI, has turned to data-driven generative policy frameworks, but mainstream approaches like Diffusion Models suffer from high inference latency and Flow-based Methods from increased architectural complexity. While simply applying meanFlow on robotic tasks achieves single-step inference and outperforms FlowPolicy, it lacks few-shot generalization due to fixed temperature hyperparameters in its Dispersive Loss and misaligned predicted-true mean velocities. To solve these issues, this study proposes an improved MeanFlow-based Policies: we introduce a lightweight Cosine Loss to align velocity directions and use the Differential Derivation Equation (DDE) to optimize the Jacobian-Vector Product (JVP) operator. Experiments on Adroit and Meta-World tasks show the proposed method outperforms MP1 and FlowPolicy in average success rate, especially in challenging Meta-World tasks, effectively enhancing few-shot generalization and trajectory accuracy of robot manipulation policies while maintaining real-time performance, offering a more robust solution for high-precision robotic manipulation.</description>

      <title>TwinAligner: Visual-Dynamic Alignment Empowers Physics-aware Real2Sim2Real for Robotic Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The robotics field is evolving towards data-driven, end-to-end learning, inspired by multimodal large models. However, reliance on expensive real-world data limits progress. Simulators offer cost-effective alternatives, but the gap between simulation and reality challenges effective policy transfer. This paper introduces TwinAligner, a novel Real2Sim2Real system that addresses both visual and dynamic gaps. The visual alignment module achieves pixel-level alignment through SDF reconstruction and editable 3DGS rendering, while the dynamic alignment module ensures dynamic consistency by identifying rigid physics from robot-object interaction. TwinAligner improves robot learning by providing scalable data collection and establishing a trustworthy iterative cycle, accelerating algorithm development. Quantitative evaluations highlight TwinAligner's strong capabilities in visual and dynamic real-to-sim alignment. This system enables policies trained in simulation to achieve strong zero-shot generalization to the real world. The high consistency between real-world and simulated policy performance underscores TwinAligner's potential to advance scalable robot learning. Code and data will be released on https://twin-aligner.github.io</description>

      <title>Real2Edit2Real: Generating Robotic Demonstrations via a 3D Control Interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent progress in robot learning has been driven by large-scale datasets and powerful visuomotor policy architectures, yet policy robustness remains limited by the substantial cost of collecting diverse demonstrations, particularly for spatial generalization in manipulation tasks. To reduce repetitive data collection, we present Real2Edit2Real, a framework that generates new demonstrations by bridging 3D editability with 2D visual data through a 3D control interface. Our approach first reconstructs scene geometry from multi-view RGB observations with a metric-scale 3D reconstruction model. Based on the reconstructed geometry, we perform depth-reliable 3D editing on point clouds to generate new manipulation trajectories while geometrically correcting the robot poses to recover physically consistent depth, which serves as a reliable condition for synthesizing new demonstrations. Finally, we propose a multi-conditional video generation model guided by depth as the primary control signal, together with action, edge, and ray maps, to synthesize spatially augmented multi-view manipulation videos. Experiments on four real-world manipulation tasks demonstrate that policies trained on data generated from only 1-5 source demonstrations can match or outperform those trained on 50 real-world demonstrations, improving data efficiency by up to 10-50x. Moreover, experimental results on height and texture editing demonstrate the framework's flexibility and extensibility, indicating its potential to serve as a unified data generation framework.</description>

      <title>MaP-AVR: A Meta-Action Planner for Agents Leveraging Vision Language Models and Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Embodied robotic AI systems designed to manage complex daily tasks rely on a task planner to understand and decompose high-level tasks. While most research focuses on enhancing the task-understanding abilities of LLMs/VLMs through fine-tuning or chain-of-thought prompting, this paper argues that defining the planned skill set is equally crucial. To handle the complexity of daily environments, the skill set should possess a high degree of generalization ability. Empirically, more abstract expressions tend to be more generalizable. Therefore, we propose to abstract the planned result as a set of meta-actions. Each meta-action comprises three components: {move/rotate, end-effector status change, relationship with the environment}. This abstraction replaces human-centric concepts, such as grasping or pushing, with the robot's intrinsic functionalities. As a result, the planned outcomes align seamlessly with the complete range of actions that the robot is capable of performing. Furthermore, to ensure that the LLM/VLM accurately produces the desired meta-action format, we employ the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technique, which leverages a database of human-annotated planning demonstrations to facilitate in-context learning. As the system successfully completes more tasks, the database will self-augment to continue supporting diversity. The meta-action set and its integration with RAG are two novel contributions of our planner, denoted as MaP-AVR, the meta-action planner for agents composed of VLM and RAG. To validate its efficacy, we design experiments using GPT-4o as the pre-trained LLM/VLM model and OmniGibson as our robotic platform. Our approach demonstrates promising performance compared to the current state-of-the-art method. Project page: https://map-avr.github.io/.</description>

      <title>REALM: A Real-to-Sim Validated Benchmark for Generalization in Robotic Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models empower robots to understand and execute tasks described by natural language instructions. However, a key challenge lies in their ability to generalize beyond the specific environments and conditions they were trained on, which is presently difficult and expensive to evaluate in the real-world. To address this gap, we present REALM, a new simulation environment and benchmark designed to evaluate the generalization capabilities of VLA models, with a specific emphasis on establishing a strong correlation between simulated and real-world performance through high-fidelity visuals and aligned robot control. Our environment offers a suite of 15 perturbation factors, 7 manipulation skills, and more than 3,500 objects. Finally, we establish two task sets that form our benchmark and evaluate the \pi_{0}, \pi_{0}-FAST, and GR00T N1.5 VLA models, showing that generalization and robustness remain an open challenge. More broadly, we also show that simulation gives us a valuable proxy for the real-world and allows us to systematically probe for and quantify the weaknesses and failure modes of VLAs.

      <title>Results of the 2024 CommonRoad Motion Planning Competition for Autonomous Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past decade, a wide range of motion planning approaches for autonomous vehicles has been developed to handle increasingly complex traffic scenarios. However, these approaches are rarely compared on standardized benchmarks, limiting the assessment of relative strengths and weaknesses. To address this gap, we present the setup and results of the 4th CommonRoad Motion Planning Competition held in 2024, conducted using the CommonRoad benchmark suite. This annual competition provides an open-source and reproducible framework for benchmarking motion planning algorithms. The benchmark scenarios span highway and urban environments with diverse traffic participants, including passenger cars, buses, and bicycles. Planner performance is evaluated along four dimensions: efficiency, safety, comfort, and compliance with selected traffic rules. This report introduces the competition format and provides a comparison of representative high-performing planners from the 2023 and 2024 editions.</description>

      <title>LIMOncello: Revisited IKFoM on the SGal(3) Manifold for Fast LiDAR-Inertial Odometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces LIMOncello, a tightly coupled LiDAR-Inertial Odometry system that models 6-DoF motion on the $\mathrm{SGal}(3)$ manifold within an iterated error-state Kalman filter backend. Compared to state representations defined on $\mathrm{SO}(3)\times\mathbb{R}^6$, the use of $\mathrm{SGal}(3)$ provides a coherent and numerically stable discrete-time propagation model that helps limit drift in low-observability conditions.
  LIMOncello also includes a lightweight incremental i-Octree mapping backend that enables faster updates and substantially lower memory usage than incremental kd-tree style map structures, without relying on locality-restricted search heuristics. Experiments on multiple real-world datasets show that LIMOncello achieves competitive accuracy while improving robustness in geometrically sparse environments. The system maintains real-time performance with stable memory growth and is released as an extensible open-source implementation at https://github.com/CPerezRuiz335/LIMOncello.</description>

      <title>LeLaR: The First In-Orbit Demonstration of an AI-Based Satellite Attitude Controller</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19576v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Attitude control is essential for many satellite missions. Classical controllers, however, are time-consuming to design and sensitive to model uncertainties and variations in operational boundary conditions. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) offers a promising alternative by learning adaptive control strategies through autonomous interaction with a simulation environment. Overcoming the Sim2Real gap, which involves deploying an agent trained in simulation onto the real physical satellite, remains a significant challenge. In this work, we present the first successful in-orbit demonstration of an AI-based attitude controller for inertial pointing maneuvers. The controller was trained entirely in simulation and deployed to the InnoCube 3U nanosatellite, which was developed by the Julius-Maximilians-Universit\"at W\"urzburg in cooperation with the Technische Universit\"at Berlin, and launched in January 2025. We present the AI agent design, the methodology of the training procedure, the discrepancies between the simulation and the observed behavior of the real satellite, and a comparison of the AI-based attitude controller with the classical PD controller of InnoCube. Steady-state metrics confirm the robust performance of the AI-based controller during repeated in-orbit maneuvers.</description>

      <title>Learning Generalizable Hand-Object Tracking from Synthetic Demonstrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a system for learning generalizable hand-object tracking controllers purely from synthetic data, without requiring any human demonstrations. Our approach makes two key contributions: (1) HOP, a Hand-Object Planner, which can synthesize diverse hand-object trajectories; and (2) HOT, a Hand-Object Tracker that bridges synthetic-to-physical transfer through reinforcement learning and interaction imitation learning, delivering a generalizable controller conditioned on target hand-object states. Our method extends to diverse object shapes and hand morphologies. Through extensive evaluations, we show that our approach enables dexterous hands to track challenging, long-horizon sequences including object re-arrangement and agile in-hand reorientation. These results represent a significant step toward scalable foundation controllers for manipulation that can learn entirely from synthetic data, breaking the data bottleneck that has long constrained progress in dexterous manipulation.</description>

      <title>LoGoPlanner: Localization Grounded Navigation Policy with Metric-aware Visual Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19629v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trajectory planning in unstructured environments is a fundamental and challenging capability for mobile robots. Traditional modular pipelines suffer from latency and cascading errors across perception, localization, mapping, and planning modules. Recent end-to-end learning methods map raw visual observations directly to control signals or trajectories, promising greater performance and efficiency in open-world settings. However, most prior end-to-end approaches still rely on separate localization modules that depend on accurate sensor extrinsic calibration for self-state estimation, thereby limiting generalization across embodiments and environments. We introduce LoGoPlanner, a localization-grounded, end-to-end navigation framework that addresses these limitations by: (1) finetuning a long-horizon visual-geometry backbone to ground predictions with absolute metric scale, thereby providing implicit state estimation for accurate localization; (2) reconstructing surrounding scene geometry from historical observations to supply dense, fine-grained environmental awareness for reliable obstacle avoidance; and (3) conditioning the policy on implicit geometry bootstrapped by the aforementioned auxiliary tasks, thereby reducing error propagation. We evaluate LoGoPlanner in both simulation and real-world settings, where its fully end-to-end design reduces cumulative error while metric-aware geometry memory enhances planning consistency and obstacle avoidance, leading to more than a 27.3\% improvement over oracle-localization baselines and strong generalization across embodiments and environments. The code and models have been made publicly available on the https://steinate.github.io/logoplanner.github.io.</description>

      <title>Joint Learning of Depth, Pose, and Local Radiance Field for Large Scale Monocular 3D Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photorealistic 3-D reconstruction from monocular video collapses in large-scale scenes when depth, pose, and radiance are solved in isolation: scale-ambiguous depth yields ghost geometry, long-horizon pose drift corrupts alignment, and a single global NeRF cannot model hundreds of metres of content. We introduce a joint learning framework that couples all three factors and demonstrably overcomes each failure case. Our system begins with a Vision-Transformer (ViT) depth network trained with metric-scale supervision, giving globally consistent depths despite wide field-of-view variations. A multi-scale feature bundle-adjustment (BA) layer refines camera poses directly in feature space--leveraging learned pyramidal descriptors instead of brittle keypoints--to suppress drift on unconstrained trajectories. For scene representation, we deploy an incremental local-radiance-field hierarchy: new hash-grid NeRFs are allocated and frozen on-the-fly when view overlap falls below a threshold, enabling city-block-scale coverage on a single GPU. Evaluated on the Tanks and Temples benchmark, our method reduces Absolute Trajectory Error to 0.001-0.021 m across eight indoor-outdoor sequences--up to 18x lower than BARF and 2x lower than NoPe-NeRF--while maintaining sub-pixel Relative Pose Error. These results demonstrate that metric-scale, drift-free 3-D reconstruction and high-fidelity novel-view synthesis are achievable from a single uncalibrated RGB camera.</description>

      <title>Deterministic Reconstruction of Tennis Serve Mechanics: From Aerodynamic Constraints to Internal Torques via Rigid-Body Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most conventional studies on tennis serve biomechanics rely on phenomenological observations comparing professional and amateur players or, more recently, on AI-driven statistical analyses of motion data. While effective at describing \textit{what} elite players do, these approaches often fail to explain \textit{why} such motions are physically necessary from a mechanistic perspective. This paper proposes a deterministic, physics-based approach to the tennis serve using a 12-degree-of-freedom multi-segment model of the human upper body. Rather than fitting the model to motion capture data, we solve the inverse kinematics problem via trajectory optimization to rigorously satisfy the aerodynamic boundary conditions required for Flat, Slice, and Kick serves. We subsequently perform an inverse dynamics analysis based on the Principle of Virtual Power to compute the net joint torques. The simulation results reveal that while the kinematic trajectories for different serves may share visual similarities, the underlying kinetic profiles differ drastically. A critical finding is that joints exhibiting minimal angular displacement (kinematically ``quiet'' phases), particularly at the wrist, require substantial and highly time-varying torques to counteract gravitational loading and dynamic coupling effects. By elucidating the dissociation between visible kinematics and internal kinetics, this study provides a first-principles framework for understanding the mechanics of the tennis serve, moving beyond simple imitation of elite techniques.</description>

      <title>SD2AIL: Adversarial Imitation Learning from Synthetic Demonstrations via Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adversarial Imitation Learning (AIL) is a dominant framework in imitation learning that infers rewards from expert demonstrations to guide policy optimization. Although providing more expert demonstrations typically leads to improved performance and greater stability, collecting such demonstrations can be challenging in certain scenarios. Inspired by the success of diffusion models in data generation, we propose SD2AIL, which utilizes synthetic demonstrations via diffusion models. We first employ a diffusion model in the discriminator to generate synthetic demonstrations as pseudo-expert data that augment the expert demonstrations. To selectively replay the most valuable demonstrations from the large pool of (pseudo-) expert demonstrations, we further introduce a prioritized expert demonstration replay strategy (PEDR). The experimental results on simulation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method. In particular, in the Hopper task, our method achieves an average return of 3441, surpassing the state-of-the-art method by 89. Our code will be available at https://github.com/positron-lpc/SD2AIL.</description>

      <title>ChronoDreamer: Action-Conditioned World Model as an Online Simulator for Robotic Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present ChronoDreamer, an action-conditioned world model for contact-rich robotic manipulation. Given a history of egocentric RGB frames, contact maps, actions, and joint states, ChronoDreamer predicts future video frames, contact distributions, and joint angles via a spatial-temporal transformer trained with MaskGIT-style masked prediction. Contact is encoded as depth-weighted Gaussian splat images that render 3D forces into a camera-aligned format suitable for vision backbones. At inference, predicted rollouts are evaluated by a vision-language model that reasons about collision likelihood, enabling rejection sampling of unsafe actions before execution. We train and evaluate on DreamerBench, a simulation dataset generated with Project Chrono that provides synchronized RGB, contact splat, proprioception, and physics annotations across rigid and deformable object scenarios. Qualitative results demonstrate that the model preserves spatial coherence during non-contact motion and generates plausible contact predictions, while the LLM-based judge distinguishes collision from non-collision trajectories.</description>

      <title>Geometric-Photometric Event-based 3D Gaussian Ray Tracing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Event cameras offer a high temporal resolution over traditional frame-based cameras, which makes them suitable for motion and structure estimation. However, it has been unclear how event-based 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) approaches could leverage fine-grained temporal information of sparse events. This work proposes a framework to address the trade-off between accuracy and temporal resolution in event-based 3DGS. Our key idea is to decouple the rendering into two branches: event-by-event geometry (depth) rendering and snapshot-based radiance (intensity) rendering, by using ray-tracing and the image of warped events. The extensive evaluation shows that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the real-world datasets and competitive performance on the synthetic dataset. Also, the proposed method works without prior information (e.g., pretrained image reconstruction models) or COLMAP-based initialization, is more flexible in the event selection number, and achieves sharp reconstruction on scene edges with fast training time. We hope that this work deepens our understanding of the sparse nature of events for 3D reconstruction. The code will be released.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models align vision and language with embodied control, but their object referring ability remains limited when relying solely on text prompt, especially in cluttered or out-of-distribution (OOD) scenes. In this study, we introduce the Point-VLA, a plug-and-play policy that augments language instructions with explicit visual cues (e.g., bounding boxes) to resolve referential ambiguity and enable precise object-level grounding. To efficiently scale visually grounded datasets, we further develop an automatic data annotation pipeline requiring minimal human effort. We evaluate Point-VLA on diverse real-world referring tasks and observe consistently stronger performance than text-only instruction VLAs, particularly in cluttered or unseen-object scenarios, with robust generalization. These results demonstrate that Point-VLA effectively resolves object referring ambiguity through pixel-level visual grounding, achieving more generalizable embodied control.</description>

      <title>PalpAid: Multimodal Pneumatic Tactile Sensor for Tissue Palpation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The tactile properties of tissue, such as elasticity and stiffness, often play an important role in surgical oncology when identifying tumors and pathological tissue boundaries. Though extremely valuable, robot-assisted surgery comes at the cost of reduced sensory information to the surgeon; typically, only vision is available. Sensors proposed to overcome this sensory desert are often bulky, complex, and incompatible with the surgical workflow. We present PalpAid, a multimodal pneumatic tactile sensor equipped with a microphone and pressure sensor, converting contact force into an internal pressure differential. The pressure sensor acts as an event detector, while the auditory signature captured by the microphone assists in tissue delineation. We show the design, fabrication, and assembly of sensory units with characterization tests to show robustness to use, inflation-deflation cycles, and integration with a robotic system. Finally, we show the sensor's ability to classify 3D-printed hard objects with varying infills and soft ex vivo tissues. Overall, PalpAid aims to fill the sensory gap intelligently and allow improved clinical decision-making.</description>

      <title>VLNVerse: A Benchmark for Vision-Language Navigation with Versatile, Embodied, Realistic Simulation and Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite remarkable progress in Vision-Language Navigation (VLN), existing benchmarks remain confined to fixed, small-scale datasets with naive physical simulation. These shortcomings limit the insight that the benchmarks provide into sim-to-real generalization, and create a significant research gap. Furthermore, task fragmentation prevents unified/shared progress in the area, while limited data scales fail to meet the demands of modern LLM-based pretraining. To overcome these limitations, we introduce VLNVerse: a new large-scale, extensible benchmark designed for Versatile, Embodied, Realistic Simulation, and Evaluation. VLNVerse redefines VLN as a scalable, full-stack embodied AI problem. Its Versatile nature unifies previously fragmented tasks into a single framework and provides an extensible toolkit for researchers. Its Embodied design moves beyond intangible and teleporting "ghost" agents that support full-kinematics in a Realistic Simulation powered by a robust physics engine. We leverage the scale and diversity of VLNVerse to conduct a comprehensive Evaluation of existing methods, from classic models to MLLM-based agents. We also propose a novel unified multi-task model capable of addressing all tasks within the benchmark. VLNVerse aims to narrow the gap between simulated navigation and real-world generalization, providing the community with a vital tool to boost research towards scalable, general-purpose embodied locomotion agents.</description>

      <title>Vision-Aided Relative State Estimation for Approach and Landing on a Moving Platform with Inertial Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper tackles the problem of estimating the relative position, orientation, and velocity between a UAV and a planar platform undergoing arbitrary 3D motion during approach and landing. The estimation relies on measurements from Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) mounted on both systems, assuming there is a suitable communication channel to exchange data, together with visual information provided by an onboard monocular camera, from which the bearing (line-of-sight direction) to the platform's center and the normal vector of its planar surface are extracted. We propose a cascade observer with a complementary filter on SO(3) to reconstruct the relative attitude, followed by a linear Riccati observer for relative position and velocity estimation. Convergence of both observers is established under persistently exciting conditions, and the cascade is shown to be almost globally asymptotically and locally exponentially stable. We further extend the design to the case where the platform's rotation is restricted to its normal axis and show that its measured linear acceleration can be exploited to recover the remaining unobservable rotation angle. A sufficient condition to ensure local exponential convergence in this setting is provided. The performance of the proposed observers is validated through extensive simulations.</description>

      <title>Mixed formulation and structure-preserving discretization of Cosserat rod dynamics in a port-Hamiltonian framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An energy-based modeling framework for the nonlinear dynamics of spatial Cosserat rods undergoing large displacements and rotations is proposed. The mixed formulation features independent displacement, velocity and stress variables and is further objective and locking-free. Finite rotations are represented using a director formulation that avoids singularities and yields a constant mass matrix. This results in an infinite-dimensional nonlinear port-Hamiltonian (PH) system governed by partial differential-algebraic equations with a quadratic energy functional. Using a time-differentiated compliance form of the stress-strain relations allows for the imposition of kinematic constraints, such as inextensibility or shear-rigidity. A structure-preserving finite element discretization leads to a finite-dimensional system with PH structure, thus facilitating the design of an energy-momentum consistent integration scheme. Dissipative material behavior (via the generalized-Maxwell model) and non-standard actuation approaches (via pneumatic chambers or tendons) integrate naturally into the framework. As illustrated by selected numerical examples, the present framework establishes a new approach to energy-momentum consistent formulations in computational mechanics involving finite rotations.</description>

      <title>Sign Language Recognition using Parallel Bidirectional Reservoir Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sign language recognition (SLR) facilitates communication between deaf and hearing communities. Deep learning based SLR models are commonly used but require extensive computational resources, making them unsuitable for deployment on edge devices. To address these limitations, we propose a lightweight SLR system that combines parallel bidirectional reservoir computing (PBRC) with MediaPipe. MediaPipe enables real-time hand tracking and precise extraction of hand joint coordinates, which serve as input features for the PBRC architecture. The proposed PBRC architecture consists of two echo state network (ESN) based bidirectional reservoir computing (BRC) modules arranged in parallel to capture temporal dependencies, thereby creating a rich feature representation for classification. We trained our PBRC-based SLR system on the Word-Level American Sign Language (WLASL) video dataset, achieving top-1, top-5, and top-10 accuracies of 60.85%, 85.86%, and 91.74%, respectively. Training time was significantly reduced to 18.67 seconds due to the intrinsic properties of reservoir computing, compared to over 55 minutes for deep learning based methods such as Bi-GRU. This approach offers a lightweight, cost-effective solution for real-time SLR on edge devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We build the first system to address the problem of reconstructing in-scene object manipulation from a monocular RGB video. It is challenging due to ill-posed scene reconstruction, ambiguous hand-object depth, and the need for physically plausible interactions. Existing methods operate in hand centric coordinates and ignore the scene, hindering metric accuracy and practical use. In our method, we first use data-driven foundation models to initialize the core components, including the object mesh and poses, the scene point cloud, and the hand poses. We then apply a two-stage optimization that recovers a complete hand-object motion from grasping to interaction, which remains consistent with the scene information observed in the input video.</description>

Abstract: Innovative ideas are continuously emerging to produce better life conditions where essential human needs are supposed to be fulfilled with perfect scenarios leading us to propose modern strategies drawing the future of smart cities. In this context, flying robots are increasingly exploited in many fields to improve the quality of our life. This paper illustrates new designs of flying robots that could be used to perform a variety of advanced missions like investigating the state of high-power lines and manipulating cabling maintenance procedures when failures are detected, evaluating the state of the outer edge of sidewalks to color their partially or wholly erased parts, and spraying pesticides to trees or crops that are affected by different diseases. Creating such smart devices demands developing many other partial designs relying on AI-based algorithms, computer vision techniques, and embedded systems. A variety of techniques that we have recently developed in this field are presented here.</description>

      <title>GUIDEd Agents: Enhancing Navigation Policies through Task-Specific Uncertainty Abstraction in Localization-Limited Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15178v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Autonomous vehicles performing navigation tasks in complex environments face significant challenges due to uncertainty in state estimation. In many scenarios, such as stealth operations or resource-constrained settings, accessing high-precision localization comes at a significant cost, forcing robots to rely primarily on less precise state estimates. Our key observation is that different tasks require varying levels of precision in different regions: a robot navigating a crowded space might need precise localization near obstacles but can operate effectively with less precision elsewhere. In this paper, we present a planning method for integrating task-specific uncertainty requirements directly into navigation policies. We introduce Task-Specific Uncertainty Maps (TSUMs), which abstract the acceptable levels of state estimation uncertainty across different regions. TSUMs align task requirements and environmental features using a shared representation space, generated via a domain-adapted encoder. Using TSUMs, we propose Generalized Uncertainty Integration for Decision-Making and Execution (GUIDE), a policy conditioning framework that incorporates these uncertainty requirements into robot decision-making. We find that TSUMs provide an effective way to abstract task-specific uncertainty requirements, and conditioning policies on TSUMs enables the robot to reason about the context-dependent value of certainty and adapt its behavior accordingly. We show how integrating GUIDE into reinforcement learning frameworks allows the agent to learn navigation policies that effectively balance task completion and uncertainty management without explicit reward engineering. We evaluate GUIDE on various real-world robotic navigation tasks and find that it demonstrates significant improvement in task completion rates compared to baseline methods that do not explicitly consider task-specific uncertainty.</description>

      <title>HEIGHT: Heterogeneous Interaction Graph Transformer for Robot Navigation in Crowded and Constrained Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12150v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of robot navigation in dense and interactive crowds with static constraints such as corridors and furniture. Previous methods fail to consider all types of spatial and temporal interactions among agents and obstacles, leading to unsafe and inefficient robot paths. In this article, we leverage a graph-based representation of crowded and constrained scenarios and propose a structured framework to learn robot navigation policies with deep reinforcement learning. We first split the representations of different inputs and propose a heterogeneous spatio-temporal graph to model distinct interactions among humans, robots, and obstacles. Based on the heterogeneous spatio-temporal graph, we propose HEIGHT, a novel navigation policy network architecture with different components to capture heterogeneous interactions through space and time. HEIGHT utilizes attention mechanisms to prioritize important interactions and a recurrent network to track changes in the dynamic scene over time, encouraging the robot to avoid collisions adaptively. Through extensive simulation and real-world experiments, we demonstrate that HEIGHT outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of success, navigation time, and generalization to domain shifts in challenging navigation scenarios.

      <title>AnyNav: Visual Neuro-Symbolic Friction Learning for Off-road Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12654v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Off-road navigation is critical for a wide range of field robotics applications from planetary exploration to disaster response. However, it remains a longstanding challenge due to unstructured environments and the inherently complex terrain-vehicle interactions. Traditional physics-based methods struggle to accurately capture the nonlinear dynamics underlying these interactions, while purely data-driven approaches often overfit to specific motion patterns, vehicle geometries, or platforms, limiting their generalization in diverse, real-world scenarios. To address these limitations, we introduce AnyNav, a vision-based friction estimation and navigation framework grounded in neuro-symbolic principles. Our approach integrates neural networks for visual perception with symbolic physical models for reasoning about terrain-vehicle dynamics. To enable self-supervised learning in real-world settings, we adopt the imperative learning paradigm, employing bilevel optimization to train the friction network through physics-based optimization. This explicit incorporation of physical reasoning substantially enhances generalization across terrains, vehicle types, and operational conditions. Leveraging the predicted friction coefficients, we further develop a physics-informed navigation system capable of generating physically feasible, time-efficient paths together with corresponding speed profiles. We demonstrate that AnyNav seamlessly transfers from simulation to real-world robotic platforms, exhibiting strong robustness across different four-wheeled vehicles and diverse off-road environments.</description>

Abstract: Salps are marine animals consisting of chains of jellyfish-like units. Their efficient underwater locomotion by coordinating multi-jet propulsion has aroused great interest in robotics. This paper presents a geometric mechanics framework for salp-inspired robots. We study a new type of geometric mechanics models inspired by salps, in which control inputs are not restricted to the shape axes, analyze nonlinear controllability, and develop motion planning and feedback control methods. We introduce the "LandSalp" robot, which serves as a physical realization of the reduced-order, drag-dominated model of salp swimming, enabling controlled evaluation of locomotion strategies without many confounding factors of underwater experiments. We extend least-squares- and inverse-dynamics-based system identification to learn the Riemannian metric of the drag-dominated model from experimental data using Lie group differentiation. With about three minutes of data, we identify an accurate model of LandSalp. Simulation and hardware experiments demonstrate omnidirectional locomotion, shape regulation, and bending maneuvers, providing a principled pathway toward more capable salp-inspired robots.</description>

      <title>VERDI: VLM-Embedded Reasoning for Autonomous Driving</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15925v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While autonomous driving (AD) stacks struggle with decision making under partial observability and real-world complexity, human drivers are capable of commonsense reasoning to make near-optimal decisions with limited information. Recent work has attempted to leverage finetuned Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for trajectory planning at inference time to emulate human behavior. Despite their success in benchmark evaluations, these methods are often impractical to deploy (a 70B parameter VLM inference at merely 8 tokens per second requires more than 160G of memory), and their monolithic network structure prohibits safety decomposition. To bridge this gap, we propose VLM-Embedded Reasoning for autonomous Driving (VERDI), a training-time framework that distills the reasoning process and commonsense knowledge of VLMs into the AD stack. VERDI augments modular differentiable end-to-end (e2e) AD models by aligning intermediate module outputs at the perception, prediction, and planning stages with text features explaining the driving reasoning process produced by VLMs. By encouraging alignment in latent space, VERDI enables the modular AD stack to internalize structured reasoning, without incurring the inference-time costs of large VLMs. We validate VERDI in both open-loop (NuScenes and Bench2Drive benchmarks) and closed-loop (HugSim Simulator) settings. We find that VERDI outperforms existing e2e methods that do not embed reasoning by up to 11% in $\ell_{2}$ distance and 11% in driving performance, while maintaining real-time inference speed.</description>

      <title>Structural Integrality in Task Assignment and Path Finding via Total Unimodularity of Petri Net Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04881v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Task Assignment and Path Finding (TAPF) concerns computing collision-free motions for multiple robots while jointly selecting goal locations. In this paper, safety is enforced by requiring unit-capacity traversal between successive intermediate markings, yielding coordination strategies that are valid independently of any specific time interpretation. Existing optimization-based approaches typically rely on time-expanded network-flow models, which result in large mixed-integer programs and limited scalability. We instead develop a Petri net (PN)-based optimization framework that exploits structural properties of the motion model to improve computational efficiency without explicit time expansion.
  When robot motion is modeled by strongly connected state-machine PNs, we show that, once the congestion level (equivalently, the synchronization depth) is fixed to an integer value, the resulting motion-planning constraint matrix is totally unimodular. Consequently, the corresponding LP relaxation admits integral optimal solutions for the motion variables. When the estimated congestion exceeds one, we introduce a synchronization-on-demand mechanism based on intermediate markings; for a fixed number of synchronization stages, the associated constraint matrices remain totally unimodular, thereby preserving integrality of the motion variables.
  Finally, we extend TAPF to Boolean specifications over regions of interest and propose a two-stage LP/mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) scheme in which integrality is confined to task-selection variables. Simulations on large benchmarks demonstrate substantial scalability improvements over time-expanded optimization baselines.</description>

Abstract: We propose PRISM-Loc - a lightweight and robust approach for localization in large outdoor environments that combines a compact topological representation with a novel scan-matching and curb-detection module operating on raw LiDAR scans. The method is designed for resource-constrained platforms and emphasizes real-time performance and resilience to common urban sensing challenges. It provides accurate localization in compact topological maps using global place recognition and an original scan matching technique. Experiments on standard benchmarks and on an embedded platform demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Our method achieves a 99\% success rate on the large-scale ITLP-Campus dataset while running at 150 ms per localization and using a 20 MB map for localization. We highlight three main contributions: (1) a compact representation for city-scale localization; (2) a novel curb detection and scan matching pipeline operating directly on raw LiDAR points; (3) a thorough evaluation of our method with performance analysis.</description>

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models offer a compelling framework for tackling complex robotic manipulation tasks, but they are often expensive to train. In this paper, we propose a novel VLA approach that leverages the competitive performance of Vision Language Models (VLMs) on 2D images to directly infer robot end-effector poses in image frame coordinates. Unlike prior VLA models that output low-level controls, our model predicts trajectory waypoints, making it both more efficient to train and robot embodiment agnostic. Despite its lightweight design, our next-token prediction architecture effectively learns meaningful and executable robot trajectories. We further explore the underutilized potential of incorporating depth images, inference-time techniques such as decoding strategies, and demonstration-conditioned action generation. Our model is trained on a simulated dataset and exhibits strong sim-to-real transfer capabilities. We evaluate our approach using a combination of simulated and real data, demonstrating its effectiveness on a real robotic system.</description>

Abstract: Trustworthy robot behavior requires not only high levels of task success but also that the robot can reliably quantify how likely it is to succeed. To this end, we present a first-of-its-kind study of confidence calibration in vision-language-action (VLA) foundation models, which map visual observations and natural language instructions to low-level robot motor commands. We establish a confidence baseline for VLAs, examine how task success relates to calibration error and how calibration evolves over time, and introduce two lightweight techniques to remedy the miscalibration we observe: prompt ensembles and action-wise Platt scaling. Our aim in this study is to begin to develop the tools and conceptual understanding necessary to render VLAs both highly performant and highly trustworthy via reliable uncertainty quantification.</description>

Abstract: Agile human-centric manufacturing increasingly requires resilient robotic solutions that are capable of safe and productive interactions within unstructured environments of modern factories. While multi-modal sensor fusion provides comprehensive situational awareness yet robots must also contextualize their reasoning to achieve deep semantic understanding of complex scenes. Foundation model particularly Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as promising approach on integrating diverse perceptual modalities and spatio-temporal reasoning abilities to ground physical actions to realize General Physical Intelligence (GPI) across various robotic embodiments. Although GPI has been conceptually discussed in literature but its pivotal role and practical deployment in agile manufacturing remain underexplored. To address this gap, this practical review systematically surveys recent advances in VLA models through the lens of GPI by offering comparative analysis of leading implementations and evaluating their industrial readiness via structured ablation study. The state of the art is organized into six thematic pillars including multisensory representation learning, sim2real transfer, planning and control, uncertainty and safety measures and benchmarking. Finally, the review highlights open challenges and future directions for integrating GPI into industrial ecosystems to align with the vision of Industry 5.0 for intelligent, adaptive and collaborative manufacturing ecosystem.</description>

Abstract: Multi-embodiment grasping focuses on developing approaches that exhibit generalist behavior across diverse gripper designs. Existing methods often learn the kinematic structure of the robot implicitly and face challenges due to the difficulty of sourcing the required large-scale data. In this work, we present a data-efficient, flow-based, equivariant grasp synthesis architecture that can handle different gripper types with variable degrees of freedom and successfully exploit the underlying kinematic model, deducing all necessary information solely from the gripper and scene geometry. Unlike previous equivariant grasping methods, we translated all modules from the ground up to JAX and provide a model with batching capabilities over scenes, grippers, and grasps, resulting in smoother learning, improved performance and faster inference time. Our dataset encompasses grippers ranging from humanoid hands to parallel yaw grippers and includes 25,000 scenes and 20 million grasps.</description>

      <title>Collaborative Representation Learning for Alignment of Tactile, Language, and Vision Modalities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11512v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tactile sensing offers rich and complementary information to vision and language, enabling robots to perceive fine-grained object properties. However, existing tactile sensors lack standardization, leading to redundant features that hinder cross-sensor generalization. Moreover, existing methods fail to fully integrate the intermediate communication among tactile, language, and vision modalities. To address this, we propose TLV-CoRe, a CLIP-based Tactile-Language-Vision Collaborative Representation learning method. TLV-CoRe introduces a Sensor-Aware Modulator to unify tactile features across different sensors and employs tactile-irrelevant decoupled learning to disentangle irrelevant tactile features. Additionally, a Unified Bridging Adapter is introduced to enhance tri-modal interaction within the shared representation space. To fairly evaluate the effectiveness of tactile models, we further propose the RSS evaluation framework, focusing on Robustness, Synergy, and Stability across different methods. Experimental results demonstrate that TLV-CoRe significantly improves sensor-agnostic representation learning and cross-modal alignment, offering a new direction for multimodal tactile representation.</description>

      <title>Continuous Vision-Language-Action Co-Learning with Semantic-Physical Alignment for Behavioral Cloning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14396v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Language-conditioned manipulation facilitates human-robot interaction via behavioral cloning (BC), which learns control policies from human demonstrations and serves as a cornerstone of embodied AI. Overcoming compounding errors in sequential action decisions remains a central challenge to improving BC performance. Existing approaches mitigate compounding errors through data augmentation, expressive representation, or temporal abstraction. However, they suffer from physical discontinuities and semantic-physical misalignment, leading to inaccurate action cloning and intermittent execution. In this paper, we present Continuous vision-language-action Co-Learning with Semantic-Physical Alignment (CCoL), a novel BC framework that ensures temporally consistent execution and fine-grained semantic grounding. It generates robust and smooth action execution trajectories through continuous co-learning across vision, language, and proprioceptive inputs (e.g., robot internal states). Meanwhile, we anchor language semantics to visuomotor representations by a bidirectional cross-attention to learn contextual information for action generation, successfully overcoming the problem of semantic-physical misalignment. Extensive experiments show that CCoL achieves an average 8.0% relative improvement across three simulation suites, with up to 19.2% relative gain in human-demonstrated bimanual insertion tasks. Real-world tests on a 7-DoF robot further confirm CCoL's generalization under unseen and noisy object states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06951v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a vision-action policy that won 1st place in the 2025 BEHAVIOR Challenge - a large-scale benchmark featuring 50 diverse long-horizon household tasks in photo-realistic simulation, requiring bimanual manipulation, navigation, and context-aware decision making. Building on the Pi0.5 architecture, we introduce several innovations. Our primary contribution is correlated noise for flow matching, which improves training efficiency and enables correlation-aware inpainting for smooth action sequences. We also apply learnable mixed-layer attention and System 2 stage tracking for ambiguity resolution. Training employs multi-sample flow matching to reduce variance, while inference uses action compression and challenge-specific correction rules. Our approach achieves 26% q-score across all 50 tasks on both public and private leaderboards.</description>

      <title>Py-DiSMech: A Scalable and Efficient Framework for Discrete Differential Geometry-Based Modeling and Control of Soft Robots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09911v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-fidelity simulation has become essential to the design and control of soft robots, where large geometric deformations and complex contact interactions challenge conventional modeling tools. Recent advances in the field demand simulation frameworks that combine physical accuracy, computational scalability, and seamless integration with modern control and optimization pipelines. In this work, we present Py-DiSMech, a Python-based, open-source simulation framework for modeling and control of soft robotic structures grounded in the principles of Discrete Differential Geometry (DDG). By discretizing geometric quantities such as curvature and strain directly on meshes, Py-DiSMech captures the nonlinear deformation of rods, shells, and hybrid structures with high fidelity and reduced computational cost. The framework introduces (i) a fully vectorized NumPy implementation achieving order-of-magnitude speed-ups over existing geometry-based simulators; (ii) a penalty-energy-based fully implicit contact model that supports rod-rod, rod-shell, and shell-shell interactions; (iii) a natural-strain-based feedback-control module featuring a proportional-integral (PI) controller for shape regulation and trajectory tracking; and (iv) a modular, object-oriented software design enabling user-defined elastic energies, actuation schemes, and integration with machine-learning libraries. Benchmark comparisons demonstrate that Py-DiSMech substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art simulator Elastica in computational efficiency while maintaining physical accuracy. Together, these features establish Py-DiSMech as a scalable, extensible platform for simulation-driven design, control validation, and sim-to-real research in soft robotics.</description>

      <title>Iterative Compositional Data Generation for Robot Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10891v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Collecting robotic manipulation data is expensive, making it impractical to acquire demonstrations for the combinatorially large space of tasks that arise in multi-object, multi-robot, and multi-environment settings. While recent generative models can synthesize useful data for individual tasks, they do not exploit the compositional structure of robotic domains and struggle to generalize to unseen task combinations. We propose a semantic compositional diffusion transformer that factorizes transitions into robot-, object-, obstacle-, and objective-specific components and learns their interactions through attention. Once trained on a limited subset of tasks, we show that our model can zero-shot generate high-quality transitions from which we can learn control policies for unseen task combinations. Then, we introduce an iterative self-improvement procedure in which synthetic data is validated via offline reinforcement learning and incorporated into subsequent training rounds. Our approach substantially improves zero-shot performance over monolithic and hard-coded compositional baselines, ultimately solving nearly all held-out tasks and demonstrating the emergence of meaningful compositional structure in the learned representations.</description>

      <title>Fine-Tuning of Neural Network Approximate MPC without Retraining via Bayesian Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14350v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Approximate model-predictive control (AMPC) aims to imitate an MPC's behavior with a neural network, removing the need to solve an expensive optimization problem at runtime. However, during deployment, the parameters of the underlying MPC must usually be fine-tuned. This often renders AMPC impractical as it requires repeatedly generating a new dataset and retraining the neural network. Recent work addresses this problem by adapting AMPC without retraining using approximated sensitivities of the MPC's optimization problem. Currently, this adaption must be done by hand, which is labor-intensive and can be unintuitive for high-dimensional systems. To solve this issue, we propose using Bayesian optimization to tune the parameters of AMPC policies based on experimental data. By combining model-based control with direct and local learning, our approach achieves superior performance to nominal AMPC on hardware, with minimal experimentation. This allows automatic and data-efficient adaptation of AMPC to new system instances and fine-tuning to cost functions that are difficult to directly implement in MPC. We demonstrate the proposed method in hardware experiments for the swing-up maneuver on an inverted cartpole and yaw control of an under-actuated balancing unicycle robot, a challenging control problem.</description>

      <title>Towards Senior-Robot Interaction: Reactive Robot Dog Gestures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17136v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As the global population ages, many seniors face the problem of loneliness. Companion robots offer a potential solution. However, current companion robots often lack advanced functionality, while task-oriented robots are not designed for social interaction, limiting their suitability and acceptance by seniors. Our work introduces a senior-oriented system for quadruped robots that allows for more intuitive user input and provides more socially expressive output. For user input, we implemented a MediaPipe-based module for hand gesture and head movement recognition, enabling control without a remote. For output, we designed and trained robotic dog gestures using curriculum-based reinforcement learning in Isaac Gym, progressing from simple standing to three-legged balancing and leg extensions, and more. The final tests achieved over 95\% success on average in simulation, and we validated a key social gesture (the paw-lift) on a Unitree robot. Real-world tests demonstrated the feasibility and social expressiveness of this framework, while also revealing sim-to-real challenges in joint compliance, load distribution, and balance control. These contributions advance the development of practical quadruped robots as social companions for the senior and outline pathways for sim-to-real adaptation and inform future user studies.</description>

      <title>TakeAD: Preference-based Post-optimization for End-to-end Autonomous Driving with Expert Takeover Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17370v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing end-to-end autonomous driving methods typically rely on imitation learning (IL) but face a key challenge: the misalignment between open-loop training and closed-loop deployment. This misalignment often triggers driver-initiated takeovers and system disengagements during closed-loop execution. How to leverage those expert takeover data from disengagement scenarios and effectively expand the IL policy's capability presents a valuable yet unexplored challenge. In this paper, we propose TakeAD, a novel preference-based post-optimization framework that fine-tunes the pre-trained IL policy with this disengagement data to enhance the closed-loop driving performance. First, we design an efficient expert takeover data collection pipeline inspired by human takeover mechanisms in real-world autonomous driving systems. Then, this post optimization framework integrates iterative Dataset Aggregation (DAgger) for imitation learning with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for preference alignment. The DAgger stage equips the policy with fundamental capabilities to handle disengagement states through direct imitation of expert interventions. Subsequently, the DPO stage refines the policy's behavior to better align with expert preferences in disengagement scenarios. Through multiple iterations, the policy progressively learns recovery strategies for disengagement states, thereby mitigating the open-loop gap. Experiments on the closed-loop Bench2Drive benchmark demonstrate our method's effectiveness compared with pure IL methods, with comprehensive ablations confirming the contribution of each component.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16073v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Open World Object Detection(OWOD) addresses realistic scenarios where unseen object classes emerge, enabling detectors trained on known classes to detect unknown objects and incrementally incorporate the knowledge they provide. While existing OWOD methods primarily focus on detecting unknown objects, they often overlook the rich semantic relationships between detected objects, which are essential for scene understanding and applications in open-world environments (e.g., open-world tracking and novel class discovery). In this paper, we extend the OWOD framework to jointly detect unknown objects and learn semantically rich instance embeddings, enabling the detector to capture fine-grained semantic relationships between instances. To this end, we propose two modules that leverage the rich and generalizable knowledge of Vision Foundation Models(VFMs) and can be integrated into open-world object detectors. First, the Unknown Box Refine Module uses instance masks from the Segment Anything Model to accurately localize unknown objects. The Embedding Transfer Module then distills instance-wise semantic similarities from VFM features to the detector's embeddings via a relaxed contrastive loss, enabling the detector to learn a semantically meaningful and generalizable instance feature. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly improves both unknown object detection and instance embedding quality, while also enhancing performance in downstream tasks such as open-world tracking.</description>

      <title>Peer-Aware Cost Estimation in Nonlinear General-Sum Dynamic Games for Mutual Learning and Intent Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17129v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamic game theory is a powerful tool in modeling multi-agent interactions and human-robot systems. In practice, since the objective functions of both agents may not be explicitly known to each other, these interactions can be modeled as incomplete-information general-sum dynamic games. Solving for equilibrium policies for such games presents a major challenge, especially if the games involve nonlinear underlying dynamics. To simplify the problem, existing work often assumes that one agent is an expert with complete information about its peer, which can lead to biased estimates and failures in coordination. To address this challenge, we propose a nonlinear peer-aware cost estimation (N-PACE) algorithm for general-sum dynamic games. In N-PACE, using iterative linear quadratic (ILQ) approximation of dynamic games, each agent explicitly models the learning dynamics of its peer agent while inferring their objective functions and updating its own control policy accordingly in real time, which leads to unbiased and fast learning of the unknown objective function of the peer agent. Additionally, we demonstrate how N-PACE enables intent communication by explicitly modeling the peer's learning dynamics. Finally, we show how N-PACE outperforms baseline methods that disregard the learning behavior of the other agent, both analytically and using our case studies</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12898v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scaling general-purpose manipulation to new robot embodiments remains challenging: each platform typically needs large, homogeneous demonstrations, and end-to-end pixel-to-action pipelines may degenerate under background and viewpoint shifts. Based on previous advances in video-based robot control, we present Vidar, consisting of an embodied video diffusion model as the generalizable prior and a masked inverse dynamics model (MIDM) as the adapter. We leverage a video diffusion model pre-trained at Internet scale, and further continuously pre-train it for the embodied domain using 750K multi-view trajectories collected from three real-world robot platforms. For this embodied pre-training, we introduce a unified observation space that jointly encodes robot, camera, task, and scene contexts. The MIDM module learns action-relevant pixel masks without dense labels, grounding the prior into the target embodiment's action space while suppressing distractors. With only 20 minutes of human demonstrations on an unseen robot (1% of typical data), Vidar outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and generalizes to unseen tasks, backgrounds, and camera layouts. Our results suggest a scalable recipe for "one prior, many embodiments": strong, inexpensive video priors together with minimal on-robot alignment.</description>

      <title>DeltaFlow: An Efficient Multi-frame Scene Flow Estimation Method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17054v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Previous dominant methods for scene flow estimation focus mainly on input from two consecutive frames, neglecting valuable information in the temporal domain. While recent trends shift towards multi-frame reasoning, they suffer from rapidly escalating computational costs as the number of frames grows. To leverage temporal information more efficiently, we propose DeltaFlow ($\Delta$Flow), a lightweight 3D framework that captures motion cues via a $\Delta$ scheme, extracting temporal features with minimal computational cost, regardless of the number of frames. Additionally, scene flow estimation faces challenges such as imbalanced object class distributions and motion inconsistency. To tackle these issues, we introduce a Category-Balanced Loss to enhance learning across underrepresented classes and an Instance Consistency Loss to enforce coherent object motion, improving flow accuracy. Extensive evaluations on the Argoverse 2, Waymo and nuScenes datasets show that $\Delta$Flow achieves state-of-the-art performance with up to 22% lower error and $2\times$ faster inference compared to the next-best multi-frame supervised method, while also demonstrating a strong cross-domain generalization ability. The code is open-sourced at https://github.com/Kin-Zhang/DeltaFlow along with trained model weights.</description>

      <title>Discrete Diffusion VLA: Bringing Discrete Diffusion to Action Decoding in Vision-Language-Action Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20072v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models adapt large vision-language backbones to map images and instructions into robot actions. However, prevailing VLAs either generate actions auto-regressively in a fixed left-to-right order or attach separate MLP or diffusion heads outside the backbone, leading to fragmented information pathways and specialized training requirements that hinder a unified, scalable architecture. We present Discrete Diffusion VLA, a unified-transformer policy that models discretized action chunks with discrete diffusion. The design retains diffusion's progressive refinement paradigm while remaining natively compatible with the discrete token interface of VLMs. Our method achieves an adaptive decoding order that resolves easy action elements before harder ones and uses secondary re-masking to revisit uncertain predictions across refinement rounds, which improves consistency and enables robust error correction. This unified decoder preserves pre-trained vision-language priors, supports parallel decoding, breaks the autoregressive bottleneck, and reduces the number of function evaluations. Discrete Diffusion VLA achieves 96.3% avg. success rates on LIBERO, 71.2% visual matching on SimplerEnv-Fractal and 54.2% overall on SimplerEnv-Bridge. We also provide ablation study on vision-language ability retention on LIBERO-OOD (Out-of-Distribution) benchmark, with our method improving over autoregressive, MLP decoder and continuous diffusion baselines. These findings indicate that discrete-diffusion VLA supports precise action modeling and consistent training, laying groundwork for scaling VLA to larger models and datasets. Our code is available at https://github.com/Liang-ZX/DiscreteDiffusionVLA/tree/libero.</description>

      <title>Event Spectroscopy: Event-based Multispectral and Depth Sensing using Structured Light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06741v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly deployed in forest environments for tasks such as environmental monitoring and search and rescue, which require safe navigation through dense foliage and precise data collection. Traditional sensing approaches, including passive multispectral and RGB imaging, suffer from latency, poor depth resolution, and strong dependence on ambient light - especially under forest canopies. In this work, we present a novel event spectroscopy system that simultaneously enables high-resolution, low-latency depth reconstruction with integrated multispectral imaging using a single sensor. Depth is reconstructed using structured light, and by modulating the wavelength of the projected structured light, our system captures spectral information in controlled bands between 650 nm and 850 nm. We demonstrate up to $60\%$ improvement in RMSE over commercial depth sensors and validate the spectral accuracy against a reference spectrometer and commercial multispectral cameras, demonstrating comparable performance. A portable version limited to RGB (3 wavelengths) is used to collect real-world depth and spectral data from a Masoala Rainforest. We demonstrate the use of this prototype for color image reconstruction and material differentiation between leaves and branches using spectral and depth data. Our results show that adding depth (available at no extra effort with our setup) to material differentiation improves the accuracy by over $30\%$ compared to color-only method. Our system, tested in both lab and real-world rainforest environments, shows strong performance in depth estimation, RGB reconstruction, and material differentiation - paving the way for lightweight, integrated, and robust UAV perception and data collection in complex natural environments.</description>

      <title>AsyMoE: Leveraging Modal Asymmetry for Enhanced Expert Specialization in Large Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12715v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on multimodal tasks through scaled architectures and extensive training. However, existing Mixture of Experts (MoE) approaches face challenges due to the asymmetry between visual and linguistic processing. Visual information is spatially complete, while language requires maintaining sequential context. As a result, MoE models struggle to balance modality-specific features and cross-modal interactions. Through systematic analysis, we observe that language experts in deeper layers progressively lose contextual grounding and rely more on parametric knowledge rather than utilizing the provided visual and linguistic information. To address this, we propose AsyMoE, a novel architecture that models this asymmetry using three specialized expert groups. We design intra-modality experts for modality-specific processing, hyperbolic inter-modality experts for hierarchical cross-modal interactions, and evidence-priority language experts to suppress parametric biases and maintain contextual grounding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AsyMoE achieves 26.58% and 15.45% accuracy improvements over vanilla MoE and modality-specific MoE respectively, with 25.45% fewer activated parameters than dense models.</description>

      <title>QDepth-VLA: Quantized Depth Prediction as Auxiliary Supervision for Vision-Language-Action Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14836v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spatial perception and reasoning are crucial for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models to accomplish fine-grained manipulation tasks. However, existing approaches often lack the ability to understand and reason over the essential 3D structures necessary for precise control. To address this limitation, we propose QDepth-VLA, a general framework that augments VLA models with an auxiliary depth prediction task. A dedicated depth expert is designed to predict quantized latent tokens of depth maps obtained from a VQ-VAE encoder, enabling the model to learn depth-aware representations that capture critical geometric cues. Experimental results on the simulation benchmarks and real-world tasks demonstrate that QDepth-VLA yields strong spatial reasoning and competitive performance on manipulation tasks.</description>

      <title>WebATLAS: An LLM Agent with Experience-Driven Memory and Action Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22732v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) web agents often struggle with long-horizon web navigation and web task completion in new websites, producing inefficient action sequences unless fine-tuned on environment-specific data. We show that experience-driven memory, combined with look-ahead action simulation, is sufficient for LLM agents to adapt to unseen web environments by remembering past failures and predicting the consequences of future actions. We introduce WebATLAS (Actor-Critic Task-completion with Look-ahead Action Simulation), a memory-augmented LLM web agent that learns a lightweight internal model of the environment from interaction experience and performs hypothetical action rollouts before acting in the real world. WebATLAS builds a persistent cognitive map via curiosity-driven exploration, stores interaction outcomes as experience-based memory, and evaluates candidate actions in cognitive space using a planner--simulator--critic loop. This enables the agent to reuse past experience, avoid previously unsuccessful behaviors, and generate more efficient plans. We evaluate WebATLAS on the WebArena-Lite benchmark for autonomous web navigation and demonstrate a success rate of 63%, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art at 53.9%. Unlike previous systems, our modular architecture requires no website-specific LLM fine-tuning. Ablation studies confirm that experience-driven memory, look-ahead action simulation, and hierarchical replanning play complementary roles in enabling robust, training-free web agents.</description>

      <title>BRIC: Bridging Kinematic Plans and Physical Control at Test Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20431v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose BRIC, a novel test-time adaptation (TTA) framework that enables long-term human motion generation by resolving execution discrepancies between diffusion-based kinematic motion planners and reinforcement learning-based physics controllers. While diffusion models can generate diverse and expressive motions conditioned on text and scene context, they often produce physically implausible outputs, leading to execution drift during simulation. To address this, BRIC dynamically adapts the physics controller to noisy motion plans at test time, while preserving pre-trained skills via a loss function that mitigates catastrophic forgetting. In addition, BRIC introduces a lightweight test-time guidance mechanism that steers the diffusion model in the signal space without updating its parameters. By combining both adaptation strategies, BRIC ensures consistent and physically plausible long-term executions across diverse environments in an effective and efficient manner. We validate the effectiveness of BRIC on a variety of long-term tasks, including motion composition, obstacle avoidance, and human-scene interaction, achieving state-of-the-art performance across all tasks.</description>

      <title>CRISP: Contact-Guided Real2Sim from Monocular Video with Planar Scene Primitives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14696v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce CRISP, a method that recovers simulatable human motion and scene geometry from monocular video. Prior work on joint human-scene reconstruction relies on data-driven priors and joint optimization with no physics in the loop, or recovers noisy geometry with artifacts that cause motion tracking policies with scene interactions to fail. In contrast, our key insight is to recover convex, clean, and simulation-ready geometry by fitting planar primitives to a point cloud reconstruction of the scene, via a simple clustering pipeline over depth, normals, and flow. To reconstruct scene geometry that might be occluded during interactions, we make use of human-scene contact modeling (e.g., we use human posture to reconstruct the occluded seat of a chair). Finally, we ensure that human and scene reconstructions are physically-plausible by using them to drive a humanoid controller via reinforcement learning. Our approach reduces motion tracking failure rates from 55.2\% to 6.9\% on human-centric video benchmarks (EMDB, PROX), while delivering a 43\% faster RL simulation throughput. We further validate it on in-the-wild videos including casually-captured videos, Internet videos, and even Sora-generated videos. This demonstrates CRISP's ability to generate physically-valid human motion and interaction environments at scale, greatly advancing real-to-sim applications for robotics and AR/VR.</description>
