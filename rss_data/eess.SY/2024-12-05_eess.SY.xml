Abstract: The increasing share of renewable energy sources and necessitate new concepts for energy flexible operation of industrial production resources. In this paper, we demonstrate the potential of mass storage to increase energy flexibility in industrial operations through the application of optimized operational planning based on market prices. A wastewater treatment plant equipped with decanters and storages is examined to optimally utilize its energy-flexibility. An MILP model was created for energy-flexible production facilities. The resulting operation plan was transmitted to the plant operators and executed over a period of more than 24 hours. The model shows good agreement with real measurements (average errors between 3% to 7%). The results demonstrate significant potential for cost savings of roughly 56% for the investigated time horizon.

      <title>Learning Koopman-based Stability Certificates for Unknown Nonlinear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Koopman operator theory has gained significant attention in recent years for identifying discrete-time nonlinear systems by embedding them into an infinite-dimensional linear vector space. However, providing stability guarantees while learning the continuous-time dynamics, especially under conditions of relatively low observation frequency, remains a challenge within the existing Koopman-based learning frameworks. To address this challenge, we propose an algorithmic framework to simultaneously learn the vector field and Lyapunov functions for unknown nonlinear systems, using a limited amount of data sampled across the state space and along the trajectories at a relatively low sampling frequency. The proposed framework builds upon recently developed high-accuracy Koopman generator learning for capturing transient system transitions and physics-informed neural networks for training Lyapunov functions. We show that the learned Lyapunov functions can be formally verified using a satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) solver and provide less conservative estimates of the region of attraction compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Modularized Neural Network Incorporating Physical Priors for Smart Building Control, Accuracy or Consistency?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model predictive control can achieve significant energy savings, offer grid flexibility, and mitigate carbon emissions. However, the challenge of identifying individual control-oriented building dynamic models limits large-scale real-world applications. To address this issue, this study proposed a Modularized Neural Network Incorporating Physical Priors (ModNN), capable of establishing a control-oriented and physical-consistent building dynamic model within minutes without substantial modeling effort. This is also the first study to evaluate the physical consistency of a given data-driven model both qualitatively and quantitively. We compared the physical consistency of a classical Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model and our ModNN. The ModNN strictly satisfies physical constraints, whereas the LSTM model learned contradictory system dynamics. Additionally, we compared their control performance on an EnergyPlus virtual testbed. While the LSTM model demonstrated slightly better prediction accuracy in dynamic modeling, it failed in control optimization, resulting in an 89{\deg}C-h temperature violation, whereas the ModNN showed only a 0.57{\deg}C-h violation and achieved up to a 78% peak load reduction. Our findings highlight the importance of incorporating physics priors into data-driven models and provide a promising solution for future smart building control optimization. Furthermore, the proposed evaluation framework defines two physical consistency indicators, providing guidelines for selecting and testing control-oriented, data-driven building dynamic models.</description>

      <title>The effects of four-wheel steering on the path-tracking control of automated vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we analyze the stability of a path-tracking controller designed for a four-wheel steering vehicle, incorporating the effects of the reference path curvature. By employing a simplified kinematic model of the vehicle with steerable front and rear wheels, we derive analytical expressions for the stability regions and optimal control gains specific to different four-wheel steering strategies. To simplify our calculations, we keep the rear steering angle $\delta_r$ proportional to the front steering angle $\delta_f$ by using the constant parameter $a$, i.e., $\delta_r = a\delta_f$, where $\delta_f$ is calculated from a control law having both feedforward and feedback terms. Our findings, supported by stability charts and numerical simulations, indicate that for high velocities and paths of small curvatures, the appropriately tuned four-wheel steering controller significantly reduces lateral acceleration and enhances path-tracking performance when compared to using only front-wheel steering. Furthermore, for low velocities and large curvatures, the using negative a values (i.e., steering the rear wheels in the opposite direction than the front wheels) allows for a reduced turning radius, increasing the vehicle's capability to perform sharp turns in confined spaces like in parking lots or on narrow roads.</description>

      <title>Robust Model Predictive Control for Constrained Uncertain Systems Based on Concentric Container and Varying Tube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel robust model predictive control (RMPC) method for the stabilization of constrained systems subject to additive disturbance (AD) and multiplicative disturbance (MD). Concentric containers are introduced to facilitate the characterization of MD, and varying tubes are constructed to bound reachable states. By restricting states and the corresponding inputs in containers with free sizes and a fixed shape, feasible MDs, which are the products of model uncertainty with states and inputs, are restricted into polytopes with free sizes. Then, tubes with different centers and shapes are constructed based on the nominal dynamics and the knowledge of AD and MD. The free sizes of containers allow for a more accurate characterization of MD, while the fixed shape reduces online computational burden, making the proposed method less conservative and computationally efficient. Moreover, the shape of containers is optimized to further reduce conservativeness. Compared to the RMPC method using homothetic tubes, the proposed method has a larger region of attraction while involving fewer decision variables and constraints in the online optimization problem.</description>

      <title>Topology Reconstruction of a Class of Electrical Networks with Limited Boundary Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of recovering the topology and the edge conductance value, as well as characterizing a set of electrical networks that satisfy the limitedly available Thevenin impedance measurements. The measurements are obtained from an unknown electrical network, which is assumed to belong to a class of circular planar passive electrical network. This class of electrical networks consists of R, RL, and RC networks whose edge impedance values are equal, and the absolute value of the real and the imaginary part of the edge impedances are also equal. To solve the topology reconstruction and the set characterization problem, we establish a simple relation between Thevenin impedance and the Laplacian matrix and leverage this relation to get a system of multivariate polynomial equations, whose solution is a set of all electrical networks satisfying the limited available Thevenin's impedance measurements. To confine the search space and generate valid electrical networks, we impose the triangle and Kalmanson's inequality as constraints. The solution to a constrained system of multivariate polynomial equations is a set of reconstructed valid electrical networks. For simple algorithmic solutions, we use Gr\"obner basis polynomials. This paper shows that the triangle and the Kalmanson's inequality holds for general circular planar passive R, RL, and RC electrical networks if certain boundary conditions lie within a convex cone. Numerical examples illustrate the developed topology reconstruction method.</description>

      <title>A Proportional-Integral Model for Fractional Voltage Tripping of Distributed Energy Resources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In regions with high shares of distributed energy resources (DERs), massive disconnection of small-scale DERs in low-voltage distribution grids during disturbances poses a serious threat to power system security. However, modeling this effect in a computationally efficient way remains challenging. This paper proposes a novel proportional-integral aggregate model for predicting the fraction of tripped DERs based on the voltage at the substation connection point. The model effectively captures the cumulative behavior of the system, is simple to implement, and includes seven parameters for undervoltage tripping and seven for overvoltage tripping behavior, each with a distinct physical meaning. We further propose an optimization-based approach to tune the model parameters. Simulation results show significantly more accurate predictions compared to the DER\_A model -- a standard dynamic model for aggregate DER behavior -- even when the latter is optimized, with only a minor increase in model complexity.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Model Predictive Control for Differential-Algebraic Systems towards a Higher Path Accuracy for Physically Coupled Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The physical coupling between robots has the potential to improve the capabilities of multi-robot systems in challenging manufacturing processes. However, the path tracking accuracy of physically coupled robots is not studied adequately, especially considering the uncertain kinematic parameters, the mechanical elasticity, and the built-in controllers of off-the-shelf robots. This paper addresses these issues with a novel differential-algebraic system model which is verified against measurement data from real execution. The uncertain kinematic parameters are estimated online to adapt the model. Consequently, an adaptive model predictive controller is designed as a coordinator between the robots. The controller achieves a path tracking error reduction of 88.6% compared to the state-of-the-art benchmark in the simulation.</description>

      <title>Nuevo modelo para el dimensionamiento de lotes de pedidos en funci\'on del volumen de compra y deterioro temporal de los art\'iculos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This research presents the development of a new simulation model to determine the optimal order lot sizes in Material Requirements Planning, based on purchase volume and the temporal deterioration of items. The scientific novelty lies in the exhaustive enumeration of all supply strategies, considering when and how much raw material and/or inputs to acquire while simultaneously managing multiple factors. The developed model enables obtaining and visualizing all feasible solutions, though a significant challenge arises when dealing with larger planning horizons. The methodology includes formulating a mathematical equation to calculate the total cost of all supply strategies, taking into account quantity discounts and the maximum allowable shelf life of inventory items. The results demonstrate that the model thoroughly explores the entire search space and identifies the optimal solution. Validation is conducted using the tabu search heuristic, a widely recognized optimization technique. While the heuristic converges toward the global minimum, it requires a significantly higher computational load. In contrast, the developed model identifies the global minimum with fewer calculations, showcasing its efficiency and accuracy.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven LQR with Finite-Time Experiments via Extremum-Seeking Policy Iteration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02758v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we address Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) problems through a novel iterative algorithm named EXtremum-seeking Policy iteration LQR (EXP-LQR). The peculiarity of EXP-LQR is that it only needs access to a truncated approximation of the infinite-horizon cost associated to a given policy. Hence, EXP-LQR does not need the direct knowledge of neither the system matrices, cost matrices, and state measurements. In particular, at each iteration, EXP-LQR refines the maintained policy using a truncated LQR cost retrieved by performing finite-time virtual or real experiments in which a perturbed version of the current policy is employed. Such a perturbation is done according to an extremum-seeking mechanism and makes the overall algorithm a time-varying nonlinear system. By using a Lyapunov-based approach exploiting averaging theory, we show that EXP-LQR exponentially converges to an arbitrarily small neighborhood of the optimal gain matrix. We corroborate the theoretical results with numerical simulations involving the control of an induction motor.</description>

      <title>Quaternion-based Unscented Kalman Filter for 6-DoF Vision-based Inertial Navigation in GPS-denied Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the orientation, position, and linear velocity estimation problem of a rigid-body moving in three-dimensional (3D) space with six degrees-of-freedom (6 DoF). The highly nonlinear navigation kinematics are formulated to ensure global representation of the navigation problem. A computationally efficient Quaternion-based Navigation Unscented Kalman Filter (QNUKF) is proposed on $\mathbb{S}^{3}\times\mathbb{R}^{3}\times\mathbb{R}^{3}$ imitating the true nonlinear navigation kinematics and utilize onboard Visual-Inertial Navigation (VIN) units to achieve successful GPS-denied navigation. The proposed QNUKF is designed in discrete form to operate based on the data fusion of photographs garnered by a vision unit (stereo or monocular camera) and information collected by a low-cost inertial measurement unit (IMU). The photographs are processed to extract feature points in 3D space, while the 6-axis IMU supplies angular velocity and accelerometer measurements expressed with respect to the body-frame. Robustness and effectiveness of the proposed QNUKF have been confirmed through experiments on a real-world dataset collected by a drone navigating in 3D and consisting of stereo images and 6-axis IMU measurements. Also, the proposed approach is validated against standard state-of-the-art filtering techniques.

      <title>Kernel-based Koopman approximants for control: Flexible sampling, error analysis, and stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data-driven techniques for analysis, modeling, and control of complex dynamical systems are on the uptake. Koopman theory provides the theoretical foundation for the extremely popular kernel extended dynamic mode decomposition (kEDMD). In this work we propose a novel kEDMD scheme to approximate nonlinear control systems accompanied by an in-depth error analysis. The main features of the method are flexible sampling, regularization-based robustness, and an adroit decomposition into micro and macro grids. In addition, we prove proportionality, i.e., explicit dependence on the distance to the (controlled) equilibrium, of the derived uniform bounds on the full approximation error. Leveraging this key property, we rigorously show that asymptotic stability of the data-driven surrogate (control) system implies asymptotic stability of the original (control) system and vice versa.</description>

      <title>Novel Magnetic Actuation Strategies for Precise Ferrofluid Marble Manipulation in Magnetic Digital Microfluidics: Position Control and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precise manipulation of liquid marbles has significant potential in various applications such as lab-on-a-chip systems, drug delivery, and biotechnology and has been a challenge for researchers. Ferrofluid marble (FM) is a marble with a ferrofluid core that can easily be manipulated by a magnetic field. Although FMs have great potential for accurate positioning and manipulation, these marbles have not been precisely controlled in magnetic digital microfluidics, so far. In this study for the first time, a novel method of magnetic actuation is proposed using a pair of Helmholtz coils and permanent magnets. The governing equations for controlling the FM position are investigated, and it is shown that there are three different strategies for adjusting the applied magnetic force. Then, experiments are conducted to demonstrate the capability of the proposed method. To this aim, different magnetic setups are proposed for manipulating FMs. These setups are compared in terms of energy consumption and tracking ability across various frequencies. The study showcases several applications of precise FM position control, including controllable reciprocal positioning, simultaneous position control of two FMs, the transport of non-magnetic liquid marbles using the FMs, and sample extraction method from the liquid core of the FM.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) has demonstrated effectiveness in a variety of imitation tasks. In this paper, we introduce an IRL framework designed to extract rewarding features from expert trajectories affected by delayed disturbances. Instead of relying on direct observations, our approach employs an efficient off-policy adversarial training framework to derive expert features and recover optimal policies from augmented delayed observations. Empirical evaluations in the MuJoCo environment under diverse delay settings validate the effectiveness of our method. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis showing that recovering expert policies from augmented delayed observations outperforms using direct delayed observations.</description>

      <title>Specification Generation for Neural Networks in Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Specifications - precise mathematical representations of correct domain-specific behaviors - are crucial to guarantee the trustworthiness of computer systems. With the increasing development of neural networks as computer system components, specifications gain more importance as they can be used to regulate the behaviors of these black-box models. Traditionally, specifications are designed by domain experts based on their intuition of correct behavior. However, this is labor-intensive and hence not a scalable approach as computer system applications diversify. We hypothesize that the traditional (aka reference) algorithms that neural networks replace for higher performance can act as effective proxies for correct behaviors of the models, when available. This is because they have been used and tested for long enough to encode several aspects of the trustworthy/correct behaviors in the underlying domain. Driven by our hypothesis, we develop a novel automated framework, SpecTRA to generate specifications for neural networks using references. We formulate specification generation as an optimization problem and solve it with observations of reference behaviors. SpecTRA clusters similar observations into compact specifications. We present specifications generated by SpecTRA for neural networks in adaptive bit rate and congestion control algorithms. Our specifications show evidence of being correct and matching intuition. Moreover, we use our specifications to show several unknown vulnerabilities of the SOTA models for computer systems.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Mobile Target Tracking Using Consensus-Based Estimation with Nearly-Constant-Velocity Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mobile target tracking is crucial in various applications such as surveillance and autonomous navigation. This study presents a decentralized tracking framework utilizing a Consensus-Based Estimation Filter (CBEF) integrated with the Nearly-Constant-Velocity (NCV) model to predict a moving target's state. The framework facilitates agents in a network to collaboratively estimate the target's position by sharing local observations and achieving consensus despite communication constraints and measurement noise. A saturation-based filtering technique is employed to enhance robustness by mitigating the impact of noisy sensor data. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively reduces the Mean Squared Estimation Error (MSEE) over time, indicating improved estimation accuracy and reliability. The findings underscore the effectiveness of the CBEF in decentralized environments, highlighting its scalability and resilience in the presence of uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Soft Adaptive Feet for Legged Robots: An Open-Source Model for Locomotion Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, artificial feet based on soft robotics and under-actuation principles emerged to improve mobility on challenging terrains. This paper presents the application of the MuJoCo physics engine to realize a digital twin of an adaptive soft foot developed for use with legged robots. We release the MuJoCo soft foot digital twin as open source to allow users and researchers to explore new approaches to locomotion. The work includes the system modeling techniques along with the kinematic and dynamic attributes involved. Validation is conducted through a rigorous comparison with bench tests on a physical prototype, replicating these experiments in simulation. Results are evaluated based on sole deformation and contact forces during foot-obstacle interaction. The foot model is subsequently integrated into simulations of the humanoid robot COMAN+, replacing its original flat feet. Results show an improvement in the robot's ability to negotiate small obstacles without altering its control strategy. Ultimately, this study offers a comprehensive modeling approach for adaptive soft feet, supported by qualitative comparisons of bipedal locomotion with state of the art robotic feet.</description>

      <title>Koopman Based Trajectory Optimization with Mixed Boundaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trajectory optimization is a widely used tool in the design and control of dynamical systems. Typically, not only nonlinear dynamics, but also couplings of the initial and final condition through implicit boundary constraints render the optimization problem non-convex. This paper investigates how the Koopman operator framework can be utilized to solve trajectory optimization problems in a (partially) convex fashion. While the Koopman operator has already been successfully employed in model predictive control, the challenge of addressing mixed boundary constraints within the Koopman framework has remained an open question. We first address this issue by explaining why a complete convexification of the problem is not possible. Secondly, we propose a method where we transform the trajectory optimization problem into a bilevel problem in which we are then able to convexify the high-dimensional lower-level problem. This separation yields a low-dimensional upper-level problem, which could be exploited in global optimization algorithms. Lastly, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the method on two example systems: the mathematical pendulum and the compass-gait walker.</description>

      <title>Rotograb: Combining Biomimetic Hands with Industrial Grippers using a Rotating Thumb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of robotic grippers and hands for automation aims to emulate human dexterity without sacrificing the efficiency of industrial grippers. This study introduces Rotograb, a tendon-actuated robotic hand featuring a novel rotating thumb. The aim is to combine the dexterity of human hands with the efficiency of industrial grippers. The rotating thumb enlarges the workspace and allows in-hand manipulation. A novel joint design minimizes movement interference and simplifies kinematics, using a cutout for tendon routing. We integrate teleoperation, using a depth camera for real-time tracking and autonomous manipulation powered by reinforcement learning with proximal policy optimization. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that Rotograb's rotating thumb greatly improves both operational versatility and workspace. It can handle various grasping and manipulation tasks with objects from the YCB dataset, with particularly good results when rotating objects within its grasp. Rotograb represents a notable step towards bridging the capability gap between human hands and industrial grippers. The tendon-routing and thumb-rotating mechanisms allow for a new level of control and dexterity. Integrating teleoperation and autonomous learning underscores Rotograb's adaptability and sophistication, promising substantial advancements in both robotics research and practical applications.</description>

      <title>Testing CPS with Design Assumptions-Based Metamorphic Relations and Genetic Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) software is used to enforce desired behaviours on physical systems. To test the interaction between the CPS software and the system's physics, engineers provide traces of desired physical states and observe traces of the actual physical states. CPS requirements describe how closely the actual physical traces should track the desired traces. These requirements are typically defined for specific, simple input traces such as step or ramp sequences, and thus are not applicable to arbitrary inputs. This limits the availability of oracles for CPSs. Our recent work proposes an approach to testing CPS using control-theoretical design assumptions instead of requirements. This approach circumvents the oracle problem by leveraging the control-theoretical guarantees that are provided when the design assumptions are satisfied. To address the test case generation and oracle problems, researchers have proposed metamorphic testing, which is based on the study of relations across tests, i.e., metamorphic relations (MRs). In this work, we define MRs based on the design assumptions and explore combinations of these MRs using genetic programming to generate CPS test cases. This enables the generation of CPS input traces with potentially arbitrary shapes, together with associated expected output traces. We use the deviation from the expected output traces to guide the generation of input traces that falsify the MRs. Our experiment results show that the MR-falsification provides engineers with new information, helping them identify passed and failed test cases. Furthermore, we show that the generation of traces that falsify the MRs is a non-trivial problem, which is successfully addressed by our genetic search.</description>

      <title>Multi-Momentum Observer Contact Estimation for Bipedal Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As bipedal robots become more and more popular in commercial and industrial settings, the ability to control them with a high degree of reliability is critical. To that end, this paper considers how to accurately estimate which feet are currently in contact with the ground so as to avoid improper control actions that could jeopardize the stability of the robot. Additionally, modern algorithms for estimating the position and orientation of a robot's base frame rely heavily on such contact mode estimates. Dedicated contact sensors on the feet can be used to estimate this contact mode, but these sensors are prone to noise, time delays, damage/yielding from repeated impacts with the ground, and are not available on every robot. To overcome these limitations, we propose a momentum observer based method for contact mode estimation that does not rely on such contact sensors. Often, momentum observers assume that the robot's base frame can be treated as an inertial frame. However, since many humanoids' legs represent a significant portion of the overall mass, the proposed method instead utilizes multiple simultaneous dynamic models. Each of these models assumes a different contact condition. A given contact assumption is then used to constrain the full dynamics in order to avoid assuming that either the body is an inertial frame or that a fully accurate estimate of body velocity is known. The (dis)agreement between each model's estimates and measurements is used to determine which contact mode is most likely using a Markov-style fusion method. The proposed method produces contact detection accuracy of up to 98.44% with a low noise simulation and 77.12% when utilizing data collect on the Sarcos Guardian XO robot (a hybrid humanoid/exoskeleton).</description>

      <title>Single and Multi-Objective Real-Time Optimisation of an Industrial Injection Moulding Process via a Bayesian Adaptive Design of Experiment Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12077v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Minimising cycle time without inducing quality defects is a major challenge in the injection moulding (IM). Design of Experiment methods (DoE) have been widely studied for optimisation of the IM, however existing methods have limitations, including the need for a large number of experiments and a pre-determined search space. Bayesian adaptive design of experiment (ADoE) is an iterative process where the results of the previous experiments are used to make an informed selection for the next design. In this study, for the first time, an experimental ADoE approach, based on Bayesian optimisation, was developed in injection moulding using process and sensor data to optimise the quality and cycle time in real-time. A novel approach for the real-time characterisation of post-production shrinkage was introduced, utilising in-mould sensor data on temperature differential during part cooling. This characterisation approach was verified by post-production metrology results.
  A single and multi-objective optimisation of the cycle time and temperature differential in an injection moulded component is proposed. The multi-objective optimisation techniques, composite desirability function and Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) using Response Surface Methodology (RSM) model, are compared with the real-time novel ADoE approach. ADoE achieved almost a 50% reduction in the number of experiments required for the single optimisation of temperature differential, and an almost 30% decrease for the optimisation of temperature differential and cycle time together compared to composite desirability function and NSGA-II. Also, the optimal settings identified by ADoE for multiobjective optimisation were similar to the selected Pareto optimal solution found by the NSGA-II.</description>

      <title>An L-BFGS-B approach for linear and nonlinear system identification under $\ell_1$ and group-Lasso regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03827v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a very efficient numerical method based on the L-BFGS-B algorithm for identifying linear and nonlinear discrete-time state-space models, possibly under $\ell_1$ and group-Lasso regularization for reducing model complexity. For the identification of linear models, we show that, compared to classical linear subspace methods, the approach often provides better results, is much more general in terms of the loss and regularization terms used (such as penalties for enforcing system stability), and is also more stable from a numerical point of view. The proposed method not only enriches the existing set of linear system identification tools but can also be applied to identifying a very broad class of parametric nonlinear state-space models, including recurrent neural networks. We illustrate the approach on synthetic and experimental datasets and apply it to solve a challenging industrial robot benchmark for nonlinear multi-input/multi-output system identification. A Python implementation of the proposed identification method is available in the package jax-sysid, available at https://github.com/bemporad/jax-sysid.</description>

      <title>Discrete-Time Conewise Linear Systems with Finitely Many Switches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12530v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate discrete-time conewise linear systems (CLS) for which all the solutions exhibit a finite number of switches. By switches, we mean transitions of a solution from one cone to another. Our interest in this class of CLS comes from the optimization-based control of an insulin infusion model for which the fact that solutions switch finitely many times appears to be key to establish the global exponential stability of the origin. The stability analysis of this class of CLS greatly simplifies compared to general CLS as all solutions eventually exhibit linear dynamics. The main challenge is to characterize CLS satisfying this finite number of switches property. We first present general conditions in terms of set intersections for this purpose. To ease the testing of these conditions, we translate them as a non-negativity test of linear forms using Farkas lemma. As a result, the problem reduces to verify the non-negativity of a single solution to an auxiliary linear discrete-time system. Interestingly, this property differs from the classical non-negativity problem, where any solution to a system must remain non-negative (component-wise) for any non-negative initial condition, and thus requires novel tools to test it. We finally illustrate the relevance of the presented results on the optimal insulin infusion problem.</description>

Abstract: We present a method to overapproximate forward stochastic reach sets of discrete-time, stochastic nonlinear systems with interval geometry. This is made possible by extending the theory of mixed-monotone systems to incorporate stochastic orders, and a concentration inequality result that lower-bounds the probability the state resides within an interval through a monotone mapping. Then, we present an algorithm to compute the overapproximations of forward reachable set and the probability the state resides within it. We present our approach on two aerospace examples to show its efficacy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11823v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In-wheel drive (IWD) systems enhance the responsiveness, traction, and maintenance efficiency of vehicles by enabling each wheel to operate independently. This paper proposes a novel robust torque-observed valve-based control (RTOVC) framework to address velocity tracking in hydraulic IWDs that actuate heavy-duty wheeled mobile robots (HWMRs), considering such challenges as wheel slippages, sensor limitations, rough terrains, and modeling uncertainties. To overcome the sensor-dependent control systems associated with the closed-loop torque/pressure in hydraulic IWD-actuated HWMRs, a robust observer network based on an adaptive barrier Lyapunov function (BLF) is proposed to estimate the required in-wheel motor torque to track the velocity references. Then, another adaptive BLF for valve control signals is employed to modulate the hydraulic fluid to generate the estimated torque for each IWD. The RTOVC strategy ensures user-defined safety within the logarithmic BLF framework by constraining the valve control signal, actual velocity, velocity tracking error, and torque of each hydraulic IWD in an HWMR to avoid exceeding specified limits. Despite its safety constraints, external disturbances, and modeling uncertainties, robustness and uniformly exponential stability of the RTOVC-applied hydraulic IWD mechanism are ensured in HWMRs. Experimental investigations using a 6,500-kg HWMR, actuated by four independent IWDs under intense disturbances and safety-defined constraints, validate the performance of the RTOVC.</description>

Abstract: PC-Gym is an open-source tool for developing and evaluating reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms in chemical process control. It features environments that simulate various chemical processes, incorporating nonlinear dynamics, disturbances, and constraints. The tool includes customizable constraint handling, disturbance generation, reward function design, and enables comparison of RL algorithms against Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) across different scenarios. Case studies demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in evaluating RL approaches for systems like continuously stirred tank reactors, multistage extraction processes, and crystallization reactors. The results reveal performance gaps between RL algorithms and NMPC oracles, highlighting areas for improvement and enabling benchmarking. By providing a standardized platform, PC-Gym aims to accelerate research at the intersection of machine learning, control, and process systems engineering. By connecting theoretical RL advances with practical industrial process control applications, offering researchers a tool for exploring data-driven control solutions.</description>

Abstract: Autonomous robots must utilize rich sensory data to make safe control decisions. To process this data, compute-constrained robots often require assistance from remote computation, or the cloud, that runs compute-intensive deep neural network perception or control models. However, this assistance comes at the cost of a time delay due to network latency, resulting in past observations being used in the cloud to compute the control commands for the present robot state. Such communication delays could potentially lead to the violation of essential safety properties, such as collision avoidance. This paper develops methods to ensure the safety of robots operated over communication networks with stochastic latency. To do so, we use tools from formal verification to construct a shield, i.e., a run-time monitor, that provides a list of safe actions for any delayed sensory observation, given the expected and maximum network latency. Our shield is minimally intrusive and enables networked robots to satisfy key safety constraints, expressed as temporal logic specifications, with desired probability. We demonstrate our approach on a real F1/10th autonomous vehicle that navigates in indoor environments and transmits rich LiDAR sensory data over congested WiFi links.</description>

Abstract: This study confronts the growing challenges of energy consumption and the depletion of energy resources, particularly in the context of smart buildings. As the demand for energy increases alongside the necessity for efficient building maintenance, it becomes imperative to explore innovative energy management solutions. We present a comprehensive review of Internet of Things (IoT)-based frameworks aimed at smart city energy management, highlighting the pivotal role of IoT devices in addressing these issues due to their compactness, sensing, measurement, and computing capabilities. Our review methodology encompasses a thorough analysis of existing literature on IoT architectures and frameworks for intelligent energy management applications. We focus on systems that not only collect and store data but also support intelligent analysis for monitoring, controlling, and enhancing system efficiency. Additionally, we examine the potential for these frameworks to serve as platforms for the development of third-party applications, thereby extending their utility and adaptability. The findings from our review indicate that IoT-based frameworks offer significant potential to reduce energy consumption and environmental impact in smart buildings. Through the adoption of intelligent mechanisms and solutions, these frameworks facilitate effective energy management, leading to improved system efficiency and sustainability. Considering these findings, we recommend further exploration and adoption of IoT-based wireless sensing systems in smart buildings as a strategic approach to energy management. Our review underscores the importance of incorporating intelligent analysis and enabling the development of third-party applications within the IoT framework to efficiently meet the evolving energy demands and maintenance challenges</description>

      <title>User Experience Evaluation of AR Assisted Industrial Maintenance and Support Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17348v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The paper introduces an innovative approach to industrial maintenance leveraging augmented reality (AR) technology, focusing on enhancing the user experience and efficiency. The shift from traditional to proactive maintenance strategies underscores the significance of maintenance in industrial systems. The proposed solution integrates AR interfaces, particularly through Head-Mounted Display (HMD) devices, to provide expert personnel-aided decision support for maintenance technicians, with the association of Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions. The study explores the user experience aspect of AR interfaces in a simulated industrial environment, aiming to improve the maintenance processes' intuitiveness and effectiveness. Evaluation metrics such as the NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX) and the System Usability Scale (SUS) are employed to assess the usability, performance, and workload implications of the AR maintenance system. Additionally, the paper discusses the technical implementation, methodology, and results of experiments conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed solution.</description>

      <title>Identifiable Representation and Model Learning for Latent Dynamic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17882v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning identifiable representations and models from low-level observations is helpful for an intelligent spacecraft to complete downstream tasks reliably. For temporal observations, to ensure that the data generating process is provably inverted, most existing works either assume the noise variables in the dynamic mechanisms are (conditionally) independent or require that the interventions can directly affect each latent variable. However, in practice, the relationship between the exogenous inputs/interventions and the latent variables may follow some complex deterministic mechanisms. In this work, we study the problem of identifiable representation and model learning for latent dynamic systems. The key idea is to use an inductive bias inspired by controllable canonical forms, which are sparse and input-dependent by definition. We prove that, for linear and affine nonlinear latent dynamic systems with sparse input matrices, it is possible to identify the latent variables up to scaling and determine the dynamic models up to some simple transformations. The results have the potential to provide some theoretical guarantees for developing more trustworthy decision-making and control methods for intelligent spacecrafts.</description>
