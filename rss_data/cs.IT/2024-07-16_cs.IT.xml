      <title>Infinite families of optimal and minimal codes over rings using simplicial complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, several infinite families of codes over the extension of non-unital non-commutative rings are constructed utilizing general simplicial complexes. Thanks to the special structure of the defining sets, the principal parameters of these codes are characterized. Specially, when the employed simplicial complexes are generated by a single maximal element, we determine their Lee weight distributions completely. Furthermore, by considering the Gray image codes and the corresponding subfield-like codes, numerous of linear codes over $\mathbb{F}_q$ are also obtained, where $q$ is a prime power. Certain conditions are given to ensure the above linear codes are (Hermitian) self-orthogonal in the case of $q=2,3,4$. It is noteworthy that most of the derived codes over $\mathbb{F}_q$ satisfy the Ashikhmin-Barg's condition for minimality. Besides, we obtain two infinite families of distance-optimal codes over $\mathbb{F}_q$ with respect to the Griesmer bound.</description>

      <title>Resource Management for Low-latency Cooperative Fine-tuning of Foundation Models at the Network Edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of large-scale foundation models (FoMo's) that can perform human-like intelligence motivates their deployment at the network edge for devices to access state-of-the-art artificial intelligence. For better user experiences, the pre-trained FoMo's need to be adapted to specialized downstream tasks through fine-tuning techniques. To transcend a single device's memory and computation limitations, we advocate multi-device cooperation within the device-edge cooperative fine-tuning (DEFT) paradigm, where edge devices cooperate to simultaneously optimize different parts of fine-tuning parameters within a FoMo. However, the parameter blocks reside at different depths within a FoMo architecture, leading to varied computation latency-and-memory cost due to gradient backpropagation-based calculations. The heterogeneous on-device computation and memory capacities and channel conditions necessitate an integrated communication-and-computation allocation of local computation loads and communication resources to achieve low-latency (LoLa) DEFT. To this end, we consider the depth-ware DEFT block allocation problem. The involved optimal block-device matching is tackled by the proposed low-complexity Cutting-RecoUNting-CHecking (CRUNCH) algorithm, which is designed by exploiting the monotone-increasing property between block depth and computation latency-and-memory cost. Next, the joint bandwidth-and-block allocation makes the problem more sophisticated. We observe a splittable Lagrangian expression through the transformation and analysis of the original problem, where the variables indicating device involvement are introduced. Then, the dual ascent method is employed to tackle this problem iteratively. Through extensive experiments conducted on the GLUE benchmark, our results demonstrate significant latency reduction achievable by LoLa DEFT for fine-tuning a RoBERTa model.</description>

      <title>Fast and Provable Simultaneous Blind Super-Resolution and Demixing for Point Source Signals: Scaled Gradient Descent without Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the problem of simultaneously recovering a sequence of point source signals from observations limited to the low-frequency end of the spectrum of their summed convolution, where the point spread functions (PSFs) are unknown. By exploiting the low-dimensional structures of the signals and PSFs, we formulate this as a low-rank matrix demixing problem. To solve this, we develop a scaled gradient descent method without balancing regularization. We establish theoretical guarantees under mild conditions, demonstrating that our method, with spectral initialization, converges to the ground truth at a linear rate, independent of the condition number of the underlying data matrices. Numerical experiments indicate that our approach is competitive with existing convex methods in terms of both recovery accuracy and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Conditional Entropies of k-Deletion/Insertion Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The channel output entropy of a transmitted sequence is the entropy of the possible channel outputs and similarly the channel input entropy of a received sequence is the entropy of all possible transmitted sequences. The goal of this work is to study these entropy values for the k-deletion, k-insertion channels, where exactly k symbols are deleted, inserted in the transmitted sequence, respectively. If all possible sequences are transmitted with the same probability then studying the input and output entropies is equivalent. For both the 1-deletion and 1-insertion channels, it is proved that among all sequences with a fixed number of runs, the input entropy is minimized for sequences with a skewed distribution of their run lengths and it is maximized for sequences with a balanced distribution of their run lengths. Among our results, we establish a conjecture by Atashpendar et al. which claims that for the 1-deletion channel, the input entropy is maximized by the alternating sequences over all binary sequences. This conjecture is also verified for the 2-deletion channel, where it is proved that constant sequences with a single run minimize the input entropy.</description>

      <title>Optimal linear codes with few weights from simplicial complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, constructions of optimal linear codes from simplicial complexes have attracted much attention and some related nice works were presented. Let $q$ be a prime power. In this paper, by using the simplicial complexes of ${\mathbb F}_{q}^m$ with one single maximal element, we construct four families of linear codes over the ring ${\mathbb F}_{q}+u{\mathbb F}_{q}$ ($u^2=0$), which generalizes the results of [IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 66(6):3657-3663, 2020]. The parameters and Lee weight distributions of these four families of codes are completely determined. Most notably, via the Gray map, we obtain several classes of optimal linear codes over ${\mathbb F}_{q}$, including (near) Griesmer codes and distance-optimal codes.</description>

      <title>Design and Optimization on Successive RIS-assisted Multi-hop Wireless Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As an emerging wireless communication technology, reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has become a basic choice for providing signal coverage services in scenarios with dense obstacles or long tunnels through multi-hop configurations. Conventional works of literature mainly focus on alternating optimization or single-beam calculation in RIS phase configuration, which is limited in considering energy efficiency, and often suffers from inaccurate channel state information (CSI), poor convergence, and high computational complexity. This paper addresses the design and optimization challenges for successive RIS-assisted multi-hop systems. Specifically, we establish a general model for multi-hop communication based on the relationship between the input and output electric fields within each RIS. Meanwhile, we derive the half-power beamwidth of the RIS-reflected beams, considering the beam direction. Leveraging these models and derivations, we propose deployment optimization and beam optimization strategies for multi-hop systems, which feature high aperture efficiency and significant gains in signal power. Simulation and prototype experiment results validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed systems and methods.</description>

      <title>Product and Ratio of Two $\alpha-\kappa-\mu$ Shadowed Random Variables and its Application to Wireless Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work studies the product and ratio statistics of independent and non-identically distributed (i.n.i.d) $ \alpha-\kappa - \mu $ shadowed random variables. We derive the series expression for the probability density function (PDF), cumulative distribution function (CDF), and moment generating function (MGF) of the product and ratio of i.n.i.d $ \alpha - \kappa - \mu $ shadowed random variables. We then give the single integral representation for the derived PDF expressions. Further, as application examples, 1) outage probability has been derived for cascaded wireless systems, and 2) physical-layer security metrics like secrecy outage probability and strictly positive secrecy capacity are derived for the classic three-node model with $\alpha-\kappa-\mu$ shadowed fading. Next, we discuss an intelligent reflecting surface-assisted communication system over $\alpha-\kappa-\mu$ shadowed fading.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work considers a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system with RIS spatial correlation and electromagnetic interference (EMI). We propose a two-phase channel estimation scheme with fractional power control-aided pilot assignment to improve the estimation accuracy and system performance of RIS-aided cell-free massive MIMO systems. Additionally, we derive the closed-form expressions of the downlink spectral efficiency (SE) with conjugate beamforming to evaluate the impact of EMI among RIS elements on the system performance. Numerical results validate that the proposed two-phase scheme can compensate for the performance degradation caused by EMI in terms of estimation accuracy and downlink SE. Moreover, the benefits of introducing RISs and increasing access points (APs) are illustrated.</description>

      <title>Latency Minimization for IRS-enhanced Wideband MEC Networks with Practical Reflection Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) has been considered as an efficient way to boost the computation capability of mobile edge computing (MEC) system, especially when the communication links is blocked or the communication signal is weak. However, most existing works are restricted to narrow-band channel and ideal IRS reflection model, which is not practical and may lead to significant performance degradation in realistic systems. To further exploit the benefits of IRS in MEC system, we consider an IRS-enhanced wideband MEC system with practical IRS reflection model. With the aim of minimizing the weighted latency of all devices, the offloading data volume, edge computing resource, BS's receiving vector, and IRS passive beamforming are jointly optimized. Since the formulated problem is non-convex, we employ the block coordinate descent (BCD) technique to decouple it into two subproblems for alternatively optimizing computing and communication settings. The effectiveness and convergence of the proposed algorithm are validate via numerical analyses. In addition, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can achieve lower latency compared to that based on the ideal IRS reflection model, which confirms the necessary of considering practical model when designing an IRS-enhanced wideband MEC system.</description>

      <title>Multibeam Satellite Communications with Massive MIMO: Asymptotic Performance Analysis and Design Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To achieve high performance without substantial overheads associated with channel state information (CSI) of ground users, we consider a fixed-beam precoding approach, where a satellite forms multiple fixed-beams without relying on CSI, then select a suitable user set for each beam. Upon this precoding method, we put forth a satellite equipped with massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO), by which inter-beam interference is efficiently mitigated by narrowing corresponding beam width. By modeling the ground users' locations via a Poisson point process, we rigorously analyze the achievable performance of the presented multibeam satellite system. In particular, we investigate the asymptotic scaling laws that reveal the interplay between the user density, the number of beams, and the number of antennas. Our analysis offers critical design insights for the multibeam satellite with massive MIMO: i) If the user density scales in power with the number of antennas, the considered precoding can achieve a linear fraction of the optimal rate in the asymptotic regime. ii) A certain additional scaling factor for the user density is needed as the number of beams increases to maintain the asymptotic optimality.</description>

      <title>Fluid Antenna Multiple Access Assisted Integrated Data and Energy Transfer: Outage and Multiplexing Gain Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluid antenna multiple access (FAMA) exploits the spatial opportunities in wireless channels to overcome multiuser interference by position (a.k.a.~port) switching, which can achieve better performance compared to traditional fixed multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. Additionally, integrated data and energy transfer (IDET) is capable of providing both wireless data transfer (WDT) and wireless energy transfer (WET) services towards low-power devices. In this paper, a FAMA-assisted IDET system is investigated, where a base station (BS) equipped with $N$ fixed antennas provides dedicated IDET services towards $N$ user equipments (UEs). Each UE is equipped with a single fluid antenna, while the power splitting (PS) approach is conceived for coordinating WDT and WET. The outage probabilities of both WDT and WET are derived and approximated into closed-forms, where the fluid antenna (FA) at each UE selects the optimal port to achieve the maximum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) or the energy harvesting power (EHP). The IDET outage probabilities are defined and subsequently derived and approximated into closed-forms. Further, multiplexing gains of the proposed system are defined and analyzed to evaluate the performace. Numerical results validate the theoretical analysis, while also illustrate that the trade-off is achieved between WDT and WET performance by exploiting different port selection strategies. Furthermore, the number of UEs should be optimized to achieve better IDET performance of the system.</description>

      <title>Visible Light Positioning with Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces under Mismatched Orientations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate localization can be performed in visible light systems in non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios by utilizing intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs), which are commonly in the form of mirror arrays with adjustable orientations. When signals transmitted from light emitting diodes (LEDs) are reflected from IRSs and collected by a receiver, the position of the receiver can be estimated based on power measurements by utilizing the known parameters of the LEDs and IRSs. Since the orientation vectors of IRS elements (mirrors) cannot be adjusted perfectly in practice, it is important to evaluate the effects of mismatches between desired and true orientations of IRS elements. In this study, we derive the misspecified Cramer-Rao lower bound (MCRB) and the mismatched maximum likelihood (MML) estimator for specifying the estimation performance and the lower bound in the presence of mismatches in IRS orientations. We also provide comparisons with the conventional maximum likelihood (ML) estimator and the CRB in absence of orientation mismatches for quantifying the effects of mismatches. It is shown that orientation mismatches can result in significant degradation in localization accuracy at high signal-to-noise ratios.</description>

      <title>On the Spectral Efficiency of Multi-user Holographic MIMO Uplink Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With antenna spacing much less than half a wavelength in confined space, holographic multiple-input multiple-output (HMIMO) technology presents a promising frontier in next-generation mobile communication. We delve into the research of the multi-user uplink transmission with both the base station and the users equipped with holographic planar arrays. To begin, we construct an HMIMO channel model utilizing electromagnetic field equations, accompanied by a colored noise model that accounts for both electromagnetic interference and hardware noise. Since this model is continuous, we approximate it within a finite-dimensional space spanned by Fourier space series, which can be defined as the communication mode functions. We show that this channel model samples Green's function in the wavenumber domain in different communication modes. Subsequently, we tackle the challenging task of maximizing the spectral efficiency (SE) of the system, which involves optimizing the continuous current density function (CDF) for each user. Using the aforementioned approximation model, we transform the optimization variables into expansion coefficients of the CDFs on a finite-dimensional space, for which we propose an iterative water-filling algorithm. Simulation results illustrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm in enhancing the system SE and show the influence of the colored noise and the system parameters on the SE.</description>

      <title>On the nature of information -- an evolutionary perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This Perspective explores the origins and persistence of recurrent structures and patterns throughout the known Universe. We start with a first fundamental question: 1. Considering that all information consists of patterns in physical structure but not all physical patterns constitute information, what is the fundamental relation between these two? We first explore the materialistic nature of structures and information, detailing how they can form through spontaneous or templated processes and evolve into complex structures, including self-replicators. We posit that all recurring structures emerge either spontaneously de novo or based on underlying information. A main implication is that all information must be understood as both a product and a driver of evolution. We further observe that the three carriers of information underpin the emergence of three main layers of self-organisation: genes coded in DNA for the biological layer, ideas stored in neural structure for the cultural layer, and records written on innate objects for the civilisation layer. This gives rise to two additional questions, which we subsequently address: 2. What can we anticipate about the future development of self-organizing layers given the role of information in their emergence? 3. What is the universality of information and its evolution throughout the Universe? This manuscript aims to offer a fresh perspective and a universal framework for information and the origin of structures by extending and unifying concepts from physics, biology, and information theory.</description>

      <title>Fast and Robust Phase Retrieval via Deep Expectation-Consistent Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately recovering images from phaseless measurements is a challenging and long-standing problem. In this work, we present "deepECpr," which combines expectation-consistent (EC) approximation with deep denoising networks to surpass state-of-the-art phase-retrieval methods in both speed and accuracy. In addition to applying EC in a non-traditional manner, deepECpr includes a novel stochastic damping scheme that is inspired by recent diffusion methods. Like existing phase-retrieval methods based on plug-and-play priors, regularization by denoising, or diffusion, deepECpr iterates a denoising stage with a measurement-exploitation stage. But unlike existing methods, deepECpr requires far fewer denoiser calls. We compare deepECpr to the state-of-the-art prDeep (Metzler et al., 2018), Deep-ITA (Wang et al., 2020), and Diffusion Posterior Sampling (Chung et al., 2023) methods for noisy phase-retrieval of color, natural, and unnatural grayscale images on oversampled-Fourier and coded-diffraction-pattern measurements and find improvements in both PSNR and SSIM with 5x fewer denoiser calls.</description>

Abstract: This is a chapter in a forthcoming book on completely regular codes in distance regular graphs. The chapter provides an overview, and some original results, on codes in distance regular graphs which admit symmetries via a permutation group acting on the vertices of the graph. The strongest notion of completely transitive codes is developed, as well as the more general notion of neighbour-transitive codes. The graphs considered are the Hamming, Johnson, and Kneser graphs and their q-analogues, as well as some graphs related to incidence structures.</description>

      <title>Popular News Always Compete for the User's Attention! POPK: Mitigating Popularity Bias via a Temporal-Counterfactual</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In news recommendation systems, reducing popularity bias is essential for delivering accurate and diverse recommendations. This paper presents POPK, a new method that uses temporal-counterfactual analysis to mitigate the influence of popular news articles. By asking, "What if, at a given time $t$, a set of popular news articles were competing for the user's attention to be clicked?", POPK aims to improve recommendation accuracy and diversity. We tested POPK on three different language datasets (Japanese, English, and Norwegian) and found that it successfully enhances traditional methods. POPK offers flexibility for customization to enhance either accuracy or diversity, alongside providing distinct ways of measuring popularity. We argue that popular news articles always compete for attention, even if they are not explicitly present in the user's impression list. POPK systematically eliminates the implicit influence of popular news articles during each training step. We combine counterfactual reasoning with a temporal approach to adjust the negative sample space, refining understanding of user interests. Our findings underscore how POPK effectively enhances the accuracy and diversity of recommended articles while also tailoring the approach to specific needs.</description>

      <title>Near-Field User Localization and Channel Estimation for XL-MIMO Systems: Fundamentals, Recent Advances, and Outlooks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extremely large-scale multiple-input multipleoutput (XL-MIMO) is believed to be a cornerstone of sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks. XL-MIMO uses more antennas to both achieve unprecedented spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs) and exploit new electromagnetic (EM) phenomena occurring in the radiative near-field. The near-field effects provide the XL-MIMO array with depth perception, enabling precise localization and spatially multiplexing jointly in the angle and distance domains. This article delineates the distinctions between near-field and far-field propagation, highlighting the unique EM characteristics introduced by having large antenna arrays. It thoroughly examines the challenges these new near-field characteristics pose for user localization and channel estimation and provides a comprehensive review of new algorithms developed to address them. The article concludes by identifying critical future research directions.</description>

      <title>CoSTAP: Clutter Suppression in Co-Pulsing FDA-STAP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Range-dependent clutter suppression poses significant challenges in airborne frequency diverse array (FDA) radar, where resolving range ambiguity is particularly difficult. Traditional space-time adaptive processing (STAP) techniques used for clutter mitigation in FDA radars operate in the physical domain defined by first-order statistics. In this paper, unlike conventional airborne uniform FDA, we introduce a space-time-range adaptive processing (STRAP) method to exploit second-order statistics for clutter suppression in the newly proposed co-pulsing FDA radar. This approach utilizes co-prime frequency offsets (FOs) across the elements of a co-prime array, with each element transmitting at a non-uniform co-prime pulse repetition interval (C-Cube). By incorporating second-order statistics from the co-array domain, the co-pulsing STRAP or CoSTAP benefits from increased degrees of freedom (DoFs) and low computational cost while maintaining strong clutter suppression capabilities. However, this approach also introduces significant computational burdens in the coarray domain. To address this, we propose an approximate method for three-dimensional (3-D) clutter subspace estimation using discrete prolate spheroidal sequences (DPSS) to balance clutter suppression performance and computational cost. We first develop a 3-D clutter rank evaluation criterion to exploit the geometry of 3-D clutter in a general scenario. Following this, we present a clutter subspace rejection method to mitigate the effects of interference such as jammer. Compared to existing FDA-STAP algorithms, our proposed CoSTAP method offers superior clutter suppression performance, lower computational complexity, and enhanced robustness to interference. Numerical experiments validate the effectiveness and advantages of our method.</description>

      <title>Mapping the Scholarship of Dark Pattern Regulation: A Systematic Review of Concepts, Regulatory Paradigms, and Solutions from an Interdisciplinary Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark patterns, design tricks used on online interfaces to manipulate users decision-making process, have raised public concerns. However, research on regulation of dark pattern remains underdeveloped and scattered, particularly regarding scholars views on the concept, regulatory paradigms, and solutions. Following PRISMA guidelines, this paper systematically reviews the formats and content of regulatory discussions on dark patterns from the interdisciplinary scholarship of Law and Human-Computer Interaction. A total of 65 studies were analysed through content and thematic analysis. This study synthesises the unique trends and characteristics of legal scholarship on dark patterns, identifying five root problems and triple layered harms. It critiques current regulations in terms of legal theories and sectoral legislations, highlighting their inadequacies in addressing dark patterns. The paper also critically examines existing proposed solutions, including paradigmatic shifts in legal doctrines, refinements to existing frameworks, technical design-embedded solutions, and accountability measures for design practices. This research critically discusses the current barriers to effective dark pattern regulations and explores promising regulatory solutions. The difficulty in identifying the normative nature of various forms of dark patterns, in identifying evident and actionable harm, and the expanding scope of dark patterns connotation inherently hinders effective regulation. However, technical design-embedded solutions, accountability frameworks, and practical design guidelines offer potential routes for more proactive regulation, while legal pluralism stands as a promising macro-level change in regulatory paradigms for dark pattern regulation.</description>

      <title>Stiefel manifolds and upper bounds for spherical codes and packings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We improve upper bounds on sphere packing densities and sizes of spherical codes in high dimensions. In particular, we prove that the maximal sphere packing densities $\delta_n$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ satisfy \[\delta_n\leq \frac{1+o(1)}{e}\cdot \delta^{\text{KL}}_{n}\] for large $n$, where $\delta^{\text{KL}}_{n}$ is the best bound on $\delta_n$ obtained essentially by Kabatyanskii and Levenshtein from the 1970s with improvements over the years. We also obtain the same improvement factor for the maximal size $M(n,\theta)$ of $\theta$-spherical codes in $S^{n-1}$: for angles $0&lt;\theta&lt;\theta'\leq\frac{\pi}{2}$, \[M(n,\theta)\leq \frac{1+o(1)}{e}\cdot \frac{M_{\text{Lev}}(n-1,\theta')}{\mu_n(\theta,\theta')}\] for large $n$, where $\mu_n(\theta,\theta')$ is the mass of the spherical cap in the unit sphere $S^{n-1}$ of radius $\frac{\sin(\theta/2)}{\sin(\theta'/2)}$, and $M_{\text{Lev}}(n-1,\theta')$ is Levenshtein's upper bound on $M(n-1,\theta')$ when applying the Delsarte linear programming method to Levenshtein's optimal polynomials. In fact, we prove that there are no analytic losses in our arguments and that the constant $\frac{1}{e}=0.367...$ is optimal for the class of functions considered. Our results also show that the improvement factor does not depend on the special angle $\theta^*=62.997...^{\circ}$, explaining the numerics in arXiv:2001.00185. In the spherical codes case, the above inequality improves the Kabatyanskii--Levenshtein bound by a factor of $0.2304...$ on geometric average. Along the way, we construct a general class of functions using Stiefel manifolds for which we prove general results and study the improvement factors obtained from them in various settings.and study the improvement factors obtained from them in various settings.</description>

Abstract: To assess the quality of a probabilistic prediction for stochastic dynamical systems (SDSs), scoring rules assign a numerical score based on the predictive distribution and the measured state. In this paper, we propose an $\epsilon$-logarithm score that generalizes the celebrated logarithm score by considering a neighborhood with radius $\epsilon$. We characterize the probabilistic predictability of an SDS by optimizing the expected score over the space of probability measures. We show how the probabilistic predictability is quantitatively determined by the neighborhood radius, the differential entropies of process noises, and the system dimension. Given any predictor, we provide approximations for the expected score with an error of scale $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon)$. In addition to the expected score, we also analyze the asymptotic behaviors of the score on individual trajectories. Specifically, we prove that the score on a trajectory can converge to the expected score when the process noises are independent and identically distributed. Moreover, the convergence speed against the trajectory length $T$ is of scale $\mathcal{O}(T^{-\frac{1}{2}})$ in the sense of probability. Finally, numerical examples are given to elaborate the results.</description>

      <title>Linearized Reed-Solomon Codes with Support-Constrained Generator Matrix and Applications in Multi-Source Network Coding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.07991v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Linearized Reed-Solomon (LRS) codes are evaluation codes based on skew polynomials. They achieve the Singleton bound in the sum-rank metric and therefore are known as maximum sum-rank distance (MSRD) codes. In this work, we give necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of MSRD codes with a support-constrained generator matrix. The conditions on the support constraints are identical to those for MDS codes and MRD codes. The required field size for an $[n,k]_{q^m}$ LRS codes with support-constrained generator matrix is $q\geq \ell+1$ and $m\geq \max_{l\in[\ell]}\{k-1+\log_qk, n_l\}$, where $\ell$ is the number of blocks and $n_l$ is the size of the $l$-th block. The special cases of the result coincide with the known results for Reed-Solomon codes and Gabidulin codes. For the support constraints that do not satisfy the necessary conditions, we derive the maximum sum-rank distance of a code whose generator matrix fulfills the constraints. Such a code can be constructed from a subcode of an LRS code with a sufficiently large field size. Moreover, as an application in network coding, the conditions can be used as constraints in an integer programming problem to design distributed LRS codes for a distributed multi-source network.</description>

      <title>Matrix Inference in Growing Rank Regimes</title>

Abstract: The inference of a large symmetric signal-matrix $\mathbf{S} \in \mathbb{R}^{N\times N}$ corrupted by additive Gaussian noise, is considered for two regimes of growth of the rank $M$ as a function of $N$. For sub-linear ranks $M=\Theta(N^\alpha)$ with $\alpha\in(0,1)$ the mutual information and minimum mean-square error (MMSE) are derived for two classes of signal-matrices: (a) $\mathbf{S}=\mathbf{X}\mathbf{X}^\intercal$ with entries of $\mathbf{X}\in\mathbb{R}^{N\times M}$ independent identically distributed; (b) $\mathbf{S}$ sampled from a rotationally invariant distribution. Surprisingly, the formulas match the rank-one case. Two efficient algorithms are explored and conjectured to saturate the MMSE when no statistical-to-computational gap is present: (1) Decimation Approximate Message Passing; (2) a spectral algorithm based on a Rotation Invariant Estimator. For linear ranks $M=\Theta(N)$ the mutual information is rigorously derived for signal-matrices from a rotationally invariant distribution. Close connections with scalar inference in free probability are uncovered, which allow to deduce a simple formula for the MMSE as an integral involving the limiting spectral measure of the data matrix only. An interesting issue is whether the known information theoretic phase transitions for rank-one, and hence also sub-linear-rank, still persist in linear-rank. Our analysis suggests that only a smoothed-out trace of the transitions persists. Furthermore, the change of behavior between low and truly high-rank regimes only happens at the linear scale $\alpha=1$.</description>

Abstract: Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC) surpasses the conventional frequency-division sensing and communications (FDSAC) in terms of spectrum, energy, and hardware efficiency, with potential for greater enhancement through integration of non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). Leveraging these advantages, a multiple-input multiple-output NOMA-ISAC framework is proposed in this paper, in which the technique of signal alignment is adopted. The performance of the proposed framework for both downlink and uplink is analyzed. 1) The downlink ISAC is investigated under three different precoding designs: a sensing-centric (S-C) design, a communications-centric (C-C) design, and a Pareto optimal design. 2) For the uplink case, two scenarios are investigated: a S-C design and a C-C design, which vary based on the order of interference cancellation between the communication and sensing signals. In each of these scenarios, key performance metrics including sensing rate (SR), communication rate (CR), and outage probability are investigated. For a deeper understanding, the asymptotic performance of the system in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) region is also explored, with a focus on the high-SNR slope and diversity order. Finally, the SR-CR rate regions achieved by ISAC and FDSAC are studied. Numerical results reveal that in both downlink and uplink cases, ISAC outperforms FDSAC in terms of sensing and communications performance and is capable of achieving a broader rate region, clearly showcasing its superiority.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.00470v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a vision transformer (ViT)-based deep joint source and channel coding (DeepJSCC) scheme for wireless image transmission over multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels, denoted as DeepJSCC-MIMO. We consider DeepJSCC-MIMO for adaptive image transmission in both open-loop and closed-loop MIMO systems. The novel DeepJSCC-MIMO architecture surpasses the classical separation-based benchmarks with robustness to channel estimation errors and showcases remarkable flexibility in adapting to diverse channel conditions and antenna numbers without requiring retraining. Specifically, by harnessing the self-attention mechanism of ViT, DeepJSCC-MIMO intelligently learns feature mapping and power allocation strategies tailored to the unique characteristics of the source image and prevailing channel conditions. Extensive numerical experiments validate the significant improvements in transmission quality achieved by DeepJSCC-MIMO for both open-loop and closed-loop MIMO systems across a wide range of scenarios. Moreover, DeepJSCC-MIMO exhibits robustness to varying channel conditions, channel estimation errors, and different antenna numbers, making it an appealing solution for emerging semantic communication systems.</description>

Abstract: We give a recursive construction for projective Reed-Muller codes in terms of affine Reed-Muller codes and projective Reed-Muller codes in fewer variables. From this construction, we obtain the dimension of the subfield subcodes of projective Reed-Muller codes for some particular degrees that give codes with good parameters. Moreover, from this recursive construction we derive a lower bound for the generalized Hamming weights of projective Reed-Muller codes which is sharp in most of the cases we have checked.</description>

      <title>Distributed IRSs Always Benefit Every Mobile Operator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08434v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of multiple distributed intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs), which are deployed and optimized by a mobile operator (MO), on the performance of user equipments (UEs) served by other co-existing out-of-band (OOB) MOs that do not control the IRSs. We show that, under round-robin scheduling, in mmWave frequencies, the ergodic sum spectral efficiency (SE) of an OOB MO increases logarithmically in the total number of IRS elements with a pre-log factor that increases with the ratio of the number of OOB paths through the IRS to the number of elements at an IRS. We further show that the maximum achievable SE of the OOB MO scales log-linearly with the total IRS elements, with a pre-log factor of $1$. Then, we specify the minimum number of IRSs as a function of the channel parameters and design a distributed IRS system in which an OOB MO almost surely obtains the maximum SE. Finally, we prove that the outage probability at an OOB UE decreases exponentially as the number of IRSs increases, even though they are randomly configured from the OOB UE's viewpoint. We numerically verify our theory and conclude that distributed IRSs always help every MO, but the MO controlling the IRSs benefits the most.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17256v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative foundation AI models have recently shown great success in synthesizing natural signals with high perceptual quality using only textual prompts and conditioning signals to guide the generation process. This enables semantic communications at extremely low data rates in future wireless networks. In this paper, we develop a latency-aware semantic communications framework with pre-trained generative models. The transmitter performs multi-modal semantic decomposition on the input signal and transmits each semantic stream with the appropriate coding and communication schemes based on the intent. For the prompt, we adopt a re-transmission-based scheme to ensure reliable transmission, and for the other semantic modalities we use an adaptive modulation/coding scheme to achieve robustness to the changing wireless channel. Furthermore, we design a semantic and latency-aware scheme to allocate transmission power to different semantic modalities based on their importance subjected to semantic quality constraints. At the receiver, a pre-trained generative model synthesizes a high fidelity signal using the received multi-stream semantics. Simulation results demonstrate ultra-low-rate, low-latency, and channel-adaptive semantic communications.</description>

Abstract: We generalize the type-based multiple access framework proposed by Mergen and Tong (2006) to the case of unsourced multiple access. In the proposed framework, each device tracks the state of a physical/digital process, quantizes this state, and communicates it to a common receiver through a shared channel in an uncoordinated manner. The receiver aims to estimate the type of the states, i.e., the set of states and their multiplicity in the sequence of states reported by all devices. We measure the type estimation error using the Wasserstein distance. Considering an example of multi-target position tracking, we show that type estimation can be performed effectively via approximate message passing. Furthermore, we determine the quantization resolution that minimizes the type estimation error by balancing quantization distortion and communication error.</description>

      <title>Group Projected Subspace Pursuit for Block Sparse Signal Reconstruction: Convergence Analysis and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07707</link>

Abstract: In this paper, we present a convergence analysis of the Group Projected Subspace Pursuit (GPSP) algorithm proposed by He et al. [HKL+23] (Group Projected subspace pursuit for IDENTification of variable coefficient differential equations (GP-IDENT), Journal of Computational Physics, 494, 112526) and extend its application to general tasks of block sparse signal recovery. We prove that when the sampling matrix satisfies the Block Restricted Isometry Property (BRIP) with a sufficiently small Block Restricted Isometry Constant (BRIC), GPSP exactly recovers the true block sparse signals. When the observations are noisy, this convergence property of GPSP remains valid if the magnitude of true signal is sufficiently large. GPSP selects the features by subspace projection criterion (SPC) for candidate inclusion and response magnitude criterion (RMC) for candidate exclusion. We compare these criteria with counterparts of other state-of-the-art greedy algorithms. Our theoretical analysis and numerical ablation studies reveal that SPC is critical to the superior performances of GPSP, and that RMC can enhance the robustness of feature identification when observations contain noises. We test and compare GPSP with other methods in diverse settings, including heterogeneous random block matrices, inexact observations, face recognition, and PDE identification. We find that GPSP outperforms the other algorithms in most cases for various levels of block sparsity and block sizes, justifying its effectiveness for general applications.</description>

      <title>Model-based learning for multi-antenna multi-frequency location-to-channel mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07719v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Years of study of the propagation channel showed a close relation between a location and the associated communication channel response. The use of a neural network to learn the location-to-channel mapping can therefore be envisioned. The Implicit Neural Representation (INR) literature showed that classical neural architecture are biased towards learning low-frequency content, making the location-to-channel mapping learning a non-trivial problem. Indeed, it is well known that this mapping is a function rapidly varying with the location, on the order of the wavelength. This paper leverages the model-based machine learning paradigm to derive a problem-specific neural architecture from a propagation channel model. The resulting architecture efficiently overcomes the spectral-bias issue. It only learns low-frequency sparse correction terms activating a dictionary of high-frequency components. The proposed architecture is evaluated against classical INR architectures on realistic synthetic data, showing much better accuracy. Its mapping learning performance is explained based on the approximated channel model, highlighting the explainability of the model-based machine learning paradigm.</description>

      <title>Multi-Objective Optimization-Based Waveform Design for Multi-User and Multi-Target MIMO-ISAC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13549</link>

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) opens up new service possibilities for sixth-generation (6G) systems, where both communication and sensing (C&amp;S) functionalities co-exist by sharing the same hardware platform and radio resource. In this paper, we investigate the waveform design problem in a downlink multi-user and multi-target ISAC system under different C&amp;S performance preferences. The multi-user interference (MUI) may critically degrade the communication performance. To eliminate the MUI, we employ the constructive interference mechanism into the ISAC system, which saves the power budget for communication. However, due to the conflict between C&amp;S metrics, it is intractable for the ISAC system to achieve the optimal performance of C&amp;S objective simultaneously. Therefore, it is important to strike a trade-off between C&amp;S objectives. By virtue of the multi-objective optimization theory, we propose a weighted Tchebycheff-based transformation method to re-frame the C&amp;S trade-off problem as a Pareto-optimal problem, thus effectively tackling the constraints in ISAC systems. Finally, simulation results reveal the trade-off relation between C&amp;S performances, which provides insights for the flexible waveform design under different C&amp;S performance preferences in MIMO-ISAC systems.</description>
