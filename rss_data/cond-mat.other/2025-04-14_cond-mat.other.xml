      <title>Spin Qubit Properties of the Boron-Vacancy/Carbon Defect in the Two-Dimensional Hexagonal Boron Nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin qubit defects in two-dimensional materials have a number of advantages over those in three-dimensional hosts including simpler technologies for the defect creation and control, as well as qubit accessibility. In this work, we select the VBCB defect in the hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) as a possible optically controllable spin qubit and explain its triplet ground state and neutrality. In this defect a boron vacancy is combined with a carbon dopant substituting the closest boron atom to the vacancy. Our density-functional-theory calculations confirmed that the system has dynamically stable spin triplet and singlet ground states. As revealed from our linear response GW calculations, the spin-sensitive electronic states are localized around the three undercoordinated N atoms and make local peaks in the density of electronic states within the bandgap. Using the triplet and singlet ground state energies, as well as the energies of the optically excited states, obtained from solution to the Bethe-Salpeter equation, we construct the spin-polarization cycle, which is found to be favorable for the spin qubit initialization. The calculated zero-field splitting parameters ensure that the splitting energy between the spin projections in the triplet ground state is comparable to that of the known spin qubits. We thus propose the VBCB defect in hBN as a promising spin qubit.</description>

      <title>Shapiro resonances in ac-self-modulated exciton-polariton Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally investigate the dynamics of exciton polariton Josephson junctions when the coupling between condensates is periodically modulated through self-induced mechanical oscillations. The condensates energy detuning, the analog of the bias voltage in superconducting junctions, displays a plateau behavior akin to the Shapiro steps. At each step massive tunneling of particles occurs featuring Shapiro-like spikes. These characteristic changes are observed when the condensates Josephson frequency $\omega_\textrm{J}$ is an integer multiple of the modulation frequency $\omega_\mathrm{M}$.</description>

      <title>Designing atomic-scale resistive circuits in topological insulators through vacancy-induced localized modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that vacancies can induce topologically protected localized electronic excitations within the bulk of a topological insulator, and when sufficiently close, give rise to one-dimensional propagating chiral bulk modes. We show that the dynamics of these modes can be effectively described by a tight-binding Hamiltonian, with the hopping parameter determined by the overlap of electronic wave functions between adjacent vacancies, accurately predicting the low-energy spectrum. Building on this phenomenon, we propose that vacancies in topological materials can be utilized to design atomic-scale resistive circuits, and estimate the associated resistance as a function of the vacancy distribution's geometric properties.</description>

      <title>Towards quantitative understanding of quantum dot ensemble capacitance-voltage spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inhomogeneous ensembles of quantum dots (QDs) coupled to a charge reservoir are widely studied by using, e.g., electrical methods like capacitance-voltage spectroscopy. We present experimental measurements of the QD capacitance as a function of varying parameters such as ac frequency and bath temperature. The experiment reveals distinct shifts in the position of the capacitance peaks. While temperature-induced shifts have been explained by previous models, the observation of frequency-dependent shifts has not been explained so far. Given that existing models fall short in explaining these phenomena, we propose a refined theoretical model based on a master equation approach which incorporates energy-dependent tunneling effects. This approach successfully reproduces the experimental data. We highlight the critical role of energy-dependent tunneling in two distinct regimes: at low temperatures, ensemble effects arising from energy-level dispersion in differently sized QDs dominate the spectral response; at high temperatures and frequencies, we observe a peak shift of a different nature, which is best described by optimizing the conjoint probability of successive in- and out-tunneling events. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of tunnel processes and the physical properties of QD ensembles coupled to a common reservoir, with implications for their development in applications such as single-photon sources and spin qubits.</description>

      <title>Equivalent Electric Model of a Macrospin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20811v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamics of a ferromagnetic macrospin (e.g., a free layer of a magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ)) can be described in terms of equivalent capacitor charge $Q$ and inductor flux $\Phi$, in a manner similar to a standard electric LC circuit, but with strongly nonlinear and coupled capacitance and inductance. This description allows for the inclusion of Gilbert damping and spin transfer torques and yields a relatively simple equivalent electric circuit, which can be easily modeled in LTspice or other electrical engineering software. It allows one to easily simulate advanced electrical circuits containing MTJs and conventional electronic components in standard simulation software.</description>
