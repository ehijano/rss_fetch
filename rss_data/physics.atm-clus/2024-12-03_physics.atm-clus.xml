      <title>Extending the atomic decomposition and many-body representation, a chemistry-motivated monomer-centered approach for machine learning potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00522</link>

Abstract: Most widely used machine learned (ML) potentials for condensed phase applications rely on many-body permutationally invariant polynomial (PIP) or atom-centered neural networks (NN). However, these approaches often lack chemical interpretability in atomistic energy decomposition and the computational efficiency of traditional force fields has not been fully achieved. Here, we present a novel method that combines aspects of both approaches, and achieves state-of-the-art balance of accuracy and force field-level speed. This method utilizes a monomer-centered representation, where the potential energy is decomposed into the sum of chemically meaningful monomeric energies. Without sophisticated neural network design, the structural descriptors of monomers are described by 1-body and 2-body effective interactions, enforced by appropriate sets of PIPs as inputs to the feed forward NN. We demonstrate the performance of this method through systematic assessments of models for gas-phase water trimer, liquid water, and also liquid CO2. The high accuracy, fast speed, and flexibility of this method provide a new route for constructing accurate ML potentials and enabling large-scale quantum and classical simulations for complex molecular systems.</description>

      <title>Real-time tracking the energy flow in cluster formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01458</link>

Abstract: While photodissociation of molecular systems has been extensively studied, the photoinduced formation of chemical bonds remains largely unexplored. Especially for larger aggregates, the electronic and nuclear dynamics involved in the cluster formation process remain elusive. This limitation is rooted in difficulties to prepare reactants at well-defined initial conditions. Here, we overcome this hurdle by exploiting the exceptional solvation properties of helium nanodroplets. We load the droplets with Mg atoms and investigate the dynamical response of the formed Mg$_n$ aggregates to photoexcitation with time-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy. Beside the response expected for conventional Mg$_n$ clusters, consisting of a prompt signal rise and a decay characteristic for van der Waals bonds, the transient spectra also show a delayed photoelectron band peaking at 1.2 ps. This delayed signal rise is characteristic for nuclear dynamics and represents the transition of Mg$_n$ aggregates from a metastable, foam-like configuration, where Mg atoms are stabilized with a previously predicted interatomic spacing of 9.5 A, to a compact cluster. With global fitting analysis and ion-electron coincidence detection, the concerted electronic and nuclear dynamics can be tracked on a fs timescale. We find that cluster formation, proceeding with a ($450\pm180$) fs time constant, is accompanied by the population of highly-excited atomic states. We propose an energy pooling reaction in collisions of two or more excited Mg atoms during cluster formation as the mechanism leading to population of these high-lying Mg states. Additionally, conversion to kinetic energy through electronic relaxation leads to fragmentation and ejection of ionic cluster fragments from the He droplet. These results underline the potential of He droplets for time-resolved studies of bond formation and to uncover involved processes.</description>

      <title>Time-resolved Coulomb explosion imaging of vibrational wave packets in alkali dimers on helium nanodroplets</title>

Abstract: Vibrational wave packets are created in the lowest triplet state \triplet of $\mathrm{K_2}$ and $\mathrm{Rb_2}$ residing on the surface of helium nanodroplets, through non-resonant stimulated impulsive Raman scattering induced by a moderately intense near-infrared laser pulse. A delayed, intense 50-fs laser pulse doubly ionizes the alkali dimers via multiphoton absorption and thereby causes them to Coulomb explode into a pair of alkali ions $\mathrm{Ak^+}$. From the kinetic energy distribution $P(E_\mathrm{kin})$ of the $\mathrm{Ak^+}$ fragment ions, measured at a large number of delays, we determine the time-dependent internuclear distribution $P(R,t)$, which represents the modulus square of the wave packet within the accuracy of the experiment. For both $\mathrm{K_2}$ and $\mathrm{Rb_2}$, $P(R,t)$ exhibits a periodic oscillatory structure throughout the respective 300 ps and 100 ps observation times. The oscillatory structure is reflected in the time-dependent mean value of $R$, $\langle R \rangle(t)$. Fourier transformation of $\langle R \rangle(t)$ shows that the wave packets are composed mainly of the vibrational ground state and the first excited vibrational state, in agreement with numerical simulations. In the case of $\mathrm{K_2}$, the oscillations are observed for 300 ps corresponding to more than 180 vibrational periods with an amplitude that decreases gradually from 0.035 {\AA} to 0.020 {\AA}. Using time-resolved spectral analysis, we find that the decay time of the amplitude is $\sim$ 260 ps. The decrease is ascribed to the weak coupling between the vibrating dimers and the droplet.</description>
