      <title>Aggregation of dipolar molecules in SiO$_2$ hybrid organic inorganic films: use of silver nanoparticles as inhibitors of molecular aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The technological implementation of hybrid organic-inorganic materials in second order nonlinear optical photonic devices depends strongly on the ability of the host matrixes to contain high loads of dipolar molecules without aggregation. Some organic molecules are often used to diminish the attracting interactions between dipolar molecules in such kind of materials, but their efficiency as inhibitors of molecular aggregation is limited by their polarizability. In this work, we report the use of silver nanoparticles as inhibitors of molecular aggregation in hybrid organic-inorganic films doped with dipolar molecules. The large polarizability of the silver nanoparticles makes them ideal moieties for the inhibition of the electrostatic interactions between dipolar nonlinear optical molecules. The average size of the silver nanoparticles in this work was 70.5 nm in diameter, they were synthesized using silver nitrate (AgNO$_3$) as precursor and aminoethylaminopropyltrimethoxysilane as reducing agent. These nanoparticles were immersed in SiO$_2$ hybrid organic-inorganic sol-gel films doped with dipolar chromophores to study their effect as inhibitors of dipolar chromophores aggregation. The presence of the silver nanoparticles in the solid films was confirmed by transmission electronic microscopy and UV-Visible spectroscopy. UV-Visible spectroscopy was also used to monitor the dipolar chromophores aggregation in the SiO$_2$ films. We found that, at room temperature, silver nanoparticles are good inhibiting chromophores aggregation in comparison with the performance of organic inhibitors.</description>

      <title>The Influence of V-Defects, Leakage, and Random Alloy Fluctuations on the Carrier Transport in Red InGaN MQW LEDs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Red InGaN-based light-emitting diodes (LEDs) exhibit lower internal quantum efficiencies (IQEs) than violet, blue, and green InGaN LEDs due to a reduction in radiative recombination rates relative to non-radiative recombination rates as the indium composition increases. Additionally, the larger polarization and band offset barriers between high indium content InGaN quantum wells and GaN quantum barriers increase the forward voltage. In blue and green LEDs, random alloy fluctuations and V-defects play a key role in reducing the forward voltage. When V-defects are present, either naturally or intentionally introduced, they create an alternative path for carrier injection into the MQWs through the V-defect sidewalls. This injection mechanism explains the turn-on voltages of green LEDs. However, in InGaN red LEDs, these two phenomena do not reduce the forward voltage as effectively as in blue and green LEDs, and consequently, the computed forward voltage remains significantly higher than the measured one. Furthermore, currents are observed at low voltages before the turn-on voltage (\(V &lt; \hbar\omega/e = 2.0 \, \text{V}\)) of red LEDs. To address this, we introduce dislocation-induced tail states in the modeling, suggesting that leakage current through these states may play a significant role both below and at turn-on voltages. The simulation also indicates that leakage carriers below turn-on accumulate, partially diffuse in the QWs, screen the polarization-induced barrier in the low injection regime, and further reduce the forward voltage. Despite these beneficial effects, a drawback of dislocation-induced tail states is the enhanced nonradiative recombination in the dislocation line region. This study provides a detailed analysis of device injection physics in InGaN QW red LEDs and outlines potential optimization strategies.</description>

      <title>Membrane phononic crystals for high-Qm mechanical defect modes in piezoelectric aluminum nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanomechanical resonators with exceptionally low dissipation are advancing mechanics-based sensors and quantum technologies. The key for these advances is the engineering of localized phononic modes that are well-isolated from the environment, i.e., that exhibit a high mechanical quality factor, Qm. Membrane phononic crystals fabricated from strained thin films can realize high-Qm single or multiple localized phononic defect modes. These defect modes can be efficiently interfaced with out-of-plane light or capacitively coupled to a microwave quantum circuit, enabling readout and control of their motion. When membrane phononic crystals are fabricated from a crystalline film, they could offer built-in functionality. We demonstrate a membrane phononic crystal realized in a strained 90 nm-thin film of aluminum nitride (AlN), which is a crystalline piezoelectric material. We engineer a high-Qm localized phononic defect mode at 1.8 MHz with a Qxf-product of 1.5 10^13 Hz at room temperature. In future devices, the built-in piezoelectricity of AlN can be utilized for in-situ tuning of mechanical mode frequencies, defect mode couplings, or acoustic bandgaps, which can be used as building blocks of tunable phononic circuits.</description>

      <title>Mitigation of Delamination of Epitaxial Large-Area Boron Nitride for Semiconductor Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is a promising material for next-generation semiconductor and optoelectronic devices due to its wide bandgap and remarkable optical properties. To apply this material in the semiconductor industry, it is necessary to grow large-area layers on the wafer-scale. For this purpose, chemical vapor deposition methods are highly preferable. However, in the case of epitaxial BN, its fragility and susceptibility to delamination and fold formation during wet processing, such as lithography, present significant challenges to its integration into device fabrication. In this work, we introduce a controlled delamination and redeposition method that effectively prevents the layer from degradation, allowing for multi-step lithographic processes. This approach is applicable to BN layers across a broad thickness range, from tens to hundreds of nanometers, and ensures compatibility with standard photolithographic techniques without compromising the material's intrinsic properties. By addressing key processing challenges, this method paves the way for integrating epitaxial BN into advanced semiconductor and optoelectronic technologies.</description>

      <title>Electrically Tunable Picosecond-scale Octupole Fluctuations in Chiral Antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a theory for the relaxation time of the octupole order parameter in nanoscale chiral antiferromagnets (AFMs) coupled to thermal baths and spin injection sources. Using stochastic spin dynamics simulations, we demonstrate that the octupole moment relaxes through two distinct mechanisms$-$escape over a barrier and precessional dephasing$-$as the barrier for octupole fluctuations is lowered relative to the thermal energy. Notably, the octupole moment relaxes orders of magnitude faster than the typical dipolar order parameters, reaching picosecond timescales. By combining Langer's theory with an effective low-energy description of octupole dynamics in chiral AFMs, we derive analytical expressions for the relaxation times. We find that relaxation in chiral AFMs parallels dipole relaxation in XY magnets, with exchange fields serving the role of the dipole fields. Further, by drawing on the analogy between order parameter dynamics in XY magnets under spin injection and current-biased Josephson junctions, we propose a new scheme for electrically tuning the octupole relaxation times. Our work offers fundamental insights for the development of next-generation spintronic devices that harness octupole order parameters for information encoding, especially in octupole-based probabilistic computing.</description>

      <title>A Metal-Insulator Transition of the Buried MnO2 Monolayer in Complex Oxide Heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Functionalities in crystalline materials are determined by 3-dimensional collective interactions of atoms. The confinement of dimensionality in condensed matter provides an exotic research direction to understand the interaction of atoms, thus can be used to tailor or create new functionalities in material systems. In this study, a 2-dimensional transition metal oxide monolayer is constructed inside complex oxide heterostructures based on the theoretical predictions. The electrostatic boundary conditions of oxide monolayer in the heterostructure is carefully designed to tune the chemical, electronic, and magnetic states of oxide monolayer. The challenge of characterizing such an oxide monolayer is overcome by a combination of transmission electron microscopy, x-ray absorption spectroscopy, cross-sectional scanning tunneling microscopy, and electrical transport measurements. An intriguing metal-insulator transition associated with a magnetic transition is discovered in the MnO2 monolayer. This study paves a new route to understand the confinement of dimensionality and explore new intriguing phenomena in condensed matters.</description>

      <title>Solid-state Synapse Based on Magnetoelectrically Coupled Memristor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brain-inspired computing architectures attempt to emulate the computations performed in the neurons and the synapses in human brain. Memristors with continuously tunable resistances are ideal building blocks for artificial synapses. Through investigating the memristor behaviors in a La0.7Sr0.3MnO3/BaTiO3/La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 multiferroic tunnel junction, it was found that the ferroelectric domain dynamics characteristics are influenced by the relative magnetization alignment of the electrodes, and the interfacial spin polarization is manipulated continuously by ferroelectric domain reversal, enriching our understanding of the magnetoelectric coupling fundamentally. This creates a functionality that not only the resistance of the memristor but also the synaptic plasticity form can be further manipulated, as demonstrated by the spike-timing-dependent plasticity investigations. Density functional theory calculations are carried out to describe the obtained magnetoelectric coupling, which is probably related to the Mn-Ti intermixing at the interfaces. The multiple and controllable plasticity characteristic in a single artificial synapse, to resemble the synaptic morphological alteration property in a biological synapse, will be conducive to the development of artificial intelligence.</description>

      <title>Spatial Quantization: Advancing Insights for Enhancing RRAs Performance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14253v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the new perspective of spatial quantization, this article systematically studies the advantages of reconfigurable reflectarray (RRA) designed with closely spaced elements in terms of sidelobe level (SLL), scanning accuracy and scan loss, including theoretical analysis and simulation verification. This article sequentially studies RRAs with element periods of {\lambda}/2, {\lambda}/4 and {\lambda}/8. Both theoretical and simulation results show that under the condition of the same aperture size, with the number of spatial quantization bits increasing, the SLL performance of 1bit RRA using closely spaced structure will have a improvement of about 5dB. The scanning accuracy at 60{\deg} is improved from 54.52{\deg} at {\lambda}/2 to 57.97{\deg} at {\lambda}/8, while the scan loss is improved from 5.02dB at {\lambda}/2 to 2.85dB at {\lambda}/8. This study has an important reference value for reconfigurable reflectarray design, communication system and radar design.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Argon Concentration within Insulating Glass Units using Low Frequency Ultrasonic Technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10317v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Insulating glass units (IGUs) account for over 30% of thermal transmission losses in building envelopes. To mitigate this, IGUs are often filled with low-conductivity gases like Argon. However, Argon concentration decreases over time due to IGU aging and manufacturing processes, which lessens their insulating effectiveness. This study presents a novel nondestructive methodology to quantify Argon concentration in IGUs using ultrasonic technique. The ultrasonic energy transmitted through the IGU is correlated with Argon concentration, validated through both experimental measurements and numerical models using COMSOL Multiphysics. The models simulate acoustic-structure interaction by adjusting gas density to reflect Argon presence, showing increased ultrasonic energy with higher Argon concentrations. Experimental measurements on two IGU samples with twenty Argon-air mixtures (ranging from 100% to 25% Argon) show that the proposed ultrasonic technique achieves a mean absolute error of 0.13, outperforming Spark Emission Spectroscopy and Helantec ISO-GAS-Control, which have errors of 2.31 and 0.33, respectively.</description>
