      <title>Intermediate time scale in the first product formation time distribution of Michaelis-Menten kinetics with inhibitors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Michaelis-Menten kinetics is one of the most recognized models in enzyme kinetics, crucial for the understanding of biochemical reactions in several metabolic processes. In this study, we perform a stochastic analysis of the Michaelis-Menten kinetics with the introduction of inhibitory mechanisms, which significantly diversifies the study of the reaction. We apply the Fock space formalism to reformulate the master equation, transforming it into a Schr\"odinger-type equation. We investigate reversible inhibitions and analyze the behavior of the averaged number of substances involved, identifying a stiffness behavior in all scenarios. In a specific case of partial inhibition, we observe that the inhibitor can act as an activator that favors product formation. We calculate the first product formation time (FPFT), which characterizes the time statistic of the first product formation. We observe the emergence of an intermediate time scale in addition to the two known time scales typical in first-passage problems. This intermediate time scale is closely aligned with the slow-binding kinetics observed in experimentally observed enzymatic reactions that involve inhibitors. This intermediate time scale is related to the new pathways introduced by the presence of inhibitors. This study offers a new perspective on inhibited enzymatic reactions, and demonstrates the usefulness of the Fock space formalism in the analysis of complex chemical systems.</description>

      <title>A Novel Nonlinear IP$_3$R State Transition Model and Calcium Oscillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel nonlinear state transition model for inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP$_3$Rs) that incorporates a pre-activated state, as suggested by electron microscopy observations. Our model provides a theoretical framework for the biphasic Ca$^{2+}$ dependence of IP$_3$Rs and accurately reproduces their experimentally observed state distribution under saturating IP$_3$ conditions. By integrating receptor dynamics with cytoplasmic and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) calcium exchange, we simulate IP$_3$R-mediated Ca$^{2+}$ oscillations governed by six key conformational states. A pivotal finding is that IP$_3$ regulates these oscillations in a switch-like manner: once a critical IP$_3$ concentration is reached, the system abruptly transitions to sustained, constant-amplitude oscillations that quickly terminate when the concentration exceeds a secondary threshold. These results underscore the crucial role of the pre-activated state in modulating calcium signaling.</description>

      <title>Collective ballistic motion explains fast aggregation in adhesive active matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by motile cells during tissue formation, we identify a mechanism by which active systems of self-aligning adhesive particles undergo ballistic aggregation via a flocking transition. This kinetic regime emerges when the cluster persistence length grows faster with cluster mass than the intercluster distance does. We also characterize and explain the emergence of distinct non-collective kinetic regimes, including long-lived transients relevant to biological systems. Our results provide a unified framework consistent with the broad range of aggregation exponents experimentally observed in cellular systems and uncover physical principles which may enable timely tissue organization</description>

      <title>Applied causality to infer protein dynamics and kinetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The use of generative machine learning models, trained on the experimentally resolved structures deposited in the protein data bank, is an attractive approach to sampling conformational ensembles of proteins. Unfortunately, since the machine-learned model utilized to generate these ensembles is not tied to an equation of motion, such as a molecular dynamics integrator or other causal generator of the dynamics, there is no timescale or causal information encoded in them. As such, with this work, we use the structural ensembles generated from AlphaFold2 at a range of reduced MSA depths to parameterize the potential of mean force of an overdamped, memory-free, coarse-grained Langevin equation. This approach couples the AlphaFold2 ensembles to a causal model, allowing us to estimate the timescales spanned by the AlphaFold2-generated ensembles at each MSA depth. Performing this analysis on six variants of HIV-1 protease, we confirm an inverse relationship between MSA depth and the timescale of an ensemble's conformational fluctuations, since the MSA depth essentially serves as a conformational restraint, and AlphaFold2 is generally able to probe timescales at or below those seen in microsecond-long, unbiased molecular dynamics simulations. We conclude by generalizing this approach to other machine-learned structure-prediction methods.</description>

      <title>Excitation-inhibition balance in cortical networks with heterogeneous cluster sizes and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Insight into how information can propagate within cortical networks is essential for a more complete understanding of neural dynamics and computation in complex networks. Networks with clustered connections have previously been shown to give rise to correlated dynamics in individual clusters. However, this same model applied to a network with highly heterogeneous cluster sizes leads to a clear breakdown of the balanced state. In this article, using a formal definition of the balance matrix, we show why the balance condition breaks and propose a solution to restore balance in heterogeneous networks by reweighing the connection strengths based on community sizes. We introduce a method of partially balancing a heterogeneous network and show that the degree of spontaneous synchronization within communities can be varied using a single parameter describing the reweighing. We further show that stimuli can propagate through a hierarchically clustered network, where stimulating one cluster of neurons in a densely connected pair induces correlated firing in the other without propagating to other weakly connected clusters.</description>

      <title>Likelihood-Based Heterogeneity Inference Reveals Non-Stationary Effects in Biohybrid Cell-Cargo Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Variability of motility behavior in populations of microbiological agents is an ubiquitous phenomenon even in the case of genetically identical cells. Accordingly, passive objects introduced into such biological systems and driven by them will also exhibit heterogeneous motion patterns. Here, we study a biohybrid system of passive beads driven by active ameboid cells and use a likelihood approach to estimate the heterogeneity of the bead dynamics from their discretely sampled trajectories. We showcase how this approach can deal with information-scarce situations and provides natural uncertainty bounds for heterogeneity estimates. Using these advantages we particularly uncover that the heterogeneity in the system is time-dependent.</description>

      <title>Memory in neural activity: long-range order without criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16394v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The "criticality hypothesis", based on observed scale-free correlations in neural activity, posits that the brain operates at a critical point of transition between two phases. However, the validity of this hypothesis is still debated. Here, employing a commonly used model of cortical dynamics, we find that a phase of long-range order (LRO) in neural activity may be induced by memory (time non-locality) without invoking criticality. The cortical dynamics model contains fast and slow time scales that govern the neural and resource (memory) dynamics, respectively. When the resource dynamics are sufficiently slow, we observe an LRO phase, which manifests in avalanche size and duration probability distributions that are fit well by power laws. When the slow and fast time scales are no longer sufficiently distinct, LRO is destroyed. Since this LRO phase spans a wide range of parameters, it is robust against perturbations, unlike critical systems.</description>

Abstract: This note considers a system in which three ligands can independently bind to a scaffold. Such systems arise in diverse applications, including immunotherapy and synthetic biology. It is shown that there are unique steady states in each conservation class, and these are asymptotically stable. The dependency of the steady-state amount of fully bound complex, as a function of total scaffold, is analyzed as well.</description>

      <title>Rosette formations as symmetry-breaking events: theory and experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20543v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multicellular rosettes are observed in different situations such as morphogenesis, wound healing, and cancer progression. While some molecular insights have been gained to explain the presence of these assemblies of five or more cells around a common center, what are the tunable, global features that favors/hinders their formation is still largely unknown. Here, we made use of a Voronoi dynamical model to investigate the ingredients driving the emergence of rosettes characterized by different degree of stability and organization. We found that (i) breaking the local spatial symmetry of the system, i.e., introducing curvature-inducing defects, allows for the formation of rosette-like structures (ii) whose probability of formation depends on the characteristic of the cellular layer. In particular, a trade-off between tissue fluidity and single cell deformability dictates the assembly of transient rosettes, that are strongly stabilized in the presence of cell alignment interactions. To test our model predictions, we performed fluorescence microscopy experiments on rosette-forming neural populations derived from induced pluripotent stem cells, finding significant agreement. Overall, our work may set the stage to gain an unifying understanding of the plethora of biophysical mechanisms involving the occurrence of rosette-like structure both in physiology and their altered formation in pathology.</description>

      <title>Effective permeability conditions for diffusive transport through impermeable membranes with gaps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10694v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Membranes regulate transport in a wide variety of industrial and biological applications. The microscale geometry of the membrane can significantly affect overall transport through the membrane, but the precise nature of this multiscale coupling is not well characterised in general. Motivated by the application of transport across a bacterial membrane, in this paper we use formal multiscale analysis to derive explicit effective coupling conditions for macroscale transport across a two-dimensional impermeable membrane with periodically spaced gaps, and validate these with numerical simulations. We derive analytic expressions for effective macroscale quantities associated with the membrane, such as the permeability, in terms of the microscale geometry. Our results generalise the classic constitutive membrane coupling conditions to a wider range of membrane geometries and time-varying scenarios. Specifically, we demonstrate that if the exterior concentration varies in time, for membranes with long channels, the transport gains a memory property where the coupling conditions depend on the system history. By applying our effective conditions in the context of small molecule transport through gaps in bacterial membranes called porins, we predict that bacterial membrane permeability is primarily dominated by the thickness of the membrane. Furthermore, we predict how alterations to membrane microstructure, for example via changes to porin expression, might affect overall transport, including when external concentrations vary in time. These results will apply to a broad range of physical applications with similar membrane structures, from medical and industrial filtration to carbon capture.</description>
