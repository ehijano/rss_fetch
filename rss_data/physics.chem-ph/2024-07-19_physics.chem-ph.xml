      <title>Reducing Numerical Precision Requirements in Quantum Chemistry Calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The abundant demand for deep learning compute resources has created a renaissance in low precision hardware. Going forward, it will be essential for simulation software to run on this new generation of machines without sacrificing scientific fidelity. In this paper, we examine the precision requirements of a representative kernel from quantum chemistry calculations: calculation of the single particle density matrix from a given mean field Hamiltonian (i.e. Hartree-Fock or Density Functional Theory) represented in an LCAO basis. We find that double precision affords an unnecessarily high level of precision, leading to optimization opportunities. We show how an approximation built from an error-free matrix multiplication transformation can be used to potentially accelerate this kernel on future hardware. Our results provide a road map for adapting quantum chemistry software for the next generation of High Performance Computing platforms.</description>

      <title>A simple approach to rotationally invariant machine learning of avector quantity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unlike with the energy, which is a scalar property, machine learning (ML) predictions of vector or tensor properties poses the additional challenge of achieving proper invariance (covariance) with respect to molecular rotation. If the properties cannot be obtained by differentiation, other appropriate methods should be applied to retain the covariance. There have been several approaches suggested to properly treat this issue. For nonadiabatic couplings and polarizabilities, for example, it was possible to construct virtual quantities from which the above tensorial properties are obtained by differentiation and thus guarantee the covariance. Here we propose a simpler alternative technique, which does not require construction of auxiliary properties or application of special equivariant ML techniques. We suggest a three-step approach, using the molecular tensor of inertia. In the first step, the molecule is rotated using the eigenvectors of this tensor to its principal axes. In the second step, the ML procedure predicts the vector property relative to this orientation, based on a training set where all vector properties were in this same coordinate system. As third step, it remains to transform the ML estimate of the vector property back to the original orientation. This rotate-predict-rotate (RPR) procedure should thus guarantee proper covariance of a vector property and is trivially extensible also to tensors such as polarizability. The PRP procedure has an advantage that the accurate models can be trained very fast for thousands of molecular configurations which might be beneficial where many trainings are required (e.g., in active learning). We have implemented the RPR technique, using the MLatom and Newton-X programs for ML and MD and performed its assessment on the dipole moment along MD trajectories of 1,2-dichloroethane.</description>

      <title>Accelerating structure search using atomistic graph-based classifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an atomistic classifier based on a combination of spectral graph theory and a Voronoi tessellation method. This classifier allows for the discrimination between structures from different minima of a potential energy surface, making it a useful tool for sorting through large datasets of atomic systems. We incorporate the classifier as a filtering method in the Global Optimization with First-principles Energy Expressions (GOFEE) algorithm. Here it is used to filter out structures from exploited regions of the potential energy landscape, whereby the risk of stagnation during the searches is lowered. We demonstrate the usefulness of the classifier by solving the global optimization problem of 2-dimensional pyroxene, 3-dimensional olivine, Au12, and Lennard-Jones LJ55 and LJ75 nanoparticles.</description>

      <title>Optimal Tree Tensor Network Operators for Tensor Network Simulations: Applications to Open Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tree tensor network states (TTNS) decompose the system wavefunction to the product of low-rank tensors based on the tree topology, serving as the foundation of the multi-layer multi-configuration time-dependent Hartree (ML-MCTDH) method. In this work, we present an algorithm that automatically constructs the optimal and exact tree tensor network operators (TTNO) for any sum-of-product symbolic quantum operator.The construction is based on the minimum vertex cover of a bipartite graph. With the optimal TTNO, we simulate open quantum systems such as spin relaxation dynamics in the spin-boson model and charge transport in molecular junctions. In these simulations, the environment is treated as discrete modes and its wavefunction is evolved on equal footing with the system. We employ the Cole-Davidson spectral density to model the glassy phonon environment, and incorporate temperature effects via thermo field dynamics. Our results show that the computational cost scales linearly with the number of discretized modes, demonstrating the efficiency of our approach.</description>

      <title>Atomistic evolution of active sites in multi-component heterogeneous catalysts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-component metal nanoparticles (NPs) are of paramount importance in the chemical industry, as most processes therein employ heterogeneous catalysts. While these multi-component systems have been shown to result in higher product yields, improved selectivities, and greater stability through catalytic cycling, the structural dynamics of these materials in response to various stimuli (e.g. temperature, adsorbates, etc.) are not understood with atomistic resolution. Here, we present a highly accurate equivariant machine-learned force field (MLFF), constructed from ab initio training data collected using Bayesian active learning, that is able to reliably simulate PdAu surfaces and NPs in response to thermal treatment as well as exposure to reactive H$_2$ atmospheres. We thus provide a single model that is able to reliably describe the full space of geometric and chemical complexity for such a heterogeneous catalytic system across single crystals, gas-phase interactions, and NPs reacting with H$_2$, including catalyst degradation and explicit reactivity. Ultimately, we provide direct atomistic evidence that verifies existing experimental hypotheses for bimetallic catalyst deactivation under reaction conditions, namely that Pd preferentially segregates into the Au bulk through aggressive catalytic cycling and that this degradation is site-selective, as well as the reactivity for hydrogen exchange as a function of Pd ensemble size. We demonstrate that understanding of the atomistic evolution of these active sites is of the utmost importance, as it allows for design and control of material structure and corresponding performance, which can be vetted in silico.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Normalizing Flows for Orbital-Free Density Functional Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08764v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Orbital-free density functional theory (OF-DFT) for real-space systems has historically depended on Lagrange optimization techniques, primarily due to the inability of previously proposed electron density approaches to ensure the normalization constraint. This study illustrates how leveraging contemporary generative models, notably normalizing flows (NFs), can surmount this challenge. We develop a Lagrangian-free optimization framework by employing these machine learning models for the electron density. This diverse approach also integrates cutting-edge variational inference techniques and equivariant deep learning models, offering an innovative reformulation to the OF-DFT problem. We demonstrate the versatility of our framework by simulating a one-dimensional diatomic system, LiH, and comprehensive simulations of hydrogen, lithium hydride, water, and four hydrocarbon molecules. The inherent flexibility of NFs facilitates initialization with promolecular densities, markedly enhancing the efficiency of the optimization process.</description>

      <title>Extending non-adiabatic rate theory to strong electronic couplings in the Marcus inverted regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01323v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electron transfer reactions play an essential role in many chemical and biological processes. Fermi's Golden rule, which assumes that the coupling between electronic states is small, has formed the foundation of electron transfer rate theory, however in short range electron/energy transfer reactions this coupling can become very large, and therefore Fermi's Golden Rule fails to make even qualitatively accurate rate predictions. In this paper I present a simple modified Golden Rule theory to describe electron transfer in the Marcus inverted regime at arbitrarily large electronic coupling strengths. The theory is based on an optimal global rotation of the diabatic states, which makes it compatible with existing methods for calculating Golden Rule rates that can account for nuclear quantum effects with anharmonic potentials. Furthermore the Optimal Golden Rule (OGR) theory can also combined with analytic theories for non-adiabatic rates, such as Marcus theory and Marcus-Levich-Jortner theory, offering clear physical insight into strong electronic coupling effects in non-adiabatic processes. OGR theory is also tested on a large set of spin-boson models and an anharmonic model against exact quantum dynamics calculations, where it performs well, correctly predicting rate turnover at large coupling strengths. Finally, an example application to a BODIPY-Anthracene photosensitizer reveals that strong coupling effects inhibit excited state charge recombination in this system, reducing the rate of this process by a factor of four. Overall OGR theory offers a new approach to calculating electron transfer rates at strong couplings, offering new physical insight into a range of non-adiabatic processes.</description>

      <title>Insights into the Mechanism, Selectivity, and Substituent Effects in the Diels-Alder Reaction of Azatrienes with Electron-rich Dienophiles: An MEDT Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11230v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The reactivity and mechanistic intricacies of azatrienes in Diels-Alder reactions have been relatively unexplored despite their intriguing potential applications. In this study, we employ Molecular Electron Density Theory to theoretically investigate the hetero-Diels-Alder reaction involving azatrienes with ethyl vinyl ether and allenyl methyl ether. Analysis of Conceptual Density Functional Theory, energetic profiles, and the topological characteristics is conducted to elucidate the reactions. The revealed mechanism manifests as a polar one-step two-stages process under kinetic control. We establish a clear relationship of between the periselectivity, regioselectivity, and stereoselectivity on one hand and the characteristics of the reactions mechanism on the other hand. The influence of weak interactions on reaction activation barriers and bonding evolution are discussed in detail. We demonstrate that substituents enhancing the reverse electron density flux facilitate the feasibility of the reactions. The results lay ground for a meticulous control of the reaction of azatriene in similar synthetic scenarios.</description>
