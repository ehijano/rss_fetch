      <title>MCRB for Parameter Estimation from One-Bit Quantized and Oversampled Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One-bit quantization has garnered significant attention in recent years for various signal processing and communication applications. Estimating model parameters from one bit quantized data can be challenging, particularly when the quantization process is explicitly accounted for in the estimator. In many cases, the estimator disregards quantization effects, leading to model misspecification. Consequently, estimation errors arise from both quantization and misspecification. Traditional performance bounds, such as the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB), fail to capture the impact of misspecification on estimation performance. To address this limitation, we derive the misspecified CRB (MCRB) for parameter estimation in a quantized data model consisting of a signal component in additive Gaussian noise. We apply this bound to direction-of-arrival estimation using quantized measurements from a sensor array and to frequency estimation with oversampled quantized data. The simulations show that the MCRB is asymptotically achieved by the mean-squared-error of the misspecified maximum-likelihood estimator. Our results demonstrate that, unlike in finely quantized scenarios, oversampling can significantly enhance the estimation performance in the presence of misspecified one-bit quantized measurements.</description>

      <title>CLuP-Based Dual-Deconvolution in Automotive ISAC Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate target parameter estimation of range, velocity, and angle is essential for vehicle safety in advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous vehicles. To enable spectrum sharing, ADAS may employ integrated sensing and communications (ISAC). This paper examines a dual-deconvolution automotive ISAC scenario where the radar waveform is known but the propagation channel is not, while in the communications domain, the channel is known but the transmitted message is not. Conventional maximum likelihood (ML) estimation for automotive target parameters is computationally demanding. To address this, we propose a low-complexity approach using the controlled loosening-up (CLuP) algorithm, which employs iterative refinement for efficient separation and estimation of radar targets. We achieve this through a nuclear norm restriction that stabilizes the problem. Numerical experiments demonstrate the robustness of this approach under high-mobility and noisy automotive environments, highlighting CLuP's potential as a scalable, real-time solution for ISAC in future vehicular networks.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Comparison between Terahertz and Optical Wireless Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive quantitative comparison between Terahertz (THz) communication (TeraCom) and optical wireless communication (OWC) technologies, focusing on both indoor and outdoor environments. We propose a comparison method for TeraCom and vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL)-based OWC in indoor scenarios, incorporating misalignment effects by modeling the THz antenna radiation pattern within a multi-ray THz channel model and using a Gaussian beam model for VCSEL-based OWC. Unified beamwidth parameters allow for a detailed analysis of misalignment impact on both systems. Furthermore, we develop power consumption models for each technology, integrating key parameters such as THz phase noise, VCSEL non-linearities, and photodetector bandwidth-area tradeoffs. These models enable an in-depth analysis of energy efficiency in indoor environments, including multi-transmitter coverage scenarios. For outdoor scenarios, we summarize existing stochastic channel models addressing path loss, pointing errors, and small-scale fading for free space optics (FSO) and THz links. We then apply these models to unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) applications to assess performance in dynamic conditions. Our results provide critical insights into the suitability of each technology for various deployment scenarios.</description>

      <title>Advancing THz Radio Map Construction and Obstacle Sensing: An Integrated Generative Framework in ISAC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) in the terahertz (THz) band enables obstacle detection, which in turn facilitates efficient beam management to mitigate THz signal blockage. Simultaneously, a THz radio map, which captures signal propagation characteristics through the distribution of received signal strength (RSS), is well-suited for sensing, as it inherently contains obstacle-related information and reflects the unique properties of the THz channel. This means that communication-assisted sensing in ISAC can be effectively achieved using a THz radio map. However, constructing a radio map presents significant challenges due to the sparse deployment of THz sensors and their limited ability to accurately measure the RSS distribution, which directly affects obstacle sensing. In this paper, we formulate an integrated problem for the first time, leveraging the mutual enhancement between sensed obstacles and the constructed THz radio maps. To address this challenge while improving generalization, we propose an integration framework based on a conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN), which uncovers the manifold structure of THz radio maps embedded with obstacle information. Furthermore, recognizing the shared environmental semantics across THz radio maps from different beam directions, we introduce a novel voting-based sensing scheme, where obstacles are detected by aggregating votes from THz radio maps generated by the CGAN. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms non-integrated baselines in both radio map construction and obstacle sensing, achieving up to 44.3% and 90.6% reductions in mean squared error (MSE), respectively, in a real-world scenario. These results validate the effectiveness of the proposed voting-based scheme.</description>

      <title>Channel Coding meets Sequence Design via Machine Learning for Integrated Sensing and Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For integrated sensing and communications, an intriguing question is whether information-bearing channel-coded signals can be reused for sensing - specifically ranging. This question forces the hitherto non-overlapping fields of channel coding (communications) and sequence design (sensing) to intersect by motivating the design of error-correcting codes that have good autocorrelation properties. In this letter, we demonstrate how machine learning (ML) is well-suited for designing such codes, especially for short block lengths. As an example, for rate 1/2 and block length 32, we show that even an unsophisticated ML code has a bit-error rate performance similar to a Polar code with the same parameters, but with autocorrelation sidelobes 24dB lower. While a length-32 Zadoff-Chu (ZC) sequence has zero autocorrelation sidelobes, there are only 16 such sequences and hence, a 1/2 code rate cannot be realized by using ZC sequences as codewords. Hence, ML bridges channel coding and sequence design by trading off an ideal autocorrelation function for a large (i.e., rate-dependent) codebook size.</description>

      <title>Least-Squares Khatri-Rao Factorization of a Polynomial Matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Khatri-Rao product is extensively used in array processing, tensor decomposition, and multi-way data analysis. Many applications require a least-squares (LS) Khatri-Rao factorization. In broadband sensor array problems, polynomial matrices effectively model frequency-dependent behaviors, necessitating extensions of conventional linear algebra techniques. This paper generalizes LS Khatri-Rao factorization from ordinary to polynomial matrices by applying it to the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) samples of polynomial matrices. Phase coherence across bin-wise Khatri-Rao factors is ensured via a phasesmoothing algorithm. The proposed method is validated through broadband angle-of-arrival (AoA) estimation for uniform planar arrays (UPAs), where the steering matrix is a polynomial matrix, which can be represented as a Khatri-Rao product between steering matrix in azimuth and elevation directions.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Graph Discovery in D2D-Enabled Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Augmenting federated learning (FL) with device-to-device (D2D) communications can help improve convergence speed and reduce model bias through local information exchange. However, data privacy concerns, trust constraints between devices, and unreliable wireless channels each pose challenges in finding an effective yet resource efficient D2D graph structure. In this paper, we develop a decentralized reinforcement learning (RL) method for D2D graph discovery that promotes communication of impactful datapoints over reliable links for multiple learning paradigms, while following both data and device-specific trust constraints. An independent RL agent at each device trains a policy to predict the impact of incoming links in a decentralized manner without exposure of local data or significant communication overhead. For supervised settings, the D2D graph aims to improve device-specific label diversity without compromising system-level performance. For semi-supervised settings, we enable this by incorporating distributed label propagation. For unsupervised settings, we develop a variation-based diversity metric which estimates data diversity in terms of occupied latent space. Numerical experiments on five widely used datasets confirm that the data diversity improvements induced by our method increase convergence speed by up to 3 times while reducing energy consumption by up to 5 times. They also show that our method is resilient to stragglers and changes in the aggregation interval. Finally, we show that our method offers scalability benefits for larger system sizes without increases in relative overhead, and adaptability to various downstream FL architectures and to dynamic wireless environments.</description>

      <title>A Method for Localization of Cellular Users from Call Detail Records</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A common problem in justice applications is localization of a user of a cellular network using a call detail record (CDR), which typically reveals only the base station and sector to which the user was connected. This precludes precise estimation of location. Instead, one is limited to estimating a region of plausible locations (RPL) using static information such as sector antenna orientation, beamwidth, and locations of nearby base stations. In this paper, we propose a method for RPL estimation in which the shape bounding the RPL is derived from a model of the antenna pattern via the Friis Transmission Equation, and the size of the RPL is determined by mean distance to nearby base stations. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated by "best server" analysis of measurements acquired from drive testing in the vicinity of Winter Garden, Florida, observing three 700 MHz-band LTE cellular networks serving this area. Of the 16 sectors evaluated, the aggregate error rate (i.e., fraction of users located outside the RPL estimated for the associated sector) is found to be 1.3%, with worst per-sector error rate of about 13.3% and error rates below 1.8% for 13 of the 16 sectors. The principal difficulty is shown to be estimation of RPL size, which entails a tradeoff between minimizing RPL area (yielding the "tightest" localization) and minimizing error rate.</description>

      <title>Improving Neonatal Care: An Active Dry-Contact Electrode-based Continuous EEG Monitoring System with Seizure Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective: Neonates are highly susceptible to seizures, which can have severe long-term consequences if undetected and left untreated. Early detection is crucial and typically requires continuous electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring in a hospital setting, which is costly, inconvenient, and requires specialized experts for diagnosis. In this work, we propose a new low-cost active dry-contact electrode-based adjustable EEG headset, a new explainable deep learning model to detect neonatal seizures, and an advanced signal processing algorithm to remove artifacts to address the key aspects that lead to the underdiagnosis of neonatal seizures. Methods: EEG signals are acquired through active electrodes and processed using a custom-designed analog front end (AFE) that filters and digitizes the captured EEG signals. The adjustable headset is designed using three-dimensional (3D) printing and laser cutting to fit a wide range of head sizes. A deep learning model is developed to classify seizure and non-seizure epochs in real-time. Furthermore, a separate multimodal deep learning model is designed to remove noise artifacts. The device is tested on a pediatric patient with absence seizures in a hospital setting. Simultaneous recordings are captured using both the custom device and the commercial wet electrode device available in the hospital for comparison. Results: The signals obtained using our custom design and a commercial device show a high correlation (&gt;0.8). Further analysis using signal-to-noise ratio values shows that our device can mitigate noise similar to the commercial device. The proposed deep learning model has improvements in accuracy and recall by 2.76% and 16.33%, respectively, compared to the state-of-the-art. Furthermore, the developed artifact removal algorithm can identify and remove artifacts while keeping seizure patterns intact.</description>

      <title>STAR-RIS-aided NOMA for Secured xURLLC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Short packet-based advanced Internet of things (A-IoT) calls for not only the next generation of ultra-reliable low-latency communications (xURLLC) but also highly secured communications. In this paper, we aim to address this objective by developing a non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) system with untrusted user. There exist two key problems: The confidential/private message for the far user will be exposed to the untrusted near user with successful SIC; The restrictive trade-off among reliability, security and latency poses a great challenge in achieving secured xURLLC. In order to solve these issues, we introduce simultaneous transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS), which provides additional degree of freedom to enable a secure and fair decoding order and achieve a desired trade-off among reliability, security and latency. To fully reveal the trade-off among reliability, security and latency, we characterize the reliability and security via decoding error probabilities. A leakage probability minimization problem is modeled to optimize the passive beamforming, power allocation and blocklength subject to secure successive interference cancellation (SIC) order, reliability and latency constraints. To solve this complex problem, we explore its intrinsic properties and propose an algorithm based on majorization minimization (MM) and alternative optimization (AO). Simulation results demonstrate the validness of our study in this paper.</description>

      <title>Zak-OTFS for Mutually Unbiased Sensing and Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Waveforms with ideal ambiguity functions are fundamental to integrated sensing and communication, to active sensing (radar), and to uplink multiple access. We describe a general method of constructing waveforms using the discrete Zak transform (DZT) to convert sequences of length $MN$ in the time domain to waveforms in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain, each of which is defined by an $M\times N$ quasi-periodic array. The DZT preserves inner products, and we show that phase coded waveforms used in radar (CAZAC sequences) determine noise-like waveforms in the DD domain, each with low Peak to Average Power Ratio. In a Zak-OTFS communication system, we show that these waveforms are mutually unbiased with respect to every carrier and use them to integrate sensing and communication as spread pilots. We view each waveform as a linear combination of Zak-OTFS carriers and show that the self-ambiguity function is supported on a discrete line in the integers modulo $MN$. The sidelobes are significantly lower than the original CAZAC sequence, and the advantage of discrete support is better localization/resolution in delay and Doppler compared with standard methods based on chirps or tones. We show that the absolute value of the cross-ambiguity function for pairs of waveforms in the same family is small and constant. This property makes the waveforms ideal preambles in the 2-step RACH protocol introduced in Release 15, 3GPP to enable grant-free multiple access. The characteristics of the cross-ambiguity function make it possible to simultaneously detect multiple preambles in the presence of mobility and delay spread.</description>

      <title>Semantic Packet Aggregation and Repeated Transmission for Text-to-Image Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-based communication is expected to be prevalent in 6G applications such as wireless AI-generated content (AIGC). Motivated by this, this paper addresses the challenges of transmitting text prompts over erasure channels for a text-to-image AIGC task by developing the semantic segmentation and repeated transmission (SMART) algorithm. SMART groups words in text prompts into packets, prioritizing the task-specific significance of semantics within these packets, and optimizes the number of repeated transmissions. Simulation results show that SMART achieves higher similarities in received texts and generated images compared to a character-level packetization baseline, while reducing computing latency by orders of magnitude compared to an exhaustive search baseline.</description>

      <title>ANNs-SaDE: A Machine-Learning-Based Design Automation Framework for Microwave Branch-Line Couplers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The traditional method for designing branch-line couplers involves a trial-and-error optimization process that requires multiple design iterations through electromagnetic (EM) simulations. Thus, it is extremely time consuming and labor intensive. In this paper, a novel machine-learning-based framework is proposed to tackle this issue. It integrates artificial neural networks with a self-adaptive differential evolution algorithm (ANNs-SaDE). This framework enables the self-adaptive design of various types of microwave branch-line couplers by precisely optimizing essential electrical properties, such as coupling factor, isolation, and phase difference between output ports. The effectiveness of the ANNs-SaDE framework is demonstrated by the designs of folded single-stage branch-line couplers and multi-stage wideband branch-line couplers.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Attention-Based Model for 5G Radio-based Outdoor Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio-based localization in dynamic environments, such as urban and vehicular settings, requires systems that can efficiently adapt to varying signal conditions and environmental changes. Factors such as multipath interference and obstructions introduce different levels of complexity that affect the accuracy of the localization. Although generalized models offer broad applicability, they often struggle to capture the nuances of specific environments, leading to suboptimal performance in real-world deployments. In contrast, specialized models can be tailored to particular conditions, enabling more precise localization by effectively handling domain-specific variations and noise patterns. However, deploying multiple specialized models requires an efficient mechanism to select the most appropriate one for a given scenario. In this work, we develop an adaptive localization framework that combines shallow attention-based models with a router/switching mechanism based on a single-layer perceptron (SLP). This enables seamless transitions between specialized localization models optimized for different conditions, balancing accuracy, computational efficiency, and robustness to environmental variations. We design three low-complex localization models tailored for distinct scenarios, optimized for reduced computational complexity, test time, and model size. The router dynamically selects the most suitable model based on real-time input characteristics. The proposed framework is validated using real-world vehicle localization data collected from a massive MIMO base station (BS), demonstrating its ability to seamlessly adapt to diverse deployment conditions while maintaining high localization accuracy.</description>

      <title>Algorithm Design and Prototype Validation for Reconfigurable Intelligent Sensing Surface: Forward-Only Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sensing-assisted communication schemes have recently garnered significant research attention. In this work, we design a dual-function reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), integrating both active and passive elements, referred to as the reconfigurable intelligent sensing surface (RISS), to enhance communication. By leveraging sensing results from the active elements, we propose communication enhancement and robust interference suppression schemes for both near-field and far-field models, implemented through the passive elements. These schemes remove the need for base station (BS) feedback for RISS control, simplifying the communication process by replacing traditional channel state information (CSI) feedback with real-time sensing from the active elements. The proposed schemes are theoretically analyzed and then validated using software-defined radio (SDR). Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the sensing algorithms in real-world scenarios, such as direction of arrival (DOA) estimation and radio frequency (RF) identification recognition. Moreover, the RISS-assisted communication system shows strong performance in communication enhancement and interference suppression, particularly in near-field models.</description>

      <title>Robust Suboptimal Local Basis Function Algorithms for Identification of Nonstationary FIR Systems in Impulsive Noise Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While local basis function (LBF) estimation algorithms, commonly used for identifying/tracking systems with time-varying parameters, demonstrate good performance under the assumption of normally distributed measurement noise, the estimation results may significantly deviate from satisfactory when the noise distribution is impulsive in nature, for example, corrupted by outliers. This paper introduces a computationally efficient method to make the LBF estimator robust, enhancing its resistance to impulsive noise. First, the choice of basis functions is optimized based on the knowledge of parameter variation statistics. Then, the parameter tracking algorithm is made robust using the sequential data trimming technique. Finally, it is demonstrated that the proposed algorithm can undergo online tuning through parallel estimation and leave-one-out cross-validation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Road traffic monitoring typically involves the counting and recording of vehicles on public roads over extended periods. The data gathered from such monitoring provides useful information to municipal authorities in urban areas. This paper presents a low-cost, widely deployable sensing subsystem based on Continuous Wave Doppler radar. The proposed system can perform vehicle detection and speed estimation with a total cost of less than 100 USD.

      <title>Active Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces: Circuit Modeling and Reflection Amplification Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) constitute a promising emerging technology that enables wireless systems to control the propagation environment to enhance diverse communication objectives. To mitigate double-fading attenuation in RIS-aided links, the paradigm of active metamaterials capable of amplifying their incident wave has emerged. In this paper, capitalizing on the inherent negative-resistance region of tunnel diodes, we propose their integration into each RIS unit element to enable RISs with reflection amplification entirely in the analog domain. We derive novel realistic phase-amplitude relationships and power constraints specific to this model, addressing gaps in the existing literature where amplitude limits are often chosen arbitrarily. This characterization of our active RIS unit elements is incorporated into two novel optimization frameworks targeting the spectral efficiency maximization of RIS-assisted Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output (MIMO) systems, which are solved via an one-step approach and an iterative Alternating Optimization (AO) method. The former approach is used to initialize the AO framework, enhancing both its performance and convergence. Our numerical investigations emphasize the importance of accurately modeling phase-amplitude dependencies, and provide key insights into the impact of RIS-induced noise as well as the trade-off between available power and the number of active elements.</description>

      <title>Reinforcing Localization Credibility Through Convex Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work proposes a novel approach to reinforce localization security in wireless networks in the presence of malicious nodes that are able to manipulate (spoof) radio measurements. It substitutes the original measurement model by another one containing an auxiliary variance dilation parameter that disguises corrupted radio links into ones with large noise variances. This allows for relaxing the non-convex maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) into a semidefinite programming (SDP) problem by applying convex-concave programming (CCP) procedure. The proposed SDP solution simultaneously outputs target location and attacker detection estimates, eliminating the need for further application of sophisticated detectors. Numerical results corroborate excellent performance of the proposed method in terms of localization accuracy and show that its detection rates are highly competitive with the state of the art.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-Based Data Fusion of 6G Sensing and Inertial Information for Target Positioning: Experimental Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sixth-generation (6G) cellular technology will be deployed with a key feature of Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC), allowing the cellular network to map the environment through radar sensing on top of providing communication services. In this regard, the entire network can be considered as a sensor with a broader Field of View (FoV) of the environment, assisting in both the positioning of active and detection of passive targets. On the other hand, the non-3GPP sensors available on the target can provide additional information specific to the target that can be beneficially combined with ISAC sensing information to enhance the overall achievable positioning accuracy. In this paper, we first study the performance of the ISAC system in terms of its achievable accuracy in positioning the mobile target in an indoor scenario. Second, we study the performance gain achieved in the ISAC positioning accuracy after fusing the information from the target's non-3GPP sensors. To this end, we propose a novel data fusion solution based on the deep learning framework to fuse the information from ISAC and non-3GPP sensors.
  We validate our proposed data fusion and positioning solution with a real-world ISAC Proof-of-Concept (PoC) as the wireless infrastructure, an Automated Guided Vehicle (AGV) as the target, and the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensor on the target as the non-3GPP sensor. The experimental results show that our proposed solution achieves an average positioning error of $3~\textrm{cm}$, outperforming the considered baselines.</description>

      <title>Impact of Synchronization Offsets and CSI Feedback Delay in Distributed MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main challenges of distributed MIMO systems lie in achieving highly accurate synchronization and ensuring the availability of accurate channel state information (CSI) at distributed nodes. This paper analytically examines the effects of synchronization offsets and CSI feedback delays on system capacity, providing insights into how these affect the coherent joint transmission gain. The capacity expressions are first derived under ideal conditions, and the effects of synchronization offsets and feedback delays are subsequently incorporated. This analysis can be applied to any distributed MIMO architecture. A comprehensive study, including system models and simulations evaluating the analytical expressions, is presented to quantify the capacity degradation caused by these factors. This study provides valuable insights into the design and performance of distributed MIMO systems. The analysis shows that time and frequency offsets, along with CSI feedback delay, cause inter-layer interference. Additionally, time offsets result in inter-symbol interference.</description>

      <title>Audio Compression using Periodic Gabor with Biorthogonal Exchange: Implementation Using the Zak Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An efficient new approach to signal compression is presented based of a novel variation on the Gabor basis set. Following earlier work by Shimshovitz and Tannor, we convolve the conventional Gabor functions with Dirichlet functions to obtain a Periodic Gabor basis set (PG). The PG basis is exact for continuous functions that are periodic band-limited. Using the orthonormality of the Dirichlet functions, the calculation of the PG coefficients becomes trivial and numerically stable, but its representation does not allow compression. Large compression factors are achieved by exchanging the PG basis with its biorthogonal basis, thereby using the localized PG basis to calculate the coefficients (PGB). Here we implement the PGB formalism using the Fast Zak Transform and obtain very high efficiency with respect to both CPU and memory. We compare the method with the state of the art Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) and Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) methods on a variety of audio files, including music and speech samples. In all cases tested our scheme surpasses the STFT by far and in most cases outperforms DWT.</description>

      <title>Towards Secure Semantic Communications in the Presence of Intelligent Eavesdroppers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semantic communication has emerged as a promising paradigm for enhancing communication efficiency in sixth-generation (6G) networks. However, the broadcast nature of wireless channels makes SemCom systems vulnerable to eavesdropping, which poses a serious threat to data privacy. Therefore, we investigate secure SemCom systems that preserve data privacy in the presence of eavesdroppers. Specifically, we first explore a scenario where eavesdroppers are intelligent and can exploit semantic information to reconstruct the transmitted data based on advanced artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. To counter this, we introduce novel eavesdropping attack strategies that utilize model inversion attacks and generative AI (GenAI) models. These strategies effectively reconstruct transmitted private data processed by the semantic encoder, operating in both glass-box and closed-box settings. Existing defense mechanisms against eavesdropping often cause significant distortions in the data reconstructed by eavesdroppers, potentially arousing their suspicion. To address this, we propose a semantic covert communication approach that leverages an invertible neural network (INN)-based signal steganography module. This module covertly embeds the channel input signal of a private sample into that of a non-sensitive host sample, thereby misleading eavesdroppers. Without access to this module, eavesdroppers can only extract host-related information and remain unaware of the hidden private content. We conduct extensive simulations under various channel conditions in image transmission tasks. Numerical results show that while conventional eavesdropping strategies achieve a success rate of over 80\% in reconstructing private information, the proposed semantic covert communication effectively reduces the eavesdropping success rate to 0.</description>

      <title>Joint Source-Environment Adaptation of Data-Driven Underwater Acoustic Source Ranging Based on Model Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adapting pre-trained deep learning models to new and unknown environments is a difficult challenge in underwater acoustic localization. We show that although pre-trained models have performance that suffers from mismatch between the training and test data, they generally exhibit a higher ``implied uncertainty'' in environments where there is more mismatch. Leveraging this notion of implied uncertainty, we partition the test samples into more certain and less certain sets, and implement an estimation method using the certain samples to improve the labeling for uncertain samples, which helps to adapt the model. We use an efficient method to quantify model prediction uncertainty, and an innovative approach to adapt a pre-trained model to unseen underwater environments at test time. This eliminates the need for labeled data from the target environment or the original training data. This adaptation is enhanced by integrating an independent estimate based on the received signal energy. We validate the approach extensively using real experimental data, as well as synthetic data consisting of model-generated signals with real ocean noise. The results demonstrate significant improvements in model prediction accuracy, underscoring the potential of the method to enhance underwater acoustic localization in diverse, noisy, and unknown environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the underwater acoustic localization in the presence of environmental mismatch. Especially, we exploit a pre-trained neural network for the acoustic wave propagation in a gradient-based optimization framework to estimate the source location. To alleviate the effect of mismatch between the training data and the test data, we simultaneously optimize over the network weights at the inference time, and provide conditions under which this method is effective. Moreover, we introduce a physics-inspired modularity in the forward model that enables us to learn the path lengths of the multipath structure in an end-to-end training manner without access to the specific path labels. We investigate the validity of the assumptions in a simple yet illustrative environment model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a method to adapt a pre-trained deep-learning-based model for underwater acoustic localization to a new environment. We use unsupervised domain adaptation to improve the generalization performance of the model, i.e., using an unsupervised loss, fine-tune the pre-trained network parameters without access to any labels of the target environment or any data used to pre-train the model. This method improves the pre-trained model prediction by coupling that with an almost independent estimation based on the received signal energy (that depends on the source). We show the effectiveness of this approach on Bellhop generated data in an environment similar to that of the SWellEx-96 experiment contaminated with real ocean noise from the KAM11 experiment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The expansion of sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks into space introduces technical challenges that conventional bit-oriented communication approaches cannot efficiently address, including intermittent connectivity, severe latency, limited bandwidth, and constrained onboard resources. To overcome these limitations, semantic communication has emerged as a transformative paradigm, shifting the communication focus from transmitting raw data to delivering context-aware, missionrelevant information. In this article, we propose a semantic communication architecture explicitly tailored for the 6G Internet of Space (IoS), integrating multi-modal semantic processing, AIdriven semantic encoding and decoding, and adaptive transmission mechanisms optimized for space environments. The effectiveness of our proposed framework is demonstrated through a representative deep-space scenario involving semantic-based monitoring of Mars dust storms. Finally, we outline open research challenges and discuss future directions toward realizing practical semantic-enabled IoS systems.</description>

      <title>Characteristics-Based Design of Generalized-Exponent Bandpass Filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15321v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop characteristics-based filter design methods for a class of IIR bandpass filters, which we refer to as Generalized-Exponent Filters (GEFs) and that are represented as second-order filters raised to non-unitary exponents. GEFs have a peak, are effectively linear phase, and are useful for seismic signal phase-picking, cochlear implants, and equalizers. The native frequency-domain specifications for GEFs are not on given frequency responses but rather on filter characteristics such as peak frequency, bandwidth, and group delay. Our characteristics-based method for filter design accommodates direct specification of a trio of frequency-domain characteristics from amongst the peak frequency, convexity, ndB quality factors, equivalent rectangular bandwidth, maximum group delay, and phase accumulation. We achieve this by deriving filter parameterizations with sets of filter characteristics which involves deriving closed-form analytic expressions mapping sets of filter characteristics to the original filter constants by making sharp-filter approximations. This results in parameterizations for GEFs including ones with simultaneous specification of magnitude-based and phase-based characteristics (e.g. bandwidths and group delays). This in turn enables designing sharply tuned filters without significant group delay, and simultaneous control over frequency selectivity and synchronization which is important in designing filterbanks. Our filter design methods with direct control over characteristics may also be utilized beyond static filter design for higher-order variable bandpass filter design and may be useful for characteristics-based adaptive filtering. Our methods are inherently stable, highly accurate in meeting strict specifications on desired characteristics, simple, and computationally efficient. The methods extend to the design of related bandpass and multiband filters.</description>

      <title>Rational-Exponent Filters with Applications to Generalized Exponent Filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16877v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present filters with rational exponents in order to provide a continuum of filter behavior not classically achievable. We discuss their stability, the flexibility they afford, and various representations useful for analysis, design and implementations. We do this for a generalization of second-order filters which we refer to as rational-exponent Generalized Exponent Filters (GEFs) that are useful for a diverse array of applications. We present equivalent representations for rational-exponent GEFs in the time and frequency domains: transfer functions, impulse responses, and integral expressions - the last of which allows for efficient real-time processing without preprocessing requirements. Rational-exponent filters enable filter characteristics to be on a continuum rather than limiting them to discrete values thereby resulting in greater flexibility in the behavior of these filters without additional complexity in causality and stability analyses compared with classical filters. In the case of GEFs, this allows for having arbitrary continuous rather than discrete values for filter characteristics such as (1) the ratio of 3dB quality factor to maximum group delay - particularly important for filterbanks which have simultaneous requirements on frequency selectivity and synchronization; and (2) the ratio of 3dB to 15dB quality factors that dictates the shape of the frequency response magnitude.</description>

      <title>IRS Aided Federated Learning: Multiple Access and Fundamental Tradeoff</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00422v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) aided wireless federated learning (FL) system, where an access point (AP) coordinates multiple edge devices to train a machine leaning model without sharing their own raw data. During the training process, we exploit the joint channel reconfiguration via IRS and resource allocation design to reduce the latency of a FL task. Particularly, we propose three transmission protocols for assisting the local model uploading from multiple devices to an AP, namely IRS aided time division multiple access (I-TDMA), IRS aided frequency division multiple access (I-FDMA), and IRS aided non-orthogonal multiple access (INOMA), to investigate the impact of IRS on the multiple access for FL. Under the three protocols, we minimize the per-round latency subject to a given training loss by jointly optimizing the device scheduling, IRS phase-shifts, and communicationcomputation resource allocation. For the associated problem under I-TDMA, an efficient algorithm is proposed to solve it optimally by exploiting its intrinsic structure, whereas the highquality solutions of the problems under I-FDMA and I-NOMA are obtained by invoking a successive convex approximation (SCA) based approach. Then, we further develop a theoretical framework for the performance comparison of the proposed three transmission protocols. Sufficient conditions for ensuring that I-TDMA outperforms I-NOMA and those of its opposite are unveiled, which is fundamentally different from that NOMA always outperforms TDMA in the system without IRS. Simulation results validate our theoretical findings and also demonstrate the usefulness of IRS for enhancing the fundamental tradeoff between the learning latency and learning accuracy.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Dynamic Sparsity for Near-Field Spatial Non-Stationary XL-MIMO Channel Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19475v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work considers a spatial non-stationary channel tracking problem in broadband extremely large-scale multiple-input-multiple-output (XL-MIMO) systems. In the case of spatial non-stationary, each scatterer has a certain visibility region (VR) over antennas and power change may occur among visible antennas. Concentrating on the temporal correlation of XL-MIMO channels, we design a three-layer Markov prior model and hierarchical two-dimensional (2D) Markov model to exploit the dynamic sparsity of sparse channel vectors and VRs, respectively. Then, we formulate the channel tracking problem as a bilinear measurement process, and a novel dynamic alternating maximum a posteriori (DA-MAP) framework is developed to solve the problem. The DA-MAP contains four basic modules: channel estimation module, VR detection module, grid update module, and temporal correlated module. Specifically, the first module is an inverse-free variational Bayesian inference (IF-VBI) estimator that avoids computational intensive matrix inverse each iteration; the second module is a turbo compressive sensing (Turbo-CS) algorithm that only needs small-scale matrix operations in a parallel fashion; the third module refines the polar-delay domain grid; and the fourth module can process the temporal prior information to ensure high-efficiency channel tracking. Simulations show that the proposed method can achieve a significant channel tracking performance while achieving low computational overhead.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we rethink delay Doppler channels (also called doubly selective channels). We prove that no modulation schemes (including the current active VOFDM/OTFS) can compensate a non-trivial Doppler spread well. We then discuss some of the existing methods to deal with time-varying channels, in particular time-frequency (TF) coding in an OFDM system. TF coding is equivalent to space-time coding in the math part. We also summarize state of the art on space-time coding that was an active research topic over a decade ago.</description>

      <title>Internet of Things-Based Smart Precision Farming in Soilless Agriculture:Opportunities and Challenges for Global Food Security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13528v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid growth of the global population and the continuous decline in cultivable land pose significant threats to food security. This challenge worsens as climate change further reduces the availability of farmland. Soilless agriculture, such as hydroponics, aeroponics, and aquaponics, offers a sustainable solution by enabling efficient crop cultivation in controlled environments. The integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) with smart precision farming improves resource efficiency, automates environmental control, and ensures stable and high-yield crop production. IoT-enabled smart farming systems utilize real-time monitoring, data-driven decision-making, and automation to optimize water and nutrient usage while minimizing human intervention. This paper explores the opportunities and challenges of IoT-based soilless farming, highlighting its role in sustainable agriculture, urban farming, and global food security. These advanced farming methods ensure greater productivity, resource conservation, and year-round cultivation. However, they also face challenges such as high initial investment, technological dependency, and energy consumption. Through a comprehensive study, bibliometric analysis, and comparative analysis, this research highlights current trends and research gaps. It also outlines future directions for researchers, policymakers, and industry stakeholders to drive innovation and scalability in IoT-driven soilless agriculture. By emphasizing the benefits of vertical farming and Controlled Environment Agriculture (CEA)-enabled soilless techniques, this paper supports informed decision-making to address food security challenges and promote sustainable agricultural innovations.</description>

      <title>Learning Beamforming Codebooks for Active Sensing with Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19046v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores the design of beamforming codebooks for the base station (BS) and for the reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) in an active sensing scheme for uplink localization, in which the mobile user transmits a sequence of pilots to the BS through reflection at the RISs, and the BS and the RISs are adaptively configured by carefully choosing BS beamforming codeword and RIS codewords from their respective codebooks in a sequential manner to progressively focus onto the user. Most existing codebook designs for RIS are not tailored for active sensing, by which we mean the choice of the next codeword should depend on the measurements made so far, and the sequence of codewords should dynamically focus reflection toward the user. Moreover, most existing codeword selection methods rely on exhaustive search in beam training to identify the codeword with the highest signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), thus incurring substantial pilot overhead as the size of the codebook scales. This paper proposes a learning-based approach for codebook construction and for codeword selection for active sensing. The proposed learning approach aims to locate a target in the service area by recursively selecting a sequence of BS beamforming codewords and RIS codewords from the respective codebooks as more measurements become available without exhaustive beam training. The codebook design and the codeword selection fuse key ideas from the vector quantized variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE) and the long short-term memory (LSTM) network to learn respectively the discrete function space of the codebook and the temporal dependencies between measurements.</description>

      <title>Near-Field THz Bending Beamforming: A Convex Optimization Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20274v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Terahertz (THz) communication systems suffer severe
  blockage issues, which may significantly degrade the communica tion coverage and quality. Bending beams, capable of adjusting
  their propagation direction to bypass obstacles, have recently
  emerged as a promising solution to resolve this issue by engineer ing the propagation trajectory of the beam. However, traditional
  bending beam generation methods rely heavily on the specific
  geometric properties of the propagation trajectory and can only
  achieve sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose a new
  and general bending beamforming method by adopting the convex
  optimization techniques. In particular, we formulate the bending
  beamforming design as a max-min optimization problem, aiming
  to optimize the analog or digital transmit beamforming vector to
  maximize the minimum received signal power among all positions
  along the bending beam trajectory. However, the resulting problem
  is non-convex and difficult to be solved optimally. To tackle this
  difficulty, we apply the successive convex approximation (SCA)
  technique to obtain a high-quality suboptimal solution. Numerical
  results show that our proposed bending beamforming method
  outperforms the traditional method and shows robustness to the
  obstacle in the environment.</description>

      <title>Optimal vintage factor analysis with deflation varimax</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10545v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vintage factor analysis is one important type of factor analysis that aims to first find a low-dimensional representation of the original data, and then to seek a rotation such that the rotated low-dimensional representation is scientifically meaningful. The most widely used vintage factor analysis is the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) followed by the varimax rotation. Despite its popularity, little theoretical guarantee can be provided to date mainly because varimax rotation requires to solve a non-convex optimization over the set of orthogonal matrices.
  In this paper, we propose a deflation varimax procedure that solves each row of an orthogonal matrix sequentially. In addition to its net computational gain and flexibility, we are able to fully establish theoretical guarantees for the proposed procedure in a broader context. Adopting this new deflation varimax as the second step after PCA, we further analyze this two step procedure under a general class of factor models. Our results show that it estimates the factor loading matrix in the minimax optimal rate when the signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) is moderate or large. In the low SNR regime, we offer possible improvement over using PCA and the deflation varimax when the additive noise under the factor model is structured. The modified procedure is shown to be minimax optimal in all SNR regimes. Our theory is valid for finite sample and allows the number of the latent factors to grow with the sample size as well as the ambient dimension to grow with, or even exceed, the sample size. Extensive simulation and real data analysis further corroborate our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Opportunistic User Scheduling for Secure RIS-aided Wireless Communications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02963v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide expressions for the secrecy outage probability (SOP) for suboptimal and optimal opportunistic scheduling schemes in a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) aided {single antenna} system with multiple eavesdroppers in approximate closed form. A suboptimal scheduling (SS) scheme is analyzed, which is used when the channel state information (CSI) of the eavesdropping links is unavailable, and the optimal scheduling (OS) scheme is also analyzed, which is used when the global CSI is available. For each scheme, we provide a simplified expression for the SOP in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime to demonstrate its behavior as a function of the key system parameters. At high SNR, the SOP saturates to a constant level which decreases exponentially with the number of RIS elements in the SS scheme and with the product of the number of RIS elements and the number of users in the OS scheme. We also show that the derived SOP of the SS scheme can directly provide the SOP for the best antenna-user pair scheduling scheme in a multiple antenna system. We compare the performance of the opportunistic user scheduling schemes with that of a non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) based scheduling scheme which chooses a pair of users in each time slot for scheduling and we show that the opportunistic schemes outperform the NOMA-based scheme. We also derive a closed-form expression for the SOP of a decode-and-forward (DF) relay-aided scheduling scheme in order to compare it with that of the RIS-aided system. It is found that the RIS-aided system outperforms the relay-aided systems when the number of RIS elements is sufficiently large. An increased number of RIS elements is required to outperform the relay-aided system at higher operating frequencies.</description>

      <title>Channel Orthogonalization in Panel-Based LIS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01919v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large intelligent surface (LIS) has gained momentum as a potential 6G-enabling technology that expands the benefits of massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO). On the other hand, orthogonal space-division multiplexing (OSDM) may give a promising direction for efficient exploitation of the spatial resources, analogous as what is achieved with orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) in the frequency domain. To this end, we study how to enforce channel orthogonality in a panel-based LIS (P-LIS) scenario. Our proposed method consists of having a subset of active LIS-panels coherently serving a set of users, and another subset of LIS-panels operating in a novel low-power mode by implementing a receive and re-transmit (RRTx) process. This results in an inter-symbol interference (ISI) channel, where we characterize the RRTx processing required to achieve simultaneous orthogonality in time and space. We then employ the remaining degrees of freedom (DoFs) from the orthogonality constraint to minimize the RRTx processing power, where we derive a closed-form global minimizer, allowing for efficient implementation of the proposed scheme.</description>

      <title>Inverse Particle Filter</title>

Abstract: In cognitive systems, recent emphasis has been placed on studying the cognitive processes of the subject whose behavior was the primary focus of the system's cognitive response. This approach, known as inverse cognition, arises in counter-adversarial applications and has motivated the development of inverse Bayesian filters. In this context, a cognitive adversary, such as a radar, uses a forward Bayesian filter to track its target of interest. An inverse filter is then employed to infer the adversary's estimate of the target's or defender's state. Previous studies have addressed this inverse filtering problem by introducing methods like the inverse Kalman filter (KF), inverse extended KF, and inverse unscented KF. However, these filters typically assume additive Gaussian noise models and/or rely on local approximations of non-linear dynamics at the state estimates, limiting their practical application. In contrast, this paper adopts a global filtering approach and presents the development of an inverse particle filter (I-PF). The particle filter framework employs Monte Carlo (MC) methods to approximate arbitrary posterior distributions. Moreover, under mild system-level conditions, the proposed I-PF demonstrates convergence to the optimal inverse filter. Additionally, we propose the differentiable I-PF to address scenarios where system information is unknown to the defender. Using the recursive Cramer-Rao lower bound and non-credibility index (NCI), our numerical experiments for different systems demonstrate the estimation performance and time complexity of the proposed filter.</description>

      <title>Multi-User MISO with Stacked Intelligent Metasurfaces: A DRL-Based Sum-Rate Optimization Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04837v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIMs) represent a novel signal processing paradigm that enables over-the-air processing of electromagnetic waves at the speed of light. Their multi-layer architecture exhibits customizable computational capabilities compared to conventional single-layer reconfigurable intelligent surfaces and metasurface lenses. In this paper, we deploy SIM to improve the performance of multi-user multiple-input single-output (MISO) wireless systems through a low complexity manner with reduced numbers of transmit radio frequency chains. In particular, an optimization formulation for the joint design of the SIM phase shifts and the transmit power allocation is presented, which is efficiently tackled via a customized deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach that systematically explores pre-designed states of the SIM-parametrized smart wireless environment. The presented performance evaluation results demonstrate the proposed method's capability to effectively learn from the wireless environment, while consistently outperforming conventional precoding schemes under low transmit power conditions. Furthermore, the implementation of hyperparameter tuning and whitening process significantly enhance the robustness of the proposed DRL framework.</description>

Abstract: Effective processing, interpretation, and management of sensor data have emerged as a critical component of cyber-physical systems. Traditionally, processing sensor data requires profound theoretical knowledge and proficiency in signal-processing tools. However, recent works show that Large Language Models (LLMs) have promising capabilities in processing sensory data, suggesting their potential as copilots for developing sensing systems.
  To explore this potential, we construct a comprehensive benchmark, SensorBench, to establish a quantifiable objective. The benchmark incorporates diverse real-world sensor datasets for various tasks. The results show that while LLMs exhibit considerable proficiency in simpler tasks, they face inherent challenges in processing compositional tasks with parameter selections compared to engineering experts. Additionally, we investigate four prompting strategies for sensor processing and show that self-verification can outperform all other baselines in 48% of tasks. Our study provides a comprehensive benchmark and prompting analysis for future developments, paving the way toward an LLM-based sensor processing copilot.</description>

      <title>Goal-oriented Semantic Communications for Metaverse Construction via Generative AI and Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16187v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The emergence of the metaverse has boosted productivity and creativity, driving real-time updates and personalized content, which will substantially increase data traffic. However, current bit-oriented communication networks struggle to manage this high volume of dynamic information, restricting metaverse applications interactivity. To address this research gap, we propose a goal-oriented semantic communication (GSC) framework for metaverse. Building on an existing metaverse wireless construction task, our proposed GSC framework includes an hourglass network-based (HgNet) encoder to extract semantic information of objects in the metaverse; and a semantic decoder that uses this extracted information to reconstruct the metaverse content after wireless transmission, enabling efficient communication and real-time object behaviour updates to the scenery for metaverse construction task. To overcome the wireless channel noise at the receiver, we design an optimal transport (OT)-enabled semantic denoiser, which enhances the accuracy of metaverse scenery through wireless communication. Experimental results show that compared to the conventional metaverse construction, our proposed GSC framework significantly reduces wireless metaverse construction latency by 92.6\%, while improving metaverse object status accuracy and viewing experience by 45.6\% and 44.7\%, respectively.</description>

      <title>Prompt-Enabled Large AI Models for CSI Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10629v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a promising tool for channel state information (CSI) feedback. While recent research primarily focuses on improving feedback accuracy on a specific dataset through novel architectures, the underlying mechanism of AI-based CSI feedback remains unclear. This study explores the mechanism through analyzing performance across diverse datasets, with findings suggesting that superior feedback performance stems from AI models' strong fitting capabilities and their ability to leverage environmental knowledge. Building on these findings, we propose a prompt-enabled large AI model (LAM) for CSI feedback. The LAM employs powerful transformer blocks and is trained on extensive datasets from various scenarios. To further enhance reconstruction quality, the channel distribution (environmental knowledge) -- represented as the mean of channel magnitude in the angular domain -- is incorporated as a prompt within the decoder. Simulation results confirm that the proposed prompt-enabled LAM significantly improves feedback accuracy and generalization performance while reducing data collection requirements in new scenarios.</description>

      <title>Channel Estimation for Pinching-Antenna Systems (PASS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13268v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pinching Antennas (PAs) represent a revolutionary flexible antenna technology that leverages dielectric waveguides and electromagnetic coupling to mitigate large-scale path loss. This letter is the first to explore channel estimation for Pinching-Antenna SyStems (PASS), addressing their uniquely ill-conditioned and underdetermined channel characteristics. In particular, two efficient deep learning-based channel estimators are proposed. 1) PAMoE: This estimator incorporates dynamic padding, feature embedding, fusion, and mixture of experts (MoE) modules, which effectively leverage the positional information of PAs and exploit expert diversity. 2) PAformer: This Transformer-style estimator employs the self-attention mechanism to predict channel coefficients in a per-antenna manner, which offers more flexibility to adaptively deal with dynamic numbers of PAs in practical deployment. Numerical results demonstrate that 1) the proposed deep learning-based channel estimators outperform conventional methods and exhibit excellent zero-shot learning capabilities, and 2) PAMoE delivers higher channel estimation accuracy via MoE specialization, while PAformer natively handles an arbitrary number of PAs, trading self-attention complexity for superior scalability.</description>
