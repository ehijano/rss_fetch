      <title>Data Driven Air Entrainment Velocity Parameterization by Breaking Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wave breaking injects turbulence and bubbles into the upper ocean, modulating air-sea exchange of momentum, heat, gases, and sea-spray aerosols. These fluxes depend nonlinearly on sea state but remain poorly represented in coupled atmosphere-wave-ocean models, where air-entrainment velocity is often parameterized using wind speed or significant wave height alone. We develop a global machine-learning parameterization of Va trained on a 43-year WAVEWATCH III simulation that resolves the breaker-front distribution and associated energetics. A multilayer perceptron with seven physically motivated predictors (wind speed, wave height, wave age, steepness, direction, and depth) reproduces spectral-reference Va with high skill. The model reduces longstanding biases in bulk formulas, notably overestimation in swell-dominated low latitudes and underestimation in storm tracks. Applied globally, it improves bubble-mediated CO2 transfer velocity and sea-salt aerosol emission, reducing errors by an order of magnitude. Validation against independent HiWinGS observations supports robust deep-water performance.</description>

      <title>Where Does Tracing of Cosmic Ray in Real Atmosphere Terminate?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In backtracing simulations, which are widely employed to determine cosmic-ray particle trajectories in the geomagnetic field, the atmosphere is typically approximated as an artificial sharp boundary at some low altitude where the traced trajectory terminates. In this paper, we extend beyond this simplified assumption and investigate two realistic physical processes that terminate cosmic-ray particle propagation in the atmosphere: Bethe-Bloch energy loss mechanisms and hard scattering interactions with atmospheric atoms using total cross sections based on the Glauber-Gribov formalism. The former mechanism dominates at low rigidities (for protons below $\sim0.57$~GV), while the latter becomes dominant at higher rigidities. Consequently, we introduce two dimensionless variables up to detailed numerical criteria: the relative rigidity shift due to Bethe-Bloch effects ($\Delta\mathfrak{R}/\mathfrak{R}$), and the expected number of hard scattering events ($\langle N\rangle$). Using the corrected US Standard Atmosphere 1976 model, we demonstrate that the altitude dependence can be factorized as approximately $\exp(-0.14h/\textrm{km})$. Additionally, the effect of the local curvature radius of the trajectory near perigee can be similarly factorized. Our calculations indicate that the simplified sharp-boundary altitude should be at least $50$ km with $\Delta\mathfrak{R}/\mathfrak{R}+\langle N\rangle\lesssim1$ for protons, increasing by more than $15$ km for heavy nuclei such as iron.</description>

      <title>WIND: Weather Inverse Diffusion for Zero-Shot Atmospheric Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning has revolutionized weather and climate modeling, yet the current landscape remains fragmented: highly specialized models are typically trained individually for distinct tasks. To unify this landscape, we introduce WIND, a single pre-trained foundation model capable of replacing specialized baselines across a vast array of tasks. Crucially, in contrast to previous atmospheric foundation models, we achieve this without any task-specific fine-tuning. To learn a robust, task-agnostic prior of the atmosphere, we pre-train WIND with a self-supervised video reconstruction objective, utilizing an unconditional video diffusion model to iteratively reconstruct atmospheric dynamics from a noisy state. At inference, we frame diverse domain-specific problems strictly as inverse problems and solve them via posterior sampling. This unified approach allows us to tackle highly relevant weather and climate problems, including probabilistic forecasting, spatial and temporal downscaling, sparse reconstruction and enforcing conservation laws purely with our pre-trained model. We further demonstrate the model's capacity to generate physically consistent counterfactual storylines of extreme weather events under global warming scenarios. By combining generative video modeling with inverse problem solving, WIND offers a computationally efficient paradigm shift in AI-based atmospheric modeling.</description>

      <title>Machine learning emulation of precipitation from km-scale UK regional climate simulations using a diffusion model</title>

Abstract: High-resolution climate simulations are valuable for understanding climate change impacts. This has motivated use of regional convection-permitting climate models (CPMs), but these are very computationally expensive. We present a convection-permitting model generative emulator (CPMGEM), to skilfully emulate precipitation simulations by a 2.2km-resolution regional CPM at much lower cost. This utilises a generative machine learning approach, a diffusion model. It takes inputs at the 60km resolution of the driving global climate model and downscales these to 8.8km, with daily-mean time resolution, capturing the effect of convective processes represented in the CPM at these scales. The emulator is trained on simulations over England and Wales from the United Kingdom Climate Projections Local product, covering years between 1980 and 2080 following a high emissions scenario. The output precipitation has a similar spatial structure and intensity distribution as in the CPM simulations. The emulator is stochastic, which improves the realism of samples. We include some evidence about the emulator's skill for extreme events with return times up to ~100 years. We demonstrate successful transfer from a "perfect model" training setting to application using GCM variable inputs. It captures the main features of the simulated 21st century climate change, but exhibits some error in the magnitude. We also show that the method can be useful in situations with limited amounts of high-resolution data. Potential applications include producing high-resolution precipitation predictions for large-ensemble climate simulations and producing output based on different GCMs and climate change scenarios to better sample uncertainty.</description>

      <title>HiRO-ACE: Fast and skillful AI emulation and downscaling trained on a 3 km global storm-resolving model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18224v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kilometer-scale simulations of the atmosphere are an important tool for assessing local weather extremes and climate impacts, but computational expense limits their use to small regions, short periods, and limited ensembles. Machine learning offers a pathway to efficiently emulate these high-resolution simulations. Here we introduce HiRO-ACE, a two-stage AI modeling framework combining a stochastic version of the Ai2 Climate Emulator (ACE2S) with diffusion-based downscaling (HiRO) to generate 3 km precipitation fields over arbitrary regions of the globe. Both components are trained on data derived from a decade of atmospheric simulation by X-SHiELD, a 3 km global storm-resolving model. HiRO performs a 32x downscaling--generating 3 km 6-hourly precipitation from coarse 100 km inputs by training on paired high-resolution and coarsened X-SHiELD outputs. ACE2S is a $1^\circ \times 1^\circ$ ($\sim$100 km) stochastic autoregressive global atmosphere emulator that maintains grid-scale precipitation variability consistent with coarsened X-SHiELD, enabling its outputs to be ingested by HiRO without additional tuning. HiRO-ACE reproduces the distribution of extreme precipitation rates through the 99.99th percentile, with time-mean precipitation biases below 10% almost everywhere. The framework generates plausible tropical cyclones, fronts, and convective events from poorly resolved coarse inputs. Its computational efficiency allows generation of 6-hourly high-resolution regional precipitation for decades of simulated climate within a single day using one H100 GPU, while the probabilistic design enables ensemble generation for quantifying uncertainty. This establishes an AI-enabled pathway for affordably leveraging the realism of expensive km-scale simulations to support local climate adaptation planning and extreme event risk assessment.</description>

      <title>DAISI: Data Assimilation with Inverse Sampling using Stochastic Interpolants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00252v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data assimilation (DA) is a cornerstone of scientific and engineering applications, combining model forecasts with sparse and noisy observations to estimate latent system states. Classical high-dimensional DA methods, such as the ensemble Kalman filter, rely on Gaussian approximations that are violated for complex dynamics or observation operators. To address this limitation, we introduce DAISI, a scalable filtering algorithm built on flow-based generative models that enables flexible probabilistic inference using data-driven priors. The core idea is to use a stationary, pre-trained generative prior that first incorporates forecast information through a novel inverse-sampling step, before assimilating observations via guidance-based conditional sampling. This allows us to leverage any forecasting model as part of the DA pipeline without having to retrain or fine-tune the generative prior at each assimilation step. Experiments on challenging nonlinear systems show that DAISI achieves accurate filtering results in regimes with sparse, noisy, and nonlinear observations where traditional methods struggle.</description>

      <title>Social Cost of Greenhouse Gases -- OPTiMEM and the Heat Conjecture(s)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06085v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite well-meaning scenarios that propose global CO2 emissions will decline presented in every IPCC report since 1988, the trend of global CO2 increase continues without significant change. Even if any individual nation manages to flatten its emissions, what matters is the trajectory of the globe. Together the gulf between climate science and climate economics, plus the urgent need for alternative methods of estimation, provided the incentives for development of our Ocean-Heat-Content (OHC) Physics and Time Macro Economic Model (OPTiMEM) system.
  To link NOAA damages to climate required creating a carbon consumption model to drive a physics model of climate. How fast could carbon be burned and how much coal, oil and natural gas was reasonably available? A carbon model driving climate meant burning the carbon, and modelling how the earth heated up. We developed this using the most recent best greenhouse gas equations and production models for CO2, CH4, N2O, and halogenated gases. This developed an ocean heat content model for the globe. Each step is validated against Known carbon consumption, CO2, temperature, and ocean heat content. This allows a physics founded model of climate costs to be projected.</description>
