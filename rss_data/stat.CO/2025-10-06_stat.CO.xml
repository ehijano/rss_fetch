      <title>Alzheimer's Clinical Research Data via R Packages: the alzverse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sharing clinical research data is essential for advancing research in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other therapeutic areas. However, challenges in data accessibility, standardization, documentation, usability, and reproducibility continue to impede this goal. In this article, we highlight the advantages of using R packages to overcome these challenges using two examples. The A4LEARN R package includes data from a randomized trial (the Anti-Amyloid Treatment in Asymptomatic Alzheimer's [A4] study) and its companion observational study of biomarker negative individuals (the Longitudinal Evaluation of Amyloid Risk and Neurodegeneration [LEARN] study). The ADNIMERGE2 R package includes data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), a longitudinal observational biomarker and imaging study. These packages collect data, documentation, and reproducible analysis vignettes into a portable bundle that can be installed and browsed within commonly used R programming environments. We also introduce the alzverse package which leverages a common data standard to combine study-specific data packages to facilitate meta-analyses. By promoting collaboration, transparency, and reproducibility, R data packages can play a vital role in accelerating clinical research.</description>

      <title>HOMC: A MATLAB Package for Higher Order Markov Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a MATLAB package, which is the first of its kind, for Higher Order Markov Chains (HOMC). It can be used to easily compute all important quantities in our recent works relevant to higher order Markov chains, such as the $k$-step transition tensor, limiting probability distribution, ever-reaching probability tensor, and mean first passage time tensor. It can also be used to check whether a higher order chain is ergodic or regular, to construct the transition matrix of the associated reduced first order chain, and to determine whether a state is recurrent or transient. A key function in the package is an implementation of the tensor ``box'' product which has a probabilistic interpretation and is different from other tensor products in the literature. This HOMC package is useful to researchers and practitioners alike for tasks such as numerical experimentation and algorithm prototyping involving higher order Markov chains.</description>

      <title>A fast non-reversible sampler for Bayesian finite mixture models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finite mixtures are a cornerstone of Bayesian modelling, and it is well-known that sampling from the resulting posterior distribution can be a hard task. In particular, popular reversible Markov chain Monte Carlo schemes are often slow to converge when the number of observations $n$ is large. In this paper we introduce a novel and simple non-reversible sampling scheme for Bayesian finite mixture models, which is shown to drastically outperform classical samplers in many scenarios of interest, especially during convergence phase and when components in the mixture have non-negligible overlap. At the theoretical level, we show that the performance of the proposed non-reversible scheme cannot be worse than the standard one, in terms of asymptotic variance, by more than a factor of four; and we provide a scaling limit analysis suggesting that the non-reversible sampler can reduce the convergence time from O$(n^2)$ to O$(n)$. We also discuss why the statistical features of mixture models make them an ideal case for the use of non-reversible discrete samplers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adaptive randomized pivoting (ARP) is a recently proposed and highly effective algorithm for column subset selection. This paper reinterprets the ARP algorithm by drawing connections to the volume sampling distribution and active learning algorithms for linear regression. As consequences, this paper presents new analysis for the ARP algorithm and faster implementations using rejection sampling.</description>

      <title>Model Falsification for Predicting Dynamical Responses of Uncertain Structural Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of dynamical response of structural system depends on the correct modeling of that system. However, modeling becomes increasingly challenging when there are many candidate models available to describe the system behavior. Furthermore, uncertainties can be present even for the parameters of these model classes. The plausibility of each input-output model class of the structures with uncertain components can be determined by a Bayesian approach from measured dynamic responses to one or more input records; predictions of the structural system response to alternate input records can then be made. However, this approach may require many model simulations, even though most of those model classes are quite implausible. An approach is proposed herein to use a bound, computed from the false discovery rate, on the likelihood of measured data to falsify models considering uncertainties in the passive control devices that do not reproduce the measured data to sufficient accuracy. Response prediction is then performed using the unfalsified models in an approximate Bayesian sense by assigning weights, computed from the likelihoods, only to the unfalsified models approach incurring only a fraction of the computational cost of the standard Bayesian approach. The proposed approach for response prediction is illustrated using three structural examples: an earthquake-excited four--degree-of-freedom building model with a hysteretic isolation layer; a 1623--degree-of-freedom three-dimensional building model, with tuned mass dampers attached to its roof, subjected to wind loads; and a full-scale four-story base-isolated building tested on world's largest shake table in Japan's E-Defense lab. The results exhibit accurate response predictions and significant computational savings, thereby illustrating the potential of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>A fast, flexible simulation framework for Bayesian adaptive designs -- the R package BATSS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02050v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The use of Bayesian adaptive designs for randomised controlled trials has been hindered by the lack of software readily available to statisticians. We have developed a new software package (Bayesian Adaptive Trials Simulator Software - BATSS for the statistical software R, which provides a flexible structure for the fast simulation of Bayesian adaptive designs for clinical trials. We illustrate how the BATSS package can be used to define and evaluate the operating characteristics of Bayesian adaptive designs for various different types of primary outcomes (e.g., those that follow a normal, binary, Poisson or negative binomial distribution) and can incorporate the most common types of adaptations: stopping treatments (or the entire trial) for efficacy or futility, and Bayesian response adaptive randomisation - based on user-defined adaptation rules. Other important features of this highly modular package include: the use of (Integrated Nested) Laplace approximations to compute posterior distributions, parallel processing on a computer or a cluster, customisability, adjustment for covariates and a wide range of available conditional distributions for the response.</description>

      <title>Deterministic and Stochastic Frank-Wolfe Recursion on Probability Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00307v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by applications in emergency response and experimental design, we consider smooth stochastic optimization problems over probability measures supported on compact subsets of the Euclidean space. With the influence function as the variational object, we construct a deterministic Frank-Wolfe (dFW) recursion for probability spaces, made especially possible by a lemma that identifies a ``closed-form'' solution to the infinite-dimensional Frank-Wolfe sub-problem. Each iterate in dFW is expressed as a convex combination of the incumbent iterate and a Dirac measure concentrating on the minimum of the influence function at the incumbent iterate. To address common application contexts that have access only to Monte Carlo observations of the objective and influence function, we construct a stochastic Frank-Wolfe (sFW) variation that generates a random sequence of probability measures constructed using minima of increasingly accurate estimates of the influence function. We demonstrate that sFW's optimality gap sequence exhibits $O(k^{-1})$ iteration complexity almost surely and in expectation for smooth convex objectives, and $O(k^{-1/2})$ (in Frank-Wolfe gap) for smooth non-convex objectives. Furthermore, we show that an easy-to-implement fixed-step, fixed-sample version of (sFW) exhibits exponential convergence to $\varepsilon$-optimality. We end with a central limit theorem on the observed objective values at the sequence of generated random measures. To further intuition, we include several illustrative examples with exact influence function calculations.</description>

      <title>Restricted Spectral Gap Decomposition for Simulated Tempering Targeting Mixture Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15059v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulated tempering is a widely used strategy for sampling from multimodal distributions. In this paper, we consider simulated tempering combined with an arbitrary local Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler and present a new decomposition theorem that provides a lower bound on the restricted spectral gap of the algorithm for sampling from mixture distributions. By working with the restricted spectral gap, the applicability of our results is extended to broader settings such as when the usual spectral gap is difficult to bound or becomes degenerate. We demonstrate the application of our theoretical results by analyzing simulated tempering combined with random walk Metropolis--Hastings for sampling from mixtures of Gaussian distributions. Our complexity bound scales polynomially with the separation between modes, logarithmically with $1/\varepsilon$, where $\varepsilon$ denotes the target accuracy in total variation distance, and exponentially with the dimension $d$.</description>

      <title>Injecting Measurement Information Yields a Fast and Noise-Robust Diffusion-Based Inverse Problem Solver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02964v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have been firmly established as principled zero-shot solvers for linear and nonlinear inverse problems, owing to their powerful image prior and iterative sampling algorithm. These approaches often rely on Tweedie's formula, which relates the diffusion variate $\mathbf{x}_t$ to the posterior mean $\mathbb{E} [\mathbf{x}_0 | \mathbf{x}_t]$, in order to guide the diffusion trajectory with an estimate of the final denoised sample $\mathbf{x}_0$. However, this does not consider information from the measurement $\mathbf{y}$, which must then be integrated downstream. In this work, we propose to estimate the conditional posterior mean $\mathbb{E} [\mathbf{x}_0 | \mathbf{x}_t, \mathbf{y}]$, which can be formulated as the solution to a lightweight, single-parameter maximum likelihood estimation problem. The resulting prediction can be integrated into any standard sampler, resulting in a fast and memory-efficient inverse solver. Our optimizer is amenable to a noise-aware likelihood-based stopping criteria that is robust to measurement noise in $\mathbf{y}$. We demonstrate comparable or improved performance against a wide selection of contemporary inverse solvers across multiple datasets and tasks.</description>
