      <title>A Safer, Smaller, Cleaner Subcritical Thorium Fission - Deuteron Fusion Hybrid Reactor: DD Collider Instead of Muonic Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fossil fuels, which meet most of humanity's energy needs, cause climate change due to their high carbon emissions. There are two types of energy sources that can replace fossil fuels: renewable and nuclear. Nuclear energy sources are more advantageous in terms of efficiency and sustainability. The use of Thorium as nuclear fuel in fusion reactors will contribute to the reduction of radioactive waste, due to the much lower production of transuranics. Fusion reactors, which are considered promising, are still in the R&amp;D phase. In this respect, hybrid fusion-fission reactors seem more promising and the recently proposed combination of muon-catalyzed DD fusion with a cascade thorium reactor is worthy of appreciation. In this study, we show that using the DD collider instead of muonic fusion has significant advantages.</description>

      <title>A double multi-turn injection scheme for generating mixed helium and carbon ion beams at medical synchrotron facilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The almost identical charge-to-mass ratios of fully ionized helium-4 and carbon-12 ions enable simultaneous acceleration in hadron therapy synchrotrons. At the same energy per mass, helium ions exhibit a stopping range approximately three times greater than carbon ions. They can therefore be exploited for online range verification downstream of the patient during carbon ion beam irradiation. One possibility for creating this mixed beam is accelerating the two ion species sequentially through the LINAC and subsequently "mixing" them at injection energy in the synchrotron with a double injection scheme. This work reports the first successful generation, acceleration, and extraction of a mixed helium and carbon ion beam using this double multi-turn injection scheme, which was achieved at the MedAustron therapy accelerator in Austria. A description of the double multi-turn injection scheme, particle tracking simulations, and details on the implementation at the MedAustron accelerator facility are presented and discussed. Finally, measurements of the mixed beam at delivery in the irradiation room using a radiochromic film and a low-gain avalanche diode (LGAD) detector are presented.</description>

      <title>Radiation of a particle performing helical motion in a multilayer cylindrical waveguide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: - An algorithm for calculating the radiation field of a charged point particle performing a spiral motion in an infinite cylindrical waveguide with a multilayer side wall is found. The number of layers and their filling is arbitrary. The axis of the spiral is aligned with the axis of the waveguide, so that the geometry of the problem has cylindrical symmetry. Explicit expressions for modal frequency distributions and equations for resonant frequencies for single-layer and double-layer waveguides are given. Examples of graphical constructions of modal frequency distributions of modes for single-layer (resistive), double-layer (metal-dielectric) and triple-layer (metal-dielectric with internal NEG coating) waveguides are presented.</description>

      <title>Concept of an Infrared FEL for the Chemical Dynamics Research Laboratory at PETRA IV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe an infrared free electron laser (FEL), proposed as a part of a user facility that also incorporates synchrotron-radiation beamlines for the PETRA IV. The FEL itself addresses the needs of the chemical sciences community for a high-brightness, tunable source covering a broad region of the infrared spectrum - from 5 to 100 mkm. The user facility will allow, for the first time, the integrated and simultaneous use of dedicated infrared FEL and synchrotron-radiation beamlines for pump-probe experiments that will focus on gaining a rigorous molecular-level understanding of combustion and other energetic molecular processes. These (pump-probe) requirements dictate the use of storage ring RF structures and cw operation. The technical approach adopted in FEL design uses an old PETRA III RF system and accelerating cavities. The primary motivation for adopting this approach was to minimize facility costs.</description>
