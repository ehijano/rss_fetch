      <title>Function-valued marked spatial point processes on linear networks: application to urban cycling profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the literature on spatial point processes, there is an emerging challenge in studying marked point processes with points being labelled by functions. In this paper, we focus on point processes living on linear networks and, from distinct points of view, propose several marked summary characteristics that are of great use in studying the average association and dispersion of the function-valued marks. Through a simulation study, we evaluate the performance of our proposed marked summary characteristics, both when marks are independent and when some sort of spatial dependence is evident among them. Finally, we employ our proposed mark summary characteristics to study the spatial structure of urban cycling profiles in Vancouver, Canada.</description>

      <title>Two Stage Least Squares with Time-Varying Instruments: An Application to an Evaluation of Treatment Intensification for Type-2 Diabetes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As longitudinal data becomes more available in many settings, policy makers are increasingly interested in the effect of time-varying treatments (e.g. sustained treatment strategies). In settings such as this, the preferred analysis techniques are the g-methods, however these require the untestable assumption of no unmeasured confounding. Instrumental variable analyses can minimise bias through unmeasured confounding. Of these methods, the Two Stage Least Squares technique is one of the most well used in Econometrics, but it has not been fully extended, and evaluated, in full time-varying settings. This paper proposes a robust two stage least squares method for the econometric evaluation of time-varying treatment. Using a simulation study we found that, unlike standard two stage least squares, it performs relatively well across a wide range of circumstances, including model misspecification. It compares well with recent time-varying instrument approaches via g-estimation. We illustrate the methods in an evaluation of treatment intensification for Type-2 Diabetes Mellitus, exploring the exogeneity in prescribing preferences to operationalise a time-varying instrument.</description>

      <title>High-dimensional Covariance Estimation by Pairwise Likelihood Truncation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pairwise likelihood offers a useful approximation to the full likelihood function for covariance estimation in high-dimensional context. It simplifies high-dimensional dependencies by combining marginal bivariate likelihood objects, thereby making estimation more manageable. In certain models, including the Gaussian model, both pairwise and full likelihoods are known to be maximized by the same parameter values, thus retaining optimal statistical efficiency, when the number of variables is fixed. Leveraging this insight, we introduce the estimation of sparse high-dimensional covariance matrices by maximizing a truncated version of the pairwise likelihood function, which focuses on pairwise terms corresponding to nonzero covariance elements. To achieve a meaningful truncation, we propose to minimize the discrepancy between pairwise and full likelihood scores plus an L1-penalty discouraging the inclusion of uninformative terms. Differently from other regularization approaches, our method selects whole pairwise likelihood objects rather than individual covariance parameters, thus retaining the inherent unbiasedness of the pairwise likelihood estimating equations. This selection procedure is shown to have the selection consistency property as the covariance dimension increases exponentially fast. As a result, the implied pairwise likelihood estimator is consistent and converges to the oracle maximum likelihood estimator that assumes knowledge of nonzero covariance entries.</description>

      <title>Direct estimation and inference of higher-level correlations from lower-level measurements with applications in gene-pathway and proteomics studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper tackles the challenge of estimating correlations between higher-level biological variables (e.g., proteins and gene pathways) when only lower-level measurements are directly observed (e.g., peptides and individual genes). Existing methods typically aggregate lower-level data into higher-level variables and then estimate correlations based on the aggregated data. However, different data aggregation methods can yield varying correlation estimates as they target different higher-level quantities. Our solution is a latent factor model that directly estimates these higher-level correlations from lower-level data without the need for data aggregation. We further introduce a shrinkage estimator to ensure the positive definiteness and improve the accuracy of the estimated correlation matrix. Furthermore, we establish the asymptotic normality of our estimator, enabling efficient computation of p-values for the identification of significant correlations. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated through comprehensive simulations and the analysis of proteomics and gene expression datasets. We develop the R package highcor for implementing our method.</description>

      <title>Calibrating satellite maps with field data for improved predictions of forest biomass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatially explicit quantification of forest biomass is important for forest-health monitoring and carbon accounting. Direct field measurements of biomass are laborious and expensive, typically limiting their spatial and temporal sampling density and therefore the precision and resolution of the resulting inference. Satellites can provide biomass predictions at a far greater density, but these predictions are often biased relative to field measurements and exhibit heterogeneous errors. We developed and implemented a coregionalization model between sparse field measurements and a predictive satellite map to deliver improved predictions of biomass density at a 1-by-1 km resolution throughout the Pacific states of California, Oregon and Washington. The model accounts for zero-inflation in the field measurements and the heterogeneous errors in the satellite predictions. A stochastic partial differential equation approach to spatial modeling is applied to handle the magnitude of the satellite data. The spatial detail rendered by the model is much finer than would be possible with the field measurements alone, and the model provides substantial noise-filtering and bias-correction to the satellite map.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several new geometric quantile-based measures for multivariate dispersion, skewness, kurtosis, and spherical asymmetry are defined. These measures differ from existing measures, which use volumes and are easy to calculate. Some theoretical justification is given, followed by experiments illustrating that they are reasonable measures of these distributional characteristics and computing confidence regions with the desired coverage.</description>

      <title>Towards Complete Causal Explanation with Expert Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of restricting Markov equivalence classes of maximal ancestral graphs (MAGs) containing certain edge marks, which we refer to as expert knowledge. MAGs forming a Markov equivalence class can be uniquely represented by an essential ancestral graph. We seek to learn the restriction of the essential ancestral graph containing the proposed expert knowledge. Our contributions are several-fold. First, we prove certain properties for the entire Markov equivalence class including a conjecture from Ali et al. (2009). Second, we present three sound graphical orientation rules, two of which generalize previously known rules, for adding expert knowledge to an essential graph. We also show that some orientation rules of Zhang (2008) are not needed for restricting the Markov equivalence class with expert knowledge. We provide an algorithm for including this expert knowledge and show that our algorithm is complete in certain settings i.e., in these settings, the output of our algorithm is a restricted essential ancestral graph. We conjecture this algorithm is complete generally. Outside of our specified settings, we provide an algorithm for checking whether a graph is a restricted essential graph and discuss its runtime. This work can be seen as a generalization of Meek (1995).</description>

      <title>Learning treatment effects while treating those in need</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many social programs attempt to allocate scarce resources to people with the greatest need. Indeed, public services increasingly use algorithmic risk assessments motivated by this goal. However, targeting the highest-need recipients often conflicts with attempting to evaluate the causal effect of the program as a whole, as the best evaluations would be obtained by randomizing the allocation. We propose a framework to design randomized allocation rules which optimally balance targeting high-need individuals with learning treatment effects, presenting policymakers with a Pareto frontier between the two goals. We give sample complexity guarantees for the policy learning problem and provide a computationally efficient strategy to implement it. We then apply our framework to data from human services in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania. Optimized policies can substantially mitigate the tradeoff between learning and targeting. For example, it is often possible to obtain 90% of the optimal utility in targeting high-need individuals while ensuring that the average treatment effect can be estimated with less than 2 times the samples that a randomized controlled trial would require. Mechanisms for targeting public services often focus on measuring need as accurately as possible. However, our results suggest that algorithmic systems in public services can be most impactful if they incorporate program evaluation as an explicit goal alongside targeting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.01480v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new two-parameter discrete distribution, namely the PoiG distribution is derived by the convolution of a Poisson variate and an independently distributed geometric random variable. This distribution generalizes both the Poisson and geometric distributions and can be used for modelling over-dispersed as well as equi-dispersed count data. A number of important statistical properties of the proposed count model, such as the probability generating function, the moment generating function, the moments, the survival function and the hazard rate function. Monotonic properties are studied, such as the log concavity and the stochastic ordering are also investigated in detail. Method of moment and the maximum likelihood estimators of the parameters of the proposed model are presented. It is envisaged that the proposed distribution may prove to be useful for the practitioners for modelling over-dispersed count data compared to its closest competitors.</description>

      <title>JOINTVIP: Prioritizing variables in observational study design with joint variable importance plot in R</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.10367v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Credible causal effect estimation requires treated subjects and controls to be otherwise similar. In observational settings, such as analysis of electronic health records, this is not guaranteed. Investigators must balance background variables so they are similar in treated and control groups. Common approaches include matching (grouping individuals into small homogeneous sets) or weighting (upweighting or downweighting individuals) to create similar profiles. However, creating identical distributions may be impossible if many variables are measured, and not all variables are of equal importance to the outcome. The joint variable importance plot (jointVIP) package to guides decisions about which variables to prioritize for adjustment by quantifying and visualizing each variable's relationship to both treatment and outcome.</description>

      <title>Bayesian changepoint detection via logistic regression and the topological analysis of image series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.02917v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a Bayesian method for multivariate changepoint detection that allows for simultaneous inference on the location of a changepoint and the coefficients of a logistic regression model for distinguishing pre-changepoint data from post-changepoint data. In contrast to many methods for multivariate changepoint detection, the proposed method is applicable to data of mixed type and avoids strict assumptions regarding the distribution of the data and the nature of the change. The regression coefficients provide an interpretable description of a potentially complex change. For posterior inference, the model admits a simple Gibbs sampling algorithm based on P\'olya-gamma data augmentation. We establish conditions under which the proposed method is guaranteed to recover the true underlying changepoint. As a testing ground for our method, we consider the problem of detecting topological changes in time series of images. We demonstrate that our proposed method $\mathtt{bclr}$, combined with a topological feature embedding, performs well on both simulated and real image data. The method also successfully recovers the location and nature of changes in more traditional changepoint tasks.</description>

      <title>Functional principal component analysis as an alternative to mixed-effect models for describing sparse repeated measures in presence of missing data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10624v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Analyzing longitudinal data in health studies is challenging due to sparse and error-prone measurements, strong within-individual correlation, missing data and various trajectory shapes. While mixed-effect models (MM) effectively address these challenges, they remain parametric models and may incur computational costs. In contrast, Functional Principal Component Analysis (FPCA) is a non-parametric approach developed for regular and dense functional data that flexibly describes temporal trajectories at a potentially lower computational cost. This paper presents an empirical simulation study evaluating the behaviour of FPCA with sparse and error-prone repeated measures and its robustness under different missing data schemes in comparison with MM. The results show that FPCA is well-suited in the presence of missing at random data caused by dropout, except in scenarios involving most frequent and systematic dropout. Like MM, FPCA fails under missing not at random mechanism. The FPCA was applied to describe the trajectories of four cognitive functions before clinical dementia and contrast them with those of matched controls in a case-control study nested in a population-based aging cohort. The average cognitive declines of future dementia cases showed a sudden divergence from those of their matched controls with a sharp acceleration 5 to 2.5 years prior to diagnosis.</description>

      <title>Practical Guide for Causal Pathways and Sub-group Disparity Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02702v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we introduce the application of causal disparity analysis to unveil intricate relationships and causal pathways between sensitive attributes and the targeted outcomes within real-world observational data. Our methodology involves employing causal decomposition analysis to quantify and examine the causal interplay between sensitive attributes and outcomes. We also emphasize the significance of integrating heterogeneity assessment in causal disparity analysis to gain deeper insights into the impact of sensitive attributes within specific sub-groups on outcomes. Our two-step investigation focuses on datasets where race serves as the sensitive attribute. The results on two datasets indicate the benefit of leveraging causal analysis and heterogeneity assessment not only for quantifying biases in the data but also for disentangling their influences on outcomes. We demonstrate that the sub-groups identified by our approach to be affected the most by disparities are the ones with the largest ML classification errors. We also show that grouping the data only based on a sensitive attribute is not enough, and through these analyses, we can find sub-groups that are directly affected by disparities. We hope that our findings will encourage the adoption of such methodologies in future ethical AI practices and bias audits, fostering a more equitable and fair technological landscape.</description>
