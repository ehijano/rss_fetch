      <title>Metadata Enrichment of Long Text Documents using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this project, we semantically enriched and enhanced the metadata of long text documents, theses and dissertations, retrieved from the HathiTrust Digital Library in English published from 1920 to 2020 through a combination of manual efforts and large language models. This dataset provides a valuable resource for advancing research in areas such as computational social science, digital humanities, and information science. Our paper shows that enriching metadata using LLMs is particularly beneficial for digital repositories by introducing additional metadata access points that may not have originally been foreseen to accommodate various content types. This approach is particularly effective for repositories that have significant missing data in their existing metadata fields, enhancing search results and improving the accessibility of the digital repository.</description>

      <title>The State of Papers, Retractions, and Preprints: Evidence from the CrossRef Database (2004-2024)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A 20-year analysis of CrossRef metadata demonstrates that global scholarly output -- encompassing publications, retractions, and preprints -- exhibits strikingly inertial growth, well-described by exponential, quadratic, and logistic models with nearly indistinguishable goodness-of-fit. Retraction dynamics, in particular, remain stable and minimally affected by the COVID-19 shock, which contributed less than 1% to total notices. Since 2004, publications doubled every 9.8 years, retractions every 11.4 years, and preprints at the fastest rate, every 5.6 years. The findings underscore a system primed for ongoing stress at unchanged structural bottlenecks. Although model forecasts diverge beyond 2024, the evidence suggests that the future trajectory of scholarly communication will be determined by persistent systemic inertia rather than episodic disruptions -- unless intentionally redirected by policy or AI-driven reform.</description>

      <title>Automatic Reviewers Assignment to a Research Paper Based on Allied References and Publications Weight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Everyday, a vast stream of research documents is submitted to conferences, anthologies, journals, newsletters, annual reports, daily papers, and various periodicals. Many such publications use independent external specialists to review submissions. This process is called peer review, and the reviewers are called referees. However, it is not always possible to pick the best referee for reviewing. Moreover, new research fields are emerging in every sector, and the number of research papers is increasing dramatically. To review all these papers, every journal assigns a small team of referees who may not be experts in all areas. For example, a research paper in communication technology should be reviewed by an expert from the same field. Thus, efficiently selecting the best reviewer or referee for a research paper is a big challenge.
  In this research, we propose and implement program that uses a new strategy to automatically select the best reviewers for a research paper. Every research paper contains references at the end, usually from the same area. First, we collect the references and count authors who have at least one paper in the references. Then, we automatically browse the web to extract research topic keywords. Next, we search for top researchers in the specific topic and count their h-index, i10-index, and citations for the first n authors. Afterward, we rank the top n authors based on a score and automatically browse their homepages to retrieve email addresses. We also check their co-authors and colleagues online and discard them from the list. The remaining top n authors, generally professors, are likely the best referees for reviewing the research paper.</description>

      <title>A bibliometric study on mathematical oncology: interdisciplinarity, internationality, collaboration and trending topics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mathematical oncology is an interdisciplinary research field where mathematics meets cancer research. The field's intention to study cancer makes it dynamic, as practicing researchers are incentivised to quickly adapt to both technical and medical research advances. Determining the scope of mathematical oncology is therefore not straightforward; however, it is important for purposes related to funding allocation, education, scientific communication, and community organisation. To address this issue, we here conduct a bibliometric analysis of mathematical oncology. We compare our results to the broader field of mathematical biology, and position our findings within theoretical science of science frameworks.
  Based on article metadata and citation flows, our results provide evidence that mathematical oncology has undergone a significant evolution since the 1960s marked by increased interactions with other disciplines, geographical expansion, larger research teams, and greater diversity in studied topics. The latter finding contributes to the greater discussion on which models different research communities consider to be valuable in the era of big data and machine learning. Further, the results presented in this study quantitatively motivate that international collaboration networks should be supported to enable new countries to enter and remain in the field, and that mathematical oncology benefits both mathematics and the life sciences.</description>

      <title>The role of preprints in open science: Accelerating knowledge transfer from science to technology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20225v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Preprints have become increasingly essential in the landscape of open science, facilitating not only the exchange of knowledge within the scientific community but also bridging the gap between science and technology. However, the impact of preprints on technological innovation, given their unreviewed nature, remains unclear. This study fills this gap by conducting a comprehensive scientometric analysis of patent citations to bioRxiv preprints submitted between 2013 and 2021, measuring and accessing the contribution of preprints in accelerating knowledge transfer from science to technology. Our findings reveal a growing trend of patent citations to bioRxiv preprints, with a notable surge in 2020, primarily driven by the COVID-19 pandemic. Preprints play a critical role in accelerating innovation, not only expedite the dissemination of scientific knowledge into technological innovation but also enhance the visibility of early research results in the patenting process, while journals remain essential for academic rigor and reliability. The substantial number of post-online-publication patent citations highlights the critical role of the open science model-particularly the "open access" effect of preprints-in amplifying the impact of science on technological innovation. This study provides empirical evidence that open science policies encouraging the early sharing of research outputs, such as preprints, contribute to more efficient linkage between science and technology, suggesting an acceleration in the pace of innovation, higher innovation quality, and economic benefits.</description>
