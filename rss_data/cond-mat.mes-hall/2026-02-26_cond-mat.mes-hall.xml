      <title>Anisotropy reduction and tunability of hole-spin qubit g-factor in strained parabolic Ge/SiGe quantum wells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hole-spin qubits in planar Ge/SiGe heterostructures have attracted significant attention in recent years owing to their favorable electrical characteristics and prolonged coherence times. However, the strong spin-orbit interaction also makes them susceptible to charge noise and inhomogeneous strain. This is further exacerbated by the highly anisotropic g-factor of the planar design. Although there are some known strategies to suppress charge noise, one approach is to engineer an isotropic g-factor. In this work we analyze how qubit confinement profile affects the g-factor of hole-spin qubits. We show that decreasing the characteristic in-plane qubit confinement length reduces the g-factor anisotropy. We perform analytical and numerical analysis to compare two types of quantum wells: square wells and parabolic wells. We show that square wells have limited tunability, while parabolic wells offer broader tunability, making them more promising for qubit engineering.</description>

      <title>Using near-flat-band electrons for read-out of molecular spin qubit entangled states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While molecular spin qubits (MSQs) are a promising platform for quantum computing, read-out has been largely limited to electron paramagnetic resonance which is often slow and requires a global system drive. Moreover, because one prerequisite for the Elzerman and Pauli spin blockade readout mechanisms typical of semiconductor spin qubits is tunneling of electrons between sites, these read-out modalities are unavailable in MSQs. Here, we theoretically demonstrate electrical read-out of entangled MSQs via driven many-electron spin unpolarized currents. In particular, using a time-dependent density matrix renormalization group approach we simulate a maximally entangled MSQ pair between two electronic leads. Driving itinerant electrons between the two leads, we find that the conductance is greater when the MSQs are in the entangled singlet state as compared to the entangled triplet state. This contrast in conductance is enhanced when the electronic density of states at the Fermi energy is large and for narrow bandwidth. Our results are readily applicable to molecules supramolecularly functionalizing semiconductors with relatively flat bands such as single-wall carbon nanotubes under a magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Time-dependent Magnetic Fields and the Quantum Hall Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ermakov has shown how the solution to the classical harmonic oscillator in one spatial dimension with general time-dependent frequency can be reduced to the time-independent case and an associated nonlinear ordinary differential equation, an analysis which has been applied to the Schr\"odinger equation as well. We extend this analysis to the Landau problem of a charged particle in a uniform magnetic field in two dimensions and construct the generalized Laughlin wave functions for the case when the magnetic field is time-dependent. We also work out the dynamics of density fluctuations (the Girvin, MacDonald, Platzman or GMP mode) and argue that it is possible to tune the frequency of the magnetic field to obtain a compressible droplet of fermions. We also analyze the dynamics of the edge modes of the droplet for the integer Hall effect.</description>

      <title>Low-Noise Quantum Dots in Ultra-Shallow Ge/SiGe Heterostructures for Prototyping Hybrid Semiconducting-Superconducting Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planar germanium is currently the only semiconducting platform where high-coherence spin qubits and proximity-induced superconductivity have each been demonstrated. Recent research into spin qubits in Ge/SiGe heterostructures has focused on increasing the thickness of the SiGe capping layer, reporting improvements in the electrostatic noise levels. Meanwhile, heterostructures with thinner capping layers remain rather unexplored, despite the potential advantages for proximity-induced superconductivity. Here, we study a Ge/SiGe heterostructure with a thin SiGe cap $d \approx 4\ \mathrm{nm}$ and investigate its viability to host low-noise quantum dots. To keep the thermal budget compatible with superconducting layers, low-temperature oxide deposition processes were developed and implemented for the gate dielectrics. The charge-noise level of fabricated devices is estimated to be $1.8 \pm 1.0\ \mu\mathrm{eV}/\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$, comparable to devices fabricated on shallow heterostructures $\left(d \sim 20\ \mathrm{nm}\right)$ with high-temperature deposited oxides. Low charge-noise levels, together with the straightforward integration of superconductors, make this heterostructure an attractive platform for prototyping hybrid semiconducting-superconducting devices.</description>

      <title>Granular aluminum induced superconductivity in germanium for hole spin-based hybrid devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In superconductor-semiconductor hybrid structures, superconductivity and spin polarization are competing effects because magnetic fields break Cooper pairs. They can be combined using thin films and in-plane magnetic fields, an approach that enabled the pursuit of Majorana zero modes, Kitaev chains, and Andreev spin qubits (ASQs), but remains challenging for materials with small in-plane g-factors. Here we show that granular aluminum (grAl), composed of nanometer-scale aluminum grains embedded in an amorphous oxide matrix, can overcome this limitation. By depositing grAl on Ge/SiGe heterostructures, we induce a hard superconducting gap with BCS peaks at 305 $\mu$eV and magnetic-field resilience for both the in-plane and out-of-plane directions, allowing Zeeman splitting of Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) states beyond 50 $\mu$eV (12 GHz). Leveraging this robustness, we reveal signatures of hole physics and demonstrate g-tensor tunability.</description>

      <title>Phonon decoherence produced by two-level tunneling states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phonon modes within pristine crystalline resonators now routinely reach the quantum ground state. Such systems are attractive for quantum information science applications, as advanced fabrication and processing can enable relatively long quantum coherence times, and precision control can be realized through optical, electrical, or qubit coupling. In many state-of-the-art systems, the phonon lifetime is limited by disorder. In particular, native oxides or damaged `dead layers' at surfaces can host two-level tunneling states that lead to a particularly problematic form of dissipation that increases at lower temperatures. As mechanical losses are driven down in systems such as micro-fabricated bulk acoustic wave resonators, tunneling states are expected to emerge as the dominant mechanism for phonon decoherence. A quantitative description of these mesoscopic systems therefore requires a framework that captures interactions between a selected phonon mode and a large ensemble of TLS. Here, we derive a quantum master equation for this coupled system, permitting the phonon decoherence produced by two-level tunneling states to be calculated. As an example, we estimate the lifetime of a variety of quantum states within quartz micro-resonators hosting a thin surface layer of tunneling states. We find that the phonon coherence time is maximized at low temperatures, in spite of increased mechanical dissipation, and that phonon-TLS coupling can be reduced for modes with strain nodes at the surfaces.</description>

      <title>Concerted Carrier-Barrier Dynamics in van der Waals Schottky Junctions Revealed by Time-Resolved Atomic Force Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Schottky junctions based on transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) have emerged as key building blocks for next-generation optoelectronic devices that demand ultrafast response and high sensitivity. However, the ultrafast, nanoscale carrier dynamics at these interfaces, crucial for device performance, have remained experimentally elusive. Here, we introduce optical pump-probe time-resolved atomic force microscopy to directly visualize, in real space, the nanosecond-scale modulation of the Schottky barrier potential at a van der Waals junction formed by point contact between WSe2 and a PtIr tip. Complementary analyses using transient absorption spectroscopy and light-modulated current-voltage characteristics together with model simulations reveal that time-resolved currents originate from the concerted temporal evolution of photoexcited carriers and the subsequent barrier response, processes that also define the rate-limiting steps of the photocurrent. Our results uncover the essential interfacial dynamics that underpin TMDC-based photodetectors and photovoltaic elements, while establishing a new measurement paradigm that complements and extends existing spectroscopic techniques. This approach provides direct access to nonequilibrium processes hidden at nanoscale interfaces, offering a powerful route to rational design of high-performance optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Thickness-Driven Control of Room Temperature Ferrimagnetic Skyrmions and their Topological Hall signature in GdFe Single Layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions are nanoscale, topologically protected spin textures with exceptional potential for high density data storage and energy efficient computing. Among various skyrmion hosting systems, rare earth transition metal ferrimagnets offer a promising platform due to their tunable magnetic properties and intrinsically low net magnetization. Despite this, the fundamental control of ferrimagnetic skyrmions in single layer films remains unexplored. Here, we demonstrate a viable route for engineering room temperature skyrmions in GdFe single layers through precise control of film thickness (60 to 80 nm). Thickness variation enables the systematic tuning of key magnetic parameters, including perpendicular magnetic anisotropy and saturation magnetization, thereby allowing precise control over skyrmion size and density. Magnetic force microscopy (MFM) reveals a clear thickness dependent evolution of isolated skyrmion characteristics, where skyrmion size decreases while skyrmion density increases with increasing GdFe film thickness, in agreement with micromagnetic simulations. At the same time, magnetotransport measurements show a systematic enhancement in the topological Hall resistivity with thickness, further corroborating the increased skyrmion density observed in MFM. Scanning transmission electron microscopy reveals a compositional gradient across the film thickness, indicative of structural asymmetry and potential inversion symmetry breaking, contributing to the emergence of a bulk Dzyaloshinskii Moriya interaction. Notably, sub 60nm skyrmions with high areal density are stabilized at room temperature. This work provides a viable route to tailor the properties of ferrimagnetic skyrmions in single-layer GdFe films, paving the way for the development of high-density ferrimagnetic skyrmionic devices.</description>

      <title>Skyrmion Phase and Non-Fermi Liquid Behavior in Nonsymmorphic Magnetic Weyl Semimetal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the interplay between complex magnetic orders and topological electronic states in nonsymmorphic magnetic Weyl semimetals on the ReAlX family (Re is a rare earth element and X is Si or Ge). We construct a lattice model incorporating conduction Weyl fermions coupled to localized magnetic moments via Kondo interaction. By considering a multi-${\bf Q}$ cycloid magnetic configuration, which can evolve into a Skyrmion lattice under an in-plane Zeeman field, we analyze its profound impact on the band structure through magnetic Brillouin zone and band-folding. Using the Kubo formula, we calculate the conductivity tensor and examine the transport properties in the clean limit. Our results reveal that the Skyrmion lattice induces significant changes in electrical and Hall conductivities. Furthermore, the temperature-dependent resistivity deviates from the standard Fermi-liquid behavior ($\rho_{xx}\sim T^2$), showing a power-law scaling ($\rho_{xx}\sim T^\alpha$ with $\alpha$ between 3 and 5), indicative of non-Fermi liquid behavior. This work provides a theoretical framework connecting multi-${\bf Q}$ magnetic textures, Skyrmion physics, and anomalous transport in topological semimetals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.21718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chirality-dependent spin generation has attracted considerable attention in condensed matter physics. In this paper, we theoretically investigate antiparallel spin polarization as a chirality-dependent quadratic response, by using a finite chiral system composed of triangular prisms. Based on the nonlinear Kubo formalism and real-time simulations, we demonstrate that spatially inhomogeneous antiparallel spin polarizations are induced as a dissipative quadratic DC response to a homogeneous AC electric field. In particular, we elucidate role of microscopic parameters characterizing the handedness of chirality, and naive expectation of spin polarization as a consequence of spin accumulation of spin current.</description>

      <title>Charge distribution across dislocation networks induced by a strained top layer in hexagonal boron nitride substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) flakes are key building blocks for encapsulating two-dimensional (2D) materials, providing atomically flat surfaces and an excellent dielectric environment for high-mobility field-effect transistors and tunnelling devices. However, strain induced during mechanical exfoliation and assembly of van der Waals heterostructures may lead to plastic deformations of the hBN surface, injecting dislocation lines between the topmost layer and the underlying film. Since a monolayer of hBN is non-centrosymmetric and exhibits a piezoelectric response to deformation, individual dislocations and, in particular their networks, can generate electrostatic potential modulations in the encapsulated 2D material. Here, we examine scenarios in which the top hBN layer is uniaxially strained and/or twisted, and show how lattice reconstruction into dislocation networks leads to the formation of piezoelectric charge hotspots that effectively behave as charged defects.</description>

      <title>Thermalization of neighboring nanomechanical resonators below 1 mK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The position noise spectra of six drums on a single chip were measured on a single cooldown below 1.3 kelvin. Cryostat temperatures as low as 0.7 mK were achieved. The temperature dependence of the resonance frequency and linewidth of the drum modes was analyzed in the framework of the tunneling two level system (TLS) model. Departures of the resonance frequency and the position noise power from the expected logarithmic and linear temperature dependences, respectively, were interpreted as indications of thermal decoupling from the cryostat. This previously unexplored measurement configuration revealed that similar neighboring drums on a single chip may be at different temperatures. At the lowest temperatures, some drums exhibited excess damping that decreased with temperature. The magnitude of the excess damping of the drums was correlated with the thermal coupling of their TLS to the cryostat. In the case of one drum, a temporary increase in its damping coincided with a decrease in its mode temperature. The thermalization of the TLS to the cold finger was independent of pump power, pulse tube state and temperature of the pre-cooling stages of the cryostat. These results reveal an interplay between TLS damping and thermalization of nanomechanics that motivates further theoretical work and may impact efforts to extend the coherence of mechanical resonators.</description>

      <title>Geometric oscillations of local Hall and Nernst effects in ballistic graphene at weak magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We predict a novel class of magnetotransport oscillations in ballistic graphene specific for a ring-shape geometry. Using the B\"uttiker-Landauer formalism, we analytically obtain the local Hall and Nernst coefficients in the weak-field ballistic regime. These coefficients exhibit pronounced oscillations as functions of both the magnetic field and the angular positions of the measurement probes. The oscillations originate from the discrete set of skipping orbits that geometrically connect the contacts, with resonances occurring when the angular separation between contacts times the radius of the disk equals an integer number of cyclotron diameters. Unlike conventional quantum oscillations in conductivity, this effect is robust at room temperature and can dominate local thermoelectric signals. This geometric control of ballistic flow provides a platform for studying electron hydrodynamics and engineering phase-coherent devices, with potential applications in sensitive terahertz detectors and thermal management systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum Resistance in Multilayer Graphene-BiFeO3 Memristor for Brain-Inspired Computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.21986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the era of big data and the Internet of Things, quantum-level control of conductance states offers a promising route toward high-density data storage and brain-inspired neuromorphic computing. Although quantum conductance (QC) phenomena have been demonstrated in various metal oxide memristors, achieving reliable and precise control over quantized states remains in its infancy. Here, we demonstrate bidirectional quantum conductance states in multifunctional BiFeO3 (BFO) perovskite memristors integrated with multilayer-graphene contacts, enabling higher-order tunability and revealing the potential of perovskite-2D heterostructures for quantum-engineered memory and computing devices. XPS analysis provides detailed insights into oxygen vacancy dynamics in BFO, whereas first-principles density functional theory calculations clearly reveal a strong localized electric field at the graphene-BFO interface. Our devices exhibit current-controlled higher-order QC transitions facilitated by quantum point contact formation, giving rise to quantized conductance states during both SET and RESET processes. Time-lag correlation maps quantify the stochastic evolution of QC states under dynamic voltage-pulse tuning schemes. Notably, the quantized conductance states effectively emulate synaptic potentiation and depression, enabling precise weight modulation for high-accuracy image and digit recognition in convolutional neural networks.

      <title>Electrostatic Gating of Ionic Conductance Through Heterogeneous van der Waals Nanopores</title>

Abstract: Nanofluidic ionic transistors typically require gate voltages above 1 V and operate only at sub millimolar ionic strengths, limiting their biocompatible applications. We demonstrate ionic transistors consisting of single sub 10 nm nanopores drilled in van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures with internal gate electrodes made of few layer graphene. These devices deliver up to 10fold current modulation at gate voltages as low as 0.3 V in 10 mM KCl, and 2fold modulation at near physiological 100 mM KCl. Baseline conductance with no gate shows surface charge dominated transport below 100 mM KCl consistent with negatively charged hBN walls and 5 nm opening of the pores. The surface charge and the electrochemical asymmetry introduced by the three electrode configuration govern the device behavior: negative gate voltage (VG) enriches ionic concentrations and enhances current, whereas positive VG induces a local depletion zone that suppresses transport. The current modulation by VG is dependent on the polarity of the transmembrane potential and leads to ion current rectification. Molecular dynamics simulations of a nanopore in a hBN graphene hBN stack reveal confinement and surface charge dependent suppression of relative permittivity of interfacial water. Continuum modeling with radially varying interfacial water permittivity reproduces the asymmetric IV characteristics and explains how the embedded gate sculpts local potential and ion concentrations. By enabling sub 0.5 V control of ionic transport at up to 100 mM salt concentrations, these devices address a key barrier in nanofluidics and open the pathway to low power ionic circuits and biosensing.</description>

      <title>Topological phase dynamics described by overtone-synthesized classical and quantum Adler equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.21451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Adler equation is a well-known one-dimensional model describing phase locking and synchronization. Motivated by recent experiments using optomechanical oscillators, we extend the model to include overtone-synthesized sinusoidal coupling with adiabatic temporal modulation. This extension gives rise to unique topological features such as winding-number quantization, discontinuous phase-slip transitions, and hysteretic and non-reciprocal phase dynamics. We further extend the analysis to the quantum regime, where we find a counterintuitive result: the breakdown of winding-number quantization. This arises from the superposition of different winding-number states in a closed-space Thouless pump. Moreover, hysteretic dynamics, once eliminated in quantum adiabatic approximation, is recovered in non-adiabatic calculations, as the superposition of two Floquet states with different PT eigenvalues becomes the quantum counterpart of phase trajectory.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Spin Filter Effect in a $d$-wave altermagnet KV$_2$Se$_2$O with Open Fermi Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Altermagnets offer a unique pathway to functional spintronics by combining vanishing magnetization with large spin splitting. Here, we demonstrate that the canonical d-wave altermagnet KV2Se2O can deliver giant tunneling magnetoresistance through orientation-dependent spin filtering. By analyzing the crystallographic spin segregation, we show that transport along specific crystallographic axes is nearly fully spin-polarized within the symmetry-protected ballistic channels. We implement this mechanism in a lattice-matched KV2Se2O/Bi2O2Se/KV2Se2O magnetic tunnel junction, which achieves a robust half-metallic transport regime. The symmetry-protected spectral gap in the parallel/anti-parallel configuration ensures a high tunneling magnetoresistance ratio, resulting in substantial tunneling magnetoresistance, robust thermally driven spin filtering, and spin Seebeck effect at room temperature. These findings provide a path of altermagnetic heterostructures as a high-performance platform for scalable, field-free, and thermally stable spin logic.</description>

Abstract: High-quality planar cavities with low-absorption mirrors based on $Al_{0.2}Ga_{0.8}As/Al_{0.9}Ga_{0.1}As$ layers demonstrate continuous wave lasing at a wavelength of 957 nm. At 300 K, the threshold power density and quality-factor at threshold are (11.4$\pm$0.7) $kW/cm^2$ and (5070$\pm$160). Increasing the pumping level above two thresholds results in an enlargement in the quality-factor to at least 19000. Efficient lateral heat dissipation in the planar semiconductor microcavity is confirmed by a low mode-energy shift, which is 660 $\mu$eV at two lasing thresholds.</description>

      <title>Mott Intermittency at the Metal-Insulator Boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The resistivity maximum at a temperature $T=T_{\mathrm{max}}$ is a recurring feature of bandwidth-tuned Mott systems, yet its meaning remains controversial: is it a coherence-incoherence crossover of an electronically homogeneous metal, or does it mark the onset of transport through a mixed landscape of metallic and insulating regions? Even more debated is whether a true phase-coexistence regime survives in the relevant parameter range, or whether apparent inhomogeneity is merely extrinsic. Here we address these questions by moving beyond temperature sweeps and probe charge transport in the time domain. Near $T=T_{\mathrm{max}}$, we find that the resistance of a model system, a quasi-two-dimensional Mott spin liquid material, exhibits clear random-telegraph switching between discrete levels over long timescales. The statistics of the switching - sharp two-level behavior with thermally activated dwell times - point to a mesoscopic "current-controlling" region that dynamically toggles between metallic and insulating states, intermittently opening and closing the dominant conduction channel. This characteristic fluctuating dynamics provides direct evidence for intrinsic metal-insulator coexistence and establishes $T\sim T_{\mathrm{max}}$ as the regime of Mott intermittency, where transport is governed by stochastic domain switching rather than quasiparticle decoherence.</description>

      <title>Loss Mechanisms in High-coherence Multimode Mechanical Resonators Coupled to Superconducting Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.22117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Circuit quantum acoustodynamics (cQAD) devices have a wide range of applications in quantum science, all of which depend crucially on the quantum coherence of the mechanical subsystem. In this context, high-overtone bulk acoustic-wave resonators (HBARs) are particularly promising, since they have shown very high quality factors with negligible dephasing. However, the introduction of piezoelectric films, which are necessary for coupling to a superconducting circuit, can lead to additional loss channels, such as surface scattering and two-level systems (TLS). Here, we study the acoustic dissipation of HBAR resonators in cQAD systems and find that the defect density of the piezoelectric material and its interface with the bulk are limiting factors for the coherence. We measure acoustic modes with phonon lifetimes up to 400 $\mu$s and lifetime-limited coherence times approaching one millisecond in the quantum regime. When coupled to a superconducting qubit, this leads to a hybrid system with a large quantum coherence cooperativity of $C_{T_2}=1.1\times10^5$. These results represent a new milestone for the performance of cQAD devices and offer concrete paths forward for further improvements.</description>

      <title>Quantum jumps in open cavity optomechanics and Liouvillian versus Hamiltonian exceptional points</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.22205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exceptional points, where two or more eigenstates of a non-Hermitian system coalesce, are now of interest across many fields of physics, from the perspective of open-system dynamics, sensing, nonreciprocal transport, and topological phase transitions. In this work, we investigate exceptional points in cavity optomechanics, a platform of interest to diverse communities working on gravitational-wave detection, macroscopic quantum mechanics, quantum transduction, etc. Specifically, we clarify the role of quantum jumps in making a clear distinction between Liouvillian and Hamiltonian exceptional points in optomechanical systems. While the Liouvillian exceptional point arises from the unconditional Lindblad dynamics and is independent of the phonon-bath temperature, the Hamiltonian exceptional point emerges from the conditional no-jump evolution and acquires a thermal shift due to an enhanced conditional damping. Employing the thermofield formalism, we derive a unified spectral framework that interpolates between these regimes via an analytical hybrid-Liouvillian description. Remarkably, in the weak-quantum-jump regime, the exceptional point is perturbed only at the second order, highlighting the robustness of the Hamiltonian exceptional point under small hybrid perturbations. Our work reveals a continuous family of hybrid exceptional points, clarifies the operational and physical differences between the conditional and unconditional dissipative dynamics in optomechanical systems, and provides a probe for thermal baths.</description>

Abstract: Moire superlattices formed in van der Waals heterostructures due to twisting, lattice mismatch and strain present an opportunity for creating novel metamaterials with unique properties not present in the individual layers themselves. Ferroelectricity for example, arises due to broken inversion symmetry in twisted and strained bilayers of 2D semiconductors with stacking domains of alternating out-of-plane polarization. However, understanding the individual contributions of twist and strain to the formation of topological polar nanostructures remains to be established and has proven to be experimentally challenging. Inversion symmetry breaking has been predicted to give rise to an in-plane component of polarization along the domain walls, leading to the formation of a network of topologically non-trivial merons (half-skyrmions) that are Bloch-type for twisted and Neel-type for strained systems. Here we utilise angle-resolved, high-resolution vector piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) to spatially resolve polarization components and topological polar nanostructures in marginally twisted bilayer WSe2, and provide experimental proof for the existence of topologically non-trivial meron/antimeron structures. We observe both Bloch-type and Neel-type merons, allowing us to differentiate between moire superlattices formed due to twist or heterogeneous strain. This first demonstration of non-trivial real-space topology in a twisted van der Waals heterostructure opens pathways for exploring the connection between twist and topology in engineered nano-devices.</description>

Abstract: The quantum geometric tensor (QGT) embodies the geometry of the eigenstates of a system's Hamiltonian, and its full characterization across diverse quantum systems is essential. However, it is challenging to characterize the QGT of solid-state systems. Here we present an electric scheme to measure the complete QGT of two-dimensional solid-state systems by using spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), in which the spin texture is extracted from geometric amplitudes of Friedel oscillations induced by the intentionally introduced magnetic impurity, and then the QGT is derived from the momentum differential of spin texture. As a canonical spin model, the surface states of a topological insulator offer a promising way to demonstrate the scheme. In a slab of topological insulator, the gapped surface states host complete QGT, i.e., nonvanishing quantum metric and Berry curvature as its symmetric real part and the antisymmetric imaginary part. Thus, a detailed derivation guides the use of the developed scheme to measure the QGT of gapped surface states, even with an external magnetic field. This study opens a new avenue to directly measure the complete QGT of two-dimensional solid-state systems by using spin-polarized STM.</description>

Abstract: Exchanging the positions of two non-Abelian anyons transforms between many-body wavefunctions within a degenerate ground-state manifold. This behavior is fundamentally distinct from fermions, bosons and Abelian anyons. Recently, quantum dot-superconductor arrays have emerged as a promising platform for creating topological Kitaev chains that can host non-Abelian Majorana zero modes. In this work, we propose a minimal braiding setup in a linear array of quantum dots consisting of two minimal Kitaev chains coupled through an ancillary, normal quantum dot. We focus on the physical effects that are peculiar to quantum dot devices, such as interdot Coulomb repulsion and residual single electron tunneling. We find that the errors caused by either of these effects can be efficiently mitigated by optimal control of the ancillary quantum dot that mediates the exchange of the non-Abelian anyons. Moreover, we propose experimentally accessible methods to find this optimal operating regime and predict signatures of a successful Majorana braiding experiment.</description>

Abstract: The braiding of Majorana zero modes (MZMs) forms the fundamental building block for topological quantum computation. Braiding protocols which involve the physical exchange of MZMs are typically envisioned on a network of topological superconducting wires. An essential component of these protocols is the transport of MZMs, which can be performed by using electric gates to locally tune sections of the wire between topologically trivial and non-trivial phases. In this work, we numerically simulate this transport by tuning a single section of a superconducting wire which contains either disorder (uncorrelated and correlated) or noise. We focus on the impact of these additional effects on the diabatic error, which describes unwanted transitions between the ground state and excited states. We show that the behavior of the average diabatic error is predominantly controlled by the statistics of the minimum bulk energy gap which is suppressed in the presence of disorder. The increase in diabatic error can be several orders of magnitude and is most deleterious when the disorder correlation length is a finite fraction of the transport distance and negligible when these lengths are far apart. In the presence of noise, the diabatic error is significantly enhanced due to optical transitions which depend on the minimum bulk energy gap as well as the frequency modes present in the noise. The results presented here serve to further characterize the diabatic error in disordered and noisy settings, which are important considerations in practical implementations of physical braiding schemes.</description>

Abstract: The recently predicted unconventional magnets offer a new ground for exploring the formation of nontrivial spin states due to their inherent nonrelativistic momentum-dependent spin splitting. In this work, we consider unconventional magnets with $d$- and $p$-wave parities, and investigate the effect of time-periodic light drives for inducing the formation of spin-triplet phases in the normal and superconducting states. In particular, we consider unconventional magnets without and with conventional superconductivity under linearly and circularly polarized light drives and treat the time-dependent problem within Floquet formalism, which naturally unveils photon processes and Floquet bands determining the emergent phenomena. We demonstrate that the interplay between unconventional magnetism and light gives rise to a non-trivial light-matter coupling which governs the emergence of Floquet spin-triplet states with and without superconductivity that are absent otherwise. We find that photon-assisted processes promote the formation of spin-triplet densities and spin-triplet Cooper pairs between different Floquet sidebands. More precisely, the Floquet sidebands offer an additional quantum number, the Floquet index, which considerably broadens the classification of superconducting correlations that lead to Floquet spin-triplet Cooper pairs as an entirely dynamical phenomenon due to the interplay between light and unconventional magnetism. Furthermore, we discuss how the number of photons is connected to the symmetry of Cooper pairs and also explore how the distinct light drives can be used to manipulate them and probe the angular symmetry of unconventional magnets. Our results therefore unveil the potential of unconventional magnets for realizing nontrivial light-induced superconducting states.</description>

Abstract: Stereoisomers of C$_{13}$Cl$_2$ exhibiting helical orbitals around a ring of carbon atoms were synthesized by atom manipulation on NaCl surfaces. We resolved the enantiomeric geometries of the singlet states by atomic force microscopy and mapped their helical orbital densities by scanning tunnelling microscopy. A ${\pi}$-orbital basis of the helical, non-planar singlets that twists by 90{\deg} in one circulation is consistent with a half-M\"obius topology. In such a topology, the ${\pi}$-orbital basis changes sign with respect to two circumnavigations and is periodic with respect to four circumnavigations. A quasiparticle on a ring with this boundary condition could be interpreted as carrying a Berry phase of ${\pi}$/2. We demonstrate reversible switching of the topology, between the two singlets of oppositely threaded half-M\"obius topology, and the planar, topologically trivial, triplet state. Multireference calculations, including large-scale sample-based ab initio calculations executed on quantum hardware, reveal that the switching is associated with a helical pseudo Jahn-Teller effect.</description>

      <title>Floquet odd-parity collinear magnets</title>

Abstract: Altermagnets (AMs), recently discovered unconventional magnets distinct from both ferro- and antiferromagnets, have rapidly emerged as a prominent research topic in condensed matter physics. AMs are characterized by alternating collinear magnetic moments with zero net magnetization in real space, and spin splittings with even-parity symmetry in momentum space. However, their counterparts exhibiting odd-parity spin splittings are generally thought to be absent in collinear magnets. Here, we show that such unconventional odd-parity magnets can be induced from collinear antiferromagnets by symmetry engineering. Remarkably, using effective model analysis within Floquet-theory framework, we demonstrate that circularly polarized light irradiation of conventional antiferromagnetic lattices breaks a spin-preserving pseudo-time-reversal symmetry and induces both $p$- and $f$-wave magnets, realizing novel magnetic states dubbed Floquet odd-parity collinear magnets. Moreover, we also uncover light-induced antiferromagnetic Chern insulating states in the $f$-wave magnets. The proposed Floquet odd-parity magnet is confirmed by first-principles calculations of MnPSe$_{3}$ under circularly polarized light. Our work not only proposes a new class of unconventional magnets, but also opens an avenue for light-induced magnetic phenomena in spintronic applications.</description>

Abstract: Domain wall motion underpins emerging spintronic technologies, such as high-speed racetrack devices and THz logic, and accelerating walls quickly is a key challenge on the path to faster devices. Recent experimental advances introduced magnetic materials with non-uniform composition, allowing angular momentum compensation points and fast domain wall motion, although acceleration of domain walls in these materials remains poorly understood. Here, we show that spatial variation of exchange and anisotropy not only pushes the wall towards lower wall surface tension region, but also modifies its inertial mass, giving rise to a variable-mass relativistic dynamics. We find another force, originating from the magnon velocity gradient, that dominates as the wall velocity approaches the magnon speed. Our results identify domain walls in nonuniform magnets as a playground for relativistic physics with variable mass and limiting speed.https://info.arxiv.org/help/prep#comments</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.20754v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study elementary semiconductors and insulators that are symmetric under spatial inversion: silicon, diamond, germanium, and black phosphorene. These materials are ideal candidates for realizing obstructed atomic insulators, which differ from trivial atomic insulators by a quantized spatial shift of their electronic Wannier centers with respect to the atomic lattice. We use symmetry indicator invariants that allow the prediction of non-trivial responses to crystal dislocations in these materials. We find that edge dislocations generically exhibit a non-trivial response, while screw dislocations always display a trivial response. With the aid of numerical simulations of realistic tight-binding models, we confirm the presence of mid-gap polarization bands localized along dislocations in silicon, diamond, and germanium.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.09674v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Excitons are vital in the photophysics of materials, especially in low-dimensional systems. The conceptual and quantitative understanding of excitonic effects in nonlinear optical (NLO) processes is more challenging compared to linear ones. Here, we present an ab initio approach to second-order NLO responses, incorporating excitonic effects, that employs an exciton-state coupling formalism and allows a detailed analysis of the role of individual excitonic states. Taking monolayer h-BN and MoS2 as two prototype 2D materials, we calculate their second harmonic generation (SHG) susceptibility and shift current conductivity tensor. We find strong excitonic enhancement requires that the resonant excitons are not only optically bright themselves, but also be able to couple strongly to other bright excitons. Our results explain the occurrence of two strong peaks in the SHG of monolayer h-BN and why the A and B excitons of MoS2 unexpectedly exhibit minimal excitonic enhancement in both SHG and shift current generation.</description>

      <title>Hermitian and non-Hermitian topology in active matter</title>

Abstract: Self-propulsion is a quintessential aspect of biological systems, which can induce nonequilibrium phenomena that have no counterparts in passive systems. Motivated by biophysical interest together with recent advances in experimental techniques, active matter has been a rapidly developing field in physics. Meanwhile, over the past few decades, topology has played a crucial role to understand certain robust properties appearing in condensed matter systems. For instance, the nontrivial topology of band structures leads to the notion of topological insulators, where one can find robust gapless edge modes protected by the bulk band topology. We here review recent progress in an interdisciplinary area of research at the intersection of these two fields. Specifically, we give brief introductions to active matter and band topology in Hermitian systems, and then explain how the notion of band topology can be extended to nonequilibrium (and thus non-Hermitian) systems including active matter. We review recent studies that have demonstrated the intimate connections between active matter and topological materials, where exotic topological phenomena that are unfeasible in passive systems have been found. A possible extension of the band topology to nonlinear systems is also briefly discussed. Active matter can thus provide an ideal playground to explore topological phenomena in qualitatively new realms beyond conservative linear systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum feedback control with a transformer neural network architecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19253v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Attention-based neural networks such as transformers have revolutionized various fields such as natural language processing, genomics, and vision. Here, we demonstrate the use of transformers for quantum feedback control through both a supervised and reinforcement learning approach. In particular, due to the transformer's ability to capture long-range temporal correlations and training efficiency, we show that it can surpass some of the limitations of previous control approaches, e.g.~those based on recurrent neural networks trained using a similar approach or policy based reinforcement learning. We numerically show, for the example of state stabilization of a two-level system, that our bespoke transformer architecture can achieve near unit fidelity to a target state in a short time even in the presence of inefficient measurement and Hamiltonian perturbations that were not included in the training set as well as the control of non-Markovian systems. We also demonstrate that our transformer can perform energy minimization of non-integrable many-body quantum systems when trained for reinforcement learning tasks. Our approach can be used for quantum error correction, fast control of quantum states in the presence of colored noise, as well as real-time tuning, and characterization of quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Dynamic competition between phason and amplitudon observed by ultrafast multimodal scanning tunneling microscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11627v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The intertwining between two ordered states that arise from the same interactions is reflected in the dynamics of their coupled collective excitations. While the equilibrium phase diagram resulting from such intertwined orders has been extensively studied, the dynamic competition between non-equilibrium modes is a largely unexplored territory. Here, we introduce a multimodal STM-based pump-probe technique, that combines ultrafast tunneling microscopy (USTM), ultrafast point-contact spectroscopy (UPC), and optical pump-probe reflectance (OPPR) on femtosecond timescale, all within a single instrument. Using this platform, we investigate the collective excitations of the unconventional charge density wave insulator (TaSe4)2I. Our UPC measurements reveal charge oscillations at 0.22 THz, with a temperature dependence that matches the theoretically predicted behavior of the long-sought massive phason gaining mass through the Anderson-Higgs mechanism. Unexpectedly, the data also reveals a second mode at 0.11 THz exhibiting similar temperature and polarization dependence with comparable mode intensity. These features, along with the robust 1/2 frequency ratio locking suggest that the 0.11 THz phason is a 'daughter mode' that arises from the splitting of the 0.22 THz massive phason into two massless phasons via parametric amplification, analogous to the decay of a neutral pion into two photons. Strikingly, comparison with OPPR data reveals that the daughter phason competes with and suppresses the amplitudon at proximate frequency. Our studies reveal an unexplored mechanism for the generation and extinction of collective excitations in quantum materials and pave the way for a microscopic understanding of ultrafast phenomena.</description>

      <title>Semi-Dirac spin liquids and frustrated quantum magnetism on the trellis lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02663v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Geometrical frustration in quantum magnets provides a fertile setting for unconventional phases of matter, including quantum spin liquids (QSLs). The trellis lattice, with its complex site arrangements and edge-sharing triangular motifs, presents a promising platform for such physics. In this work, we undertake a comprehensive classification of all fully symmetric QSLs on the trellis lattice using the projective symmetry group approach within the Abrikosov-fermion representation. We find 7 U(1) and 25 $Z_2$ short-ranged Ans\"atze and analyze the phase diagram in the mean-field parameter space, uncovering both gapped and Dirac QSLs as well as a semi-Dirac spin liquid that emerges at the level of projective symmetry group classification and mean-field band structure, in which the spinon dispersion is linear along one momentum direction but quadratic along the orthogonal one. We demonstrate that such dispersions can occur only at high-symmetry points in the Brillouin zone with $C_{2v}$ little groups and analyze their characteristic correlation signatures. Moreover, by optimizing over all symmetry-allowed mean-field states, we map out a phase diagram -- featuring six distinct phases -- of the nearest-neighbor Heisenberg Hamiltonian on the trellis lattice. Among these, we find four quasi-one-dimensional QSL phases, one dimer phase, and one Dirac QSL phase. Going beyond mean field, we also assess equal-time and dynamical spin structure factors of these phases using density-matrix renormalization group and Keldysh pseudofermion functional renormalization group calculations and compare qualitative momentum-space features of these spectra with those obtained at the mean-field level. Finally, we identify four cuprate and vanadate compounds as promising experimental realizations and provide spectroscopic predictions, based on first-principles Hamiltonians, as a guide for neutron-scattering studies.</description>

      <title>First principles band structure of interacting phosphorus and boron/aluminum $\delta$-doped layers in silicon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19205v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Silicon can be heavily doped with phosphorus in a single atomic layer (a $\delta$ layer), significantly altering the electronic structure of the conduction bands within the material. Recent progress has also made it possible to further dope silicon with acceptor-based $\delta$ layers using either boron or aluminum, making it feasible to create devices with interacting $\delta$ layers with opposite polarity. Using Density Functional Theory, we calculate the electronic structure of a phosphorus-based $\delta$ layer interacting with a boron or aluminum $\delta$ layer, varying the distances between the $\delta$ layers. At separations 1 nm and smaller, the dopant potentials overlap and largely cancel each other out, leading to an electronic structure closely mimicking intrinsic silicon. At separations greater than 1 nm, the two $\delta$ layers behave independently of one another, with an equivalent electronic structure to a p-n diode with an intrinsic layer taking the place of the depletion region. One mechanism for charge transfer between $\delta$ layers at larger distances could be tunneling, where we see a tunneling probability exceeding what would be seen for a standard silicon 1.1 eV triangular barrier, indicating that the interaction between delta layers may enhance tunneling compared to a traditional junction.</description>

      <title>Non-abelian Geometric Quantum Energy Pump</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09651v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a non-abelian geometric quantum energy pump realized by a transitionless geometric quantum drive--a time-dependent Hamiltonian supplemented by a counterdiabatic term generated by a prescribed trajectory on a smooth control manifold--that coherently transports states within a degenerate subspace. When the coordinates of the trajectory are independently addressable by external drives, the net energy transferred between drives is set by the non-abelian Berry-curvature tensor. The trajectory-averaged pumping power is separately controlled by the initial state and by the Hamiltonian topology through the Euler class. We outline an implementation with artificial atoms, which are realizable on various platforms including trapped atoms/ions, superconducting circuits, and semiconductor quantum dots. The resulting energy pump can serve as a quantum transducer or charger, and as a metrological tool for measuring phase coherences in quantum states.</description>
