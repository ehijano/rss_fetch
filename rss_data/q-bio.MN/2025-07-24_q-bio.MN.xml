      <title>Variant effects on protein-protein interactions: methods, models and diseases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advances in sequencing have revealed that each individual carries about 10,000 missense variants. For the vast majority, we do not know what the functional consequences - if any - will be. Further, mechanistic insight, such as structural details, would be immensely helpful in development of therapeutic approaches. Here we review recent developments in experimental and computational techniques aimed to assess the impact of variants on protein-protein interactions, including limitations and upcoming challenges.</description>

      <title>Gears in Chemical Reaction Networks: Optimizing Energy Transduction Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17960v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Similarly to gear systems in vehicles, most chemical reaction networks (CRNs) involved in energy transduction have at their disposal multiple transduction pathways, each characterized by distinct efficiencies. We conceptualize these pathways as `chemical gears' and demonstrate their role in refining the second law of thermodynamics. This allows us to determine the optimal efficiency of a CRN, and the gear enabling it, solely based on its topology and operating conditions, defined by the chemical potentials of its input and output species. By suitably tuning reaction kinetics, a CRN can be engineered to self-regulate its gear settings, maintaining optimal efficiency under varying external conditions. We demonstrate this principle in a biological context with a CRN where enzymes function as gear shifters, autonomously adapting the system to achieve near-optimal efficiency across changing environments. Additionally, we examine artificial molecular motors and reveal that their gearing mechanisms are far from optimally regulated.</description>

      <title>Energy Transduction in Complex Networks with Multiple Resources: The Chemistry Paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01176v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the traditional framework of steady state energy transduction -- typically characterized by a single input and output -- to multi-resource transduction in open chemical reaction networks (CRNs). Transduction occurs when stoichiometrically balanced processes are driven against their spontaneous directions by coupling them with thermodynamically favorable ones. However, when multiple processes (resources) interact through a shared CRN, identifying the relevant set of processes for analyzing transduction becomes a critical and complex challenge. To address this, we introduce a systematic procedure based on elementary processes, which cannot be further decomposed into subprocesses. Our theory generalizes the methodology used to define transduction efficiency in thermal engines operating between multiple heat baths. By selecting a reference equilibrium environment, it explicitly reveals the inherently relative nature of transduction efficiency and ties its definition to exergy. This framework also allows one to exclude unusable outputs from efficiency calculations. We further extend the concept of chemical gears to multi-process transduction, demonstrating their versatility as an analytical tool in complex settings. Finally, we apply our framework to central metabolic pathways, uncovering deep insights into their operation and highlighting the crucial difference between thermodynamic efficiencies and stoichiometric yields.</description>
