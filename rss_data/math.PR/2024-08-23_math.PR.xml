      <title>Fractional binomial distributions induced by the generalized binomial theorem and their applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A generalized binomial theorem was established by Hara and Hino [Bull. London Math. Soc. 42 (2010), 467-477] for proving the neo-classical inequality. We introduce a new fractional analogue of the binomial distribution on the basis of the generalized binomial theorem and study its properties. They include the law of large numbers, the central limit theorem, and the law of small numbers, the last of which leads to a fractional analogue of the Poisson distribution. As an application of the fractional binomial distribution, a fractional analogue of the Bernstein operator is proposed, which acts on the space of continuous functions on the unit interval. We show that the fractional Bernstein operator uniformly approximates every continuous function on the unit interval. Some limit theorems for its iterates are discussed as well. In particular, a generalization of the Wright--Fisher diffusion process arising in the study of population genetics is captured as a certain limit of the iterates.</description>

      <title>Sharpness and locality for percolation on finite transitive graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(G_n) = \left((V_n,E_n)\right)$ be a sequence of finite connected vertex-transitive graphs with uniformly bounded vertex degrees such that $\lvert V_n \rvert \to \infty$ as $n \to \infty$. We say that percolation on $G_n$ has a sharp phase transition (as $n \to \infty$) if, as the percolation parameter crosses some critical point, the number of vertices contained in the largest percolation cluster jumps from logarithmic to linear order with high probability. We prove that percolation on $G_n$ has a sharp phase transition unless, after passing to a subsequence, the rescaled graph-metric on $G_n$ (rapidly) converges to the unit circle with respect to the Gromov-Hausdorff metric. We deduce that under the same hypothesis, the critical point for the emergence of a giant (i.e. linear-sized) cluster in $G_n$ coincides with the critical point for the emergence of an infinite cluster in the Benjamini-Schramm limit of $(G_n)$, when this limit exists.</description>

      <title>Generalized Birth-Death Process on Finite Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a generalized birth-death process (GBDP) whose state space is a finite subset of a $q$-dimensional lattice. It is assumed that there can be a jump of finite step size in all possible directions such that the probability of simultaneous transition in more than one direction is zero. Such processes are of interest as their transition probability matrix is diagonalizable under suitable conditions. Thus, their $k$-step transition probabilities can be efficiently obtained. For GBDP on two-dimensional finite grid, we obtain a sufficient and necessary condition for the vertical and horizontal transition probability matrices to commute. Later, we extend these results to the case of $q$-dimensional finite grid. We obtain the minimum number of constraints required on transition probabilities that ensure the commutation of transition probability matrices for each possible direction.</description>

      <title>Size distribution of clusters in site-percolation on random recursive tree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove rigorously several results about the site-percolation on random recursive trees, observed in the previous work by Kalay and Ben-Naim [J. Phys. A48(2015), no.4, 0405001, 15 pp.]. For a random recursive tree of size $n$, let every site have probability ${p \in (0,1)}$ to remain and with probability $(1-p)$ to be removed. As $n\to\infty,$ we show that the proportion of the remaining clusters of size $k$ is of order $k^{-1-\frac{1}{p}}$, resulting in a Yule-Simon distribution; the largest cluster size is of order $n^{p}$, and admits a non-trivial scaling limit. The proofs are based on the embedding of this model in the multi-type branching processes, and a coupling with the bond-percolation on random recursive trees.</description>

      <title>Neural Fields and Noise-Induced Patterns in Neurons on Large Disordered Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study pattern formation in class of a large-dimensional neural networks posed on random graphs and subject to spatio-temporal stochastic forcing. Under generic conditions on coupling and nodal dynamics, we prove that the network admits a rigorous mean-field limit, resembling a Wilson-Cowan neural field equation. The state variables of the limiting systems are the mean and variance of neuronal activity. We select networks whose mean-field equations are tractable and we perform a bifurcation analysis using as control parameter the diffusivity strength of the afferent white noise on each neuron. We find conditions for Turing-like bifurcations in a system where the cortex is modelled as a ring, and we produce numerical evidence of noise-induced spiral waves in models with a two-dimensional cortex. We provide numerical evidence that solutions of the finite-size network converge weakly to solutions of the mean-field model. Finally, we prove a Large Deviation Principle, which provides a means of assessing the likelihood of deviations from the mean-field equations induced by finite-size effects.</description>

      <title>A strange five vertex model and multispecies ASEP on a ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of constructing the stationary states of the multispecies asymmetric simple exclusion process on a one-dimensional periodic lattice. Central to our approach is a quantum oscillator weighted five vertex model which features a strange weight conservation distinct from the conventional one. Our results clarify the interrelations among several known results and refine their derivations. For instance, the stationary probability derived from the multiline queue construction by Martin (2020) and Corteel--Mandelshtam--Williams (2022) is identified with the partition function of a three-dimensional system. The matrix product operators by Prolhac--Evans--Mallick (2009) acquire a natural diagrammatic interpretation as corner transfer matrices (CTM). The origin of their recursive tensor structure, as questioned by Aggarwal--Nicoletti--Petrov (2023), is revealed through the CTM diagrams. Finally, the derivation of the Zamolodchikov--Faddeev algebra by Cantini--de Gier--Wheeler (2015) is made intrinsic by elucidating its precise connection to a solution to the Yang--Baxter equation originating from quantum group representations.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Homogenization of Parabolic Equations with Lower-order Terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of homogenization results has long been a central focus in the field of mathematical analysis, particularly for equations without lower-order terms. However, the importance of studying homogenization results for parabolic equations with lower-order terms cannot be understated. In this study, we aim to extend the analysis to homogenization for the general parabolic equation with random coefficients:
  \begin{equation*}
  \partial_{t}p^\epsilon-\nabla\cdot\left(\mathbf{a}\left( \dfrac{x}{\epsilon},\dfrac{t}{\epsilon^2}\right)\nabla p^\epsilon\right)-\mathbf{b}\left( \dfrac{x}{\epsilon},\dfrac{t}{\epsilon^2}\right)\nabla p^\epsilon -\mathbf{d}\left( \dfrac{x}{\epsilon},\dfrac{t}{\epsilon^2}\right) p^\epsilon=0.
  \end{equation*}
  Moreover, we establish the Caccioppoli inequality and Meyers estimate for the generalized parabolic equation. By using the generalized Meyers estimate, we get the weak convergence of $p^\epsilon$ in $H^1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The main goal of this work is to provide a description of transitions from uniform to non-uniform snychronization in diffusions based on large deviation estimates for finite time Lyapunov exponents. These can be characterized in terms of moment Lyapunov exponents which are principal eigenvalues of the generator of the tilted (Feynman-Kac) semigroup. Using a computer assisted proof, we demonstrate how to determine these eigenvalues and investigate the rate function which is the Legendre-Fenichel transform of the moment Lyapunov function. We apply our results to two case studies: the pitchfork bifurcation and a two-dimensional toy model, also considering the transition to a positive asymptotic Lyapunov exponent.</description>

Abstract: Whether Borel amenability implies hyperfiniteness is a main open question in the theory of Borel equivalence relations. Under a mild extra uniformity condition, we prove that Borel amenability of bounded degree Borel graphs is equivalent to a randomized version of hyperfiniteness. Our new approach yields simple proofs and generalizations for the Ornstein-Weiss theorem, the Quasi-Tiling theorem and the Connes-Feldman-Weiss theorem. One result is that the main conjecture holds up to a compressible set (that is, a set that admits no invariant probability measur</description>

      <title>Wilson lines in the Abelian lattice Higgs model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2111.06620v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lattice gauge theories are lattice approximations of the Yang-Mills theory in physics. The abelian lattice Higgs model is one of the simplest examples of a lattice gauge theory interacting with an external field. In a previous paper~\cite{flv2021}, we calculated the leading order term of the expected value of Wilson loop observables in the low-temperature regime of the abelian lattice Higgs model on $ \mathbb{Z}^4 ,$ with structure group $G = \mathbb{Z}_n $ for some $ n \geq 2. $ In the absence of a Higgs field, these are important observables since they exhibit a phase transition which can be interpreted as distinguishing between regions with and without quark confinement. However, in the presence of a Higgs field, this is no longer the case, and a more relevant family of observables are so-called open Wilson lines. In this paper, we extend and refine the ideas introduced in~\cite{flv2021} to calculate the leading order term of the expected value of the more general Wilson line observables. Using our main result, we then calculate the leading order term of several natural ratios of expected values and confirm the behavior predicted by physicists.</description>

      <title>Fast Consensus and Metastability in a Highly Polarized Social Network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2202.12871v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A polarized social network is modeled as a system of interacting marked point processes with memory of variable length. Each point process indicates the successive times in which a social actor expresses a "favorable" or "contrary" opinion. After expressing an opinion, the social pressure on the actor is reset to 0, waiting for the group's reaction. The orientation and the rate at which an actor expresses an opinion is influenced by the social pressure exerted on it, modulated by a polarization coefficient. We prove that the network reaches an instantaneous but metastable consensus, when the polarization coefficient diverges.</description>

      <title>Gaussian beta ensembles: the perfect freezing transition and its characterization in terms of Beurling-Landau densities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.15054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.15054v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Gaussian $\beta$-ensemble is a real $n$-point configuration $\{x_j\}_1^n$ picked randomly with respect to the Boltzmann factor $e^{-\frac\beta 2H_n}$, $H_n=\sum_{i\ne j}\log\frac 1{|x_i-x_j|}+n\sum_{i=1}^n\tfrac 12x_i^2.$ The point process $\{x_j\}_1^n$ tends to follow the semicircle law $\sigma(x)=\tfrac 1{2\pi}\sqrt{(4-x^2)_+}$ in certain average senses.
  A Fekete configuration (minimizer of $H_n$) is spread out in a much more uniform way in the interval $[-2,2]$ with respect to the regularization $\sigma_n(x)=\max\{\sigma(x),n^{-\frac 1 3}\}$ of the semicircle law. In particular, Fekete configurations are "equidistributed" with respect to $\sigma_n(x)$, in a certain technical sense of Beurling-Landau densities.
  We consider the problem of characterizing sequences $\beta_n$ of inverse temperatures, which guarantee almost sure equidistribution as $n\to\infty$. We find that a necessary and sufficient condition is that $\beta_n$ grows at least logarithmically in $n$: $$\beta_n\gtrsim \log n.$$ We call this growth rate the perfect freezing regime. We give several further results on the distribution of particles when $\beta_n\gtrsim\log n$, for example on minimal spacing, discrepancies, and sampling and interpolation for weighted polynomials.
  The condition $\beta_n\gtrsim\log n$ was introduced by some of the authors in the context of two-dimensional Coulomb gas ensembles, where it is shown to be sufficient for equidistribution. Although the technical implementation requires some considerable modifications, the strategy from dimension two adapts well to prove sufficiency also for one-dimensional Gaussian ensembles. On a technical level, we use estimates for weighted polynomials due to Levin, Lubinsky, Gustavsson and others. The other direction (necessity) involves estimates due to Ledoux and Rider on the distribution of particles which fall near or outside the boundary.</description>

      <title>Stake-governed tug-of-war and the biased infinity Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.08300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.08300v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In tug-of-war, two players compete by moving a counter along edges of a graph, each winning the right to move at a given turn according to the flip of a possibly biased coin. The game ends when the counter reaches the boundary, a fixed subset of the vertices, at which point one player pays the other an amount determined by the boundary vertex. Economists and mathematicians have independently studied tug-of-war for many years, focussing respectively on resource-allocation forms of the game, in which players iteratively spend precious budgets in an effort to influence the bias of the coins that determine the turn victors; and on PDE arising in fine mesh limits of the constant-bias game in a Euclidean setting.
  In this article, we offer a mathematical treatment of a class of tug-of-war games with allocated budgets: each player is initially given a fixed budget which she draws on throughout the game to offer a stake at the start of each turn, and her probability of winning the turn is the ratio of her stake and the sum of the two stakes. We consider the game played on a tree, with boundary being the set of leaves, and the payment function being the indicator of a single distinguished leaf. We find the game value and the essentially unique Nash equilibrium of a leisurely version of the game, in which the move at any given turn is cancelled with constant probability after stakes have been placed. We show that the ratio of the players' remaining budgets is maintained at its initial value $\lambda$; game value is a biased infinity harmonic function; and the proportion of remaining budget that players stake at a given turn is given in terms of the spatial gradient and the $\lambda$-derivative of game value. We also indicate examples in which the solution takes a different form in the non-leisurely game.</description>

      <title>Sharp upper tail behavior of line ensembles via the tangent method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.08922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.08922v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a new probabilistic and geometric method to obtain several sharp results pertaining to the upper tail behavior of continuum Gibbs measures on infinite ensembles of random continuous curves, also known as line ensembles, satisfying some natural assumptions. The arguments make crucial use of Brownian resampling invariance properties of such Gibbs measures. We obtain sharp one-point upper tail estimates showing that the probability of the value at zero being larger than $\theta$ is $\exp(-\frac{4}{3}\theta^{3/2}(1+o(1)))$. A key intermediate step is developing a precise understanding of the profile when conditioned on the value at zero equaling $\theta$. Our method further allows one to obtain multi-point asymptotics which were out of reach of previous approaches. As an example, we prove sharp explicit two-point upper tail estimates. All of our assumptions are shown to hold for the zero-temperature case of the Airy$_2$ process, thus yielding new proofs for one-point estimates already known due to its connections to random matrix theory, as well as new two-point asymptotics. To showcase the reach of the method, we obtain the same results in a purely non-integrable setting under only assumptions of stationarity and extremality in the class of Gibbs measures. Finally, all the assumptions are also shown to hold for the KPZ equation, except for a correlation inequality which remains an interesting open question. Our method bears resemblance to the tangent method introduced by Colomo-Sportiello and mathematically realized by Aggarwal in the context of the six-vertex model.</description>

Abstract: Dai Pra et al studied two notions of monotonicity for continuous-time Markov processes on a finite partially ordered set (poset), and conjectured that monotonicity equivalence holds for a poset of W-glued diamond, and that there is no other case when it has no acyclic extension. We proved their conjecture and were able to provide a complete characterization of posets for monotonicity equivalence.</description>

      <title>A new adaptive local polynomial density estimation procedure on complicated domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.01156v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for pointwise estimation of multivariate density functions on known domains of arbitrary dimensions using nonparametric local polynomial estimators. Our method is highly flexible, as it applies to both simple domains, such as open connected sets, and more complicated domains that are not star-shaped around the point of estimation. This enables us to handle domains with sharp concavities, holes, and local pinches, such as polynomial sectors. Additionally, we introduce a data-driven selection rule based on the general ideas of Goldenshluger and Lepski. Our results demonstrate that the local polynomial estimators are minimax under a $L^2$ risk across a wide range of H\"older-type functional classes. In the adaptive case, we provide oracle inequalities and explicitly determine the convergence rate of our statistical procedure. Simulations on polynomial sectors show that our oracle estimates outperform those of the most popular alternative method, found in the sparr package for the R software. Our statistical procedure is implemented in an online R package which is readily accessible.</description>

      <title>Stochastic optimal control in Hilbert spaces: $C^{1,1}$ regularity of the value function and optimal synthesis via viscosity solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03181v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study optimal control problems governed by abstract infinite dimensional stochastic differential equations using the dynamic programming approach. In the first part, we prove Lipschitz continuity, semiconcavity and semiconvexity of the value function under several sets of assumptions, and thus derive its $C^{1,1}$ regularity in the space variable. Based on this regularity result, we construct optimal feedback controls using the notion of the $B$-continuous viscosity solutions for the associated Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman equation. This is done in the case when the noise coefficient is independent of the control variable. We also discuss applications of our results to optimal control problems for controlled stochastic reaction-diffusion equations and, under economic motivations, to stochastic delay differential equations.</description>

      <title>Determinantal structure of the overlaps for induced spherical unitary ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12690v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note, we study the determinantal structure of the $k$-th conditional expectation of the overlap for induced spherical unitary ensemble. We will show the universality for the scaling limits of the $k$-the conditional expectation of the overlap in the three regimes, strongly non-unitary, weakly non-unitary, and the singular origin regimes. As a consequence, we will confirm the universality for the overlap.</description>

      <title>Numerical Approximations and Convergence Analysis of Piecewise Diffusion Markov Processes, with Application to Glioma Cell Migration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13428v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on numerical approximations of Piecewise Diffusion Markov Processes (PDifMPs), particularly when the explicit flow maps are unavailable. Our approach is based on the thinning method for modelling the jump mechanism and combines the Euler-Maruyama scheme to approximate the underlying flow dynamics. For the proposed approximation schemes, we study both the mean-square and weak convergence. Weak convergence of the algorithms is established by a martingale problem formulation. Moreover, we employ these results to simulate the migration patterns exhibited by moving glioma cells at the microscopic level. Further, we develop and implement a splitting method for this PDifMP model and employ both the Thinned Euler-Maruyama and the splitting scheme in our simulation example, allowing us to compare both methods.</description>
