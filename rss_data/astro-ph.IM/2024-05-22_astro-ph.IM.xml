      <title>Computing the Instantaneous Collision Probability between Satellites using Characteristic Function Inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The probability that two satellites overlap in space at a specified instant of time is called their instantaneous collision probability. Assuming Gaussian uncertainties and spherical satellites, this probability is the integral of a Gaussian distribution over a sphere. This paper shows how to compute the probability using an established numerical procedure called characteristic function inversion. The collision probability in the short-term encounter scenario is also evaluated with this approach, where the instant at which the probability is computed is the time of closest approach between the objects. Python and R code is provided to evaluate the probability in practice. Overall, the approach has been established for over fifty years, is implemented in existing software, does not rely on analytical approximations, and can be used to evaluate two and three dimensional collision probabilities.</description>

      <title>HST/JWST Long-Term Monitoring Working Group Final Report</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Astro2020 Decadal Survey recognizes time-domain astronomy as a key science area over the next decade and beyond. With over 30 years of HST data and the potential for 20 years of JWST operations, these flagship observatories offer an unparalleled prospect for a half-century of space-based observations in the time domain. To take best advantage of this opportunity, STScI charged a working group to solicit community input and formulate strategies to maximize the science return in time-domain astronomy from these two platforms. Here, the HST/JWST Long-Term Monitoring Working Group reports on the input we received and presents our recommendations to enhance the scientific return for time-domain astronomy from HST and JWST. We suggest changes in policies to enable and prioritize long-term science programs of high scientific value. As charged, we also develop recommendations based on community input for a JWST Director's Discretionary Time program to observe high-redshift transients.</description>

      <title>Robust 1-norm periodograms for analysis of noisy non-Gaussian time series with irregular cadences: Application to VLBI astrometry of quasars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Astronomical time series often have non-uniform sampling in time, or irregular cadences, with long gaps separating clusters of observations. Some of these data sets are also explicitly non-Gaussian with respect to the expected model fit, or the simple mean. The standard Lomb-Scargle periodogram is based on the least squares solution for a set of test periods and, therefore, is easily corrupted by a subset of statistical outliers or an intrinsically non-Gaussian population. It can produce completely misleading results for heavy-tailed distribution of residuals. We propose a robust 1-norm periodogram technique, which is based on the principles of robust statistical estimation. This technique can be implemented in weighted or unweighted options. The method is described in detail and compared with the classical least squares periodogram on a set of astrometric VLBI measurements of the ICRF quasar IERS B0642+449. It is uniformly applied to a collection of 259 ICRF3 quasars each with more than 200 epoch VLBI measurements, resulting in a list of 49 objects with quasi-periodic position changes above the $3\sigma$ level, which warrant further investigation.</description>

      <title>SALTUS Probe Class Space Mission: Observatory Architecture and Mission Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe the space observatory architecture and mission design of the SALTUS mission, a NASA Astrophysics Probe Explorer concept. SALTUS will address key far-infrared science using a 14-m diameter &lt;45 K primary reflector (M1) and will provide unprecedented levels of spectral sensitivity for planet, solar system, and galactic evolution studies, and cosmic origins. Drawing from Northrop Grumman's extensive NASA mission heritage, the observatory flight system is based on the LEOStar-3 spacecraft platform to carry the SALTUS Payload. The Payload is comprised of the inflation control system (ICS), Sunshield Module (SM), Cold Corrector Module (CCM), Warm Instrument Electronics Module, and Primary Reflector Module (PRM). The 14-m M1 is an off-axis inflatable membrane radiatively cooled by a two-layer sunshield (~1,000 m2 per layer). The CCM corrects for residual aberration from M1 and delivers a focused beam to two instruments - High Resolution Receiver (HiRX) and SAFARI-Lite. The CCM and PRM reside atop a truss-based composite deck which also provides a platform for the attitude control system. The 5-year mission lifetime is driven by a two-consumable architecture: the propellant system and the ICS. The Core Interface Module (CIM), a multi-faceted composite truss structure, provides a load path with high stiffness, mechanical attachment, and thermal separation between the Payload and spacecraft. The SM attaches outside the CIM with its aft end integrating directly to the bus. The spacecraft maintains an attitude off M1's boresight with respect to the Sun line to facilitate the &lt;45 K thermal environment. SALTUS will reside in a Sun-Earth halo L2 orbit with a maximum Earth slant range of 1.8 million km thereby reducing orbit transfer delta-v. The instantaneous field of regard provides two continuous 20-deg viewing zones around the ecliptic poles resulting in full sky coverage in six months.</description>

      <title>The influence of the Sun and Moon on the observation of very high energy gamma-ray sources using EAS arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With great advance of ground-based extensive air shower array, such as LHAASO and HAWC, many very high energy (VHE) gamma-ray sources have been discovered and are been monitored regardless of the day and the night. Hence, the Sun and Moon would have some compact on the observation of gamma-ray sources, which have not been taken into account in previous analysis. In this paper, the influence of the Sun and Moon on the observation of very high energy gamma-ray sources when they are near the line of sight of the Sun or Moon is estimated. The tracks of all the known VHE sources are scanned and several VHE sources are found to be very close to the line of sight of the Sun or Moon during some period. The absorption of very high energy gamma-ray by sunlight is estimated with detailed method and some usefully conclusions are achieved. The main influence is the block of the Sun and Moon on gamma-ray and their shadow on the cosmic ray background. The influence is investigated considering the detector angular resolution and some strategy on data analysis are proposed to avoid the underestimation of the gamma-ray emission.</description>

      <title>WST - Widefield Spectroscopic Telescope: Motivation, science drivers and top-level requirements for a new dedicated facility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we describe the wide-field spectroscopic survey telescope (WST) project. WST is a 12-metre wide-field spectroscopic survey telescope with simultaneous operation of a large field-of-view (3 sq. degree), high-multiplex (20,000) multi-object spectrograph (MOS), with both a low and high-resolution modes, and a giant 3x3 arcmin2 integral field spectrograph (IFS). In scientific capability, these specifications place WST far ahead of existing and planned facilities. In only 5 years of operation, the MOS would target 250 million galaxies and 25 million stars at low spectral resolution, plus 2 million stars at high resolution. Without need for pre-imaged targets, the IFS would deliver 4 billion spectra offering many serendipitous discoveries. Given the current investment in deep imaging surveys and noting the diagnostic power of spectroscopy, WST will fill a crucial gap in astronomical capability and work in synergy with future ground and space-based facilities. We show how it can address outstanding scientific questions in the areas of cosmology; galaxy assembly, evolution, and enrichment, including our own Milky Way; the origin of stars and planets; and time domain and multi-messenger astrophysics. WST's uniquely rich dataset may yield unforeseen discoveries in many of these areas. The telescope and instruments are designed as an integrated system and will mostly use existing technology, with the aim to minimise the carbon footprint and environmental impact. We will propose WST as the next European Southern Observatory (ESO) project after completion of the 39-metre ELT.</description>

      <title>Single Aperture Large Telescope for Universe Studies (SALTUS): Science Overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The SALTUS Probe mission will provide a powerful far-infrared (far-IR) pointed space observatory to explore our cosmic origins and the possibility of life elsewhere. The observatory employs an innovative deployable 14-m aperture, with a sunshield that will radiatively cool the off-axis primary to &lt;45K. This cooled primary reflector works in tandem with cryogenic coherent and incoherent instruments that span the 34 to 660 micron far-IR range at both high and moderate spectral resolutions.</description>

      <title>Exploring the directly imaged HD 1160 system through spectroscopic characterisation and high-cadence variability monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The time variability and spectra of directly imaged companions provide insight into their physical properties and atmospheric dynamics. We present follow-up R~40 spectrophotometric monitoring of red companion HD 1160 B at 2.8-4.2 $\mu$m using the double-grating 360{\deg} vector Apodizing Phase Plate (dgvAPP360) coronagraph and ALES integral field spectrograph on the Large Binocular Telescope Interferometer. We use the recently developed technique of gvAPP-enabled differential spectrophotometry to produce differential light curves for HD 1160 B. We reproduce the previously reported ~3.2 h periodic variability in archival data, but detect no periodic variability in new observations taken the following night with a similar 3.5% level precision, suggesting rapid evolution in the variability of HD 1160 B. We also extract complementary spectra of HD 1160 B for each night. The two are mostly consistent, but the companion appears fainter on the second night between 3.0-3.2 $\mu$m. Fitting models to these spectra produces different values for physical properties depending on the night considered. We find an effective temperature T$_{\text{eff}}$ = 2794$^{+115}_{-133}$ K on the first night, consistent with the literature, but a cooler T$_{\text{eff}}$ = 2279$^{+79}_{-157}$ K on the next. We estimate the mass of HD 1160 B to be 16-81 M$_{\text{Jup}}$, depending on its age. We also present R = 50,000 high-resolution optical spectroscopy of host star HD 1160 A obtained simultaneously with the PEPSI spectrograph. We reclassify its spectral type to A1 IV-V and measure its projected rotational velocity v sin i = 96$^{+6}_{-4}$ km s$^{-1}$. We thus highlight that gvAPP-enabled differential spectrophotometry can achieve repeatable few percent level precision and does not yet reach a systematic noise floor, suggesting greater precision is achievable with additional data or advanced detrending techniques.</description>

      <title>Ringing out General Relativity: Quasi-normal mode frequencies for black holes of any spin in modified gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: After black holes collide, the remnant settles to a stationary state by emitting gravitational waves. Once non-linearities subside, these ringdown waves are dominated by exponentially-damped sinusoids, or quasinormal modes. We develop a general method using perturbative spectral expansions to calculate the quasinormal-mode frequencies and damping times in a wide class of modified gravity theories for black holes with any subextremal spin. We apply this method to scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity to show its accuracy, thus enabling robust ringdown tests with gravitational wave data.</description>

      <title>In-situ Measurements of Dark Photon Dark Matter using Parker Solar Probe: Going beyond the Radio Window</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark photon dark matter emerges as a compelling candidate for ultralight bosonic dark matter, detectable through resonant conversion into photons within a plasma environment. This study employs in-situ measurements from the Parker Solar Probe (PSP), the first spacecraft to venture into the solar corona, to probe for DPDM signatures. The PSP in-situ measurements go beyond the traditional radio window, spanning frequencies between about 10 kHz and 20 MHz, a challenging range inaccessible to Earth-based radio astronomy. Additionally, the proximity of PSP to the resonant conversion location enhances the signal flux, providing a distinct advantage over ground-based observations. As a result, the PSP data establishes the most stringent constraints on the kinetic mixing parameter $\epsilon$ for DPDM frequencies between 70 kHz and 20 MHz, with values of $\epsilon \lesssim 10^{-14}-10^{-13}$. Investigating the data from STEREO satellites resulted in weaker constraints compared to those obtained from PSP. By utilizing state-of-the-art solar observations from space, we have surpassed the cosmic microwave background limits established in the early universe.</description>

      <title>Verification of astrometrically accelerating stars from Hipparcos and Gaia: I. Methodology and application to HIP 44842</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A large number of candidate binary stars with apparent acceleration on the sky has emerged from analysis of astrometric data collected by the Hipparcos, Tycho-2, and Gaia space missions. Although the apparent acceleration can serve as a relatively reliable indicator of binarity, it provides scarce information about the orbital and physical parameters of the components. With an emphasis on the search for stellar-mass black holes and neutron stars hidden in binary systems, we start a broader effort to characterize the most promising candidates using follow-up ground-based observations. Accurate quantification of orbital and physical parameters of systems with dim or invisible companions requires combination of Hipparcos, Gaia, and precision spectroscopic measurements. In this paper, we review the necessary steps in this implementation and describe the improved Hipparcos-Gaia sample of long-term astrometric accelerations which includes correction of sky-correlated systematic errors using the vector spherical decomposition method. As an example, we study one Hipparcos star with a large acceleration, HIP 44842, where the companion is revealed to be a normal main sequence star.</description>

Abstract: Calculations are performed for electron collision with the methylene molecular ion CH$_2^+$ in its bent equilibrium geometry, with the goal to obtain cross sections for electron impact excitation and dissociation. The polyatomic version of the UK molecular R-matrix codes was used to perform an initial configuration-interaction calculation on the doublet and quartet states of the CH$_2^+$ ion. Subsequently, scattering calculations are performed to obtain electron impact electronic excitation and dissociation cross sections and, additionally, the bound states of the CH$_2$ molecule and Feshbach resonances in the $e$-CH$_2^+$ system.</description>

      <title>Feasibility study on retrieving exoplanetary cloud cover distributions using polarimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. As a new growing field, exocartography aims to map the surface features of exoplanets that are beyond the resolution of traditional observing techniques. While photometric approaches have been discussed extensively, polarimetry has received less attention despite its promising prospects.
  Aims. We demonstrate that the limb polarization of an exoplanetary atmosphere offers valuable insights into its cloud cover distribution. Specifically, we determine an upper limit for the polarimetric precision, which is required to extract information about the latitudinal cloud cover of temperate Jovian planets for scenarios of observations with and without host stars.
  Methods. To compute the scattered stellar radiation of an exoplanetary atmosphere and to study the polarization at various planetary phase angles, we used the three-dimensional Monte Carlo radiative transfer code POLARIS.
  Results. When the planetary signal can be measured separately from the stellar radiation, information about the latitudinal cloud cover for polar cap models is accessible at polarimetric sensitivities of $0.1$ %. In contrast, a precision of about $10^{-3}$ ppm is required when the stellar flux is included to gain this information.</description>

Abstract: The analyses of the next generation cosmological surveys demand an accurate, efficient, and differentiable method for simulating the universe and its observables across cosmological volumes. We present Hamiltonian ray tracing (HRT) -- the first post-Born (accounting for lens-lens coupling and without relying on the Born approximation), three-dimensional (without assuming the thin-lens approximation), and on-the-fly (applicable to any structure formation simulations) ray tracing algorithm based on the Hamiltonian formalism. HRT performs symplectic integration of the photon geodesics in a weak gravitational field, and can integrate tightly with any gravity solver, enabling co-evolution of matter particles and light rays with minimal additional computations. We implement HRT in the particle-mesh library \texttt{pmwd}, leveraging hardware accelerators such as GPUs and automatic differentiation capabilities based on \texttt{JAX}. When tested on a point-mass lens, HRT achieves sub-percent accuracy in deflection angles above the resolution limit across both weak and moderately strong lensing regimes. We also test HRT in cosmological simulations on the convergence maps and their power spectra.</description>

      <title>The future of cosmological likelihood-based inference: accelerated high-dimensional parameter estimation and model comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We advocate for a new paradigm of cosmological likelihood-based inference, leveraging recent developments in machine learning and its underlying technology, to accelerate Bayesian inference in high-dimensional settings. Specifically, we combine (i) emulation, where a machine learning model is trained to mimic cosmological observables, e.g. CosmoPower-JAX; (ii) differentiable and probabilistic programming, e.g. JAX and NumPyro, respectively; (iii) scalable Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling techniques that exploit gradients, e.g. Hamiltonian Monte Carlo; and (iv) decoupled and scalable Bayesian model selection techniques that compute the Bayesian evidence purely from posterior samples, e.g. the learned harmonic mean implemented in harmonic. This paradigm allows us to carry out a complete Bayesian analysis, including both parameter estimation and model selection, in a fraction of the time of traditional approaches. First, we demonstrate the application of this paradigm on a simulated cosmic shear analysis for a Stage IV survey in 37- and 39-dimensional parameter spaces, comparing $\Lambda$CDM and a dynamical dark energy model ($w_0w_a$CDM). We recover posterior contours and evidence estimates that are in excellent agreement with those computed by the traditional nested sampling approach while reducing the computational cost from 8 months on 48 CPU cores to 2 days on 12 GPUs. Second, we consider a joint analysis between three simulated next-generation surveys, each performing a 3x2pt analysis, resulting in 157- and 159-dimensional parameter spaces. Standard nested sampling techniques are simply not feasible in this high-dimensional setting, requiring a projected 12 years of compute time on 48 CPU cores; on the other hand, the proposed approach only requires 8 days of compute time on 24 GPUs. All packages used in our analyses are publicly available.</description>

      <title>Neural style transfer of weak lensing mass maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17141v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new generative model of projected cosmic mass density maps inferred from weak gravitational lensing observations of distant galaxies (weak lensing mass maps). We construct the model based on a neural style transfer so that it can transform Gaussian weak lensing mass maps into deeply non-Gaussian counterparts as predicted in ray-tracing lensing simulations. We develop an unpaired image-to-image translation method with Cycle-Consistent Generative Adversarial Networks (Cycle GAN), which learn efficient mapping from an input domain to a target domain. Our model is designed to enjoy important advantages; it is trainable with no need for paired simulation data, flexible to make the input domain visually meaningful, and expandable to rapidly-produce a map with a larger sky coverage than training data without additional learning. Using 10,000 lensing simulations, we find that appropriate labeling of training data based on field variance allows the model to reproduce a correct scatter in summary statistics for weak lensing mass maps. Compared with a popular log-normal model, our model improves in predicting the statistical natures of three-point correlations and local properties of rare high-density regions. We also demonstrate that our model enables us to produce a continuous map with a sky coverage of $\sim166\, \mathrm{deg}^2$ but similar non-Gaussian features to training data covering $\sim12\, \mathrm{deg}^2$ in a GPU minute. Hence, our model can be beneficial to massive productions of synthetic weak lensing mass maps, which is of great importance in future precise real-world analyses.</description>

      <title>The impact of the explicit representation of convection on the climate of a tidally locked planet in global stretched-mesh simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19277v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Convective processes are crucial in shaping exoplanetary atmospheres but are computationally expensive to simulate directly. A novel technique of simulating moist convection on tidally locked exoplanets is to use a global 3D model with a stretched mesh. This allows us to locally refine the model resolution to 4.7 km and resolve fine-scale convective processes without relying on parameterizations. We explore the impact of mesh stretching on the climate of a slowly rotating TRAPPIST-1e-like planet, assuming it is 1:1 tidally locked. In the stretched-mesh simulation with explicit convection, the climate is 5 K colder and 25% drier than that in the simulations with parameterized convection (with both stretched and quasi-uniform meshes)}. This is due to the increased cloud reflectivity - because of an increase of low-level cloudiness - and exacerbated by the diminished greenhouse effect due to less water vapor. At the same time, our stretched-mesh simulations reproduce the key characteristics of the global climate of tidally locked rocky exoplanets, without any noticeable numerical artifacts. Our methodology opens an exciting and computationally feasible avenue for improving our understanding of 3D mixing in exoplanetary atmospheres. Our study also demonstrates the feasibility of a global stretched mesh configuration for LFRic-Atmosphere, the next-generation Met Office climate and weather model.</description>
